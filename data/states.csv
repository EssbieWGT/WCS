Patrick Morrisey on Wednesday, May 28, 2025, announced a series of reforms that he said will end “years of bureaucratic stonewalling” from within the state’s troubled foster care agency and begin a “new era of transparency.” (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey video screenshot)Following years of issues within the state’s foster care system, Gov. Patrick Morrisey on Wednesday announced a series of reforms that he said will end “years of bureaucratic stonewalling” from within the agency and begin a “new era of transparency.”
The proposed changes are partially the result of a statewide listening tour, where Morrisey and other officials — including the new Department of Human Services Secretary Alex Mayer — heard from residents on challenges they’ve faced from the state agency in charge of child welfare.
At those listening sessions, West Virginians shared stories lamenting lack of communication from the state’s Child protective Services workers and other issues that have occurred due to the system being inconsistent, short on staff and offering limited support for many traumatized children.
The reforms announced by Morrisey on Wednesday include:

Having DoHS fully comply with the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act and follow federal guidelines requiring the public disclosure of key information in child abuse or neglect cases resulting in fatalities or near fatalities
Overhauling the state’s Child Welfare Dashboard to make it easier to interpret and more user friendly
Requiring supervisors to conduct monthly reviews with their child welfare cases and work with the governor’s office to identify opportunities for improvement. The state will also launch a department-wide “Leadership Education and Development” (LEAD) initiative to train DoHS supervisors.
Creating a Critical Incident Review Team that will conduct a “deeper dive” into any critical incident that occurs
Introducing a Comprehensive Practice Model to provide a framework that can be standardized across the state
Allowing caseworkers to gather more comprehensive information on cases rather than relying solely on the referral process

There are currently more than 6,100 children in West Virginia’s foster care system. That number has skyrocketed during the state’s drug crisis. The state’s high poverty rate has contributed to the number, as well.
The new reforms as well as the recent statewide listening sessions were initiated after several high-profile incidents of child abuse and mistreatment occured in West Virginia in recent years. Reporters investigating the incidents were often stonewalled by the state government, unable to get information about the events or the circumstances that led up to them.
“In previous years, the state stonewalled about the status of children in its care — and that changes now,” Morrisey said on Wednesday. “We are rolling up our sleeves and getting to work. West Virginians deserve a child welfare system that is transparent, accountable and always puts the safety of children first.”
Morrisey appointed Mayer to oversee DoHS in January. The 37-year-old came to the Mountain State from South Dakota, where he worked for the state government on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and the child welfare system.
Before getting involved in state government, Mayer was adopted. He spent time in the military before working at a residential facility serving people with severe mental illnesses.
In an interview with West Virginia Watch earlier this month, Mayer said he was focusing his first few months on learning where and how the state could increase specialized care for children who need additional services, increase consistency in the state agency’s processes and recruiting foster families to help care for children already in the system.
This legislative session, lawmakers — who have struggled in recent years to get a handle on DoHS spending — allocated more than $300 million to foster care. The 2026 budget bill mandated that the agency spend some money on designated line items to prevent it from shifting money around to pay bills. 
But Morrisey vetoed that idea, saying it was too restrictive for DoHS. 
Morrisey — who made reigning in state spending a key tenet of his first legislative session as governor — also vetoed line item funding for programs that support foster children as well as babies born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome.
Mayer said he doesn’t believe that more funding will solve the issues clearly present in West Virginia’s child welfare system. Instead, he said, the state will likely rely on partnerships with the faith-based community, businesses and others that provide services to help children and families.
On Wednesday, Mayer said he realized that change is long overdue for both the state’s children and the adults who attempt to care for them.
“For far too long, we’ve asked families and frontline professionals to navigate a system that has not kept pace with the complexities our families and children face today. That must change,” Mayer said. “We are listening — intentionally — and using that feedback to shape a more responsive, accountable and transparent system built on trust.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed an executive order on Wednesday bringing a handful of state agencies together to try and better manage the state’s growth. 
The order creates the BUILD (Blueprint for Utah’s Infrastructure, Land, and Development) Coordinating Council, tasked with streamlining efforts and long-term planning related to housing, transportation, water, energy, open space, recreation, air quality and quality of life.
Utah routinely ranks among the country’s fastest growing states, and the executive order is the latest example of elected officials trying to wrangle the population boom. 
“As Utah evolves, everything from water use to transportation is affected,” Cox said in a statement on Wednesday. “This council will help us combine efforts and make better decisions to maintain the quality of life that makes Utah exceptional.”
According to the executive order, the council has five main responsibilities — creating a shared vision for Utah’s future; making sure state agencies are aligned in their long-term plans; identifying ways to “leverage state investments for greater impact”; and collaborating across state agencies to address growth. 
The council is also required to produce an annual report to the governor, lieutenant governor and Legislature. 
The order builds on a resolution passed by the Legislature earlier this year. Sponsored by Rep. Bridger Bolinder, R-Grantsville, HCR11 encourages state and local governments, as well as the private sector, to consider “cross-issue growth impacts in decision-making processes.” 
“A growing population means an increased demand for housing, transportation, water, energy, and open space and recreation,” Bolinder said earlier this year. “Growth issues are interrelated and decisions on one issue often affect other growth-related issues.” 
The council will be made up of the following: 

The senior adviser for long-range planning, who also serves as the Utah planning coordinator and will act as the chair of the committee 
The senior adviser for housing strategy and innovation 
The Utah energy adviser 
The state homeless coordinator 
The executive director of the Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget
The executive director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Opportunity
The executive director of the Utah Department of Natural Resources 
The executive director of the Utah Department of Transportation 
The executive director of the Utah Department of Public Safety 
The executive director of the Utah Department of Environmental Quality 
The executive director the Utah Department of Heath and Human Services
The commissioner of the Utah Department of Agriculture and Food 

The commission will also include a number of representatives from higher education and local governments, like: 

The University of Utah’s Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute
Utah State University’s Janet Quinney Lawson Institute for Land, Water and Air
Southern Utah University’s Utah Center for Rural Life
Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games Salt Lake City 2034

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Legislators at a meeting of the state’s Joint Prison Oversight Committee Wednesday expressed mixed feelings about proposed parole guideline changes from the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles earlier this month.
But lawmakers said they believed the committee’s discussion of the issue brought the Legislature’s attention to it and eventually compelled the parole board to produce the guidelines.
“What I want to say is that you are being heard,” said. Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, the chair of the Joint Prison Oversight Committee. “Does that mean we change everything overnight? No, but you are being heard.”

Since 2023, the Joint Prison Oversight Committee has hosted public hearings that had regularly been attended by friends and family with loved ones incarcerated with the Alabama Department of Corrections.
Members of the public described brutality in the state prisons as well as parole board rejection of applicants.
Legislators from both parties have grown increasingly frustrated with the Board’s delay in delivering new parole guidelines, which were due in 2022, as well as its deviation from existing guidelines in making parole decisions. Last October, lawmakers from the Joint Prison Oversight Committee peppered Leigh Gwathney, chair of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles, with questions regarding the parole rates and the rationale for some of the decisions made by the parole board.
Legislators became increasingly frustrated with her as she hesitated at answering their questions, oftentimes giving long-winded answers without a direct response.
Near the end of the 2025 session, Chambliss amended the state’s General Fund budget to make funding for the parole board contingent on producing the guidelines. Several days later, the parole board published a proposed update to the guidelines.
The proposed changes would use a point-based system like the current guidelines, with more points making parole denial more likely. But the revisions would add weight to the severity of the offense and place more emphasis on an applicant’s behavior closer to the date of the parole hearing by assigning points for any disciplinary infractions, violent or nonviolent, that occurred within the past 12 months of the hearing date.
Lawmakers on the committee offered a range of reactions to the proposed updates. Some wanted additional time to review and evaluate the updated version before forming an opinion.
“I am a little bit behind them on the curve of knowing and understanding what it means, because of their background in the legal world,” Chambliss said in an interview following the meeting with the media.
He referred to others on the committee who offered their opinions on the guidelines.
“Having done some of this for a living, they understand it quicker than I do. It takes me a little bit longer to figure out where they are headed,” he said. “I am in the process of doing that and look forward to understanding it better before I answer that fully.”
Others offered praise for the parole board.
“I think the parole board is taking the step to try and put the guidelines into a place where they accurately reflect the individuals before them,” said Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, in an interview after the meeting. “Not everyone should get out. It is not the intent for everyone to be released early, and the parole board is doing what they can to make sure that the people who are supposed to stay in, stay in, and that those numbers are reflected through the guidelines.”
Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, remains skeptical of the proposed updates as well as the parole board.
“I think the way that this happened is one of the most ridiculous things I have ever witnessed,” England said. “We have had several years of opportunities to assess what those guidelines were going to produce, and instead of using that data, it seems like this came out of nowhere because there was a threat of losing funding.”
The data was supposed to reflect data collected from decisions made by the board regarding parole. During the Joint Prison Oversight Committee meeting in October, Gwathney told the committee members that she changed the score sheet to favor the applicant all while denying many of them parole.
“The data is corrupted, so I really don’t know what the new guidelines are based on,” England said during the committee meeting.
He also said the updated version does not include a section that considers a risk assessment from the Alabama Department of Corrections, which would know the applicant the best.
Jerome Dees, policy director with the Southern Poverty Law Center, also criticized elements of the proposed guidelines. Dees disapproved of the weight assigned to the underlying offense, saying that the original offense is not related to the rehabilitation that applicants pursued while incarcerated.
“There should be greater weight to programs that a participant has participated in during the course of their confinement,” Dees said. “Not just a neutral, plus zero point, but actually incentivizing individuals to engage in that.”
England said that updated parole guidelines are less about public safety and designed to increase the conformance rate, the frequency that the decisions of the parole board match the guidelines.
“It is the equivalent of taking a pop quiz, failing, and instead of digging deeper and seeing what changes you need to make, you just rewrite the question to the quiz so that it aligns with wrong answers,” Dees said.
Members of the committee signaled further changes in the future.
“The guidelines ought to be something that we consider,” said Rep. Jim Hill, R-Odenville, regarding the parole board abiding by the guidelines. “If we get to a point where we decide on something other than the guidelines, I think there ought to be an explanation.”

Gov. Maura Healey at an unrelated press conference Wednesday raised questions about due process and a lack of information about those arrested.
The post As ICE touts island arrests, Healey highlights ‘fear’ and ‘anxiety’ appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","FEDERAL OFFICIALS apprehended “around 40” individuals on Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard on Tuesday, part of continuing immigration law enforcement efforts that authorities said involved “a documented gang member and at least one child sex offender.”In the wake of the apprehensions, Gov. Maura Healey at an unrelated press conference Wednesday raised questions about due process and a lack of information about those arrested. She called it “very disturbing, needless to say, to wake up to that news about that activity” on the two islands and alleged that immigration enforcement operations are causing “fear” and “anxiety” in Massachusetts communities.In a press release Wednesday, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not release information about the identities of any of the people arrested and alleged without specifics that “many” had “US criminality.”The agency highlighted operational cooperation across federal agencies, including the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the US Coast Guard.“ICE officers and FBI, DEA and ATF agents worked together to arrest a significant number of illegal alien offenders which included at least one child predator,” ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Boston Acting Field Office Director Patricia Hyde said in a statement. “Our partners in the US Coast Guard facilitated a safe and efficient transport of the alien offenders off Nantucket and Martha’s Vineyard, ensuring the safety of the residents of those communities. ICE and our federal partners made a strong stand for prioritizing public safety by arresting and removing illegal aliens from our New England neighborhoods.”Sudden immigration sweeps have become a common occurrence in Massachusetts during President Donald Trump’s second term, riling affected communities.“This operation highlights FBI Boston’s ongoing commitment to supporting our partners at the Department of Homeland Security with identifying and apprehending those who are breaking the law by violating our immigration laws and, in some cases, committing crimes that endanger public safety,” said Kimberly Milka, acting special agent in charge of the FBI’s Boston Division.Healey said state officials and local police chiefs have “zero” information about the federal operations here.“I’d like information,” she said. “I understand that there were 40 people picked up. I also have only heard about two with alleged criminal records. And you know, this is part of the problem that we’re seeing with ICE across the country, and certainly here in Massachusetts. People are being picked up, we have no information about their circumstance. There have been real questions raised about due process and whether or not ICE and immigration officials are following, complying with due process here and in other states, and we need answers.”Healey continued: “It’s one thing to go after and target those who have committed crimes, who are here unlawfully. You know, it’s concerning when we see people, moms and dads, being ripped away from families, neighbors, you know, coworkers taken away, literally, it looks like on the way to job sites in Nantucket and on the Vineyard. So we need to know more. But you know, the fear and the uncertainty, the anxiety that is created in these communities, I think is totally unnecessary. I don’t think that this was what we thought that ICE was supposed to be doing.”As attorney general, Healey said, she set up the New England Strike Force on Fentanyl.“I’m happy to cooperate with federal and local and state law enforcement when it comes to going out and chasing bad guys and putting them away,” the governor said. “But what we’re seeing, you know, are too many instances where real questions about due process are raised.”Republican candidate for governor Brian Shortsleeve swiped at the governor over her comments.“It’s rich that after years of turning Massachusetts into a migrant magnet and refusing cooperation with federal law enforcement to remove criminal illegal aliens, Maura Healey is pouting that she was kept out of the loop,” he said in a statement. “Instead, she should be apologizing for allowing criminals and gang members who shouldn’t even be in our country walk freely on our streets while spending billions in taxpayer dollars to accommodate them.”The News Service asked Shortsleeve’s campaign if he would be alright with federal officials conducting immigration enforcement actions without providing state and local officials with information, and whether he would do anything to try to ensure due process for individuals who are apprehended.“A Governor Shortsleeve would insist that local and state officials work in cooperation with the federal government to enforce the laws of the land because that is their job,” campaign spokeswoman Holly Robichaud said. “Under Maura Healey, that has not been happening, which is why we have an illegal immigration crisis in the first place.”Robichaud added: “The right to due process is guaranteed by the Constitution and there is a justice system to adjudicate disputes, which must be respected.”The post As ICE touts island arrests, Healey highlights ‘fear’ and ‘anxiety’ appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Gov.-Maura-Healey-speaks-at-a-press-conference-at-the-State-House-on-Wednesday-May-28-2025.webp?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-28 16:09:22.604219

In a letter addressed to Barnes, Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch said her office “has reason to believe” the candidate violated several state campaign finance laws. 
Mike Hurst, chairman of the Mississippi Republican Party, said Wednesday he has asked District Attorney Crosby Parker and Fitch to investigate the alleged “vote buying.”
“This is something that strikes at the heart of our democracy,” he said in a news conference across the street from the Gulfport Police Department. “Votes should not be for sale.”
Barnes did not immediately return a phone call. The Rev. Eddie Hartwell Sr., a pastor at St. James Baptist Church, said the voucher idea was his. The group behind it is called All Souls to the Polls and members say they want to increase voter turnout. Hartwell said he is not a member of either mayoral campaign and denied the efforts were illegal.
“All we’re doing is saying, ‘Go and vote,’” he said. “As far as me telling somebody who to vote for? No, sir.”
The accusation of vote buying came less than a week before the election and intensified an already contentious race between Republican Hugh Keating and Democrat Sonya Williams Barnes. Mississippi Sen. Joel Carter of Biloxi alleged last month that “cronies” of Stacey Abrams, a Democrat who in 2018 nearly defeated Georgia’s Republican governor, were “highly involved” in the election. Barnes said she alone is responsible for running her campaign and called the statement divisive.
Hurst said he became aware of the allegations Monday night and believes vouchers are still being handed out to absentee voters.
 The vouchers, according to photos provided by the Republican Party, give voters “one entry” to Ms. Audrey’s Southern Kitchen and Catering in Gulfport for a “special prepared meal now through June 3.” 
Hurst also said he had asked state authorities to investigate an event on Saturday that was advertised by Barnes’ campaign. The event, called “Project 35’s Vote & Vibe,” encouraged voters to meet at City Hall then attend brunch together. 
Mississippi law says it is illegal to try to influence absentee voters through money, rewards or any item of value. Anyone convicted of doing so can face fines between $500 and $5,000 and between one and five years in prison. 
Hurst also said he believes the efforts violate a law that forbids offering money or “anything of substantial value” for a vote. Hartwell said the vouchers are worth about $10. 
By Wednesday, city officials said they had received 805 absentee ballots. There were just 177 absentee voters in the last mayoral election four years ago, according to the city. 
The Gulfport mayoral race has drawn some national attention and spending from outside interests, with Democrats seeing a chance to flip the seat leading the state’s second-largest city from red to blue and Republicans working to keep it. 
Dirt Road Democrats, a PAC initially started by former Democratic National Committee Chairman Jaime Harrison and now supported by former Mississippi gubernatorial candidate Brandon Presley, is helping Barnes and a separate Presley PAC has contributed to Barnes’ campaign. Barnes has also received endorsement by her childhood friend, national Democratic operative and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. 
State Republicans are fearful that Gulfport’s changing partisan makeup make it less a GOP stronghold than it was in years past, and worry about a low Republican voter turnout in a June general election.
Records show Mayor Billy Hewes, a Republican who is not running for office again, won the 2021 general election with 2,680 votes. Barnes won the Democratic primary this spring with 3,316 votes. Keating had no Republican opponent in the primary.
Keating has recently received endorsements and advertisement appearances by current and former state leaders, including former Gov. Haley Barbour, and South Carolina U.S. Sen. Tim Scott is headlining a rally for Keating.

Brent Howard, R-Altus, presents a bill in the Senate on Monday, May 5, 2025. (Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Legislature on Wednesday advanced a measure to Gov. Kevin Stitt to create the state’s first business court system.
Senate Bill 632 would create a business court in Tulsa and one in Oklahoma City. The specialized courts would only hear business-related disputes that involve at least $500,000.
Proponents argue the courts are designed to attract economic growth and investment by making outcomes more efficient and predictable and less costly. In other states, they’ve also helped reduce the backlog of civil cases.
Over two dozen other states already have adopted similar models.   
The selection process for Oklahoma’s judges would be outside the parameters of the Judicial Nominating Commission, which interviews candidates for judicial vacancies and submits three names to the governor. Senate confirmation is not required.
Under the measure, the Oklahoma House Speaker would submit three candidates to the governor for consideration. 
The governor would choose a judge from among those selections. The governor’s selection appointment would be subject to Senate confirmation.
The business court judge would serve for eight years and be subject to reappointment, according to the measure.
To be eligible, a person must be at least 35 years old, a U.S. citizen and a licensed attorney in good standing with 10 or more years experience in certain areas, including complex business litigation, business transaction law, and as a judge or clerk in an Oklahoma court with civil jurisdiction.
Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant, asked if the state was growing government.
Sen. Brent Howard, R-Altus, said the state is adding two new judges, at least two new law clerk positions and two new bailiff posts.
“Yes,” Howard said. “It’s growing positions within government.”
Howard said creation of the new system will have a fiscal impact of about $2 million.
The bill passed the Senate by a vote of 39-7 and the House by a vote of 77-12.
Stitt has supported creating the specialized courts that deal with commercial legal issues, arguing that business disputes and complicated contracts must be resolved by judges with business expertise.

(Stock photo via Getty Images)In an era where change is seemingly constant, the high school graduation ceremony remains a largely unchanged part of the American education experience.
While audience noise levels have definitely increased, ceremonies are defined by much that is familiar: the playing of “Pomp and Circumstance,” the smiles of graduates and tears of families, the tossing of caps, and, most significantly, the awarding of diplomas.
If recent trends hold true, more of those diplomas will be distributed this year than ever before.
According to data from the South Carolina School Report Cards, the statewide high school graduation rate has increased from 80.3% in 2015 to 85.4% in 2024. (That’s the percent earning a diploma four years after entering high school.) While this trajectory for the number of diplomas awarded is positive, recent reports raise important questions about changes in the value of those diplomas.
For example, the 2019 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) High School Transcript Study found 12th graders selected to participate in the 2019 NAEP administration had, on average, a higher GPA and earned more course credits than graduating seniors in 2009. Yet, as measured by NAEP, 2019 graduates demonstrated no improvement in science and lower achievement in math compared to the 2009 cohort of students.
As an educator and parent, I find this apparent disconnect between core markers of student achievement troubling but not completely surprising.
Teachers, universities, the military, and employers have been sounding the alarm in recent years about the declining readiness of graduates for life beyond high school.
In response, policymakers are considering actions ranging from offering collegiate remedial coursework during high school to creating a “tiered credential” system to demonstrate student readiness for the workforce.
These programs are well-intentioned and can be beneficial for students, but ultimately, they are more akin to a doctor that focuses on treating symptoms rather than addressing the root causes of illness.
In this instance, curing the disease requires addressing reasons why a high school diploma does not always guarantee readiness for employment, enlistment, or enrollment in higher education.
Such action must start with continuing to reverse our state’s persistent educator shortages.
South Carolina experienced encouraging progress in this area this school year through increased salaries and the passage of policies to improve educator working conditions. Even still, this school year opened with more than 1,000 teacher-less classrooms, a number that is almost certainly underreported.
At the start of the spring, I talked with one Midlands-area high school math teacher that had been assigned to “grade” the work of nearly 40 students in an adaptive online math program where the students never interacted with the teacher. These types of classroom settings are certain to lead to the awarding of credits on the basis of limited academic substance and content mastery.
South Carolina also must address excessive rates of student absenteeism. According to the Education Oversight Committee, nearly one quarter of students were absent for more than 18 days during the 2023-24 school year.
Not surprisingly, measures of student achievement consistently demonstrate a strong correlation between chronic absenteeism and lower student performance rates. In response, too many schools across the state offer “credit recovery” programs without meaningful instruction so students can “make up” absences.
Such an arrangement most likely contributes to the 15% of parents who believe students should be able to “frequently miss” school. While no single policy can reverse this trend, states like Rhode Island are experiencing promising results from a comprehensive mix of policies and community engagement.
Once students are in class consistently, action is needed to maximize instructional time. An important step was taken this year with the Department of Education’s “Free to Focus” cellphone policy. Further steps require addressing the high rates of persistent “disruptive (student) behaviors” reported by the 2023 Teacher Recruitment and Retention Task Force and diminishing instructional time lost to district- and state-mandated assessments and surveys.
In our state, current required assessments can disrupt more than 10% of instructional days for the average sixth grade student.
Finally, any effort to enhance the value of a high school diploma must address the rigor, relevance, and validity of grading practices.
The Legislature has started to look at policies such as the use of “grade floors” and “credit retrieval,” practices that teachers often identify as sources of grade inflation.
However, simply prohibiting those programs will do little to improve academic outcomes and readiness without a simultaneous reevaluation of an accountability system that limits opportunities and ways by which a student can demonstrate mastery of content and a Uniform Grading Policy that lacks uniformity in the awarding of “quality points” across all numeric grades 0 to 100.
By taking these types of actions, South Carolina can become a national leader in ensuring that the pomp and circumstance of graduation serves as both a celebration of past achievements and a prelude to future success.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/graduates-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-28 16:09:22.604219

But […]","A damaged vehicle is seen in the aftermath of a June 2024 crash in Thurston County, in which the driver of another vehicle was suspected of speeding and driving under the influence. (Photo courtesy of Thurston County Sheriff Office)Coming off a 33-year high, deaths on Washington’s roads dropped nearly 10% last year, according to state data released Wednesday. 
The state saw 731 people die in vehicle crashes in 2024, according to the Washington Traffic Safety Commission’s preliminary data. That’s down from 743 in 2022 and 809 in 2023, the most since 1990. But it’s still well above levels in the 500 range recorded annually from 2015 through 2020.
“This is obviously a welcome change to see our annual fatality numbers decline after experiencing large increases over the previous four years,” Shelly Baldwin, the commission’s director, said in a press release. Baldwin added, “We still have a lot of work to do to further reduce these historically high fatality numbers.”
Drivers impaired by drugs or alcohol were involved in about half of the fatalities, a figure that could rise as crash evidence continues to be gathered. Speeding was a factor in about one-third. Among fatalities involving fast drivers, impairment was also a factor in 62%.
A distracted driver was involved in about one-fifth. Similarly, one in five crashes involved someone not wearing a seat belt.
All of those are largely in line with trends from the past few years.
“The bottom line is that four driver behaviors contribute to at least 75% of traffic fatalities annually: impaired driving, speeding, distracted driving, and failure to wear seat belts,” said Mark McKechnie, the commission’s external relations director. “To make our roads safer, we should drive sober, at safe speeds, without distractions, and buckle up. And we should encourage those we care about to do the same.”
Most of those who died were car drivers or motorcyclists, but pedestrians and bicyclists made up 168 of the 731 deaths. That’s down slightly from a record 177 the year prior. 
Motorcyclist deaths dropped about 20%, from 142 in 2023 to 113 last year.
In response to a post-pandemic jump in crash deaths, Washington state lawmakers have looked for solutions. 
Starting in January, the state upped the penalties for drivers who hurt or kill pedestrians, cyclists and other more vulnerable travelers. Washington also now has speed cameras in roadwork zones in an attempt to slow drivers down.
Lawmakers have discussed reducing the legal limit for driving drunk from 0.08% to 0.05%, a move only Utah has accomplished. But that ambitious policy has failed to gain traction.
This year, however, legislators approved measures to require innovative speed-limiting devices for habitual speeders, starting in 2029, and mandate driver’s education to get a license for those up to age 21, increased from the current 18. Drivers between the ages of 15 and 24 were involved in about a quarter of last year’s traffic deaths.
The traffic safety commission recently awarded grants to the cities of Aberdeen and Kent to pay for a new officer in each department focused solely on impaired drivers.
The commission attributed some of the drop in traffic deaths to increased police enforcement efforts that dropped off during the pandemic. More and more cities are implementing speed cameras, especially in school zones and other places where more pedestrians travel.
The state Department of Transportation has also pushed heavily in recent years to build roundabouts at problematic intersections in the hopes of slowing traffic.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/crash-thurston-county-speeding-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-28 16:09:22.604219
,DC,2025-05-28 19:31:14+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration contends U.S. courts can’t rule on Kilmar Abrego Garcia,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-contends-us-courts-cant-rule-kilmar-abrego-garcia,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is arguing that a Maryland federal court lacks the authority to require the return of wrongly deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia because he’s in prison in El Salvador — even though the U.S. Supreme Court has directed administration officials to “facilitate” his return.In addition, the judge in the highly publicized case has denied the Department of Justice’s request for another 30 days to extend its time to submit briefs. Abrego Garcia has remained in prison since March.DOJ lawyers said in a brief filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, in Greenbelt, that because the administration has not brought back Abrego Garcia, the court cannot act on his case. “This Court lacks jurisdiction because Abrego Garcia is not in United States custody, his injury is not redressable by this Court…,” according to the DOJ brief.It’s the same argument DOJ attorneys made before another federal judge in the District of Columbia. That judge is deciding whether hundreds of men deported to El Salvador under an 18th-century wartime law — the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 — are in U.S. custody, rather than El Salvador’s custody, and therefore can be required to be returned.The United States is paying the Salvadoran government up to $15 million to detain the men at a brutal mega-prison, CECOT.Abrego Garcia was among the nearly 300 men on the deportation flights to CECOT, but was not removed under the Alien Enemies Act. The Trump administration has admitted his removal to El Salvador was an “administrative error,” because Abrego Garcia has had deportation protections from El Salvador since 2019 due to concerns he would face violence if returned to his home country.Need for additional time ‘rings hollow,' judge saysThe DOJ motion to dismiss the case being heard by District Court Judge Paula Xinis came after Xinis on Monday denied the Trump administration's request for additional time.In that request, the Department of Justice asked for 30 days to submit documents as part of an expedited briefing schedule to determine actions the government has taken to facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return.“The Court ordered expedited discovery because of Defendants’ refusal to follow the orders of this Court as affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and the United States Supreme Court,” she wrote in her order denying the request for more time.“The Court has conducted no fewer than five hearings in this case and at no point had Defendants even intimated they needed more time to answer or otherwise respond,” she continued. “Thus, to say now that additional time is needed to do that which the law requires rings hollow.”In the DOJ brief, the Trump administration argues that even though the Supreme Court in April ruled that the government must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return, the high court did not rule on the issue of the lower court having jurisdiction over the case.“Those decisions do not ‘squarely address’ these jurisdictional issues and therefore are not binding as to whether Abrego Garcia’s claims are proper, his injury is redressable by this Court,” according to the DOJ filing.The Trump administration also argues that the suit Abrego Garcia’s family and attorneys must bring is a habeas corpus claim, which allows people in the U.S. who believe they are being unlawfully detained to petition for their release in court. It can be used to challenge immigration detention.“Because Plaintiffs seek Abrego Garcia’s release from allegedly unlawful detention on the grounds that it was effected illegally, they make a core habeas claim and must bring it exclusively in habeas,” according to the DOJ brief. “But there is no jurisdiction in habeas.”Travels to El SalvadorTwo Maryland Democratic members of Congress – Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Rep. Glenn Ivey – traveled to El Salvador to meet and advocate for Abrego Garcia’s return.Van Hollen said that Abrego Garcia had been moved from CECOT to a lower-security prison. He added that Salvadoran officials told him that Abrego Garcia was being held because of the financial agreement between the United States and El Salvador.While Van Hollen was able to meet and speak with Abrego Garcia last month, Ivey was not.Ivey returned from El Salvador last weekend, and said Salvadoran officials would not permit him to see Abrego Garcia, who is a resident of his congressional district.According to Maryland Matters, Ivey said that Abrego Garica remaining in El Salvador despite the Supreme Court’s April order is inching the U.S. toward a “constitutional crisis,” because it seems like the Trump administration is “refusing to comply with court orders. That’s scary.”At the last hearing before Xinis, DOJ attorney Jonathan D. Guynn said the Trump administration was complying with all court orders and defended statements from Trump officials, including President Donald Trump, who have stated Abrego Garcia would not return to the U.S.Guynn said that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s comment that Abrego Garcia “will not return” to the U.S. meant that if Abrego Garcia was back in U.S. custody he would be removed either to another third country or back again to El Salvador.“He’ll never walk free in the United States,” Guynn said.",,,,2025-05-28 16:09:22.604219

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he would look into the cases of two men convicted of planning to kidnap and kill Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in the summer of 2020.
Trump’s comments on the cases of Barry Croft and Adam Fox came during a press event for the swearing in of Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host and the acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia.
“It’s been brought to my attention,” Trump said in response to a question about Croft and Fox, who are currently serving nearly 20-year sentences in a Colorado federal prison. “I did watch the trial. It looked to me like somewhat of a railroad job. I’ll be honest with you, it looked to me like some people said some stupid things. They were drinking and I think they said stupid things, but I’ll take a look at that. … A lot of people think they got railroaded.” 
Ed Martin Jr., a pardon attorney with the U.S. Department of Justice who was in line for the U.S. attorney post in D.C. before his name was withdrawn and replaced by Pirro, said this weekend that he was eyeing Fox and Croft’s cases and would consider floating their names to the president for a pardon.
DOJ official eyes pardons for Whitmer kidnap plotters

Martin likened their cases to the criminal charges that were brought against the January 6 Capitol insurrectionists, the Associated Press reported. Trump pardoned more than 1,500 defendants charged in the Capitol attack on his first day back in office.
Conservative activists and conspiracy theorists have long alluded to the plot against Whitmer as a federal government-led operation to entrap the participants, despite numerous pieces of evidence shown in court that detailed the breadth of Croft and Fox’s involvement in spearheading the plan and recruiting others to join in the plot – including eventually an informant working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Martin appears to be among those who viewed the prosecution of Croft and Fox as the weaponization of the federal government, a running theme in the Trump White House. Martin on the podcast vowed to take a hard look at their cases in his new role.
Now, it appears that Martin’s comments have put Fox and Croft on Trump’s pardon radar.
A message seeking comment from Whitmer’s office was not returned at the time of publication.

Kim Reynolds signed two healthcare bills into law at the Guthrie County Hospital in Guthrie Center May 28, 2025, including her proposal to increase rural health care accessibility. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed into law Wednesday her legislative proposal to increase physician training options and rural health care accessibility, a step she said will help ease burdens on rural hospitals and increase patients’ health outcomes across the state.
Reynolds signed House File 972 at Guthrie County Hospital in Guthrie Center, one of many rural health providers she said will benefit from the measure. The law, which she first introduced in February, includes multiple components. It directs the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services to create a “hub-and-spoke” funding model for rural health care services based on the current Centers of Excellence Program and makes changes to Iowa Medicaid rates for providers serving mothers and infants.
Reynolds said improving rural health care access “starts with growing our physician workforce.” To address health care workforce shortages, the law  makes changes to Iowa’s training and residency programs — HHS is also directed to work to draw down $150 million in federal funding that will go toward the creation of a projected 115 new residency slots at Iowa teaching hospitals. Reynolds said this expansion will help Iowa retain more of the health care providers who went to school in Iowa.
“Doctors often decide to practice where they do their residency,” Reynolds said. “Today, Iowa ranks 40th in the number of residency slots … which means many of our (medical graduates) don’t get chance to continue their training here.”
The new residency slots are one way to encourage medical providers to stay in the state — another part of the law works to provide an incentive to health care providers by consolidating the state’s medical student loan repayment programs to a new system with a boost of $8 million in funding, opening the program to individuals who are trained out-of-state who commit to practicing in high-demand areas of Iowa for five years.
Other medical professions, like Registered Nurses and Certified Nursing Assistants, can also receive funding for training through the Health Care Professional Incentive Program, with Iowa HHS designating what fields are in high demand and eligible for the program.
Chris Stipe, the CEO of Guthrie County Hospital, thanked Reynolds for pursuing this measure, saying her administration has prioritized improving health care providers’ “ability to recruit and retain health care workers in rural Iowa.”
“It’s no secret, there’s a physician shortage and a nurse shortage, but let’s be honest, there’s a shortage of all qualified healthcare workers in nearly every field,” Stipe said. “And workforce shortages are often more severe in smaller communities. If we are to continue to effectively care for our rural Iowa communities, critical strategies such as loan forgiveness programs and graduate medical education programs must be funded and expanded and run efficiently.”
He also thanked Reynolds for signing a bill on health care workers’ safety. She also signed House File 310 Wednesday, a bill that expands the definition of “health care provider” under existing laws that provide increased penalties — a Class D felony — for assaulting people in certain occupations. The new definition would raise the criminal charges for assaulting anyone who is working, volunteering or participating in education at a hospital or rural emergency hospital.
Reynolds said the measure is necessary to address increasing cases of violence occurring at health care facilities.
In addition to signing these two health care measures, the governor also signed a slate of bills into law Tuesday. The bills she signed include:

House File 856, a measure banning state entities, including local governments and community colleges, from spending funds or opening diversity, equity and inclusion offices and officials.
House File 865, a change to Iowa’s definition of “bullying and harassment,” removing reference to bullying as acts and conduct based on “any actual or perceived trait or characteristic” that lists characteristics like age, religion, race, sexual orientation and disability as potential traits a student could targeted for. The new definition states bullying is defined as “repeated and targete”  acts and conduct that create a hostile school environment for a student.
Senate File 608, increasing the grain indemnity fund maximum of $16 million and minimum of $8 million to help cover farmers’ losses in credit-sale contracts.
House File 889, Reynolds’ proposal to provide four weeks of paid parental leave to stay employees within 12 months of birth or adoption.

(Image via Maine DOT)Maine lawmakers passed two bills that will pave the way for the state to develop defunct rail lines into trails for walking, biking and more. 
On Tuesday, the House of Representatives voted 118-26 to pass LD 30, which will replace inactive railroad tracks between Portland and Auburn with a multi-use pedestrian trail. A similar bill (LD 29) to convert tracks between Brunswick and Gardiner, as well as a portion between Pembroke and Calais in the Downeast region, into a trail also passed 116-26. 
The Senate approved the proposals earlier this month but on Wednesday the upper chamber placed both bills on the special highway table, which is where bills not provided for in the budget are placed to be considered for remaining highway fund allocations. 
Both proposals will require money, but the fiscal notes do not specify an amount. Rather, they direct the Maine Department of Transportation to undertake the projects subject to funding, permitting and municipal agreements. 
LD 29 and LD 30 came from recommendations put forward by Rail Use Advisory Councils that solicited public input and held multiple meetings within the local communities to determine the best use for the tracks. Rep. Lydia Crafts (D-Newcastle), who co-chairs the Legislature’s Transportation Committee, said that process exists to help guide legislators.
During the House debate, Rep. Karen Montell (D-Gardiner) introduced floor amendments for each of the bills, which sought to prohibit the state from moving forward with the trail development if there is an active business proposal for the rail line. Both amendments failed. 
The State Railroad Preservation Act allows former rail lines to be converted into trail use, but stipulates that they must be preserved for future rail use. The statute says that any track removal or other change for nonrail use is considered interim. Because of that, Montell argued a more sensible solution would be to build a trail alongside the tracks so they can coexist. 
Crafts said restricting the ability to use state dollars would prevent the project from being successful. 
Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth), who was involved with the RUAC process in her community, said she was in strong support of converting the redundant, deteriorating rail line into an active transit corridor where commuters can travel by foot or bike. She also worried that it would set a bad precedent to come in with a last-minute amendment to an extensive stakeholder process. 
Although the Down East Sunrise Trail, a multiuse corridor connecting eastern Maine with the East Coast Greenway, was controversial at first, Rep. Will Tuell (R-East Machias) said businesses have embraced it and seen economic benefits. He loves walking his dog on the trail. 
Seeing that change in his own community, Tuell said he supported LD 29 because extending the trail to Calais will only boost the whole region. 
Similarly, Rep. Dan Ankeles (D-Brunswick) said the plan would mark one of the “greatest advancements in active transportation in a long time.” He said that the best use of the defunct rail lines is a trail and that the lawmakers should “take the words of the communities that actually did the work,” referring to the advisory councils that developed the recommendations. 
If the Legislature failed to adopt the recommendations, Ankeles said, “what we will actually get is a guarantee that nothing will ever happen at all on these lines except decay, abandonment and the squandering of potential in Washington, Sagadahoc and Kennebec counties. In short, economic blight.”
However, he said that would be avoided by passing the measures. 
“We can do what Mainers do best and adapt and repurpose and in doing so we can deliver something truly wonderful for our constituents,” Ankeles added.

On June 6, 50 middle and high school students from across Delaware will step into the roles of 18th-century delegates during a Mock Continental Congress at Legislative Hall in Dover.
The event, inspired by the historic Second Continental Congress of 1776, aims to immerse students in the political debates that shaped American independence.
The day-long simulation is being organized by Delaware 250, the state’s official commemoration of the upcoming 250th anniversary of American independence in 2026.

Students were nominated by their teachers to participate in the event, which is designed to encourage civic engagement and historical understanding.
“This experience will help students engage with historical thinking and civic engagement,” said Margaret Hughes, director of Delaware 250. “In the summer of 1776, separation from Great Britain wasn’t a foregone conclusion.”
By putting themselves in the shoes of the members of the Second Continental Congress, students will be able not only to imagine, but to actively participate in history, civil dialogue, parliamentary procedure, and the complex questions around independence, she said.
Participants will deliberate in Legislative Hall, the heart of Delaware’s state government, adding to the authenticity of the event.
Nicole Worthley, Superintendent of First State Heritage Park, emphasized the significance of the location.
“We are delighted to welcome students into the historic setting of Legislative Hall in Dover,” she said. “The idea of First State Heritage Park is that it is an ‘urban park without boundaries,’ so we are excited to get middle and high school students not only learning about history but engaging with this significant space.”
The event is a collaborative effort between Delaware 250, the Delaware Historical Society, First State Heritage Park, and the Delaware Center for Civics Education at the University of Delaware.
The day will also feature talks by noted historians Dr. Richard Bell of the University of Maryland and Dr. Emily Sneff, an expert on the Declaration of Independence.

Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDiggerBRATTLEBORO — Two months after rejecting a municipal budget for the first time in town history, residents have finally agreed on a 2025-26 spending plan — but not before trying two more times to amend it.“I don’t think anyone’s thrilled with it,” resident Tom Franks said at a special Town Meeting that approved a $24.9 million budget Tuesday night. But after months of setbacks and surprises, Franks told more than 100 attendees at Brattleboro Union High School, “We need to pass it as is and move on.”Residents defeated an initial $25 million plan in March, telling the town selectboard its proposed 12.1% tax increase for the fiscal year starting July 1 was too high.Local leaders went back to the drawing board, only to discover their budget underestimated contracted expenses such as payroll taxes, retirement contributions and overtime. That forced them to raise the bottom line by $426,732 before cutting a half-million dollars, resulting in a revised proposal about $200,000 lower than the original.Residents wrestled for two hours Tuesday over the latest plan, which will still require a double-digit percentage tax hike of 10.8%.READ MORE
The meeting began with a call to add $43,045 to restore a municipal sustainability coordinator job to full time instead of part time. Supporters expressed hope that an employee working more hours could generate more grant money, while opponents noted the need to reduce the budget.“The taxpayers are screaming and they want you to listen,” resident Dick DeGray said against raising the total, even if only by a small sum.After 45 minutes of debate, residents defeated the request in a 71-53 vote. Residents then considered a call to cut the plan by almost $1 million, which would limit spending to 4% over the current budget.“There needs to be some brakes on the system,” resident Robert Oeser said.But townspeople overwhelmingly defeated a 4% limit in a voice vote before finally approving the selectboard’s latest plan by a 110-4 margin.Tuesday’s endorsement came six months after local leaders learned that continuing to fund all current services amid rising staff counts and trash disposal costs would trigger a 22% tax increase as of July 1. The selectboard voted this winter to retain all personnel and instead decrease or defer other spending, only for residents to reject the plan in March and call for revisions.Local leaders found savings by keeping several empty posts vacant, including assistant town manager and information technology coordinator.The selectboard — anticipating fire department overtime could rise to up to $700,000 or more annually because of recurring vacancies and contract requirements — added three more firefighters in hopes their regular salaries would cost less than paying existing personnel to work higher-priced extra hours.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Brattleboro approves $24.9M town budget after months of setbacks.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/VTD-2025-TM-Brattleboro-5-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-28 15:16:53.203081

The photos of the subjects identified by Tamara Lanier as her great-great-great-grandfather Renty, whom she calls “Papa Renty,” and his daughter Delia will be transferred from the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology to the International African American Museum in South Carolina, the state where they were enslaved in 1850 when the photos were taken, a lawyer for Lanier said Wednesday.
The settlement marks the end of a 15-year battle between Lanier and the esteemed university to release the 19th-century daguerreotypes, a precursor to modern-day photographs. Lanier’s attorney Joshua Koskoff told The Associated Press that the resolution is an “unprecedented” victory for descendants of those enslaved in the U.S. and praised his client’s yearslong determination in pursuing justice for the people she had identified as her ancestors.
“I think it’s one of one in American history, because of the combination of unlikely features: to have a case that dates back 175 years, to win control over images dating back that long of enslaved people — that’s never happened before,” Koskoff said.
On Wednesday, Lanier stood holding a portrait of Papa Renty while arm-in-arm with Susanna Moore, the great-great-great-granddaughter of Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz, who commissioned the images and whose theories on racial difference were once used to support slavery in the U.S. Both women praised the resolution.
“This is a moment in history where the sons and daughters of stolen ancestors can stand with pride and rightfully proclaim a victory for reparations,” Lanier said. “This pilfered property, images taken without dignity or consent and used to promote a racist psychoscience will now be repatriated to a home where their stories can be told and their humanity can be restored.”
Moore called the images captured by her ancestor, Agassiz, a “deeply racist project.”
“This victory reminds us that the meaning of such objects in museums can and should change,” she said. “This woman standing next to me, she knew all along she was not small and she was not alone.”
A question of ownership
In 2019, Lanier sued Harvard, alleging the images were taken “without Renty’s and Delia’s consent and therefore unlawfully retained.” The suit attacked Harvard for its “exploitation” of Renty’s image at a 2017 conference and in other uses. It said Harvard has capitalized on the photos by demanding a “hefty” licensing fee to reproduce the images.
Agassiz came across Renty and Delia while touring plantations in search of racially “pure” slaves born in Africa, according to Lanier’s suit. To create the images, both Renty and Delia were posed shirtless and photographed from several angles.
“To Agassiz, Renty and Delia were nothing more than research specimens,” the suit says. “The violence of compelling them to participate in a degrading exercise designed to prove their own subhuman status would not have occurred to him, let alone mattered.”
In 2021, a Massachusetts court ruled that photos are the property of the photographer, not the subject — a stance affirmed by the Massachusetts Supreme Court.
However, while Harvard sought to have the case dismissed, the state high court allowed the case to proceed on Lanier’s claim to emotional distress damages.
The state’s highest court recognized “Harvard’s complicity in the horrific actions surrounding the creation of the daguerreotypes,” saying that “Harvard’s present obligations cannot be divorced from its past abuses.”
In a statement, Harvard said it had “long been eager to place the Zealy Daguerreotypes with another museum or other public institution to put them in the appropriate context and increase access to them for all Americans.”
“This settlement now allows us to move forward towards that goal,” the university said. “While we are grateful to Ms. Lanier for sparking important conversations about these images, this was a complex situation, particularly since Harvard has not confirmed that Ms. Lanier was related to the individuals in the daguerreotypes.”
A new home for Renty and Delia
Tonya M. Matthews, the CEO of the International African American Museum, called Harvard’s relinquishing of the images a moment “175 years in the making.”
“The bravery, tenacity, and grace shown by Ms. Lanier throughout the long and arduous process of returning these critical pieces of Renty and Delia’s story to South Carolina is a model for us all,” she said in a statement.
The South Carolina museum has committed to working with Lanier and including her in decisions about how the story of the images will be told.
In Lanier’s lawsuit, she asked for Harvard to acknowledge its complicity in slavery, listen to Lanier’s oral family history and pay an unspecified sum in damages. An undisclosed financial settlement was part of the resolution with Harvard announced Wednesday, but Koskoff said Harvard still hasn’t publicly acknowledged Lanier’s connection to them or its connection to perpetuating slavery in the U.S., Koskoff said.
“That is just left unanswered by Harvard,” he said.
He said Lanier isn’t expecting or waiting to hear from the institution, but that the settlement speaks for itself.
“In the end, the truth will find you — you can you can only hide from it for so long,” he said. “Yes, history is written by the winners. But over time, you know, those winners look like losers sometimes.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/IMG_8956-e1569967536615.jpg,,,2025-05-28 15:16:53.203081

Two Wyoming federal judges have now dismissed Grace Smith’s lawsuit over pandemic-era mask policies, finding she broke lawful rules and has no standing to sue.
The post Laramie student’s COVID-19 mask lawsuit dismissed again appeared first on WyoFile .","For the second time, a U.S. District Court of Wyoming judge has dismissed a lawsuit from the parents of former Laramie High School student Grace Smith over classroom mask mandates during the pandemic. 
Judge Kelly Rankin dismissed each of the Smiths’ three federal claims as invalid, echoing a decision issued in 2023 by a different federal judge. In that dismissal, Judge Nancy Freudenthal found any suffering by Smith was “self-inflicted,” as she trespassed voluntarily during a protest, opted out of a virtual education offered to non-mask wearers and left school altogether.
In November 2024, a federal appeals court in Denver ordered Freudenthal’s dismissal reconsidered. 
But in a decision issued Tuesday, Rankin like Freudenthal concluded Smith had violated lawful orders during the pandemic and did not have a case against the Albany County School District 1 board and other officials. Smith was suspended several times, cited and ultimately arrested for trespassing when she refused to comply with the mask rules or leave the school’s campus.
Rankin did not rule on three claims Smith made under state law, saying he did not want to intervene in a matter best left to Wyoming’s courts. It’s uncertain if Smith’s family will bring a fresh case in state court. They first sued the school district in the Albany County District Court before all parties involved agreed to move the case into federal court.
A WyoFile email sent to the Smiths through their website did not receive an immediate response Wednesday. 
Among other arguments, the Smith family sought to make the case that being forced to wear a mask was a violation of their daughter’s free speech rights, as she did not agree with the government’s public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Rankin disagreed.
“Following this logic, driving on the right side of the road is speech because it signifies agreement with traffic laws,” he wrote. “By the same token, noncompliance frequently signals disagreement, but driving on the left side of the road is still illegal in the United States.”
Smith’s arrest, which she filmed, drew widespread publicity amid the tense politics of the pandemic. Within a week and following national attention from conservative news outlets and politicians, the family raised more than $75,000 for legal fees, according to The Laramie Reporter.
School board member Nate Martin, who was named as one of the plaintiffs, called the lawsuit a waste of time and taxpayer dollars. 
“It was ludicrous and juvenile and kind of a petty plea for attention from the beginning,” Martin said. “Hopefully, this is the last we’ll hear about it.”

Hughes and Edward Echtle Jr. (Photo Courtesy of the Secretary of State)Fifty years ago, Washington welcomed the first of thousands of Southeast Asian refugees fleeing war and conflict in their home countries. 
A new book captures 15 stories of first-generation refugees and their descendants and how they rebuilt their lives in Washington state. 
“New Land: Southeast Asian Refugees Finding Home in Washington” touches upon topics such as the challenges people faced fleeing war and oppression, the heartache of displacement, the process of building new lives in the state, and hopes for a more just and inclusive future. 
It was written by John C. Hughes, chief historian for the Office of the Secretary of State, and Edward Echtle Jr., a historian for Legacy Washington. 
“‘New Land’ provides a window into the origins of Washington’s diverse Southeast Asian communities through the stories of individuals,” Echtle said in a statement. “Arriving as refugees, many endured profound hardships as they started over.” 
After the fall of Saigon, on April 30, 1975, at the end of the Vietnam War, the first 34 refugees arrived at Camp Murray, the National Guard Headquarters near Tacoma, on May 20, 1975. 
By the end of that year, roughly 4,000 refugees had settled in Washington with the assistance of state agencies, community organizations, and churches. 
Evans Nguyen was one of the 34 families who fled their home country “with only the clothes on their backs” and arrived in Washington on May 20, 1975. 
He said his family, whose story is featured in the book, had to choose between leaving their home country behind or risking getting captured and being sent to a concentration camp. After deciding to flee, he describes how he still remembers the generosity he received from people in the state.
“I remember my mom and my dad, particularly we’re having difficulties setting up doctors’ appointments, getting jobs, buying houses, even grocery shopping,” Nguyen said. “There were people to help us.”
Nguyen is now an engineer who is working to help cure cancer. “If we didn’t escape back then, I really can’t imagine where we’d be,” he said. 
Kayla Somvilay, originally from Laos, came to the U.S. in 1981 when she was 5 years old. 
“As a child holding tightly to my family, as we left behind our homeland, seeking refuge from the war in hope of a better life,” Somvilay said. “Like so many Lao and Southeast Asian families, we arrived with almost nothing except the will to survive and the dream of the future.” 
She said the extraordinary resilience her community has shown is living proof that out of displacement comes not only survival but also strength, unity, and leadership. 
Savong Lam is a survivor of the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia. She was 3 years old when she was carried to the Thai border by her aunt to flee. 
To Lam, the book is more than just ink and paper but rather represents the memory, courage, and spirit of her community. She said the seeds of the Khmer heritage were “watered by tears, of loss, and nurtured by sunlight of hope.” 
“Look all around you, see how those seeds have blossomed, how our communities have flourished,” Lam said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-Land-Book.jpg,,,2025-05-28 15:16:53.203081

(Amy Dalrymple/North Dakota Monitor)Attorneys for Greenpeace argued this week that a jury’s decision ordering it to pay $667 million to the developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline cannot stand.
A Morton County jury delivered the verdict on March 19 after more than three weeks of trial. Jurors found the environmental group responsible for damages related to anti-pipeline protests in North Dakota in 2016 and 2017, as well as for publishing defamatory statements about Energy Transfer.
Greenpeace says the jury’s decision was not based on fact, but bias against the protest movement.
“What the verdict in this case reflected, your honor, is the community’s desire to punish someone who was involved in the protests,” said Everett Jack, an attorney representing Greenpeace’s U.S. affiliate.
The arguments followed a hearing earlier this month during which Greenpeace asked Southwest Judicial District Court Judge James Gion to reduce the $667 million award if he moves forward with a judgment against the environmental group.
Energy Transfer wants Gion to uphold the jury’s decision in full.
Jury finds Greenpeace at fault for protest damages, awards pipeline developer more than $660 million

The award includes more than $200 million of compensatory damages — or money meant to make the plaintiffs whole for financial harms — and another roughly $400 million in punitive damages.
Energy Transfer’s core argument is that Greenpeace trained protesters to wage violent attacks to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline and that it deliberately published false statements to sabotage the company’s business.
Greenpeace was one of many activist groups that sent representatives to south-central North Dakota to protest in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. It denies Energy Transfer’s allegations and says the lawsuit is an attempt to discourage environmental activism.
During a Tuesday hearing, attorneys representing the environmental group doubled down on their claims that Energy Transfer presented no concrete evidence during the trial that Greenpeace caused the company to suffer financially.
The lawsuit is against three Greenpeace entities: Greenpeace International, Greenpeace USA, and Greenpeace Fund, its United States-based fundraising arm.
Only Greenpeace USA had employees at the protests. Greenpeace USA says it had six staff members visit to provide peripheral support to the Indigenous-led demonstrations, including supplies and nonviolent trainings.
Energy Transfer attorney Trey Cox argued that Gion has no reason not to honor the jury’s verdict.
Cox said the acts the jury found Greenpeace liable for — including defamatory speech, trespassing and abuse of property — do not count as constitutionally protected speech.
“They’re trying to wrap themselves in the First Amendment,” he said.
Cox said Greenpeace is willfully ignoring documentation Energy Transfer presented to the jury linking Greenpeace personnel to attacks against the pipeline, and that the jury’s decision is the most important indicator of the evidence’s credibility.
Attorneys also asked Gion to toss the jury’s verdict finding the three organizations liable for defamation. Energy Transfer alleges that Greenpeace published nine defamatory statements about the Dakota Access Pipeline that harmed the energy company’s business relationships.
In the United States, the standard for proving defamation claims is high — especially for individuals and organizations in the public eye.
Greenpeace attorneys said the nine statements don’t meet this threshold for multiple reasons.
For one, each of the nine statements was either factually true or reflected opinions about what happened at Standing Rock, Jack said.
Energy Transfer also did not demonstrate that Greenpeace made the statements knowing they were false or with “reckless disregard” for their veracity, which are other key standards required for proving defamation, he added.
Greenpeace has also said it was not the first to circulate the statements, and that they were contemporaneously published by hundreds of other organizations and media outlets.

Judges must act as the “gatekeeper” on defamation claims to make sure the decision does not violate free speech rights, Adam Caldwell, an attorney representing Greenpeace International, argued. This standard was set in the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case on defamation New York Times v. Sullivan, he said.
Jack also argued that under North Dakota law, proving a defamation claim requires that a third party testify that they believe the statements in question are defamatory. He said none of Energy Transfer’s witnesses fulfilled this requirement.
He pointed to the testimony of Greenpeace employees who said they believed the statements were true and came from credible sources.
Cox said jurors likely rejected this testimony as unconvincing.
“Given the very large exemplary damage award, we can readily infer that this jury found these witnesses to be liars,” Cox said. “We found them to be concealing things, to be hiding things, to be non-credible.”
Greenpeace International and Greenpeace Fund — which does not engage in organizing activities — say Energy Transfer has no right to involve them in the case. Neither had any personnel visit North Dakota.
Greenpeace International says it is not subject to the court’s jurisdiction because it is a Netherlands-based organization that was not involved in the protests.
“The only evidence was affirmative evidence from International that it had never set foot in North Dakota,” Caldwell said. “It’s a textbook case of lack of personal jurisdiction.”
While Greenpeace International did sign onto a letter that included two of the statements the jury found defamatory, it was one of more than 500 signatories, he said.
Greenpeace Fund similarly said there was no evidence linking it to the case.
“We shouldn’t be here,” said Matt Kelly, an attorney representing the organization.
Energy Transfer has argued that Greenpeace Fund and Greenpeace International conspired with Greenpeace USA on its anti-pipeline efforts. The jury found Greenpeace International and Greenpeace USA liable for conspiracy, but not Greenpeace Fund.
Gion took the motions under advisement.
The parties also recently presented arguments on a separate set of motions asking Gion to reduce the jury’s nearly $667 million award against Greenpeace. Greenpeace claims the award exceeds statutory caps on damages and that the verdict is riddled with inconsistencies.
If the jury’s decision is allowed to stand, defendants have the option to appeal the verdict to the North Dakota Supreme Court. Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace International have disclosed their intent to appeal.

(Danielle Prokop/Source NM)New Mexico’s environment department on Wednesday announced it has filed a lawsuit against the Camino Real Regional Utility Authority and has asked the Third Judicial District Court to appoint an independent manager to oversee its operations.
The suit follows more than a decade of “mismanagement at the utility,” NMED states in a news release, including recent and repeated failed arsenic tests. As Source reported last week, tests the agency itself took at CCRUA on May 7 recorded arsenic levels at the Santa Teresa Industrial Park plant that violated the federal limit, marking the third overage recorded at the plant in recent weeks, although the other tests were from voluntary tests.
New CRRUA arsenic violation prompts NMED to evaluate taking emergency action

CRRUA serves approximately 19,000 people in the border city of Sunland Park, Santa Theresa and the southernmost portion of Doña Ana County, an area with naturally occurring high levels of arsenic in the groundwater. Sunland Park and Doña Ana County jointly operate the utility, which is governed by a seven-member board.
At its May 13 meeting, the Doña Ana Board of County Commissioners unanimously voted to send immediate notice to Sunland Park to start the termination process of the Joint Powers Agreement. Environment Department Secretary James Kenney subsequently urged Sunland Park to also sever its ties with CRRUA, and acknowledged in an interview with Source NM it was an unusual step for him to take.
“We’re weighing in at this point because we’ve had it,” he said. “While we’re exhausting our enforcement, our legal approaches, we have another approach: We have to speak about it.”
Now, with its lawsuit, NMED is asking the courts to order CRRUA to:
• implement real-time arsenic monitoring
• distribute free arsenic test strips for all CRRUA customers
• provide an alternative drinking water source if arsenic levels exceed state limits
• conduct monthly public meetings
• and pay civil penalties which, per state law, fund drinking water and wastewater utility
operators for communities across New Mexico
“While the Environment Department has invested significant technical resources to assist CRRUA in fulfilling its duty to deliver safe and reliable drinking water, its failures continue to threaten public health,” Kenney said in a statement on Wednesday. “Today’s
lawsuit and request to appoint an independent manager to oversee CRRUA signals a new approach in Environment Department efforts to protect the health of communities when they turn on their tap.”
NMED’s news release also notes that last July it placed 138 drinking systems across the state on notice, and that the City of Las Vegas and Cassandra Water System in Moriarity remain out of compliance.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_9851-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-28 15:16:53.203081

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator).A Louisiana legislative committee has killed two bills that would have added eight new majority Black districts to the state House and Senate. 
The author of the proposals, Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus Chairman Rep. Edmond Jordan, D-Baton Rouge, argued the maps are necessary because a federal judge has ruled the current state legislative maps, adopted in 2022, violate the federal Voting Rights Act. Attorney General Liz Murrill has appealed that decision on the state’s behalf, and the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals has yet to issue a decision. 
House Bill 487, which redistricts the Senate, was killed on a party-line 9-6 vote with Republicans prevailing. House Bill 488, the new House of Representative district map, fell in a 9-5 vote, again along party lines. The votes mean Louisiana will not update its legislative maps in the current legislative session, though they have the opportunity to do so in a future session. 
“By us not upholding our obligation and redrawing these maps … I think it sends a signal that we are unwilling to do so,” Jordan said. “Rather than wait on the court to come up with a decision, I think it’s incumbent upon us to get ahead of that and maybe draw these maps and show the court that we’re willing to comply with Section 2” of the Voting Rights Act.
The section Jordan cited prohibits voter discrimination based on a person’s race, color or membership in a language minority group. Republicans have argued Section 2 is outdated, as it has served its purpose to dismantle Jim Crow-era laws. 
Although a third of Louisianians are Black, less than a third of state legislative districts have majority Black populations. The redistricting plan adopted in 2022 maintained the same number of majority Black districts from the previous redistricting cycle, based on 2010 Census demographics, even though the percentage of the state’s Black population has increased in the interim. 
Republicans on the committee repeatedly pointed out that the case is still on appeal and indicated they were optimistic courts may rule in the state’s favor. 
Lawmakers also expressed concern that Jordan’s plan put upwards of 20 incumbent lawmakers outside of their existing district, meaning they would either have to move to maintain residency in their current districts or run against another incumbent to return to the legislature. 
Jordan said that while he considered incumbency, his primary concern was giving Black voters an opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. 
“What we’re trying to do is attempt to unpack and uncrack these districts so that they would comply with Section 2,” Jordan said 
Packing is a type of gerrymandering that forces a large number of voters from one group into a single or small number of districts to weaken their power in other districts. Cracking dilutes the power of those voters into many districts.
Jordan’s plan would have added new majority Black House districts in Natchitoches, Lake Charles, Shreveport and Baton Rouge, and Black Senate districts in Baton Rouge, Shreveport and Jefferson Parish. 
Republican lawmakers expect the 5th Circuit to wait to release an opinion on the legislative maps until after the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on Louisiana’s current congressional district boundaries, as the decision might create new precedent. 
In the congressional redistricting case, non-Black voters are suing the state over a map lawmakers passed last year that created a second majority Black district, arguing it violated their constitutional rights. The Supreme Court decision is expected later next month.

Gathering in Mackinac Island’s Grand Hotel on Wednesday, State Sens. Darrin Camilleri (D-Trenton) and Ed McBroom (R-Vulcan) joined Skillman Foundation President and CEO Angelique Power to discuss areas for improvement in Michigan’s education system. 
The discussion was one of the forums scheduled during the Detroit Regional Chamber’s Mackinac Policy Conference.
McBroom and Camilleri, both former educators, opened the panel by recounting the pathway that brought them to begin teaching, before answering some pre-recorded questions from Michigan students about education policy and how they engage with education on the ground. 
Jia Patel, a senior at Grand Blanc High School, asked the lawmakers how they interact with and listen to youth voices in their policymaking process. 
Camilleri said one of his guiding philosophies as a lawmaker is to stay  connected to the kids. 
“I go to my classrooms all the time, all across my district. I listen to students, listen to educators, and I’ve never really left…I may not be teaching in front of the kids anymore, but I miss them all the time and I talk to them,” he said.

Additionally, Camilleri said he works to bring youth into the campaign and political world through internships, telling attendees it’s something that would have benefitted him as a young adult. 
Alongside raising five teenagers, McBroom said he also visits schools within his district but noted those invitations have come slower since the pandemic. He also helps conduct mock interviews with student teachers for Northern Michigan University’s teachers education program.
McBroom touched on Patel’s effort to bring forth legislation allowing youth to serve on school boards, calling it an excellent opportunity and noting his school had put students on the board while he was in eighth grade. 
Alongside youth engagement, McBroom and Camilleri touched on funding for schools, with McBroom arguing the state’s shift to merit core curriculum in the mid 2000s, which requires students to earn a specific number of credits in subject areas including English, math, science and social studies, had strangled the state’s career technical education, as funding for many classrooms hinged on their enrollment from the year prior. 
However, in his 13 years in the Legislature, McBroom said there have been a lot of efforts to provide more resources to career technical centers and work with labor unions to teach skilled trades.

The state has also worked to close the funding gap between students, noting that the gap had almost been closed since efforts began in 1994. 
Camilleri pointed to the Opportunity Index Formula used in recent years which shifts school funding to the schools with greater need and higher levels of poverty. 
“I wanna be clear, it’s not just urban schools, right? These are rural school districts across the state that have transportation funding issues and special education funding issues and all kinds of other challenges too, and this puts them through that lens as well,” Camilleri said, noting that lawmakers had paired this lens of historic levels of school funding with the Senate’s latest education budget allocating another $250 million into the formula, for a total of $1.3 billion in funding. 
Shifting to another question from University of Michigan student Brandon Hofmeister, Camilleri and McBroom discussed ways to ensure Michigan students have the tools they need to pursue a post-high school education. 
McBroom again looked to Michigan’s merit curriculum, noting that prior to those changes, the only requirements were a year of physical education and a semester of government, with the remaining curriculum left up to a local school district. 
“Unfortunately, the Legislature, in my opinion, overstepped by a long way, by creating this huge ‘here’s the classwork everybody should accomplish’ and directed so many students away from the skilled trades,” McBroom said, calling merit curriculum the turning point in going down a “bad one-size-fits-all path.”
Instead, lawmakers should be setting overarching goals for graduation, literacy skills and job attainment rather than telling students they have to take specific courses, McBroom said. 
Whether a school focused on the arts or the sciences should be decided by the local school board and the community in collaboration with parents and students, McBroom said. 
As Michigan’s literacy rates have decreased across the past two decades, leaving the state at 41st in the nation for education, Power asked both lawmakers what needs to change in Michigan to improve the state’s educational outcomes. 
While Lansing could do more on credentialing of superintendents and principals to ensure quality staff are administering schools, McBroom called for lawmakers to empower locals more, giving them more opportunity and more freedom with clear directives of what to accomplish. 
“We also need to stop changing the rules so often…. we need less turmoil from Lansing, more good guidance,” McBroom said, emphasizing that local communities know their needs best. 
He also argued that changes to the state Board of Education are necessary, pointing to the current process of allowing political parties to nominate candidates for the board without holding a primary. 
Camilleri offered a different approach, arguing there are too many school districts in Michigan. While lawmakers can get local by allowing them to set goal posts, total local control is not in the state’s best interest, he said.
“We gotta get, again, these guiding posts of where we all want to be and in order to meet better standardized testing and be prepared for college and career, all of these things have to be with a vision in mind. And we as stakeholders in Lansing and policy makers in Lansing, we need to be empowered and feel comfortable with setting that direction and do so in a collaborative way,” Camilleri said.

“I’m not saying ‘no local control’, but when you have 1,600 people, plus boards, plus superintendents, all these different people in the room, it makes it challenging,” Camilleri said, with McBroom agreeing. 
Camilleri and McBroom also offered their perspectives on moving forward amid federal disruptions and efforts to eliminate the federal department of education. 
While it’s possible to move forward, it will require willing leaders on both sides of the aisle, Camilleri said, noting that the state Senate had already advanced its own education budget. 
However, Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) has avoided committing to passing a budget before the July 1 legislative deadline, which carries no mandate, arguing the Legislature’s responsibility is to pass a budget before the fiscal year ends on Oct. 1. 
“I hope that we can still meet that deadline. Well, we are in uncharted territory. I mean, I don’t have a good answer on that front, because we still do have the chaos out of [Washington] D.C. where we don’t have a final budget from them. What are they attempting to cut? And then, how does that have the impact on our budgets here at the local level,” Camilleri said, arguing the state does not have to cut funding to schools due to a surplus in the school aid fund. 
McBroom offered a more optimistic assessment, arguing the situation was something lawmakers navigated before, with lawmakers previously working under a split-legislature in 2010. 
“We’ve had chaos from the feds before. We’ve had cuts before in times of bad finances and bad decisions. So I don’t really see this as uncharted, whereas it’s just different than it was for the past 15 years in Michigan,” he said. 
“Whether the feds are doing a good job or not, we should always be trying to labor for something better, to do a better job. If the feds are going to give us these dollars that used to come through the Department of Ed and block grants, let’s make sure that we work together to make sure they get to where we need them to be,” McBroom said.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Labor Commissioner Bárbara Rivera Holmes has officially thrown her hat in the ring to run for a full term in office.
Holmes, who was previously the CEO of the Albany Area Chamber of Commerce, was tapped by Gov. Brian Kemp to lead the agency in April after former Labor Commissioner Bruce Thompson died in November.
“I have a profound responsibility to serve the people of Georgia, and I look forward to working alongside them to ensure Georgia’s best and brightest days are ahead,” Holmes said in a statement Wednesday. “As Labor Commissioner, I will continue to lead the department to build trust, foster collaboration, expand workforce development, and empower small businesses and entrepreneurs across the state.”
Before heading the department, Holmes worked as a journalist and has served on boards including the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, to which she was appointed by Gov. Nathan Deal and the Georgia Rural Development Council, to which she was appointed by Kemp.
Holmes is of Cuban descent and a native of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Kemp’s appointment made her Georgia’s first Latina constitutional officer.
Unlike in other statewide races that are likely to see heated partisan primaries, Holmes did not highlight her party affiliation, conservative bona fides or devotion to President Donald Trump, either in her announcement or on her campaign website. She registered as a Republican on her paperwork with the state ethics commission.
During the April press conference announcing her appointment, Kemp was less demure.
“Yes, she’ll run, and yes she’ll run as a Republican,” he said.

Josh Stein speaks with reporters after addressing attendees at the 2025 Emerging Issues Forum: ""Future Forward Energy."" (Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein on Wednesday voiced strong support for retaining and strengthening the state’s electric vehicle industry. Speaking at an Institute for Emerging Issues forum entitled “Future Forward Energy,” at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, Stein said he has communicated with the state’s congressional delegation about the urgency of keeping tax credits designed to support the EV industry.
U.S. House Republicans passed a budget reconciliation bill last week that would eliminate several tax credits for electric vehicles, a move that advocates say will harm North Carolina’s EV industry.
The cuts would undo tax credits leading to 16,300 jobs and $20.4 billion in investments in the state, according to nonprofit Electrification Coalition.
“Companies make investments based on policy, and there has to be certainty, there has to be settled expectations, or else they do not know how to invest,” Stein told reporters.
He emphasized the importance of drawing businesses to the state to boost its economy and create jobs.
“Many of them have made major business decisions about investing in North Carolina,” Stein continued. “We’ve got to preserve those credits so that the companies get the bargain that they struck.”
Addressing the conference, Stein spoke about the Energy Saver North Carolina program that he launched with Secretary of Environmental Quality Reid Wilson.
This initiative offers more than $200 million in rebates for income-eligible households for the installation of energy efficient appliances and other products, like heat pumps and insulation.
Stein said the program is an example of moving forward toward a clean energy economy, strengthening the economy, and putting money back into people’s pockets.
“It is about moving forward. That is true nowhere more than western North Carolina,” he said, pointing to the devastation wrought last fall by Hurricane Helene.
Stein added that his administration has been “laser-focused” on helping western North Carolinians recover since his first day in office.
He also addressed the issue of climate change and its effects on the state.
“As we do the difficult work of seeking the federal and state dollars and putting them to work and communities, we cannot ignore the fact that North Carolina is experiencing more extreme weather with increasing frequency,” he said. “As we rebuild our energy infrastructure out west, we must be mindful of the need to adapt to a change in climate and insure greater resiliency for the future.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_0786-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-28 15:16:53.203081

(Photo courtesy of EPA) Five Iowa communities have been selected to receive $5.5 million in grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to clean up and restore blighted or contaminated properties.
Sites selected in Iowa are former grocery stores, a YMCA building, a meat packing plant, abandoned businesses and a smelting facility. The EPA Brownfields Program helps a community to assess, clean up and eventually reuse contaminated sites that would otherwise be unusable. 
The City of Clinton received a grant for a little over $1 million, which City Administrator Matt Brooke said will be used to remove the pool section of the city’s former YMCA.

The former YMCA building is contaminated with asbestos and lead, which make it unsuitable for redevelopment until it is remediated.
“This grant funding will enable Clinton to continue a crucial environmental cleanup project,” Brooke said in a press release sent by EPA. “Clinton continues to work toward a cleaner and greener community for all people to live, work, and enjoy.”
Iowa Western Community College receives EPA grant for job training

The Iowa grants are part of a nationwide allotment of $267 million in brownfields grants. 
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the program will help to create new opportunities for businesses and housing while strengthening local economies. 
“EPA’s Brownfields program demonstrates how environmental stewardship and economic prosperity complement each other,” Zeldin said in a statement. “Under President Trump’s leadership, EPA is Powering the Great American Comeback, ensuring our nation has the cleanest air, land, and water while supporting sustainable growth and fiscal responsibility.” 
The EPA Brownfields Program started in 1995, but saw a significant boost in funding under former President Joe Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Plan. 
Another recipient of the recently awarded funding, East Central Intergovernmental Association, has facilitated brownfield clean up projects in eastern Iowa through its participation in the Brownfield Revolving Loan Fund with EPA. The association was awarded $1.5 million to help replenish the fund, which EPA said has been “high performing.” The fund thus far has supported projects like the YMCA remediation in Clinton and a property in Dubuque. 
“Many communities are burdened with brownfield sites but lack the resources to address them,” said Dawn Danielson, ECIA’s brownfields coordinator. “The ripple effect of EPA’s investments is transformational, not only for the site itself but also for surrounding properties.”
Danielson said the remediated sites typically become “catalysts for economic development” in the area and breathe “new life” into communities. 
Le Mars Mayor Rob Bixenman, similarly said the grant will revitalize “key areas” of the community and help to accelerate the city’s community development plan. 
Le Mars was awarded $400,000 to assess and develop clean up plans at a former Walmart, meat packing plant, landscaping company and unused hotel along the city’s business corridor. 
The City of Keokuk was also selected to receive just under $2 million to clean up a 16-acre site that formerly smelted and refined zinc and lead. According to EPA, the site is contaminated with coal tar, zinc smelting residuals that are high in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or PAH, and heavy metals. The plant opened in 1915 and operated until the 1980s. 
The site has received a number of EPA grants as the city works to clean up the site and hopefully attract a redeveloper.
The City of Red Oak was also selected and will receive a $500,000 grant to conduct site assessments and community engagement for unused properties along its Broadway Street.

Voters rejected repealing the camping ban ordinance in April. (Getty Images)As an ordinance aimed at prohibiting homeless people from sleeping on public property goes into effect in Morgantown, the city announced Tuesday an alternative sentencing program for enforcing the camping ban. 
Morgantown’s camping ban goes into effect Thursday, 30 days after the city’s residents voted 986 to 905 against repealing the ordinance during its election April 29. 
According to a news release Tuesday from the city, beginning June 4, the city is launching the sentencing program with Valley Healthcare Systems, a provider of mental health, substance use treatment, housing services and case management.
Valley Healthcare Systems will be contracted through the city to “conduct assessments and guide individuals toward support systems that address housing instability and offer recovery options,” the city said in a news release. 
The organization will help define the requirements of completing the alternative sentencing program under the ordinance, the city said. 
“City staff and administration are committed to enforcing all local provisions, laws, and ordinances with fairness and objectivity,” Brad Riffe, the city’s public relations and communications director, said in the news release. “Our responsibility is to apply these regulations as written, ensuring accountability while always acting in the best interest of the entire community. We will always strive to balance compliance with compassion and any strategy we follow will reflect a model that offers consideration to all citizens.”
The alternative sentencing program will be similar to the West Virginia Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion program, a diversion program for low-level offenses that are often related to substance use or mental health issues that allows offenders to get treatment or recovery services, the news release said. 
“We’re proud to partner with the City of Morgantown to help develop meaningful alternatives for individuals cited under the new ordinance or anyone for that matter,” Steve Bennett, director of the LEAD program and crisis services for Valley HealthCare Systems, said in the news release. “By connecting people to housing, treatment, and long-term support, especially those struggling with substance use disorders, we can reduce repeated offenses, improve public safety, and offer individuals a real path toward stability and recovery.”
Bennett did not immediately return an email seeking more information.
According to the ordinance, people who violate the ban are first given a warning and information about shelter, second violations are subject to up to a $200 fine, and a third violation within 12 months may result in a fine of up to $500 or 30 days in jail along with information about available shelter and alternative sentencing options. 
Morgantown City Council originally passed the ordinance in September. The Morgantown Coalition for Housing Action successfully petitioned the city council to reconsider the ordinance by repealing it or putting it on the ballot for voters to decide. Council members chose the latter, and city voters upheld the ban.
Proponents of the law have said homeless people sleeping in public areas is a health and safety issue.
Opponents of the ordinance have pointed out that the city does not have enough emergency housing beds for the 100 homeless people that were counted in Monongalia County during the 2024 point in time count, and that the camping ban does not address the cause of homelessness. 
Morgantown is one of dozens of cities around the country that have implemented camping bans after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a similar ban in Grants Pass, Oregon last summer.

Aug. 2, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Legislature inched Wednesday toward clarifying the legislative branch’s legal authority to provide oversight of how the executive branch spends the people’s money, including how it handles children and adults under state supervision.
Lawmakers advanced Legislative Bill 298 by voice vote. The measure, sought by Speaker John Arch, would create a new Division of Legislative Oversight and a new Legislative Oversight Committee. The new division would include the inspectors general of child welfare and corrections, as well as the legislative performance audit office.
“We need information in this Legislature to legislate and appropriate,” Arch said, adding that senators require more information to do its job well than relying on news reports.
Data and opinions
State Sen. Eliot Bostar of Lincoln emphasized the need to dig deeper independently of reporters and the state auditor. He had wanted to add new employees who monitor spending by all levels of government as a job, an amendment that failed 7-22.

“We do not have adequate oversight over all of the levels of government, over all of the governmental bodies, over all of the political subdivisions in the State of Nebraska,” Bostar said.
Senators spent much of the debate arguing about how specific the bill should be about response times for requested records from the agencies under the governor’s control.
Some also discussed the origins of the debate, whether senators need to pass a new law in response to a non-binding legal opinion in 2023 from Attorney General Mike Hilgers.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln has argued the Legislature should have sued the executive branch and let the courts decide the limits of legislative oversight.
Conrad has argued that Arch and the Legislature should not accept an executive branch interpretation of the limits of legislative power that lacks the power of law. It is, she said, an opinion. 
Evolving fix for Nebraska legislative oversight faces continued resistance

“I strongly disagree with how legislative leadership reacted to the attorney general’s political opinion, which undermined our undeniable ability to conduct legislative oversight,” she said.
On Wednesday, Conrad argued that if the Legislature was going to proceed on codifying its oversight role, it should specify a timeline for record requests and responses.
She said her overarching goal was making sure that the state agencies that the Legislature funds understand that lawmakers are watching how they work, that “the agencies are on notice.”
Better, quicker answers
Arch responded that he agreed with her that a time may come when the Legislature has to set a number of days but that the experience under a memorandum of understanding has been good.
He said the inspectors general for corrections and child welfare tell him that the offices are getting information in a timely manner, often four to seven days, so deadlines aren’t needed yet.
But State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, who has long fought with the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services for timely information, said agencies should not have the option.

Cavanaugh and Conrad pointed to an Ombudsman’s Office report that argued the administration has been less accessible and slower in responding to the child welfare questions. 
“I appreciate Speaker Arch’s comments … that it hasn’t been a problem recently, but that’s part of the reason that we put things in statute,” Cavanaugh said.
Under the bill, the Legislature’s watchdogs would retain the subpoena power to demand documentation and answers. Using that power would require a majority vote of the Executive Board. 
Lawmakers seemed to agree that their oversight would need to pause during criminal investigations and that lawmakers might not be able to access every bit of executive information. 
Arch has said the Legislature and executive branch sought a balance to make sure state senators get the information they need and that the executive branch can carry out its work.

The shooting never happened, according to organizers, the local school system and police. (Sarah Ladd/ Kentucky Lantern) Everytown for Gun Safety says a man who spoke at a February rally for gun safety it helped organize in Frankfort lied about his experience surviving a school shooting. 
The event, which the Lantern and other media outlets covered, happened Feb. 12 in the Kentucky State Capitol. Moms Demand Action and Students Demand Action hosted a variety of speakers who advocated against gun violence. 
One of the speakers, Calvin Polachek, said that when he was a high school student in Pennsylvania, he lost people in a school shooting, including claiming that he saw his best friend lying in a pool of blood.
Polachek “is not an active volunteer with Moms Demand Action or Students Demand Action, and we are deeply disappointed that someone would exploit the tragic, lived experience of many to use our platform to share a story that was not true,” Sarah Boland Heine, the senior director of communications for Everytown, said in a Wednesday statement. The Lantern reached out to Moms Demand Action, which is part of the Everytown gun safety group network, after receiving numerous messages from people who said they were classmates or relatives of Polachek and that the shooting never happened
“Calvin reached out to our Kentucky chapter, shamefully lied to our volunteers and shared a tragic story that we later learned was not true,” Heine said. “This is an affront to the countless survivors of gun violence who show extraordinary courage every day by reliving their darkest moments in service of the fight to end our country’s gun violence crisis. We are revisiting our guidance to our grassroots networks in an effort to ensure this never happens again.” 
Polachek did not immediately respond to Facebook and LinkedIn messages from the Lantern. Polachek was identified as a University of Louisville student at the rally. A UofL spokesperson said Wednesday that he is currently a graduate student.
The Dallas School District, in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, said in a Wednesday statement that it “is aware of a video clip and accompanying article that appears to depict a former Dallas student speaking about a school shooting at Dallas in 2017.” 
“Thankfully, that never happened,” the school said. “The discussion on the clip about Dallas and school violence is not factually accurate.” 
The school district did not immediately return a voicemail from the Lantern. 
Meanwhile, the Dallas Township Police Department said the claims made that day at the rally are “entirely false.” 
“The widespread sharing of a fabricated tragedy is not only reckless, it is harmful,” the police department said in a news release. “It fuels unnecessary fear, disrespects the experiences of real victims of school violence and misleads the public with a narrative that has no basis in truth.”

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)Attorneys for Greenpeace argued this week that a jury’s decision ordering it to pay $667 million to the developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline cannot stand.
A Morton County jury delivered the verdict on March 19 after more than three weeks of trial.  Jurors found the environmental group responsible for damages related to anti-pipeline protests in North Dakota in 2016 and 2017, as well as for publishing defamatory statements about Energy Transfer. 
Greenpeace says the jury’s decision was not based on fact, but bias against the protest movement.
“What the verdict in this case reflected, your honor, is the community’s desire to punish someone who was involved in the protests,” said Everett Jack, an attorney representing Greenpeace’s U.S. affiliate. 
 
More Dakota Access Pipeline coverage


The arguments followed a hearing earlier this month during which Greenpeace asked Southwest Judicial District Court Judge James Gion to reduce the $667 million award if he moves forward with a judgment against the environmental group.
Energy Transfer wants Gion to uphold the jury’s decision in full.
The award includes more than $200 million of compensatory damages — or money meant to make the plaintiffs whole for financial harms — and another roughly $400 million in punitive damages.
Energy Transfer’s core argument is that Greenpeace trained protesters to wage violent attacks to stop the Dakota Access Pipeline and that it deliberately published false statements to sabotage the company’s business.
Greenpeace was one of many activist groups that sent representatives to south-central North Dakota to protest in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. It denies Energy Transfer’s allegations and says the lawsuit is an attempt to discourage environmental activism. 
During a Tuesday hearing, attorneys representing the environmental group doubled down on their claims that Energy Transfer presented no concrete evidence during the trial that Greenpeace caused the company to suffer financially.
The lawsuit is against three Greenpeace entities: Greenpeace International, Greenpeace USA, and Greenpeace Fund, its United States-based fundraising arm. 
Only Greenpeace USA had employees at the protests. Greenpeace USA says it had six staff members visit to provide peripheral support to the Indigenous-led demonstrations, including supplies and nonviolent trainings.
Energy Transfer attorney Trey Cox argued that Gion has no reason not to honor the jury’s verdict. 
Cox said the acts the jury found Greenpeace liable for — including defamatory speech, trespassing and abuse of property — do not count as constitutionally protected speech.
“They’re trying to wrap themselves in the First Amendment,” he said.
Cox said Greenpeace is willfully ignoring documentation Energy Transfer presented to the jury linking Greenpeace personnel to attacks against the pipeline, and that the jury’s decision is the most important indicator of the evidence’s credibility.
Attorneys also asked Gion to toss the jury’s verdict finding the three organizations liable for defamation. Energy Transfer alleges that Greenpeace published nine defamatory statements about the Dakota Access Pipeline that harmed the energy company’s business relationships.
In the United States, the standard for proving defamation claims is high — especially for individuals and organizations in the public eye.
Greenpeace attorneys said the nine statements don’t meet this threshold for multiple reasons. 
Jury finds Greenpeace at fault for protest damages, awards pipeline developer more than $660 million

For one, each of the nine statements was either factually true or reflected opinions about what happened at Standing Rock, Jack said.
Energy Transfer also did not demonstrate that Greenpeace made the statements knowing they were false or with “reckless disregard” for their veracity, which are other key standards required for proving defamation, he added.
Greenpeace has also said it was not the first to circulate the statements, and that they were contemporaneously published by hundreds of other organizations and media outlets.
Judges must act as the “gatekeeper” on defamation claims to make sure the decision does not violate free speech rights, Adam Caldwell, an attorney representing Greenpeace International, argued. This standard was set in the landmark U.S. Supreme Court case on defamation New York Times v. Sullivan, he said.
Jack also argued that under North Dakota law, proving a defamation claim requires that a third party testify that they believe the statements in question are defamatory. He said none of Energy Transfer’s witnesses fulfilled this requirement.
He pointed to the testimony of Greenpeace employees who said they believed the statements were true and came from credible sources.
Cox said jurors likely rejected this testimony as unconvincing.
“Given the very large exemplary damage award, we can readily infer that this jury found these witnesses to be liars,” Cox said. “We found them to be concealing things, to be hiding things, to be non-credible.”
Greenpeace International and Greenpeace Fund — which does not engage in organizing activities — say Energy Transfer has no right to involve them in the case. Neither had any personnel visit North Dakota.
Greenpeace International says it is not subject to the court’s jurisdiction because it is a Netherlands-based organization that was not involved in the protests.
“The only evidence was affirmative evidence from International that it had never set foot in North Dakota,” Caldwell said. “It’s a textbook case of lack of personal jurisdiction.”
While Greenpeace International did sign onto a letter that included two of the statements the jury found defamatory, it was one of more than 500 signatories, he said.
Greenpeace Fund similarly said there was no evidence linking it to the case.
“We shouldn’t be here,” said Matt Kelly, an attorney representing the organization.
Energy Transfer has argued that Greenpeace Fund and Greenpeace International conspired with Greenpeace USA on its anti-pipeline efforts. The jury found Greenpeace International and Greenpeace USA liable for conspiracy, but not Greenpeace Fund.
Gion took the motions under advisement.
The parties also recently presented arguments on a separate set of motions asking Gion to reduce the jury’s nearly $667 million award against Greenpeace. Greenpeace claims the award exceeds statutory caps on damages and that the verdict is riddled with inconsistencies.
If the jury’s decision is allowed to stand, defendants have the option to appeal the verdict to the North Dakota Supreme Court. Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace International have disclosed their intent to appeal.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/28/ct-legislators-discuss-ditching-2-year-budget-as-priorities-clash/,CT Democrats want to spend $200 million more than Gov. Ned Lamont will accept in 2026-27. Lamont said a one-year plan would be 'a mistake.',"With spending on pace to exceed Connecticut’s constitutional cap starting in July 2026, legislators may suspend their requirement to adopt a biennial budget and craft a plan covering only one year, House Speaker Matt Ritter announced Wednesday.
Talk of abandoning the two-year cycle — a planning tool enacted in 1991 to temper public frustration over the newly created state income tax — drew criticism from Gov. Ned Lamont, who said legislators need to provide a long-range plan that would give predictability to municipalities and taxpayers.
But Ritter said something is better than nothing.
“As a legislature, the worst and most dangerous thing you can do is leave without a budget of some kind,” Ritter said, referring to the June 4 mandatory deadline for the regular General Assembly and stalled budget negotiations with the Lamont administration.
The two sides largely have agreed on spending to cover the 2025-26 fiscal year, which starts in less than five weeks.
But for more than three decades, the legislature in odd-numbered years has adopted a biennial plan, covering both the soon-to-begin fiscal year and offering a first draft for the one after that. Legislators have an opportunity to amend the second half of the biennial plan during even-numbered years.
This approach is designed to encourage long-range fiscal planning and to help officials anticipate spending and revenue problems. Connecticut has followed this approach since the biennium stretching from July 1993 through June 1995.
But the spending cap and Connecticut’s other budget controls have become increasingly difficult to follow in recent years.
Ritter said the legislature’s Democratic majority wants to spend roughly $200 million more than the administration will accept in 2026-27. The legislature’s proposal also would push spending over the constitutional cap, which keeps most budget growth in line with household income and inflation, unless some compromise to legally exceed or otherwise circumvent that limit can be reached.
Slashing those funds would eliminate most spending growth planned for public colleges and universities, special education for K-12 schools, subsidized student meals and health care. “The [cut] sheet is tough,” Ritter added.
“We continue to have cordial conversations and negotiations with the governor’s office,” the speaker said. But he added that, with the session closing in one week, leaders must decide in the next few days whether to keep pursuing a two-year deal, and risk adopting no budget, or passing a one-year sure thing.
The legislature could call a special session. But with summer vacations and other scheduling challenges, there’s no guarantee that any deal would be passed before the new fiscal year starts July 1. If that happens, the lack of any budget could lead to delays in issuing aid to cities and towns.
Lamont told reporters Wednesday he doesn’t like the idea of abandoning the two-year budget cycle.
“I think that’s a mistake,” he said, adding that it helps municipalities and other groups that rely on state assistance with their own fiscal planning. “Mayors, superintendents and everybody wants a little bit of predictability.”
Republican legislative leaders also called for Connecticut to stick with biennial budgeting.
“This is about priorities,” said House Speaker Vincent J. Candelora of North Branford. “This is about choices. And some adult needs to get in that room and start making these decisions.”
Adopting a single-year plan would be “more than a ‘mistake,’ governor,” added Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding of Brookfield. “It’s a dereliction of duty.”
“We submitted a balanced budget to the legislature, what, back in early February,” Lamont said, adding that template should show lawmakers how to craft a plan that complies with state budget caps. “We’ve got a week to go. I think we ought to be able to figure it out.”
But legislative leaders counter that it’s not that simple, for several reasons.
First, state budget caps have become increasingly problematic.
Some large segments of the state budget, such as Medicaid, grow faster than either household income or inflation and largely are fixed. So, they tend to eat up a disproportionate share of new spending allowed each year under the cap system, leaving other programs to fight for fiscal scraps.
Second, state officials are particularly wary of committing to any long-range budget right now given the likelihood that Connecticut could lose hundreds of millions in annual aid from Washington based on cutting proposals pending before Congress.
“We all know that we’re waiting for the other shoe to drop in the fall,” said state Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven.
Third, Lamont’s budget wasn’t as perfectly balanced as the governor suggested.
The administration and legislature both knew entering the legislative session in January that health care workers were poised to strike this spring at nursing homes and group homes for clients with developmental disabilities. Lamont recently reached a last-minute deal last week to boost Medicaid over the next few years — including about $140 million extra in 2026-27 — to avert a strike. 
But the governor didn’t propose any funds to cover a pay increase for nursing and group home workers in his February budget proposal.
In other words, the legislature is seeking to spend $200 million more in 2026-27 than Lamont will accept, but 70% of that involves an expense he chose not to cover in his own budget plan.
“The legislative branch is not backup singers,” Ritter added. “It is a co-equal branch of government, and it’s not going to just bend a knee because somebody says on a sheet of paper, ‘just make these cuts.’”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7592-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-28 14:10:30.894731

A federal judge denied the requested temporary restraining order on Feb. 18.New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez’s office announced on Tuesday that District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, from the District of Columbia, had denied the Trump administration’s motion to dismiss a lawsuit by more than a dozen states, and co-led by New Mexico, against Elon Musk and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency.
The lawsuit, filed in February, alleges President Trump “delegated virtually unchecked authority to [Musk] without proper legal authorization from Congress and without meaningful supervision of his activities.” A federal judge that same month rejected the plaintiffs’ request for a temporary restraining order against DOGE and President Donald Trump.
New Mexico sues Elon Musk

In her ruling, Chutkan writes that two states, New Mexico and Washington, “allege sufficient injuries” to satisfy standing under Article III of the Constitution, which limits federal judicial power. In the case of New Mexico, Chutkan notes that New Mexico’s Mining and Minerals Division has been unable to access federal funding via Bipartisan Infrastructure Law grants, which it relies on to “safeguard…thousands of abandoned mines and associated hazards” across the state.
She wrote that the court also found “New Mexico’s allegations that Defendants gained unauthorized access to its private and proprietary information sufficient to allege an injury.”
In describing the suit in February, Torrez said it posed a “novel” question for the courts to consider, which is that Musk’s actions constitute “a fundamental restructuring of constitutional order and a violation of the rule of law.”
Specifically, the suit argues that DOGE’s actions violate the U.S. Constitution’s separation of powers and the Appointments Clause, specifically the portion that requires executive appointments to have congressional oversight.
In her analysis, Chutkan notes that the U.S. Constitution does not allow “the Executive to commandeer the entire appointments power by unilaterally creating a federal agency pursuant to Executive Order and insulating its principal officer from the Constitution as an ‘advisor’ in name only. This is precisely what Plaintiffs claim the Executive has done.”
While Chutkan allowed the suit to proceed, she did agree to dismiss President Trump as a defendant.
Following Chutkan’s ruling on Tuesday, Torrez released a statement calling the decision “an important milestone for preserving America’s system of checks and balances.” The AGs filed the case, he said, “to defend the Constitution and stop the dangerous precedent of allowing billionaire donors to dismantle federal agencies, cut vital public programs, and access sensitive state data without lawful authority. We are proud to move this case forward and help bring Elon Musk’s reign of terror to an end.”
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel in a statement noted that, “The Constitution, and the Appointments Clause, are not mere roadblocks for this administration to ignore. I look forward to continuing this case in court.”
Torrez noted that the case will continue even if Musk is gone. “No one should be allowed to outsource the presidency to one of their billionaire friends or exercise executive authority without the advice and consent of the Senate,” he said in a statement. “This is about the rule of law, plain and simple.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AGssueDOGE-1024x580.jpg,,,2025-05-28 14:10:30.894731

As Jared Preseau helped his grandfather fix farm equipment, he developed an interest in mechanics. Encouraged by family to pursue a degree and boost his earning potential, he decided to take the leap. With VSAC’s guidance, he’s set to begin a diesel and hydraulics program this fall.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  A grandfather gives the gift of knowledge[...]","Earlier this spring, as the other seniors at Poultney High School were picking out dresses and tuxes, Jared Preseau’s “prom prep” had him scouring auto parts catalogs. After replacing the motor, transmission, and four-wheel-drive axels in his 1989 Ford F150 over the winter, he was hustling to button up some final repairs he had missed. “I want to get it ready for prom,” he said with a grin. Working on motors, engines, and equipment has been Jared’s passion for a long time, ever since the day the hay baler broke on his grandfather’s farm when he was eight years old. “We hit a big rock in the hay pile, and we had to take the spinner apart to fix it where it got bent. It still works to this day.”That was the first time Jared experienced the satisfaction of taking something broken and making it work again. He’s felt the same pride many times since, working on brushhogs, tractors, 4-wheelers, and neighbors’ lawn mowers and snowblowers. Jared was raised by his grandparents in Wells, and much of his growing-up experience took place on their 400-acre, 70-cow beef farm in Pawlet. “Haying is pretty much my summer,” he says. His grandfather, in particular, was an important role model, introducing him to farm life, fishing, and turkey and deer hunting. “He taught me everything I know,” says Jared. On the equipment side of things, his grandfather did most of the farm’s repairs, and as a young boy, Jared was usually by his side and looking over his shoulder. His grandfather passed away two years ago, but he leaves a legacy in the mechanical knowledge he passed down to his grandson. Jaren’s grandfather lives on through the knowledge Jared will gain when he goes on to college this fall at Northern Maine Community College’s diesel and hydraulics program. It’s a path his grandfather wanted for him, but one Jared almost didn’t take. “For years I was dead set on not going to college,” Jared says. “I didn’t think it was for me.”His grandfather did not go to college, heading to work on the farm instead. He also had several off-farm jobs doing logging, driving dump trucks and excavators, and as the head road commissioner for the town of Pawlet. “Something along those lines was what I thought about doing,” says Jared, until other family members echoed his grandfather’s advice to go to college. “My aunts, my grandmother, my grandfather—they all wanted me to go. And my uncle said not going to college was his biggest regret. He worked as a mechanic off the farm, and said he didn’t make the money he could have made if he’d had a degree.”So last summer, Jared reflected on his plans, heard his grandfather’s voice, and started to wonder if he was being more stubborn than smart. As senior year kicked off, he met with his guidance counselor, attended a college fair, and started working with Nathan Hickey, an outreach counselor for VSAC’s GEAR UP program, a federally funded initiative that provides additional counseling and financial support to modest-income students who want to continue their education beyond high school. “Each time I connected with Jared, I became more impressed with him as someone who has good values and ethics and a desire to continue his education after high school,” says Hickey.“It’s been helpful to talk with Nate about next steps along the way,” says Jared. “He also helped me out with scholarship applications, and I applied for quite a few. I’m not good with words, so having Nate there to help me was great.” While he applied to several schools in Vermont, Maine, and upstate New York, Jared chose Northern Maine Community College for its diesel and hydraulics program and its affordable tuition. While the school offers both two- and four-year degree programs, Jared plans to start with the two-year plan. “I think I’d rather get out and work, but if I change my mind and decide to get more classroom experience, I’ll have that option.”  Jared’s already gotten far through hands-on learning and—occasionally—some hockey tape. “Last winter, some buddies and I had entered the Granville Lighted Tractor Parade, and I discovered my tractor had a fuel leak while we were in line for the parade. So while we were waiting, I took off the rear portion of the body, spliced in a piece of metal, and wrapped it with hockey tape. My buddy plays hockey and had some in his truck. It’s actually still holding,” Jared says with a laugh, although he plans to weld it—another of his favorite hobbies—before entering the tractor pulls this summer.While he’s grateful for the advice from his grandfather and, more recently, from his dad—with whom he keeps in contact and calls “one good mechanic”—Jared’s also not afraid of trial and error. “I figure if I break something, I’ll just try again and figure out how to do it. That’s the only way you’re going to learn.” This story is produced by Vermont Student Assistance Corp., created by the Vermont Legislature in 1965 as a public nonprofit agency, to advocate for Vermont students and their families to ensure that they achieve their education goals.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Child sex offenders can be sentenced to death or life without parole on their first offense under a new law signed by Gov. Kevin Stitt. 
Senate Bill 599, authored by Sen. Warren Hamilton, R-McCurtain, allows prosecutors to pursue the death penalty for the rape of a child under 14 for first-time offenders. Under existing law, the offender must have been previously convicted of the sex crime to be eligible for the death penalty. 
For lewd molestation against a child under the age of 12, an offender can receive the death penalty, a sentence of at least 10 years or life or life without parole. The law currently requires a sentence of at least 25 years of incarceration.  
“Oklahoma is sending a clear and unequivocal message, crimes against our most vulnerable citizens, our children, will be met with the harshest consequences,” Hamilton said in a statement.
The Oklahoma District Attorney’s Council was involved in the crafting of this legislation and made recommendations to shape its language, he said. Prosecutors will continue to have discretion about which sentence to seek.
Hamilton said this law makes Oklahoma one of the states with the toughest penalties for child sex offenses.
“I deeply appreciate Gov. Stitt for signing this crucial legislation,” he said. “His action reaffirms our state’s commitment to justice and to protecting children from predators who, frankly, don’t deserve a second chance.”
The legislation passed through the Legislature with the only “no” votes coming from some House and Senate Democrats. 
The new law takes effect Nov. 1.

Now, states may lose their ability to raise or implement new taxes. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)The tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week targets a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government. The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.
Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.
But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.
Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

(Screenshot/Capitol TV)A state policy change aimed at helping Johnston insurance company FM expand its investments, and potentially, its employment in Rhode Island, sailed through the Rhode Island House of Representatives Tuesday.
The 71-0 vote came without discussion, following a strong backing by Rep. Joseph Solomon, chairman of the House Committee on Commerce, which held a May 15 hearing on the bill. 
“It’s a great bill,” said Solomon, a Warwick Democrat, noting that no written or verbal opposition on the proposal emerged during the hearing before the House panel.
The bill sponsored by Rep. Alex Finkelman, a Jamestown Democrat, was introduced on May 8 after FM executives met with House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi. The Fortune 500 company was formerly known as FM Global, but rebranded in July 2024.
The proposed policy change seeks to let insurance companies invest as much as they want in nontraditional or alternative assets — referred to under federal reporting requirements as Schedule BA assets —  like hedge funds, private equity funds and real estate holdings. It effectively reverses the 1984 law on the books, which limited investments on long-term assets outside of traditional stocks and bonds to no more than 10% of a company’s total assets.
Eleventh hour insurance bill could help top employer FM expand in R.I.

The origins of the 1984 law remain somewhat hazy, but proponents for its repeal insist the rule no longer makes sense, with alternative investments like hedge funds now widely used and commonly accepted.
“When this law was enacted in 1984, the limitation was practical, as regulatory techniques for overseeing insurance investments were more limited at that time,” Solomon said Tuesday. “The law is now outdated.”
Since 2010, insurance companies have been steadily increasing investments in alternative assets, searching for higher returns in a low-interest rate environment. The appeal of alternate asset classes increased further after 2017 regulatory changes adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which reformed how companies could record exchange-traded funds on their balance sheets. 
Certain bonds are also now considered Schedule BA assets under a new NAIC effective Jan. 1. Removing the state’s limit on BA investments now is particularly timely,” Jonathan Schreiber,  associate vice president of state government relations for the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, wrote in a May 15 letter to lawmakers.
The change would also put Rhode Island in line with neighboring Massachusetts and Connecticut — a key selling point for Gov. Dan McKee, who has already signaled support for the policy change.
Especially as the state wrestles with how to retain major employers like Hasbro, Inc., which previously indicated it was looking to abandon its Pawtucket headquarters in favor of a new location in Boston. The potential relocation was put on hold after Trump tariffs roiled markets and put company profits at risk; an update is now expected sometime this summer.
FM executives made it clear they have no intention of picking up and moving from their 8-acre Johnston headquarters, which houses the bulk of the property insurer’s 1,500-person local workforce. Instead, the company is contemplating more hiring as it looks to expand its offerings of research, development and industrial and commercial insurance products for renewable energy, Finkelman said previously.
FM did not offer specifics on expansion plans when asked by Rhode Island Current.
Lifting the investment cap could also benefit the other 29 local insurance companies that operate in Rhode Island, according to Elizabeth Dwyer, director for the Department of Business Regulation. Dwyer wrote a letter supporting the policy change, noting that state business regulators will continue to carefully monitor companies.
“This vigilance gives me confidence that a blunt tool for investments is no longer necessary,” Dwyer wrote in the May 14 letter to lawmakers.
Lincoln-based Amica Mutual Insurance Co. and Providence’s Delta Dental of Rhode Island also submitted written support for the policy change, along with the Rhode Island Business Coalition and the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies.
A companion bill in the Senate, sponsored by Johnston Democrat Andrew Dimitri, remains under review by the Senate Committee on Finance following an initial May 20 hearing. A committee vote has not been scheduled as of Tuesday, according to Greg Pare, a Senate spokesperson.
If passed by both chambers and signed into law by McKee, the investment cap would be repealed immediately. 
Reps. Arthur Handy, Brian Kennedy, Earl Read III and Brandon Voas were not present for the House vote Tuesday.

As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.

Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.

Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.

But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.

Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Consumer sentiment in Virginia continues to slide, reaching its second-lowest level on record, according to the latest quarterly report by the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research (IPOR) at Roanoke College, released Wednesday.
“While the labor market remains strong and wage growth is outpacing inflation, uncertainty is weighing heavily on consumers, particularly around tariffs,” said Alice Louise Kassens, Roanoke College’s John S. Shannon Professor of Economics and senior analyst at IPOR. “This uncertainty is reflected in both short- and long-term inflation expectations, which remain elevated despite recent easing in actual inflation rates.”
The Virginia Index of Consumer Sentiment fell to 63.6 in the second quarter of 2025, continuing a 13-point slide over the past six months and marking the second-lowest reading since the index began in 2011. The drop underscores growing unease among Virginians, particularly surrounding the economic consequences of new tariffs and the general direction of the national economy.
Kassens warned that a continued slide in sentiment could soon translate into concrete economic consequences. 
“Consumer spending, which drives nearly 70% of economic activity, has remained robust, albeit tempered,” she said. “However, if sentiment continues to decline, we may see a pullback in spending that could slow economic growth or even trigger a recession.”
That warning comes despite some signs of strength in the broader economy. The labor market remains resilient, and Virginia workers are seeing wage increases that exceed inflation. Average wage growth in the commonwealth is currently 3.8%, compared to 2.3% inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index. This gap suggests increased purchasing power for households, a key support for ongoing economic activity.
Still, many Virginians remain cautious. 
Just 20% of respondents said their household finances are better today than they were a year ago, while 30% expect improvement over the next year. Meanwhile, 32% anticipate worsening conditions, and 59% believe the next few years will be marked by economic difficulty.
Short-term inflation expectations remain stubbornly high, even as actual inflation continues to moderate. Many survey respondents indicated they were accelerating purchases of big-ticket items like refrigerators in anticipation of higher prices to come. In fact, 37% said it was a good time to buy such durable goods, citing concern over the inflationary effects of tariffs.
“Despite months of easing inflationary fears in the commonwealth over 2024, the inflationary effects of tariffs are keeping short-term inflation expectations elevated,” the report notes. “These concerns can have a chilling effect on the economy as consumers and businesses experience difficulty in financial planning.”
The Virginia Index of Current Conditions, which measures sentiment about personal finances and buying conditions today, declined 2.2 points from last quarter to 60.8. That remains slightly above the national index, a trend that continued in future expectations as well. The Virginia Index of Consumer Expectations held at 65.4 — unchanged from the previous quarter — while the national index dropped nearly 18 points to 46.5. 
Kassens said that disparity may point to some localized resilience.
“The divergence between Virginia and national sentiment, where Virginia remains more optimistic, suggests regional resilience, but that could be tested if inflationary and uncertainty pressures persist,” Kassens said. “As we move into the second half of 2025, the trajectory of consumer sentiment will be a key indicator to watch.”
The results are based on a representative sample of 719 Virginia adults surveyed between May 12 and May 19. The survey was conducted using a combination of phone interviews (including landlines and texts to mobile phones) and an online panel. 
The phone sample was drawn by Marketing Systems Group using random digit dialing, while the online panel was managed by Cint USA, Inc. Responses were statistically weighted to reflect the gender, age, and racial demographics of Virginia according to the 2023 American Community Survey.
Regional quotas were also applied to ensure proportional representation across different areas of the state. About 38% of completed phone and text-to-web interviews came via mobile phones. Interviews were conducted in English, and attention checks were built into the online questionnaire to ensure quality responses.
The continued decline in consumer confidence — despite economic indicators that might otherwise encourage optimism — suggests that psychological factors such as uncertainty and inflation fear may be outweighing hard data in shaping household expectations.
Kassens emphasized that while wage growth and job availability remain bright spots, sentiment will be a key factor to watch as the year progresses. 
“We’re at a critical juncture,” she said. “If consumers lose confidence in their ability to spend and plan ahead, it could create ripple effects that weaken an otherwise sturdy economic foundation.”

Mikie Sherill's Dem rivals have turned their sights on her as the June 10 gubernatorial primary approaches.,"Three of Rep. Mikie Sherill's Dem rivals have turned their sights on her as the June 10 gubernatorial primary approaches. (Amanda Brown for New Jersey Monitor)With less than two weeks to go before the June 10 primary, Democrats vying to become New Jersey’s next governor have stepped up their attacks on Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who election observers and pollsters consider to be the race’s front-runner.
In new television ads and mailers, Sherrill’s rivals have bashed her wealth, her establishment ties, and past campaign contributions she accepted from a PAC associated with SpaceX, the spaceflight company helmed by Elon Musk.
The grievances aren’t new, but they’re escalating as the primary approaches. And they’re coming from candidates like Steve Fulop and Ras Baraka, who are running as anti-establishment insurgents, as well as party darlings like Steve Sweeney as they look to erode Sherrill’s support among voters, many of whom remain undecided.
“Why on earth would Mikie Sherrill vote to send millions in taxpayer funds to Elon and SpaceX? Musk be the money he gave her campaigns. End the corruption!” says an ad from Coalition for Progress, a PAC boosting Fulop’s candidacy (its treasurer is Fulop’s wife’s business partner).
Another ad from Baraka’s campaign takes aim at Sherrill for both the SpaceX donations and profits Sherrill and her husband, a banker, made from stock trades. The congresswoman, along with other politicians, paid a fine several years ago for disclosure failures.
“Mikie Sherrill let us down. Mikie took $30,000 from Elon Musk’s campaign fund, while Trump attacked abortion access,” the ad’s narrator says.

Sherrill, after speaking to voters in Somerset Tuesday, told the New Jersey Monitor that the uptick in negative campaigning against her is “a shame to see.”
“A lot of that’s based on false information from Newsmax, which is paying $40 million in court settlements for misinformation. And I’m the only person in the race that’s put out my tax return for state and federal over the last two years. It’s all really transparent,” she said.
Sherrill’s congressional campaign received $24,000 between 2019 and September 2024 from the SpaceX PAC, while a Sherrill-affiliated leadership PAC received another $7,500 total from the PAC in 2020 and 2022. Sherrill donated the amount her campaign received to a food bank, her campaign filings show.
When Charlamagne tha God, a host on the radio show The Breakfast Club, interviewed Sherrill last week and asked her to confirm claims in Baraka’s campaign ad — plus in news reports — that she made $7 million in stock trades, Sherrill said she didn’t know.
“I haven’t, I don’t believe I did, but I’d have to go see what, what that was alluding to,” she said. “Look, I, both my husband and I come from very middle-class families. My parents were the first in their family to go to college and his were both teachers, and then we both went into the military. And afterwards he got a good job and, I, we’ve been really lucky. I really, I really deeply feel like this country has provided an incredible amount of opportunity to us and that’s why I think I feel a responsibility to sort of pay that forward.”
The clip of the interview promoted on social media prompted a succinct reaction from Sweeney.
“Yikes,” he wrote.
Fulop, the mayor of Jersey City, told the New Jersey Monitor that the criticism facing Sherrill is fair given the race’s high stakes. He doesn’t think Sherrill, if she wins the Democratic primary in June, can pull off a general election win in November, citing mounting public disillusionment with Democrats in both D.C. and Trenton. Sherrill has the backing of key New Jersey Democratic Party officials.
“She’s a creature of the political establishment,” Fulop said. “She has the same machine infrastructure and the same playbook as was run in the last 25 years. And the nature of where the state is and the country is, is not that. After eight years of Democratic machine politics, it’s going to be hard for any Democrat that is part of that structure to be elected.”
He pointed to Jack Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman and the front-runner on the Republican side of the race, and his habit of hammering Trenton lawmakers for things like skyrocketing taxes and electric bills. Fulop said Sherrill makes an easy target for Ciattarelli because she’s “the status quo machine politician.”
If she prevails in the primary, Fulop said, “Jack Ciattarelli’s biggest talking point is going to be ‘four more years of Phil Murphy.’ ‘You like your taxes? Four more years of Phil Murphy. You like your energy bill? Four more years of Phil Murphy.’”
Requests for comment from Baraka’s and Sweeney’s campaigns were not returned.
Sherrill campaign spokesman Sean Higgins disputed the claim that Sherrill would be a weak general election candidate, and highlighted the electoral histories of the three men criticizing her. Baraka and Fulop won elections in towns that have nonpartisan municipal races, while Sweeney lost his bid for reelection in 2021 to a Republican whom Sweeney vastly outspent.
“Mikie has actually beaten Trump Republicans election after election — while the mayors have never faced a competitive general and Senator Sweeney famously lost to a MAGA Republican,” Higgins said.
Asked to respond to Fulop’s complaint that Sherrill is a creature of the political establishment, Sherrill said, “I think most people would find that a really odd statement coming from Steve Fulop.”

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Maine Legislators said they hope to send a message about the importance of public service with the passage of a bill that would undo previous cuts to the state pension system — to the tune of more than $1.6 billion.
In 2011, the Legislature and former Gov. Paul LePage made changes to the state pension system that capped cost of living adjustments at 3% and restricted that increase so that it would only apply to the first $20,000 (which has now increased to $24,000) of pension income. At the time, those cuts helped the state lower the top marginal individual income tax rate from 8.5% to 7.15%.
The House voted 81-66 on Wednesday following the Senate’s 22-12 vote on Tuesday in favor of legislation (LD 900) that would undo some of those changes and tie the Public Employees Retirement System to the Consumer Price Index in an effort to help retirement accounts keep pace with inflation. 
Speaking from the chamber floor Tuesday, Sen. Mike Tipping (D-Penobscot) noted the bill has a fiscal note of more than $1.6 billion due to the state pension system not having enough assets to cover the future cost of those changes.
“I have every confidence that my colleagues on the Appropriations and Financial Affairs Committee will find that money,” Tipping joked, “but regardless of how it works out, this is an important reminder of how much we’ve taken from retirees to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy.”
However, critics said passing a bill with such a price tag would be irresponsible.
“We must legislate responsibly, balancing our obligations to retirees with a broader need for Maine’s working families, businesses and public services,” Rep. Mike Soboleski (R-Phillips) said during the House debate, adding that if funded the bill would likely divert resources from education, health care, and other priorities. 
Rep. Amy Roeder (D-Bangor) said although the bill is likely going to die on the appropriations table, where legislation not included in the budget vies for remaining funds at the end of session, she won’t stop fighting for pensions. “Every year we fail to restore these pensions, we are complicit in perpetuating the injustice,” she said.
Bill sponsor Sen. Joe Baldacci (D-Bangor) said over the last 15 years “employees of the state have been shortchanged significantly,” noting the thousands of retired teachers and public workers impacted by the current structure. His hope is that over successive legislatures, this issue becomes a priority.
Before advancing to either the governor’s desk or the appropriations table, the bill will go back to both chambers for final enactment votes.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A pipeline failure in northwest North Dakota caused an estimated 73,000 barrels, or nearly 3.1 million gallons, of brine to spill in Williams County, the Department of Environmental Quality reported this week.
Continental Resources staff discovered the spill about 1:35 p.m. Monday about 16 miles northeast of Williston and notified state regulators, said Marty Haroldson with the Division of Water Quality.
“This would be a larger spill,” Haroldson said Wednesday.
Brine, or produced water, is a waste byproduct of oil production that can be destructive to land. The spill contaminated grassy land near the site of the pipeline failure, Haroldson said. Brine also contaminated an unnamed tributary that eventually flows into Stony Creek.
The spill did not reach Stony Creek and has had no known impacts to drinking water sources, Haroldson said.
An incident report indicates that trucks began removing fluid from the site earlier this week and crews blocked culverts and set up berms to contain the contamination. Crews were working to excavate the pipeline to repair it, according to the incident report.
A Continental Resources representative did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Wednesday.
The cause of the spill is under investigation. Department of Environmental Quality and Department of Mineral Resources staff are inspecting the site and will be overseeing the investigation and cleanup.

(Photo via via Leon County Humane Society Facebook)Gov. Ron DeSantis signed two bills  Wednesday that will increase fines and sentences for people convicted of abusing pets or restraining them outside during natural disasters.
Lawmakers passed the bills, HB 255 and SB 150, in honor of Dexter, a bulldog mix found decapitated and dumped in St. Petersburg, and Trooper, a bull terrier a Florida Highway Patrol officer found tied to a fence along Interstate 75 as Hurricane Milton approached.
“Current sentencing guidelines don’t match the gravity of these crimes, and it was evident that Florida law needed to do more to protect dogs from senseless violence,” DeSantis said during the bill signing ceremony in Loxahatchee.
Dexter’s Law, which will go into effect July 1, creates a sentencing multiplier for people convicted of intentionally torturing, mutilating, or killing a pet, meaning that they could serve a longer sentence. Under the bill, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement must create, by the beginning of 2026, a database of people who plead guilty or no contest or who have been convicted of animal cruelty.
At least seven counties and Tallahassee have a registry of animal abusers, according to a legislative bill analysis.
A judge sentenced the 66-year-old who decapitated Dexter days after adopting him last year and dumped his body in Fort De Soto Park to a year and 60 days in jail, according to the Tampa Bay Times.
Trooper’s Law will go into effect on Oct. 1 and will make it a third-degree felony to restrain and abandon a dog outside during a natural disaster. Third-degree felonies are punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 and imprisonment for up to five years.
Trooper Orlando Morales said he’d responded to a report of an animal in distress
“It took several loops, but I thank God that He gave me the right time and right place of where to be, and after the second or third loop, I was able to find a dog clearly in water, in distress,” Morales said. “And it was a horrific moment to be in.”

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA).Being a freelance writer, I have had my own financial ups and downs. My own experience with poverty, and with paying bills that you really lack the funds to pay, leaves me flabbergasted by the short-sightedness behind the massive budget package that passed the U.S House of Representatives.
Republicans and conservatives have been calling it “a big beautiful bill,” but New Mexico’s own The Food Depot, which services nine New Mexico counties, says the only result will be even greater challenges to access food and healthcare.”The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities writes that if the bill passes unchanged, it would be the first time in the modern history of  the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Programs “that the federal government would no longer ensure that the lowest-income families with children, older adults, and people with disabilities in every state have access to the food assistance they need.”
Local and national groups concur. And I believe them.
These organizations point out blatant inconsistencies in the bill’s rationale, revealing its intent is not to lift spirits, or instill the down-on-their-luck with training and knowledge. It’s to punish them.
The most talked about aspects are the additional work requirements for nutritional assistance and Medicaid recipients. The revisions display a grave misunderstanding that poverty is layered, complex and full of pitfalls. Able-bodied SNAP recipients already fulfill work requirements, with exemptions for those who are taking care of children, or over age 55. The provisions in the U.S. House bill eliminate most exemptions, like a clean slate that erases all familial differences, or capabilities.  The new provision—which will heavily impact New Mexico, where 61% of SNAP recipients are families with children—orders that any parent with a child over six years old will have to meet work requirements.
The new requirements can easily undermine households already in tenuous situations. Obviously, people who qualify for nutritional assistance have even less ability to pay for child care. How much harm will forcing a parent to leave the house and systemically abandon a very young child do?
Furthermore if the family or single parent faces a set of circumstances that leaves them unable to meet the new work requirements, what happens? The household loses its SNAP benefits. The bottom line is that this means less food for the child. The proposal promises a drastic uptick in child hunger. What kind of society snatches food from families with children?
The bill would also impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients, forcing them to prove they’re consistently working, which is basically an excuse for additional paperwork—additional red tape in a system that is already clogged with it. The overwhelming majority of Medicaid recipients already work. A 2023 analysis found that 71% of Medicaid enrollees were in school, or employed, and a significant number of the “unemployed” were caregivers of some kind, staying at home for the sake of sick family members. Healthcare furthermore is a human right that should be available to all Americans, regardless of income or ability to make a regular paycheck.
GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson cavalierly claims the bill is harmless. “What we’re talking about, again, is able-bodied workers, many of whom are refusing to work because they’re gaming the system,” he stated on the Face the Nation TV show, and opined, “There’s a moral component to what we are doing.”
Alas,  Johnson’s moral component is based on an obsessive zeal to stereotype the recipients of assistance with the lie that all people who aren’t financially solvent are  consequently lazy, shiftless or criminal. Like most distorted morality imposed by self-righteous groups, it’s worsened by the refusal to examine the GOP’’s own hypocrisy and self-interest. The “big beautiful bill”  includes a massive tax cut for the wealthy.
It’s a matter of cutting services to the have-nots to provide benefits for the very rich. It’s a matter of kicking one group off the rolls to afford tax cuts that bolster the other. The U.S. Senate can do better than this, and should reject this “ big beautiful bill” and its contemptuous elitist morality.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/snapmarket-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-05-28 12:22:34.333590

Republicans Senate President Robert Stivers and House Speaker David Osborne released the list of members and chairs they appointed to the task forces in press releases Tuesday. Like interim joint committees, task forces have both representatives and senators as members and two co-chairs, one from each chamber. Task forces are typically formed by a resolution of the House or Senate and make recommendations about legislation to consider the following year. 
Osborne said in a statement that lawmakers will “continue to use our interim to address the challenges facing our Commonwealth.” 
“Whether through interim committees or formal task forces, we are positioning ourselves to create policies that help Kentucky and Kentuckians succeed,” Osborne said. “The groundwork we lay now allows for more efficient and productive debate once the session is underway, reducing rushed decisions and increasing the likelihood of passing meaningful, effective legislation.”
A meeting schedule for the task forces has not been released yet. 
The interim legislative task forces are: 
Make America Healthy Again Kentucky Task Force
The chairs, Sen. Shelley Funke-Frommeyer, R-Alexandria, and Rep. Matt Lockett, R-Nicholasville, were the sponsors of resolutions to establish the group. The task force will explore ways to implement directives from the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, policies. During a committee hearing on her resolution, Funke-Frommeyer said “this is our starting point” to start addressing Kentucky’s dismal health statistics. The commonwealth has high rates of diabetes and cancer deaths, maternal mortality and more.
Disaster Prevention and Resiliency Task Force
This task force is the only one of the five with bipartisan co-chairs, Rep. Chris Freeland, R-Benton, and Sen. Robin Webb, D-Grayson. While Webb sponsored the Senate resolution for the task force, Rep. John Blanton, R-Salyersville, introduced the House resolution. Webb said during the floor debate on her resolution that she had been working on the idea of the task force for some time, but the Senate considered the resolution on the heels of statewide floods and winter storms in February. Kentucky has faced more weather-related challenges, such as tornadoes and flooding, since lawmakers adjourned the 2025 session. 
Artificial Intelligence Task Force
Both Sen. Amanda Mays Bledsoe, R-Lexington, and Rep. Josh Bray, R-Mount Vernon, chaired the AI task force in 2024 but saw more policy areas to explore when it comes to possible state legislation on AI. This year, the General Assembly passed initial legislation to regulate AI in state government carried by Bledsoe. The co-chairs were part of an April panel on AI and discussed ways the technology could be used in health care, energy, education and more. 
States’ AI laws may be impacted by actions at the federal level. The budget bill passed by the House last week includes a 10-year moratorium on enforcement of state AI laws as a way to a patchwork of different policies nationwide. 
Housing Task Force
Last year, lawmakers on the Housing Task Force compiled information to better understand the state’s housing needs. The task force is continuing this year under co-chairs, Senate Republican Caucus Chair Robby Mills, of Henderson, and Rep. Susan Tyler Witten, R-Louisville. In a final report released ahead of the 2025 legislative session, the task force found that local elected officials are confronting a problem exacerbated by a boom of jobs in some communities and natural disasters in others. This year, the task force will review issues around housing availability, affordability and development statewide this interim session. 
Air Mobility and Aviation Economic Development Task Force
The chairs of this task force are Rep. Stephanie Dietz, R-Edgewood, and Sen. Brandon Storm, R-London. Frommeyer introduced the legislation to create the panel. In an earlier press release, she said Kentucky has “an opportunity to further cement our leadership in this sector and create high-quality jobs” in the aviation industry. The task force will review steps other states are taking in the industry and what policies Kentucky could implement to further support the industry at large and regional airports statewide.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/240227Lantern083-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-28 12:22:34.333590

This needs to change.,"In 2017, Sophia, an expectant mom from New Haven, gave birth to a baby girl at a local hospital. She often complained of inflammation and difficulty breathing following the birth, but her symptoms were overlooked. Undiagnosed preeclampsia caused Sophia to go into cardiac arrest within 48 hours, and she sadly passed away. 
Like many others, her experience highlights a severe weakness in Connecticut’s maternity care system, particularly for low-income and Black women. These are not isolated events; instead, they indicate a systemic issue that needs to be fixed immediately. 


Maternity care’s lack of regulation and accountability continues to claim lives. Connecticut House Bill 6589, “An Act Establishing Accountability Measures for Maternity Care,” would help to solve this public health issue. The bill’s existence indicates a legislative purpose to improve maternal health results by regulating reports, holding healthcare providers accountable, and improving openness, even if it is now in placeholder form. 
As Connecticut drafts this law, it should take inspiration from other states’ successful models, especially California. 
Connecticut is not an exception to the dangerously high maternal death rate in the United States. Regardless of their level of education or their financial wellbeing, Black women are three times more likely than white women to die during pregnancy. Systemic problems like economic inequality, racial bias in healthcare, and uneven access to high-quality prenatal care are the leading causes of these disparities. 

Chanel Sample
California’s Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC) established data-driven, efficient methods and accountability tools that helped reduce the state’s maternal mortality rate by 55% between 2006 and 2013. Now is the perfect time for community leaders and medical care providers in Connecticut to advocate for a comprehensive and evidence-based plan for maternal health reform. 
The administrative pressure that new rules will place on hospitals might concern some individuals, but the cost of doing nothing is much higher.
Sophia’s story and the many others who share similar experiences demand immediate and significant action. Connecticut can set the standard for maternity care reform by passing a carefully developed version of HB 6589 to make childbirth safe, transparent, and equitable for all women, regardless of zip code, race, or financial situation. 
As a young Black woman myself, this issue is extremely personal. I dream of one day starting my own family, and I want to know that the healthcare system I’ll rely on will protect me and my future children. This fight for accountability in maternity care is not just political—it’s personal, and it affects the future of families like mine across Connecticut. 
Lawmakers must act on this opportunity as the General Assembly continues its 2025 session. House Bill 6589 must be reshaped into complete, effective legislation that holds healthcare providers accountable and guarantees fair treatment for everyone, not just an empty promise. There is too much at stake to waste time. 
Every mother is entitled to safety, respect, and understanding. Let’s take this opportunity to respect their lives by making significant changes for all they do.

During a confirmation hearing this month, Department of Adult Correction Secretary Leslie Dismukes told lawmakers the state is now faced with 40% vacancy rate for correctional officers.

Three prisons currently have a vacancy rate over 60%, and at another 10 the vacancy rate hovers at over 50%.
“The General Assembly has been our partner and has dedicated resources to help us address this issue. But I’ll be honest, it’s still a struggle,” Dismukes told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The Department of Adult Correction (DAC) has almost 32,000 people in physical custody and another 77,000 under community supervision. State employees in the department are working 12-hour shifts and mandatory overtime to meet minimum staffing levels in the prisons.
Flanked by law enforcement officers, Dismukes said she has workers who are dealing with exhaustion and child care needs, that many cannot afford.
“What is the department doing now to recruit new employees and what do you think needs to be changed to do to increase your recruitment?” Sen. Warren Daniel (R-Burke, McDowell, Buncombe) asked.
Dismukes said recent raises have been helpful, but North Carolina lags its neighbors.
“We are for correctional officers in the bottom three in the country, and certainly in all of our surrounding states, we are at lowest,” she said.
DAC urgently needs to keep qualified staff on board to train the new staff that are being recruited.
“Right now, we’re in great danger of losing a lot of our talented staff who know how to do the job because we cannot pay them equivalent to other states or other industries within North Carolina,” Dismukes added.

Rep. Phil Rubin (D-Wake) agrees with that concern.
“If you want to be a prison guard, you’ve got a lot of reasons not to do it here,” Rubin said in an interview this week with NC Newsline.
Rubin said the House budget proposal offers a meager 2.5% raise for state workers and proposes getting rid of many positions that have been vacant for months. For DAC that would mean the loss of 400 correctional officer positions that are unfilled.
“We can’t fill the spots. So, then we get rid of them, and we have too few prison guards, which endangers the ones that are there, and it drives them out of the job because their job just got harder and worse and they’re still not getting paid better,” Rubin explained. “Meanwhile, we’re hearing about doubling the premiums and the deductibles on the State Health Plan.”
Aging infrastructure, aging populations
Beyond just a modest pay increase, the state needs to make a commitment to ensuring the correction officers have a safe workplace.

NCDAC has recorded more than $1 billion in deferred maintenance for the aging infrastructure in prisons.
“It’s $1.4 billion of maintenance that needs to be done right now,” Dismukes stressed. “Our fire suppression systems are outdated or completely inoperable in 23 prisons and several prisons don’t have air conditioning.”
Correction officials say it’s not a matter of comfort. The lack of cooling systems in close conditions in an institutional setting can increase the risk of violence. A 2015 Columbia Law School report noted that the rise in older, sicker prisoners may also be more vulnerable to the heat.
North Carolina has been working on a long-term project to cool its prisons since 2021. As of last summer, DAC was installing air conditioning systems in buildings containing the remaining one-third of the beds its staff supervises.
Beyond the indoor environmental conditions, the agency learned during Hurricane Helene that it does not have the redundancies and system resilience to meet natural disasters. The storm forced the transfer of nearly 2,200 prisoners from five facilities in the western part of the state. Civil rights groups warned at the time that the emergency transfers exacerbated overcrowded conditions and the workload on correctional officers.

“We must make critical decisions about our prison locations to maximize staffing and return on investment for our infrastructure repairs,” Dismukes told senators.
Another ever-present worry for DAC is medical costs.
In fiscal year 2024, the department spent $400 million on health care. This fiscal year, that number is projected to rise to $425 million.
“These costs, we cannot avoid given the aging prison population and our duty of care to them,” warned Dismukes. “We must take a look at our overall medical infrastructure and build the best prison medical system we can and create savings wherever possible.”
Getting medical personnel to work in the correction system remains a challenge. The persistent and high vacancy rates for nurses have resulted in the use of contract or traveling nurses, a more expensive option for the state.
‘No silver bullet’
Dismukes is expected to win confirmation from the Judiciary Committee at its next meeting.
Sen. Danny Britt (R-Robeson) said the secretary deserves credit for her willingness to take on the challenge.
“It is probably one of the most challenging budget areas that we have to deal with, both on scale and funding,” he acknowledged.
Britt said the Senate has done its best with salaries, earmarking an additional 5.25% raise for correctional officers combined with step increases. Probation and parole officers could get an additional 2% raise in the Senate budget.
“There’s no real silver bullet, so hopefully if confirmed, you can come up with those answers outside of salaries that can fill these positions. We’re willing to do whatever we can to assist. Hope you’re willing to reach out.”
  Sen. Danny Britt said in the last 10 years he’s served there have been close to 3,000 vacancies in NC correction officers. NC Department of Adult Correction Secretary Leslie Dismukes says wages and conditions must improve to attract and keep workers.

Michigan’s state constitution states that no public funds can be appropriated to fund non-public schools, but state law permits non-public or homeschooled students to enroll in “non-essential” courses at public school, excluding science, social studies, mathematics and English language arts.
Rep. Jennifer Wortz (R-Quincy), joined by several Republican co-sponsors, has introduced House Bill 4330, that would eliminate restrictions on the kinds of classes public schools can receive state school aid for to provide classes to non-public school students. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Having done 13 years of homeschooling with her kids, including enrolling her kids into limited programming at public school once they reached high school, Wortz said there is a lot of benefit for homeschool parents to have the autonomy to tailor educational experiences to suit their children and family.
“This bill kind of allows for that freedom. If it’s a homeschool family that still just wants to completely homeschool, they can continue to do that, but if it’s a family who maybe they want their kid to have a math or science class, they can do that and then still continue to homeschool with the other options at home, and it just kind of enhances their opportunities,” Wortz said.
In her own experience, living in a rural area where many homeschool families elect to send their kids to public school for high school, Wortz said the bill would allow families that already contribute to state taxes to better benefit from what those tax dollars are used for. 
As one of the handful of states that doesn’t require families to register minor children for homeschool, Michigan doesn’t have a count of how many homeschool students exist in the state, so an estimation on necessary increases to the school aid budget is something Wortz said she’s looking into.
Following a stark increase in homeschooling nationwide during the COVID-19 pandemic and news stories in recent years outlining accounts of abuse behind closed doors when children didn’t attend public schools, Michigan State Superintendent Michael Rice asked the state Legislature last year to create a mandatory state registry for students outside of public school in the name of safety.
“The issue of “missing children” is a national problem with potential negative consequences for too many children,” Rice wrote to the Legislature. “Parents should be able to choose the best educational system for their children. However, there is a history in Michigan and across the nation of some children not receiving any education at all, in particularly egregious cases in abusive or neglected environments.”
Currently, House Republicans’ budget plans include diverting around $700 million annually in gas sales tax revenue that goes into the School Aid Fund, while backfilling the money for schools using the state’s General Fund. Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Twp.) said before this year’s legislative session that funding for schools would be guaranteed as the gas tax revenue under the GOP plan would be used to repair the state’s crumbling roads and infrastructure.
But just as some families may start increasing their usage of public school programming, some might leave the full-time structure, Wortz said. With the option to attend math and science classes at a public school, Wortz argued that she would not have necessarily enrolled her own children in public school in high school.
“I didn’t want to teach geometry, I didn’t want to teach Algebra II or chemistry,” Wortz said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2025-04-16-Wortz-homeschool-classes-bill-intro-scaled-1-1024x732.jpg,,,2025-05-28 12:22:34.333590

Ole Miss, unseeded going into postseason play, faces the No. 12 seed Texas Tech Thursday at 6 p.m.
Action across the eight-team double-elimination bracket begins Thursday at Devon Park. The final two teams will play for the title in a best-of-three series starting June 4.
In other opening-day matchups, second-seeded Oklahoma plays No. 7 seed Tennessee, third-seeded Florida will play No. 6 seed Texas and No. 9 seed UCLA meets No. 16 seed Oregon.
Although No. 1 overall seed Texas A&M was knocked out in regional play, the SEC has five teams in the field — Oklahoma, Tennessee, Florida, Texas and Ole Miss.
Florida beat Georgia in three games to advance. The Gators won national titles in 2014 and 2015 and lost to Oklahoma in the semifinals last year.
Texas has reached the best-of-three championship series in two of the past three seasons, with both losses coming to Oklahoma. The Longhorns are also in their first season in the SEC.
Texas Tech and Ole Miss are first-time qualifiers.
Texas Tech beat host Florida State in a super regional.

(Photo by Claire Sullivan/New Hampshire Bulletin)A controversial recycling facility project in Claremont has been denied by state officials, a win for local conservation and community groups that had been vehemently opposed to the project.
Recycling Services Inc., and its Massachusetts-based parent company, Acuity Management, sought to upgrade its recycling facility to handle 500 tons of construction and demolition debris daily, per its 2023 permit application. It currently can accept 50 tons a day of newsprint, aluminum, corrugated paper items, industrial iron, glass, metal cans, automotive batteries, and tires. The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services denied the permit request last week because the property setbacks were too short and incoming trucks would block traffic, according to a letter sent by the department to Recycling Services.
Recycling Services has 30 days to appeal the decision. Representatives with the company did not immediately respond to the Bulletin’s request for comment.
“DES listened to reason and did the right thing,” John Tuthill of Acworth, with a community organization called A Better Claremont, said in a press release. “Acuity’s proposal did not add up.”
The project saw fierce opposition from local residents concerned about what such a large facility would do to their town. In a March hearing held by DES in Claremont, hundreds of residents showed up, most of whom urged the government to deny the project. They expressed concerns that environmental contaminants like heavy metals or PFAS would seep into a nearby brook that feeds into the Connecticut River. They feared the increased number of trucks carrying the waste would damage their already crumbling and pothole-filled roads. They also worried that traffic and noise pollution from the facility would impact students at nearby Maple Avenue Elementary School. For these and other reasons they feared their property values would decrease if the project came to fruition.
This is not the first time Recycling Services has attempted to convert this facility to accept more materials, including construction and demolition waste. It was the third application the company submitted to state officials since 2017.
“This is a win for Claremont, where families made it clear their health and environment are not for sale,” Heidi Trimarco, staff attorney at Conservation Law Foundation, said in a release. “People came together to protect their neighborhoods — and it worked.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/claremontsigns.png,,,2025-05-28 12:22:34.333590

A Florida member of Congress says she is hopeful that her request for a federal investigation into allegations of impropriety regarding the Hope Florida Foundation will begin soon.
“I expect them to. That’s their job,” said Tampa Bay Democratic U.S. Rep. Kathy Castor, who along with Central Florida Democrat Darren Soto, contacted the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services and the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services two weeks ago, asking them to investigate the Hope Florida Foundation.
The foundation is the nonprofit arm of Hope Florida, the state welfare assistance program that works with nonprofits and faith-based groups and has been led by First Lady Casey DeSantis.
The Hope Florida Foundation gave $10 million from a state Medicaid settlement to two nonprofits last year. Those groups then gave millions to a political committee, chaired by Gov. Ron DeSantis’ then-chief of staff, James Uthmeier, to campaign against a proposed referendum to legalize recreational marijuana in Florida. DeSantis later appointed Uthmeier to serve as Florida attorney general.
A spokesperson for the Health & Human Services Office of Inspector General told the Phoenix Tuesday that the agency is in receipt of Castor’s and Soto’s letter.
“The letter has been received and we are reviewing for appropriate action,” said Zeke Miller, public affairs officer for the Health & Human Services Office of Inspector General.
Castor said on Tuesday that the details that have emerged through the reporting of Hope Florida is “awfully sketchy on a number of different levels.”
“First is passing what are Medicaid dollars through nonprofits to totally unrelated political action committees. That’s illegal in the state of Florida,” she said.
“Number two, Medicaid dollars are state and federal dollars, because it’s a partnership initiative. And it’s highly likely there was a settlement of a court case that the feds are entitled to some of those dollars. So, I would think that would capture the attention of the HHS Inspector General. Especially at a time when everybody is talking about fraud and abuse in Medicaid — and here is a prime example.”
Medicaid cuts
Soto connected the allegations regarding the Hope Florida Foundation to the major tax and spending bill pushed by President Trump and passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives last week.





“House Republicans are proposing record cuts to Medicaid of over $700 Billion, claiming waste, fraud and abuse,” he said in a statement emailed to the Phoenix on Wednesday. “Diverting $10 million Medicaid settlement funds to a political campaign, rather than back into the program, would be the biggest fraud of all.”
 While it’s unclear whether the federal government will investigate, the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald reported last week that an open investigation into the Hope Florida Foundation is underway in Florida’s Second Judicial Circuit, led by State Attorney Jack Campbell in Tallahassee.





Gov. DeSantis blasted that investigation last week as much ado about nothing, calling it a “manufactured political operation” created by Pensacola Republican Rep. Alex Andrade, who chaired the House Health Care Budget Subcommittee earlier this year and launched a probe into the settlement during the legislative session.
The office of Mehmet Oz, administrator of the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, did not immediately respond to request for comment regarding the congressional request for an investigation.
Rep. Castor said that the taxpayers and citizens of Florida deserve answers.
“We just need to get to the bottom of it, and if there was nothing wrong, I would think that the governor and the attorney general would be forthcoming and cooperative,” she said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-28 15:47:59+00:00,CT Mirror,"Eversource, United Illuminating drop website references to ‘DEI’",John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/28/eversource-united-illuminating-dei-trump/,"Despite quietly scrubbing references to 'diversity, equity and inclusion,' the utilities say they remain committed to fostering diverse and inclusive workplaces.","Connecticut’s two largest investor-owned utilities have quietly scrubbed references to “diversity, equity and inclusion” initiatives in recent months, online records show, following a trend in the corporate world of companies turning away from the terminology since President Donald J. Trump won a second term in office.
As recently as March, Eversource’s website boasted of its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion practices — more commonly known as DEI — that had earned the company accolades from publications such as Forbes and Bloomberg, according to versions of the site still available on internet archives.
As of this week however, that page redirects to Eversource’s main jobs website, which no longer contains references to DEI.
Gone, too, are references to the company’s 2023 report on its DEI initiatives, which Chief Executive Joe Nolan prefaced with a letter calling the programs “key to our ability to meet our customers’ needs,” adding, “we seek to create a workplace where employees of all backgrounds and perspectives are welcomed and can thrive.”
A similar shift in terminology around diversity programs also appears to have taken place at the state’s other major utility provider, United Illuminating’s parent company, Avangrid.
Last July, Avangrid announced the hiring of Ignacio Estella to serve as senior vice president of “DEI, Talent and Innovation.” While Estella remains a member of Avangrid’s senior leadership team, his title changed earlier this year to senior vice president of “Innovation, Talent & Equal Opportunity,” according to a review of online archives.
Both utilities said this week that the changes have not altered their broader commitment to fostering diverse and inclusive workplaces.
“We are committed to fair and consistent hiring practices that identify the most qualified talent,” Eversource spokeswoman Jamie Ratliff said in a statement. “The different perspectives and backgrounds of our employees and potential future employees make us stronger and create a more innovative team that brings immense value to our customers and the communities we serve.”
Ratliff went on to say that Eversource has kept intact its “inclusion council” — which she said plays a “key role in shaping our organizational culture” — as well as seven “business resource groups,” which are voluntary, internal networks for minorities, LGBTQ people, veterans and other affinity groups.
As a federal contractor, she said, Eversource is bound to comply with U.S. anti-discrimination laws and regulations. “We regularly review our policies and programs, and while we made adjustments to certain language and certain demographic data is no longer made publicly available, our commitment to fostering an engaged, respectful and supportive workplace remains the same,” Ratliff said.
Estella, the Avangrid executive, said in an interview Monday that the company has had an equal opportunity policy in place since 2015. The removal of the reference to DEI in his title, he said, was made to provide clarity and conformity to that policy, as well as state and federal laws. 
Estella also pointed to ongoing efforts, including an upcoming report on the company’s accessibility for people with disabilities and a mentoring pilot program, as examples of the company’s commitment to that policy. He also noted that United Illuminating, Avangrid’s electric utility, is currently led by its first Black chief executive in the company’s 125-year history, Frank Reynolds.
“The true north of the work that we do is equal opportunity,” Estella said. “There can be no confusion if you’re clear in what you do. What I think is that there’s been no change in our mission to [offer] equal opportunity.” 
The change at both companies came after President Trump took office in January and subsequently issued a series of executive orders targeting DEI programs in the federal government and among contractors. His administration also ordered federal agencies to “combat” similar programs in the private sector.
Since then, several major U.S. corporations have followed suit by rolling back DEI initiatives, including McDonald’s, Target and Meta. Other companies, such as Disney, have rebranded DEI programs with new language, while promising to continue their commitment to diversity.
State Rep. Derell Wilson, D-Norwich, the vice chair of the legislature’s Black and Puerto Rican Caucus, pointed to Connecticut’s diverse workforce and said it was important that local companies not “bend to national pressure” over DEI programs. 
“I would hope that they realize that diversity and inclusion is an important piece for workforce development opportunities, and that they continue to have measures beyond just equal opportunity for the diversification of workforce opportunities within the electric industry, but also the diversification of these opportunities in leadership,” Wilson said.
Joseph Malcarne, business manager at the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 420, which represents around 600 unionized Eversource employees, said he hadn’t heard of any shift in the company’s policies and that workers are still being trained on diversity efforts.
He said it’s more likely the shift in language was made for “an audience of one.”
“If President Trump says no DEI stuff, then they’re going to take all the DEI stuff off,” Malcarne said. 
“What matters to me as a representative of the union is that the actual inclusion still exists, the equity still exists.”Moses Rams, UWUA Local 470-1
About 450 Avangrid employees are represented by another union, the United Workers Union of America Local 470-1.
“What matters to me as a representative of the union is that the actual inclusion still exists, the equity still exists,” said Moses Rams, a line crew leader and local UWUA president.
Avangrid is a subsidiary of the Spanish power company Iberdrola, which previously published a “Diversity and Inclusion Anti-Harasssment Policy” on its corporate website, according to internet archives.
That page now directs to Iberdola’s “Sustainable Human Capital Management and Anti-Harassment Policy,” which was published in March. “Respect for equality of opportunity and non-discrimination, as well as the interests of professionals, are part of Iberdrola’s strategy,” the company’s website now states.
Rams said the union has pushed Avangrid to take steps to promote diversity in hiring since relations between the company and its workers reached a low point during a 2002 strike. He said he speaks regularly with Estella, and has not noticed any changes in the company’s policies other than terminology.
“I would make such a big deal if it weren’t this way, because we worked so hard to get here,” Rams said. “I’m proud to say that’s not the case.”
Companies involved in the interstate sale and transmission of electricity, including both Avangrid and Eversource, are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
As part of his administration’s campaign against DEI programs, Trump has also ordered federal agencies, including FERC, to stop considering environmental justice in decision-making. That order could block FERC from weighing the disproportionate impacts of projects such as pipelines and power plants in minority and low-income communities, according to a report from Bloomberg Law.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP897557055837-1017x1024.jpg,,,2025-05-28 12:22:34.333590

The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities, and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.
Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.
But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.
Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

,DC,2025-05-28 15:17:52+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Top Democrats in Congress decry White House 'lack of transparency' in spending plans,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/top-democrats-congress-decry-white-house-lack-transparency-spending-plans,,"WASHINGTON — Two top Democratic lawmakers are calling on the Trump administration to detail exactly how it’s spending money that Congress approved earlier this year for government operations.House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray of Washington released a two-page letter Wednesday demanding the White House budget office share that information this week.The detailed plans were due to Congress by April 29, but several departments and agencies haven’t submitted the information to lawmakers, or have sent up incomplete documents, they wrote.“The widespread failure of departments and agencies to abide by the requirements of section 1113 is unacceptable, and the lack of transparency begs serious questions about what exactly this administration is seeking to hide from the Committees — and the American people,” DeLauro and Murray wrote to the budget director, Russ Vought.“These spending plans are essential to understand how the executive branch is spending taxpayer dollars appropriated by Congress in fiscal year 2025, and they directly inform the legislative responsibilities of the Committees to consider fiscal year 2026 appropriations legislation, a process that is already underway,” the two lawmakers added.Repeated requests for informationThe lack of detailed information about how exactly the Trump administration is spending funding approved by Congress has come up during several Appropriations Committee hearings during the last month.Concerns from lawmakers, however, have not led to a change in heart as of this week’s letter. The Office of Management and Budget did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Congress was unable to broker agreement on the dozen annual spending bills for the current fiscal year, which began on Oct 1. Instead, lawmakers passed a series of stopgap spending bills that essentially held funding levels flat and kept the prior year’s policies mostly in place.The third stopgap spending bill, which lawmakers passed in March, required the Trump administration to tell Congress how it planned to spend those resources. The requirement is intended to assist lawmakers with their oversight responsibility and to help them shape the next fiscal year’s dozen appropriations bills.“As the House and Senate Appropriations Committees intend to mark up the fiscal year 2026 bills next month, we demand that by the end of this month you comply with section 1113 and ensure that all spending plans contain sufficient information to demonstrate how each department and agency intends to prudently obligate all amounts provided by Congress for fiscal year 2025 within their period of availability and resubmit them to the Committees,” DeLauro and Murray wrote.Website pulled downThe Trump administration did publicly post budget documents earlier this year that detailed how quickly departments and agencies planned to spend the money appropriated by Congress, known as apportionments.Vought had that website pulled down in late March, leading to lawsuits from government watchdog groups.The judge in those cases heard arguments earlier this month, but has yet to issue a ruling about whether the Trump administration violated the law by removing that information.",,,,2025-05-28 12:22:34.333590

The 9-year-old Indiana boy told his parents his stomach hurt. He kept running to the bathroom and felt too ill to finish a basketball game.
Days later, he lay in a hospital bed, fighting for his life. He had eaten tainted salad, according to a lawsuit against the lettuce grower filed by his parents on April 17 in federal court for the Southern District of Indiana.
The E. coli bacteria that ravaged Colton’s kidneys was a genetic match to the strain that killed one person and sickened nearly 90 people in 15 states last fall. Federal health agencies investigated the cases and linked them to a farm that grew romaine lettuce.
But most people have never heard about this outbreak, which a Feb. 11 internal FDA memo linked to a single lettuce processor and ranch as the source of the contamination. In what many experts said was a break with common practice, officials never issued public communications after the investigation or identified the grower who produced the lettuce.
From failing to publicize a major outbreak to scaling back safety alert specialists and rules, the Trump administration’s anti-regulatory and cost-cutting push risks unraveling a critical system that helps ensure the safety of the U.S. food supply, according to consumer advocates, researchers and former employees at the FDA and U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The investigation into the illnesses began near the end of the Biden administration but work on the lettuce outbreak wasn’t completed until Feb. 11. At that time, the decision was made by the Trump administration not to release the names of the grower and processor because the FDA said no product remained on the market.
The administration also has withdrawn a proposed regulation to reduce the presence of salmonella in raw poultry, according to an April USDA alert. It was projected to save more than $13 million annually by preventing more than 3,000 illnesses, according to the proposal.
Officials from the Department of Health and Human Services have said that food safety is a priority, and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in an April 29 interview with the newsletterInside Medicine that the recent job cuts would not affect agency operations.
“The FDA had 9,500 employees in 2007. Last year it was nearly 19,000. Has the 100% increase in employees increased approval times, innovation, AI, food safety, or agency morale?” Makary asked. “No, it hasn’t. In fact, it’s increased regulatory creep.”
The FDA referred questions to HHS, which declined to comment or make Makary available for an interview. In a statement, the agency said “protecting public health and insuring food safety remain top priorities for HHS. FDA inspectors were not impacted [by job cuts] and this critical work will continue.”
Public health advocates warn companies and growers will face less regulatory oversight and fewer consequences for selling tainted food products as a result of recent FDA actions.
The administration is disbanding a Justice Department unit that pursues civil and criminal actions against companies that sell contaminated food and is reassigning its attorneys. Some work will be assumed by other divisions, according to a publicly posted memo from the head of the department’s criminal division and a white paper by the law firm Gibson Dunn.
The Justice Department did not respond to an email requesting comment.
“They need the DOJ to enforce the law,” said Sarah Sorscher, director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. “For an executive investing in food safety, the knowledge they could go to jail if they don’t is a really strong motivator.”
Federal regulators also want states to conduct more inspections, according to two former FDA officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation. But some Democratic lawmakers say states lack the resources to take over most food safety inspections.
“Handing that duty to state and local agencies is really troubling,” said Rep. Shontel M. Brown (D-Ohio). “They don’t have the resources, and it creates a potentially unsafe situation that puts families in Ohio and America at risk.”
The High Cost of Foodborne Illnesses
Foodborne illnesses exact a major economic toll in the United States, according to federal data, and cost thousands of lives each year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates the deaths, chronic illness, medical treatment, and lost productivity from food-related illnesses amounted to $75 billion in 2023.
Each year, about 48 million people in the U.S. get sick with foodborne illnesses, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In its first few months, the administration has suspended a program known as the Food Emergency Response Network Proficiency Testing that ensures food-testing labs accurately identify pathogens that can sicken or kill, according to a former FDA official.
In March, the agency said it would delay from January 2026 to July 2028 compliance with a Biden-era rule that aims to speed up the identification and removal of potentially contaminated food from the market.
However, the FDA is taking aim at foreign food manufacturing, saying in a May 6 notice that it would expand unannounced inspections overseas. “This expanded approach marks a new era in FDA enforcement — stronger, smarter, and unapologetically in support of the public health and safety of Americans,” the notice said.
Some former FDA and USDA officials said that goal isn’t realistic, because U.S. inspectors often need to obtain travel visas that can wind up alerting companies to their arrival.
“It’s really, really difficult to do surprise inspections,” said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports and a former USDA deputy undersecretary for food safety. “The visa process can alert the local authority.”
HHS declined to address Ronholm’s concerns.
The FDA hasn’t met the mandated targets for inspecting food facilities in the U.S. since fiscal year 2018, and the agency has consistently fallen short of meeting its annual targets for foreign inspections, according to a January report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
Foodborne illness can turn serious. Listeria bacteria in cucumbers sickened dozens of people in April and May and left at least nine people hospitalized, according to the FDA. Salmonella in peanut butter killed nine in 2008 and 2009, resulting in criminal charges against company executives. And E. coli in cookie dough sickened more than 70 people in 2009, including a Nevada mother who died of complications from eating the raw dough.
‘Life or Death for Our Son’
E. coli, commonly found in feces, can be especially dangerous to children like Colton, the boy from Avon, Indiana, who ate contaminated lettuce. The bacteria can damage blood vessels and cause clots that destroy the kidneys, leading to strokes and comas. Consumers sickened by E. coli can pass it along to others, and, in some cases, the bacteria end up killing victims who never consumed the contaminated food.
By the time Colton’s mother brought him to the emergency room that November day, the bacteria were releasing toxins and damaging his blood cells and kidneys, according to his father, Chris George.
Colton was sent to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis. Chris said doctors told him and his wife, Amber George, that their son was in kidney failure and the next 24 to 72 hours would determine whether he would survive, the father recalled.
“They said it was life or death for our son, and I was like, wait, he was just playing basketball,” said Chris, a firefighter. “I told them, ‘You do what you need to do to save my son.’”
Usually, the FDA alerts the public and identifies growers and food manufacturers when there are outbreaks like the one that sickened Colton. The FDA said in its February internal summary that the grower wasn’t named because no product remained on the market.
But Bill Marler, a Seattle lawyer who specializes in food-safety litigation and represents the George family, said the information is still important because it can prevent more cases, pressure growers to improve sanitation, and identify repeat offenders.
It also gives victims an explanation for their illnesses and helps them determine whom they might take legal action against, he said.
“Normally we would see the information on their websites,” Marler said, adding that the agency’s investigatory findings on the outbreak were “all redacted” and he obtained them through a Freedom of Information Act request.
The FDA, USDA, and CDC play central roles in overseeing food safety, including inspections and investigations. The FDA and CDC have been rocked by job cuts that are part of a reduction of 20,000 staff at HHS, their parent agency. The Agriculture Department has also shrunk its workforce.
Staffing cuts mean delays in publicizing deadly outbreaks, said Susan Mayne, an adjunct professor at Yale School of Public Health who retired from the FDA in 2023.
“Consumers are being notified with delays about important food safety notifications,” she said, referring to a recent outbreak in cucumbers. “People can die if there are pathogens like listeria, which can have a 30% fatality rate.”
Makary has said the cuts wouldn’t touch inspectors, reviewers, or scientists at the agency.
But the FDA laid off scientists in April who worked at food safety labs in Chicago and San Francisco, where they performed specialized analysis for food inspectors, former FDA officials said. The FDA later restored some positions.
“No scientists were fired? That was incorrect,” Mayne said.
Siobhan DeLancey, who worked in the agency’s Office of Foods and Veterinary Medicine for more than 20 years before she also was laid off in April, said new requirements for reviewing agency announcements became so arduous that it took weeks to get approval for alerts that should have been going out much sooner.
She said some employees who were laid off include communications specialists and web staff who do consumer outreach aimed at preventing illness. The USDA and FDA have been bringing some workers back or are asking some who accepted deferred resignations to take back their decisions.
“It’s all about destruction and not about efficiency,” DeLancey said. “We’re going to see the effects for years. It will cost lives.”
HHS did not respond to an email seeking a response to DeLancey’s comments.
For 13 days, Colton stayed on dialysis at the hospital, initially unable to eat or drink. His mother wet a sponge to moisten his lips and tongue.
He turned 10 in the hospital. Chris George bought paint markers to make signs on the windows of his son’s room.
“I am not happy with the CDC and FDA,” Chris George said. “Victims have a right to know who made them sick. This is my kid. He’s my life.”
Colton was able to leave the hospital almost three weeks after first eating the contaminated lettuce but still has nightmares about the ordeal and is seeing a therapist.
“The whole ‘Make America Healthy Again,’ the focus on taking food color dyes out of cereal?” said Chris George, who objects to the Trump administration’s decision to redact information about the grower in the February report. “How about we take E. coli out of our lettuce, so it doesn’t kill our kids?”

Through the “Seven States Safety Campaign,” the ACLU across seven states filed coordinated public records requests seeking to uncover police excesses in those departments. The records requested include Use of Force reports, records of Taser use, and complaints of racial discrimination and profiling. 
“We’re at the beginning of the investigation,” said Joshua Tom, legal director of the ACLU of Mississippi. “Once we fully investigate, we can decide then what exactly we’re going to do.”
The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division on the same day as ACLU’s launch had announced the closure of its investigations into law enforcement departments in Phoenix, Arizona; Trenton, New Jersey; Memphis, Tennessee; Mount Vernon, New York; Oklahoma City;, Oklahoma; and the state of Louisiana. This came alongside an announcement that its lawsuits against the Louisville, Kentucky, and Minneapolis police departments were going to be dismissed. An investigation into the Lexington, Mississippi, Police Department had been concluded, also, but no consent decree was issued.
In February, the Civil Rights Division had announced that it was pausing all litigation – notably an announcement that did not impact federal oversight of the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department as the investigation into it had only been opened, not concluded, and not accompanied by litigation. 
The Rankin County Sheriff’s Department did not respond to a request for comment. This article will be updated if they respond. 
“The purpose of the Seven States Campaign is to try to fill the gap that the Department of Justice under President Trump has left by abandoning the eight investigations that were identified last week,” Tom said. 
The Justice Department is yet to confirm if it is ceasing its patterns and practices investigation into the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department in Mississippi, which was opened in 2024, the year after five deputies from the department, who were part of a self-described “Goon Squad” went to prison for their role in the torture of two Black men – one of whom they shot in the mouth.
Tom said that accountability could take various forms, such as consent decrees, damage awards and settlements for victims, and for officers who have engaged in misconduct to lose their jobs. 
“Policing is obviously an important public service. It’s also important that when police do their jobs that they respect people’s civil and constitutional rights, and to the extent that they’re not doing that – such as with the Goon Squad – that they be held accountable.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/28094225/IMG_0260.jpeg,,,2025-05-28 11:07:49.178601

(Dean Hanson/Albuquerque Journal)New Mexico lawmakers said Tuesday they plan to investigate more reforms for the state’s troubled child welfare agency in advance of next year’s legislative session, pointing to the recent tragedy of a 16-year old foster child’s suicide as a catalyst for further action.
The Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee convened at the Roundhouse for the first meeting of the interim, which included a presentation on recent reforms to the Children, Youth & Families Department lawmakers passed in the 2025 Legislative session. Specifically, House Bill 5 created an Office of the Child Advocate, which will be administratively attached to the state Department of Justice.
Tuesday’s hearing also exposed continued tension over the management of CYFD. The troubled agency has faced increased scrutiny over rising costs of settlements for maltreatment and deaths of children in custody from years past, as well as the housing of children in offices, which have included incidents of injury from private security guards. New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez in April announced an investigation into the April death. In a recent interview with Source, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who has clashed with the AG over CYFD, said the agency intends to abide with the Legislature’s reforms “in a robust and cooperative manner.”
Sen. Joe Cervantes (D-Las Cruces), who co-chairs the interim committee with Rep. Christine Chandler (D-Los Alamos), said New Mexico was failing to protect children in state custody which he called “our most important, sacred responsibility.” 
“We’re not saving lives, we have children who are dying on our watch,” he said Tuesday.
Cervantes alluded to Jaydun Garcia, the 16-year old who died by suicide in congregate care in April, but also mentioned a second case: “I cannot go into detail, that we had another suicide: a young woman who was pregnant at the time in our state custody.”
CYFD spokesperson Jessica Preston said she could not corroborate Cervantes’ statement.
“State and federal confidentiality laws strictly limit what the Children, Youth, and Families Department can confirm or disclose about individual cases. We are only authorized to release information when it is determined that abuse or neglect caused a child’s death,” Preston said in a written statement. “Accordingly, no information can be provided.”
CYFD was not invited to testify at today’s meeting, both Cervantes and CYFD confirmed, with Preston noting that the agenda item related to the new office attached to the NMDOJ. 
CYFD Cabinet Secretary Teresa Casados “has said on many occasions that the Department welcomes oversight, and we look forward to collaborating with the new Office of Child Advocate to serve the children, youth, and families of New Mexico when it is up and running,” Preston wrote.
Lujan Grisham line-item vetoed $1 million earmarked for Office of the Child Advocate from the budget, but allowed both a $650,000 appropriation the New Mexico Department of Justice to set up the office and $300,000 for CYFD to hire additional staff to respond to inquiries from the advocate to remain in the budget. 
Attorneys for NMDOJ said they would be able to stand up the office with the $650,000 appropriation, but would seek further funding in 2026.
“That sets us on a pretty good entry point,” said Billy Jimenez, the deputy attorney general for civil affairs at NMDOJ. “From a purely administrative standpoint, we can provide staff to assist whether that’s paralegals or clerical staff, HR staff. But I think, at the end of the day, we want to make sure that that office maintains… independence [and] their own paralegals and staff over time.”
Further decisions about staffing the office will be made once the child advocate is in the role Jimenez said. 
The state is still in the process of appointing a statutorily required state child advocate selection committee, which is required by law to meet before Sept. 1 to consider recommendations for the state child advocate. Within 30 days of meeting, the committee is supposed to recommend a short list of candidates to the governor, who will make the appointment.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CYFD-1024x522.jpeg,,,2025-05-28 11:07:49.178601

While the city plans to deploy more than $5 million to youth public safety efforts, and the state funds a robust set of programs aimed at at-risk youth and violence prevention, the US Department of Justice under President Trump has concluded that such programs no longer further “program goals or agency priorities.”
The post Boston stays the course, despite[...]","IT’S BECOME A rite of spring in Boston, as certain as Lilac Sunday at the Arnold Arboretum and the return of swan boats to the Public Garden: A press briefing on city plans for promoting public safety during the hot summer months when trouble ticks up with the temperature.  But the annual anti-crime announcement feels a bit like the mayoral warnings issued in advance of a big winter storm or blast of arctic air in January: They are both meant to show that the city is on the job and taking the issue seriously, but the details that are shared invariably have a familiar quality to them.  After all, there are only so many ways to warn people to stay off the roads during a blizzard, or to remind them to lend a hand to any neighbor in need of help during a storm. By the same token, when it comes to efforts to keep a lid on gun violence and other urban ills, Boston’s yearly announcement inevitably follows a well-worn theme.  In a city that has earned national reputation over decades for its low homicide rate and comprehensive approach to public safety and gun violence, there’s no sense in reinventing the wheel.  When Mayor Michelle Wu, Police Commissioner Michael Cox, and other city leaders gathered at a Dorchester park Tuesday morning for their annual briefing, they largely stuck to the script that has driven Boston’s public safety thinking since the 1990s: The police will be vigilant in focusing on the small number of people driving violence in Boston, while various other city departments will be doing all they can to engage young people in positive pursuits, especially those at risk of getting pulled into trouble on the streets.  It is an “all of government” effort, said Wu, highlighting everything from summer youth jobs to expanded evening programming for young people this summer that is aimed at complementing police work so that Boston is “continuing to put in place strategies, the resources, and the leadership to continue to be the safest major city in the country.”  This year, however, “all of government” doesn’t include all levels of government.  While the city plans to deploy more than $5 million to youth public safety efforts, and the state funds a robust set of programs aimed at at-risk youth and violence prevention, the US Department of Justice under President Trump has concluded that such programs no longer further “program goals or agency priorities.” That was the language used in a form letter emailed last month to more than 350 nonprofits across the county, informing them that DOJ was terminating grants worth a total of $500 million for violence reduction efforts, victims’ services, reentry programming, and other public safety initiatives under its Office of Justice Programming.  Roca, a Chelsea-based nonprofit that does violence prevention outreach in five Massachusetts cities, including Boston, was notified that three of its grants, totaling $6 million, were being terminated with about $4 million still unexpended. It means 19 open positions in Massachusetts won’t be filled, and another 19 staff members in the state will be laid off.  Those on the frontlines are having a hard time squaring the cuts – and the message in the termination notices that their work doesn’t align with administration priorities — with the relentless drumbeat of President Trump’s rhetoric about crime-ravaged US cities and the need to do something about it.  “Despite what the letter says, we actually believe our priorities and our work is perfectly aligned with the administration’s goals and objectives in terms of wanting to prevent violent crime, protect victims of trafficking, and better coordinate efforts with law enforcement at all levels,” said Dwight Robson, executive vice president for operations at Roca.   The DOJ has not provided any further rationale for the cuts to anti-violence programs, which come as Trump takes aim at a range of initiatives he has labeled as part of the left-wing “woke” agenda.  Speaking after Tuesday’s public safety briefing, Isaac Yablo, the mayor’s senior advisor for community safety, said, “There’s nothing quote-unquote woke about saving lives.” Yablo said proven anti-violence strategies are “not anything that should be politicized.”  Robson said Roca, which focuses on the highest risk young people, most of whom have been involved in gangs and violence, thinks it should demonstrate its value through rigorous data collection and analysis. Last year, Robson said, Roca worked with 312 young people in Boston, 88 percent of whom were gang involved and 82 percent of whom had a history of arrest. Among those who Roca has worked with for two years, 80 percent have had no new arrests. Boston officials say the combination of law enforcement strategy, city human services programs, and community-focused efforts are behind the extraordinary safety record the city has. Last year, Boston recorded just 24 homicides, the lowest number since 1957 and a fraction of the number seen in other US cities of similar size.  The DOJ termination notices told grant recipients they could file an appeal of the decision within 30 days, something Roca did last week. Robson said there is no clear timeline or process, however, for the petition to keep the funding. Meanwhile, a national class action lawsuit was filed last week against the cuts by four organizations challenging the legality of ending the grants.  Yablo said the city employs about 20 people doing outreach work to the most violence-prone young people, with another 30 or so employed by community organizations such as Roca. “For the community-based organizations that we work with day to day, it’s devastating,” he said of the federal cuts. “It’ll definitely make the challenge harder,” he said of the effort to keep the violence down over the summer.  Cox, the city police commissioner, was a young officer in the 1990s when Boston developed strategies credited with driving a steep drop in gun violence. Cox has a decidedly low-key manner, and demurred when asked directly about the federal cuts.  “I like to keep things in my lane,” he said.  But Cox made clear his belief in the multi-pronged approach to public safety. “From our perspective, all of these things are important to reduce crime in the city,” he said of everything from the police focus on gang members to the “partnerships” he said the department has with community groups and deploying of social workers at district police stations who work to steer those not involved in serious offenses to job-training programs and other services.   “We have a long history of it, and it’s shown success,” he said. “So, I don’t know why we would ever get away from that.”  The post Boston stays the course, despite Trump yanking violence prevention grants appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8257-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-28 11:07:49.178601

CHICAGO — A single mother in Kenwood changed jobs in order to find child care – even though it meant possibly working fewer hours and less pay.
A couple in Park Ridge has paid so much for care they haven’t been able to start a college fund for their toddler.
A family in Lemont delayed buying a home and decided against having as many children as they once hoped for.
Child care has become one of the biggest line items in a family’s budget, with its costs growing faster than any other household expense in recent decades.

It forces parents to make tough decisions – ultimately stalling the chance for families to advance financially and professionally, according to dozens of interviews and responses to an Illinois Answers Project survey of child care workers and families.
“We’re at the mercy of child care,” said one working mother, who is pregnant with her third child and expects she and her husband will pay $54,000 for child care in the coming year. It’s roughly a quarter of their annual income.
The financial health of the child care industry is inextricably linked to the larger economy, with both short- and long-term impacts. Access to affordable, reliable child care has the immediate benefit of allowing parents to work or attend school, providing a stable workforce for businesses and putting more cash in the pockets of young families.
The Child Care Assistance Program, also known as CCAP, is the largest government child care subsidy. It significantly reduces monthly costs for families and it can be an essential source of income for child care businesses, particularly in Cook County.
Yet it doesn’t provide enough relief for many families and providers, an Illinois Answers Project investigation found.

Illinois continues to put limits on CCAP far stricter than federal recommendations. These restrictions exclude up to 130,000 children, who could be eligible under national guidelines, from receiving support, according to the most recent estimates of Illinois’ program.
The state also caps payments for some child care providers at rates that are near the lowest in the nation.
These restrictions, studies show, can impact a family’s ability to provide stability, pursue higher paying jobs and set up their children for lifelong success.
The number of child care providers that participate in CCAP has also plummeted in recent years, the investigation found.
Gov. JB Pritzker has sought to make Illinois a leader in providing accessible early childhood services, investing hundreds of millions of dollars a year into programs to improve provider pay, grow child care availability and expand access to public preschool.
Since taking office in 2019, the Pritzker administration has instituted some changes to expand access to the CCAP subsidy.
“Looking ahead, the state will continue to work diligently to equitably expand and improve our child care system for Illinois’ families,” Summer Griffith, a public information officer for the Illinois Department of Human Services – the state agency that oversees CCAP – wrote in an email to Illinois Answers.
But these improvements are still far from offsetting effects of the drastic cuts to the program made a decade ago. And the new rules instituted by Pritzker for qualifying for the program are still stricter than those in many other states, limiting program access primarily to families that earn below an income threshold that some say is far too low – particularly in expensive areas like Chicago.
Depending on the type of care for their infant, parents spend between a median of $900 to $1,200 each month on child care – which can be up to 15% of the median family income in Cook County. Parents told Illinois Answers they spend more.
And there is no guarantee child care spots will be available, even in Chicago where there are many more providers than in most rural areas in the state. One 2023 estimate found there were only enough formal child care slots, at places like centers and licensed home care, in Cook County to care for about 25% of the children who need them.
“Searching, navigating, and finding childcare is a nightmare,” said Breann Cornell, a mother of three in northern Cook County.
“It really is something affecting whether people decide to have children or not because it’s not just if we want one, it’s if we can afford one.”
The struggle to qualify
This spring, Tasia Powell gave birth to a baby girl, Jai. She started looking for affordable child care before her daughter was even born, but wasn’t able to find many realistic options.
Powell works at a Chicago nonprofit that provides homelessness services, where she said she earns a few hundred dollars over the limit to qualify for subsidized child care, including CCAP. Yet without any help, Powell said the financial burden will be significant.

“You want people to work … but then you work too much. And if you work less, then you can’t afford your actual other bills,” she said.
“That puts a lot of people in a bad circumstance.”
Powell’s situation is not unique.
Parents navigating today’s child care options, and the programs to help pay for them, face a complicated landscape of differing eligibility rules, which can sometimes lock them out of much-needed assistance.
CCAP, for example, is one of the most widely used child care support programs across the country.
Federal rules state that a family can earn no more than 85% of their state’s median income in order to initially qualify for CCAP. But states are allowed to set their own lower thresholds, an option Illinois officials have taken advantage of for years.
Pritzker has increased CCAP initial eligibility twice during his tenure as governor, most recently in 2022. The state also expanded eligibility in other ways by including families with parents deployed in the military – regardless of income – and excluding other sources of income like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, child support and social security payments, among other programs.
But it still falls far short of federal recommendations, excluding tens of thousands of potentially eligible Illinois children from receiving support.
Today, an Illinois family of three can only earn up to $4,841 a month, or about 61% of the state’s median income to be initially accepted to the program. Under the maximum federal rules, that number would be $6,704.
Many families, providers and advocates argue that the current income limit is still far too low, pointing out that the rules don’t take into account where a family is located in the state. Families living downstate have the same income cutoffs as those in Cook County, where the cost of living is up to 30% higher.
An IDHS spokeswoman pointed to how Illinois’ CCAP income limit as a percent of the state’s median income is higher than some neighboring Midwest states.
Among all states, Illinois ranks 25th in the country for its income eligibility level for a family of three.
The spokeswoman also said that if Illinois were to expand eligibility rules beyond what the budget could currently accommodate, the state would need to institute a waitlist for families to receive the subsidy – which could “inject inequity.”
Without a waitlist, “all eligible families can receive the help they need when they need it,” the spokeswoman said.
Many other states also refrain from using wait lists for CCAP services, which can create more administrative burdens for government agencies to track and keep up-to-date. But states that do use wait lists often guarantee services for certain families or prioritize which families receive services faster.

But the current income restrictions still leave families feeling trapped.
One parent wrote to the health department in 2021 about how their family was “barely making it.” It was one among the dozens of emails Illinois Answers obtained through a public records request that showed the difficulties families and providers face with the subsidy.
“Being part of the lower middle class is really affecting us,” they wrote, “I just started working and because they use our gross income they say we make too much for daycare help.
“We are barely staying afloat and can’t afford for me to quit or afford for me to stay working.”
Pritzker’s increases to the CCAP initial income eligibility levels have created a positive, though moderate, impact. Total enrollment has increased each year after the income threshold increase in 2022, when the state began recovering from the pandemic.
A March 2025 report by Chapin Hall, a research group at the University of Chicago, found that in 2023, 42% of eligible Illinois children ages 0-2 and 48% of children ages 3-5 were enrolled in CCAP.
However, the total number of children enrolled in CCAP  in fiscal year 2024 was still down roughly 18% compared to 2015, when the total number of children served was at its highest in the last decade, according to Illinois Answers analysis.

IDHS officials, in response, said their internal data of certificate payments shows that CCAP participation has returned to 2015 levels – in terms of the monthly averages of children served by the subsidy. There was a monthly average of 137,968 for the calendar year 2015. As of January to April 2025, the monthly average of CCAP enrollment has been 143,006, according to IDHS officials.
Former Gov. Bruce Rauner made drastic cuts to Illinois’ income limit in July 2015, in which it was estimated at the time that only 10% of once eligible families could qualify. The program lost about one-third of its participating children from 2015 to fall 2018.
Another common problem cited by parents is looking for a job – but needing child care in order to do so.
Parents need to work or attend school in order to be eligible for CCAP. But many parents report struggling to find the time to interview or search for jobs without already having reliable child care.
During the pandemic, Illinois temporarily waived these rules, allowing parents to receive CCAP services for up to three months while they searched for a job or educational opportunity.
The initiative was widely praised as a success. One survey of participating Cook County parents  found two-thirds of respondents reported getting a job during their three-month windows and another 10% enrolled in school.
But in July 2024, the state chose to end the special allowance, citing the expiration of federal COVID funding. State officials estimated 8,400 families used this service from October 2021 to June 2024.
A Mason City foster mother, who cares for her young relatives in central Illinois, has been out of work as a waitress. She said it has been frustrating to be told she needs to get a job to qualify for CCAP – without first getting the child care she desperately needs.
“You get pre-approved for a home loan,” she said. “Why can’t you get pre-approved for child care?”
Falling off an economic cliff
Once a family is enrolled in CCAP, they must follow strict rules to remain in the program, including keeping their income level below the state’s redetermination limit – a figure slightly higher than the maximum income they could earn to first qualify for the program.
For some families this means that getting a raise – even a small one – could leave them financially worse-off than before.
“One penny over the amount, and you fall off – so it’s like falling off a cliff,” said Kimberly Bianchini, owner at Advance Preschool in Hoffman Estates.

The University of Chicago’s Inclusive Economy Lab found a small increase in earnings could cost families access to CCAP, leaving them with less money overall and making it nearly impossible to afford child care while also paying for other basic life necessities.
Researchers studied CCAP to understand the barriers to economic mobility, using a Cook County family of three – one adult with two young children – as an example.
A small raise from $54,000 to $55,000 could mean this hypothetical family loses access to CCAP, according to the analysis, resulting in a net loss of about $25,000 per year.
Eligibility restrictions, researchers found, often make it more difficult for participants to increase their salaries or have enough in savings to make “meaningful investments in upward mobility.”
In Cook County, a family with a 2-year-old in a child care center spends nearly 15% of their income on child care costs. This is more than double what the federal government says is an affordable amount.
According to one estimate, it isn’t until a Cook County family begins to earn close to $200,000 a year – or 900% of the federal poverty level – that the percentage of their income dedicated to child care starts to reach a level the federal government deems affordable.
But those families say otherwise.
Interviews with Cook County parents who make that much or more said child care costs have become so burdensome that they are held at economic standstills and it impacts their ability to secure their kids’ financial futures.
These parents, some of whom now out earn the middle class families they were raised in, said the cost of child care for multiple children can be upwards of $55,000 a year. They said they were unable to stow away money for their children’s futures and have no disposable income.
“My wife’s parents and my parents, because they grew up so differently, they’re consistently looking at us like: ‘You guys are doing great, you don’t need help,’” said one Evanston mother of two young children.
“We’re not though,” she said. “This isn’t the world you grew up in.”
A system that runs ‘on the backs’ of child care providers
Each school day, as owner of Imani Children’s Academy, Marianne Powell dressed up professionally.
“I dress up because this is my job,” she would tell parents when she took over the center from her late mother. “This is my career. I want you to take me seriously.”
Running the business was a challenge. Historically, a majority of the center’s Roseland families were below the poverty level, Powell said, estimating that 75% to 80% of the business’ funding came from CCAP.
It all took a “nosedive” during the pandemic, she said. Kids didn’t return. Enrollment dropped from about 30 students to just five. Staff quit.
Powell closed the center in 2023 after three decades in business. She enrolled in school to become an esthetician.
“I love kids, but I’m a business,” she said. “I need to get paid.”

﻿﻿﻿

In interviews with more than a dozen current and former Cook County providers, many like Powell remarked on how difficult it is to maintain a business when the child care industry’s economic model is fundamentally flawed. The costs parents pay – though exorbitant – often still fail to offset how expensive it is to provide quality care in line with important health and safety standards.
Providers, in turn, are forced to keep their rates artificially low in order to maintain enough clients to stay in business, even if that means they take home little-to-no wages. For example, to keep costs down, home-based providers sometimes forgo paying themselves set salaries, instead adjusting their take-home pay month by month when operation costs are too high and tuition payments too low.
“They’re not funded for the true cost of care,” Marcia Stoll, assistant director of research for Illinois Action for Children, said about child care businesses. “It’s the child care workers that are being punished. It’s like we’re running this system on their backs because they’re so underpaid and because you can’t charge parents more because they just can’t afford any more.”

An Illinois Answers’ analysis of state child care data found the total number of providers that accept CCAP payments dropped by more than 60% in the past decade.
The state determines how much CCAP subsidizes the amount parents pay by completing a study of current child care prices and availability across different age groups and areas.
Federal guidelines recommend states use that information to set payment amounts that would reasonably allow a parent to afford 75% of the available child care options in their area. The goal is to give CCAP parents the same ability as parents without subsidies to choose a high-quality option that fits their particular needs.
Illinois is among the bottom 15 states when it comes to the number of choices the CCAP subsidy provides families in terms center-based care. The state’s CCAP payments to center-based care providers can reportedly only cover 50% or less of available options across all age groups. For preschoolers specifically, the subsidy rate can only cover 41% of the tuition for center-based providers – a rate so low it violates federal equal access provisions.
Illinois is within the top 10 in the nation for licensed family child care for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers.
An IDHS spokeswoman said center-based care tends to be more expensive, adding that a majority of CCAP providers are license-exempt family child care providers. This category cares for three or less children.

In Cook County, the subsidy amount fails to meet the 75% goal for all types of providers and age groups and the numbers are even lower in some northern Illinois suburbs, according to the state’s most recent survey.
However, an IDHS spokeswoman said family child care homes in Illinois have received rate increases since the most recent market rate survey.
In some rural areas of Illinois, where child care is typically harder to find but much cheaper, CCAP subsidies are reportedly high enough to purchase nearly all child care options in the market.
Some providers complained of payment delays, which they said put their businesses at even greater financial jeopardy. While new federal rules require states to change the way they pay providers to create more stability, Illinois requested a waiver to allow the state until 2026 to comply.
“I can’t wait so long” one person wrote to the state in January about delayed payments, “my bills will get shut off and my landlord will make me move so please help me.”
Within the overall decline of CCAP providers, there is also a change in the type of providers available for families, as the number of home-based providers dropped significantly while the number of larger child care centers remained relatively stable.
Some families may prefer family-home providers over centers, which typically care for smaller groups of children in more personal settings and tend to offer flexible schedules, such as late-night, early-morning or overnight care. Forty percent of Cook County CCAP parents potentially need such options, according to an Illinois Action for Children survey. In contrast, other families may prefer larger centers with more resources and more structured environments.
This decline in home-based CCAP providers means fewer options for parents to select the best type of provider for their needs.

This was the case for Denika Berry, a Kenwood mom to two children with special needs. She had difficulty finding CCAP providers that could cover her overnight shift at a fast food restaurant. It forced Berry to change shifts, which meant fewer hours and less income.
Berry said she relied on a patchwork of providers, at times being forced to pay out of pocket for a non-CCAP provider. She said she often had to leave work early to pick up her children for alleged behavior reasons or short staffing. She worried she could lose her job.
“With me constantly leaving work,” she said, “just imagine – my check is shorter.”
‘I can’t wait to be liberated from child care costs’
Last June, at a Rogers Park child care center called Eyes on the Future Childhood Development Center, Pritzker signed legislation that he said would usher in a new era for the state – the creation of the new Department of Early Childhood.
Life, the governor said, will become “simpler, better and fairer” for families with the new department. CCAP will be housed there, in addition to other early childhood programs that were once dispersed at three different agencies.
It’s all part of Pritzker’s efforts to make Illinois first in the country for childhood services through Smart Start Illinois, which the administration says will improve child care provider pay and expand access to accessible, high-quality options for families.
Smart Start aims to address the childcare workforce shortage by offering new grants to providers in hopes of increasing wages.
Nearly every child care service owner interviewed by Illinois Answers was complimentary about Pritzker – in part because they felt he was the first governor in recent history to prioritize early childhood services.
These grants, they said, are a welcome infusion for those who are able to get it but they also noted that the eligibility restrictions make it difficult for Chicago providers in particular to access them.
But they are only available to providers whose only form of public assistance is from CCAP payments. In Chicago, providers rely on a range of public support options, such as Head Start or Preschool For All funding, much more frequently than their downstate counterparts.
City providers are then faced with a choice: drop their other forms of public assistance in favor of Smart Start grants, which are dependent on annual budget renewals by the state legislature, or forgo the new funds altogether.
An IDHS spokesperson said the state “continues to gather feedback and adapt the program to best serve providers and families.” The feedback IDHS said they received included offering a wage of $17-$19 per hour to recruit and retain staff, and making the grants “stable, predictable, and transparent.” These business owners didn’t want to receive the grant one year and then lose it the next year.
Providers also suggested that the grants should be “prioritized for child care programs with limited access to additional resources.” This is why the grants are targeted only toward providers who receive CCAP funding, the spokesperson said.
For those who don’t qualify, the hit is compounded by the exodus of 4-year-olds from private child care facilities, which created a massive disruption to a common business model among Chicago providers, they said.

In recent years, the city expanded its public school system to create enough slots for every 4-year-old to attend free preschool. But while this creates a clear financial benefit to parents, child care providers outside of the public school system say it is a devastating blow to their operations.
Caring for preschool-aged children is generally much less expensive than infants and toddlers, who have lower adult-to-child ratio requirements and therefore incur bigger staffing costs. Many providers have traditionally taken on larger numbers of 3- and 4-year olds to offset these expenses and stay financially afloat.
For parents, the change alleviates the cost of an entire year of child care, but if providers don’t find a way to recoup the loss, it could mean more closures and fewer options for families with younger children.
Natalie Reillo, an Austin mother of two, is considering sending her 3-year-old son to a CPS preschool in the next year. She has been on CCAP for the past decade, first for her almost 10 -year-old daughter and now for her 3-year-old son.
Reillo has had a positive experience with the government subsidy. She estimates child care would take up nearly all of her $3,400 monthly salary without it. But with the subsidy, she pays about $240 a month, allowing her to better afford her other bills and household expenses.
Still, the idea of moving to free child care when her son turns four is just too appealing, she said.
“I can’t wait to be liberated from daycare costs,” she said.

Goldstein Treasury Building in Annapolis. (Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)A second bond-rating agency has reaffirmed its highest credit rating for Maryland, helping offset a downgrade by a third agency just weeks before a scheduled $1.7 billion bond sale by the state.
The AAA rating from Standard & Poor’s follows a similar rating from Fitch two weeks ago. Standard & Poor’s — one of three firms that Maryland hires to rate its creditworthiness in advance of annual bond sales — issued its rating with a stable outlook for the state, but also with a warning.
“The stable outlook reflects our expectation that the state will make timely adjustments to achieve a structural balance and adequate cash reserves by proactively managing economic and budgetary risks that arise,” the report said.
The back-to-back AAA ratings from Fitch and Standard & Poor’s help take the sting out of Moody’s report, which downgraded the state from Aaa for the first time in more than 50 years, to Aa1. But state officials note that Moody’s has downgraded several other jurisdictions in the region recently, and say the latest ratings prove that Maryland’s financial health is strong.
“The Fitch and S&P ratings reaffirmed what we have been saying all along about the state’s sound fiscal management and ability to adapt to an ever-changing federal bureaucracy,” state Treasurer Dereck Davis said through a spokesperson Wednesday morning.
The report comes before a June 11 sale of nearly $1.7 billion in bonds. Money raised in the sale will be used by the state to pay for large infrastructure projects, including school construction.
Ratings issued by the three agencies — Fitch, Moody’s, and Standard & Poor’s — determine what interest rate the state — and taxpayers — pay for borrowing money. The latest rating in many ways is similar to one issued by Fitch, including words of caution that Standard & Poor’s could downgrade the state under certain conditions.
Davis: ‘To hell with Moody’s’ following its downgrade of state credit

“We could revise our outlook to negative or lower the rating within the two-year outlook period if the state significantly relies on nonrecurring measures to balance its budget, draws down reserves to a level that is unlikely to be meaningfully replenished, or increases debt and other liability metrics to a level that no longer aligns with the current rating,” the firm wrote in its report.
“We could also lower the rating if the state’s overall wealth and income, employment, and population levels materially trend in a persistently unfavorable direction due to significant weakness in the government sector,” it said.
Such cautions are common from bond rating agencies.
For decades, Maryland enjoyed AAA ratings from all three agencies: Standard & Poor’s gave Maryland its first AAA rating in 1961, followed by Moody’s in 1973 and Fitch in 1993. Those ratings continued every year until this spring, making Maryland one of a handful of states to boast the highest ratings of all three.
Political leaders in the state touted the triple AAA ratings as proof of strong fiscal management. Others said the ratings reflected another reality: a willingness among Maryland’s leaders — mostly Democrats — to raise taxes to pay its debts.
The ratings period this year was more tense. Few acted as if the state was guaranteed the highest ratings of all three, with Moody’s of the most concern.
The firm, in its 2024 report, had reaffirmed its Aaa rating for Maryland, but downgraded the state’s outlook from stable to negative. In March, Moody’s issued a report naming Maryland the state at highest risk for economic problems from Trump administration cuts to federal budgets and jobs.
When the state met with the three firms earlier this month, Moody’s was the only one to schedule an in-person visit. It was attended by the governor, the Senate president and House speaker, an unusual occurrence and an acknowledgement of the seriousness with which state officials were treating the situation.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
State officials said in the days after the meeting that they believed they had addressed the budgetary concerns from the 2024 report.
But within days of that meeting — a quick turnaround that surprised many in state government — Moody’s had downgraded Maryland to Aa1 with a stable outlook. Moody’s appeared to put more weight on federal actions and the reliance of the state’s economy on federal employees, contractors and agencies.
Officials — all Democrats — including Davis, Gov. Wes Moore, Comptroller Brooke Lierman, Senate President Bill Ferguson and House Speaker Adrienne Jones issued a joint statement decrying the rating downgrade.
Their statement blamed Republican President Donald Trump, who has focused the first months of his second term on the elimination of federal agencies and draconian budget and employee reductions.
A week ago, Davis, whose office oversees the issuing of bonds, said “to hell with Moody’s,” and implied that the state may no longer need three bond rating reviews. Moody’s — which is paid more than $200,000 annually for its review — was potentially on the chopping block.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_2528-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-28 11:07:49.178601

(Photo by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)A recent column in the Duluth News Tribune argued that renewables alone cannot sustain our nation’s energy demands, suggesting that fossil fuels must remain central to our power system. 
But this argument ignores the real issue: our grid isn’t built for the energy transition we need. The problem isn’t renewables — it’s an outdated and inadequate transmission system. Wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric and energy storage are already proving to the world that they can effectively power our homes, businesses and communities, all while helping our economy, protecting our health, and keeping our environment clean. 
A common myth about clean energy is that it isn’t reliable because the sun doesn’t always shine, and the wind doesn’t always blow. But clean energy is more than just solar and wind — it includes geothermal and  hydroelectric, and can be supplemented with energy storage, all of which provide steady power. Geothermal energy taps into underground heat, operating 24/7 to supply electricity and heating, while hydroelectric power from rivers and dams generates constant energy. New battery storage and smart grid technology help balance energy use by storing extra power when it’s available and distributing it when needed. A diverse mix of clean energy sources creates a more stable and reliable energy system — something fossil fuels alone can’t guarantee.
Extreme weather events, rising fuel costs, and grid failures have proven that fossil fuels don’t ensure reliability. In 2021, Texas — one of the largest natural gas producers in the country — suffered catastrophic blackouts when record-low temperatures caused gas pipelines to freeze and wells to seize up, choking off critical fuel supply just as demand for heating and electricity spiked. This cascade of failures left millions without power for days, leading to hundreds of deaths from hypothermia, carbon monoxide poisoning, and medical device failures. The crisis exposed the dangers of relying on a centralized, fossil-fuel-heavy grid in an era of increasingly extreme weather. 
During the same storm, communities like Two Harbors, Minnesota, faced extreme natural gas price spikes, where prices surged from about $5 to over $200 per thousand cubic feet, leaving some residents with utility bills double or triple their usual amounts. These problems aren’t going away. Last year, rolling blackouts hit parts of the Midwest and South as coal and gas plants struggled to keep up with severe cold. If fossil fuels were the answer to grid stability, we wouldn’t see these reliability and affordability crises play out repeatedly. 
Instead of doubling down on outdated energy sources, we need to modernize our grid by expanding and strengthening transmission lines, reducing congestion, and improving efficiency. A better-connected grid allows power to flow where and when it’s needed — whether it’s geothermal heat, hydro from the Northwest, or stored solar and wind energy. The key to a reliable and affordable energy future isn’t sticking to the past — it’s investing in a smarter, stronger grid.
This isn’t just theory — it’s happening now. The Midcontinent Independent System Operator recently approved a $10.3 billion transmission expansion that will improve reliability, lower costs, and integrate the next generation of power sources. Grid-enhancing technologies and advanced storage solutions are making renewables more reliable than ever.
Some argue that renewables are too expensive, but the facts tell a different story. According to the International Energy Agency, accelerating the clean energy transition could cut overall energy system operation costs by more than half over the next decade, saving governments, businesses, and households billions. Clean energy technologies — such as wind, solar, and energy-efficient appliances — are already cost-competitive over their lifetimes, while electric vehicles often lead to long-term savings despite sometimes higher upfront costs.
But unlocking these financial benefits requires strategic upfront investments, particularly in emerging economies where funding access remains limited. Meanwhile, fossil fuel subsidies reached $620 billion in 2023 alone, artificially distorting the market and making it harder for clean energy to compete. The IEA’s report emphasizes that a faster transition to renewables will stabilize energy costs, reduce reliance on volatile oil markets, and make electricity the dominant energy source by 2035 — surpassing oil for the first time in history.
The real energy challenge isn’t whether renewables “can cut it.” It’s whether we’re willing to make the smart infrastructure investments needed to ensure a more reliable, affordable, and resilient grid. Clinging to fossil fuels as the only solution ignores both the risks of volatile fuel prices and the opportunity to build a stronger, more modern energy system for all Americans.
It’s time to stop looking backward for energy security. The future is in a smarter, better-connected grid — not just more fossil fuels.

Gov. Bob Ferguson last week signed the state’s new “right to repair” policy into law. The goal of House Bill 1483 is to allow consumers to fix their devices instead of throwing them away and buying new ones.
It was a yearslong effort to get the law approved.
“This is a win for every person in Washington state,” said the bill’s prime sponsor, Rep. Mia Gregerson, D-SeaTac. “We all know that we want to keep our devices longer. We want to be able to connect with our loved ones.”
In 2021, the Federal Trade Commission reported that consumers with broken electronics don’t have much choice but to replace them because repairs require specialized tools, unique parts and inaccessible proprietary software. And those restrictions, the FTC found, disproportionately burden communities of color and low-income communities.
The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these issues as access to technology quickly became increasingly vital.
Apple has since made moves to improve the repairability of its products.
Some companies engage in a practice called “parts pairing” that can make replacing parts of a device impossible. Washington’s new law would largely outlaw this tactic.
Starting Jan. 1, 2026, the law will require manufacturers to make tools, parts and documentation needed for diagnostics and maintenance available to independent repair businesses. The requirement applies to digital electronics, like computers, cellphones and appliances, that were first sold in Washington after July 1, 2021.
Manufacturers won’t be able to use parts that inhibit repairs.
The state attorney general’s office could enforce violations of the new law under the Consumer Protection Act.
Critics argued the bill could harm businesses’ reputations if repairs aren’t completed correctly, and potentially leave users’ personal information unsecured. But some tech giants backed the legislation.
Google, for example, thanked the governor for signing it.
“This is a significant win for consumers, and will provide them more affordable ways to repair their devices while reducing waste,” a spokesperson said in an email.
Microsoft said its “Surface PCs are among the most repairable in their class — and we view this law as a meaningful step toward reducing waste, empowering consumers, and advancing a more circular economy.”
State lawmakers across the country have introduced similar legislation in recent years. Five states now have laws on the books: California, Colorado, Minnesota, New York and Oregon. Massachusetts and Maine have such laws focused on car repairs.
Southwest Washington U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Democrat, has led the charge in Congress for national right to repair laws focused on cars, electronics and military equipment. Before joining Congress, Gluesenkamp Perez co-owned an auto repair shop.
Late last month, the U.S. Army, at the direction of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, announced it would seek “right to repair” provisions in all of its contracts.
Ferguson also signed a similar repair bill focused on wheelchairs and mobility scooters. Both measures had strong bipartisan support.
[Editor’s note: North Carolina lawmakers have introduced different versions of “right to repair” legislation in recent years, but the proposals have not gained traction. Two bills from the 2025 session — House Bill 460 and House Bill 938 — would expand the right for, respectively, medical equipment and digital electronics, but neither was heard in committee prior to the May 8 crossover deadline.]

Police said they 'do not believe this was a random act of violence.',"A shooting at Brass Mill Center in Waterbury on Tuesday afternoon has left five people injured, the authorities said.
No fatalities were reported.
Police were called to the mall around 4:40 p.m. following a report of a disturbance. Officers found “several” people with gunshot wounds in the central area of the mall.
Victims were transported to local hospitals.

Officials said there was no immediate threat to the public.
“We do not believe this was a random act of violence,” said Fernando Spagnolo, the Waterbury police chief. “We believe this started as a conflict and it escalated.”
Waterbury police say they’re working with various law enforcement agencies; state police said they have units at the scene to assist.
An investigation was underway Tuesday evening as officials gathered video and digital evidence, while others searched the mall store by store.
Spagnolo said that mall staff and guests did “an incredible job” in keeping themselves safe and mitigated “what could have been a really bad incident.”

“It was really amazing to watch people in this time of crisis to keep cool heads and follow plans and shelter in place,” he said.
Spagnolo added: “These acts occur, unfortunately, it’s the society we live in at times.”
Gov. Ned Lamont said Tuesday night he was grateful to law enforcement, “who acted swiftly,” and that “hearts break” for the Waterbury community and those affected by the shooting.
The mall, Lamont said, is “a place where everyone should feel safe.”

In a lawsuit filed in federal court Tuesday, the U.S. Justice Department said the lack of driver’s license numbers, partial Social Security numbers, or unique identifying numbers connected to some voter registration records violates the Help America Vote Act. 
The Justice Department wants the elections board to ask all voters who do not have the proper numbers in the statewide database for the information. The elections board is to attach unique numbers to voters who do not have those other identifiers. 
The allegations in the DOJ lawsuit mirror an issue Republican Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin raised as he tried to overturn Democratic Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs’ election victory by throwing out votes. 
The DOJ claims also mirror a state Republican Party and Republican National Committee federal lawsuit contending that people who do not have the government digits connected to their electronic file are not legally registered to vote. It’s unclear how many registrations don’t have the numbers, but the GOP sought to purge about 225,000 voters over the issue. 
The elections board did not do enough to remedy the problem of missing identification numbers when conservative activist Carol Snow raised it in a complaint in 2023, the DOJ lawsuit says.  
The state was using voter registration forms that made it look like providing a driver’s license number or partial Social Security number was optional. In some cases, the information was not typed into the database even when voters did supply it. 
The board, then controlled by Democrats, voted unanimously to make the recommended changes to the voter registration form, but “declined to take sufficient steps to cure their continuing violations” by contacting voters, the lawsuit says.
Republicans took control of the elections board this month and appointed a Republican executive director. 
In a statement, Executive Director Sam Hayes said: 

“I was only recently notified of this action by the United States Department of Justice.  We are still reviewing the complaint, but the failure to collect the information required by HAVA has been well documented. Rest assured that I am committed to bringing North Carolina into compliance with federal law.
“The voter registration form at the heart of this issue was updated in January 2024. It is available here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/dl.ncsbe.gov/Voter_Registration/NCVoterRegForm_06W.pdf

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)The board in charge of the University of Alaska could grow by one member, if a proposal passed by the Alaska House of Representatives is approved by the state Senate and Gov. Mike Dunleavy next year.
House Bill 10, from Rep. Ashley Carrick, D-Fairbanks, would add a UA faculty member to the university’s board of regents. If enacted, HB 10 would expand the board from 11 members to 12, with the new seat reserved for “a current full-time faculty member who is employed at and has acquired tenure at the University of Alaska Anchorage, the University of Alaska Fairbanks, or the University of Alaska Southeast.”
Speaking on the House floor, Carrick said the addition of a new regent “will provide the  university with a greater ability to fulfill its mission and provide representation to this key stakeholder group.”
Alaska would become the seventh state to have a board seat reserved for a faculty member, Carrick said. Other states have non-voting seats reserved for faculty members.
The board expansion would expire in 2032 unless legislators later vote to permanently extend the new position. 
Under HB 10, the faculty senates of UAA, UAF and UAS would hold elections for two faculty members apiece for the board seat, and the governor would have the final pick. Each member would serve an eight year term.
The Alaska Legislature passed 33 bills during its regular session this year, but HB 10 wasn’t one of them. The House approved it by a 27-13 vote on May 7, but the Senate did not hold a committee hearing for the bill before lawmakers adjourned for the year.
It’s in a prime position to pass the Legislature next year, however; it’s been assigned to just one committee before being presented to the full Senate. In the Senate, the bill is cosponsored by both Republicans and Democrats, including one member of the Senate’s Republican minority caucus, Sen. Mike Cronk, R-Tok. 
The bill didn’t advance through the House without opposition. In the House Finance Committee, Rep. Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River, said she had spoken to every member of the current Board of Regents and none of them were in favor of the bill.
No members of the board offered testimony against the bill.
Rep. Frank Tomaszewski, R-Fairbanks and another “no” vote, said he believes that assigning faculty to the board could create conflicts of interest. 
Early this year, the university reached a three-year labor deal with the union representing faculty. That agreement happened after extensive work and a brief breakdown in negotiations, leading to both parties requesting a federal mediator.
Speaking on the House floor, Carrick alluded to the university’s budget and contract struggles.
“Over the last decade, the University of Alaska has navigated some of the greatest fiscal and social challenges that have taken place in our state’s history,” she said. “(HB 10) allows for better representation in the driver’s seat to help make difficult decisions with the rest of our board members about our university system in its future.”

“It wasn’t just the austerity of changing the water to save money,” Hanna said. “It was years of austerity in state government and federal government that really had hollowed out our bureaucracies – our Department of Natural Resources at the time, our public health departments that had become skeletons of themselves and they only really could react to crises, and they didn’t have the infrastructure to really be proactive and to prevent issues.”
She said that when those institutions failed, researchers stepped up.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“It was research that was the scientific safety net,” Hanna said. “It was the source of truth. It was the check and balance to kind of protect a community.”
Among the programs that have already seen its funding cut is the Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program, Hanna said.
Hanna was speaking during a panel at the Mackinac Policy Conference sponsored by Michigan State University.
University President Kevin Guskiewicz said other projects at MSU that are either at risk of losing funding or already have include a project to create more resilient crops, research to improve health outcomes for expectant mothers and babies, and a Detroit wastewater surveillance program that was among the first to detect COVID-19.

“Federal investment enables high risk, early stage innovation that commercial entities wouldn’t likely fund,” Guskiewicz said. “It’s the starter fuel, as we like to say, for breakthroughs in health, security and technology.”
Howard Crawford, senior scientist and scientific director at Henry Ford, researches pancreatic cancer.
Pancreatic cancer patients have a median survival of about 10 months, Crawford said.
“The first thing they usually hear from their doctor is to get their affairs in order,” Crawford said. “And the thing that I always want to tell everyone that ever hears that … is get yourself to a university hospital, because that’s where the second opinions are going to come, that’s where the clinical trials are being conducted, and that’s your best hope.”
But he said the research he and others have done is already starting to make an impact, with the five-year survival rate more than doubling since he began 25 years ago, largely due to work done in university hospitals.
“This progress we’ve made, this is stuff that started 40 years ago, not four years ago, and what we have to have is a continuity of research so that we can make this progress mean something,” Crawford said.
While scientists could be on the verge of a breakthrough in treatment, Crawford said that work is jeopardized by the ongoing uncertainty around funding.
He said that’s in part because the public doesn’t understand the impact of the work researchers do.
“We spend all of our time writing papers and writing grants, and that’s what we have to do to function, but if the public doesn’t understand that’s what we’re doing, why we’re doing it, what is happening in the laboratory, what we’re bringing to them in the next few years, that’s our goal, and we need to be better,” Crawford said.
Hanna added that “we need to get out of our ivory towers, classrooms and labs and clinics, and get more comfortable in these public spaces.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AMR_0082-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-28 09:06:37.556077

After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned federal abortion protections in 2022, California lawmakers moved quickly to make the state a “safe haven” for reproductive health care. But while California has some of the strongest laws ensuring abortion rights, other states’ restrictions can make performing or seeking the procedure from California doctors more complicated.
On Tuesday California Attorney General Rob Bonta, along with 19 other attorneys general, urged the American Medical Association to do more about protecting prospective OB-GYNs seeking certification. To become board certified, OB-GYN candidates must travel to Dallas, where the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology is headquartered, to complete their in-person certifying exam.
Under Senate Bill 8, Texas has a near-total ban on abortions and penalizes abortion providers. Because of this, the attorneys general argue that the in-person requirements lead some candidates from their states to fear for their legal and physical safety in Texas.
Though California struggles to provide wide access to maternity care, there are over 3,000 OB-GYNs employed in California — the highest number of any state — according to the most recent data available from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Attorneys’ general testimony to the AMA: “The web of confusing and punitive state-based restrictions creates a legal minefield for medical providers. … Indeed, at least one anti-choice group has publicly announced that it is actively recruiting individuals, including disgruntled ex-boyfriends, to bring cases under SB8’s bounty hunter provision.”

The attorneys general suggest either relocating the testing sites to states where abortion is not restricted; pivoting to remote testing; or granting some exemptions to the in-person exam.
Bonta’s call to the medical association comes as the state Senate is considering a bill that aims to protect California abortion providers beyond state lines. 
Last week the Assembly advanced the measure, which would help shield California pharmacists, doctors and hospitals from penalties for dispensing the abortion pill mifepristone to out-of-state patients. The proposal would also strengthen privacy protections, such as removing prescriber names from abortion medication labels.

Since their inconsistent April rollout, President Donald Trump’s tariff policies have had the potential to upend California’s businesses, public pensions and budget. But the tariffs are also disrupting workers laboring at the state’s biggest ports, writes CalMatters’ Levi Sumagaysay.
Across California, port executives and spokespeople have reported notable signs of slowdown:

At the Port of Long Beach, cancellations are beginning to exceed levels seen during the pandemic.
At the Port of Los Angeles, 80 ships were expected to arrive in May, but 17 have been canceled and 10 have been canceled for June. (In May of last year, there were a total of 12 cancellations.)
At the Port of Oakland, April saw a significant 15% month-over-month drop in container activity.

With fewer goods coming in and out of the state, there is less work to go around: Union representatives report that part-time port workers aren’t getting any hours, and port security workers are struggling to carry out their jobs with few workers to look after. Truck drivers also say they are seeing less work.

Eric Tate, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 848, which represents Southern California truck drivers: “We’re trying to gear up and quickly move stuff around. We’re trying to save Christmas.”

CA tech department finds zero high-risk systems

By law, the California Department of Technology must submit a report every year on whether state agencies and entities are using high-risk automated systems that can affect people’s lives. 
In its most recent findings, the department said that none of the nearly 200 state entities it surveyed uses high-risk automated systems — despite a handful of legislative analyses concluding that California must spend millions of dollars a year to monitor the state’s use of high-risk algorithms.
As CalMatters’ Khari Johnson explains, high-risk algorithms are systems that can assist or replace human decision making. In the winter of 2020, the California Employment Development Department paused unemployment benefits for 1.1 million people after it used artificial intelligence tools to mistakenly flag thousands of legitimate unemployment applicants as fraudulent. 
The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation also uses automated systems to assign recidivism scores to inmates, including one system that has a documented history of racial bias.
But the technology department’s assessment is based on self reports, and it’s up to each agency to determine whether they are using a high-risk system. Critics of the report argue agencies should expand their definition of high-risk systems to include algorithms such as the ones that the employment and corrections departments are using.

California lawmakers reworked a bill that now seeks to provide funding for phonics-based instruction in K-12 public schools, but stops short of requiring the teaching method. CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones and video strategy director Robert Meeks have a video segment on the bill as part of our partnership with PBS SoCal. Watch it here.

California jobs and revenue on and off the ports are feeling the effects of Trump’s tariffs. 



California’s port traffic is beginning to look worse now, under the effects of President Donald Trump’s fickle tariff policy, than it did at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“The vessel calls, or cancellations, that we’re seeing today (are) starting to exceed the number that we saw in COVID-19,” Mario Cordero, chief executive of the Port of Long Beach, said in an interview with CalMatters in early May.
At Port of Los Angeles, Executive Director Gene Seroka said during a media briefing last week that the port expected 80 ships to arrive in May, but 17 have been canceled. By comparison, last year through May there were a total of 12 cancellations. There are 10 cancellations for June already, he added.
Farther north, the Port of Oakland saw a 15% month-over-month drop in container activity in April, spokesperson Matt Davis said. It was the first significant decline this year, as tariffs went into effect.
The challenges presented by Trump’s tariffs are “not like COVID,” said Martha Miller, executive director of the California Association of Port Authorities, at a business roundtable last week. The unpredictability of Trump’s edicts means there won’t be a surge of cargo, she said; many businesses are waiting to act, including to order goods for import. 
Data for the state’s three biggest ports confirm that jobs are dwindling for longshore workers up and down the state. The numbers of gangs — teams of varied sizes that work to handle cargo — at each of the ports have declined in the past few weeks, and have dropped year over year. Besides the numbers of containers at the ports, gang numbers are another indicator of the amount of work available.
Gary Herrera is president of the International Longshore Workers Union Local 13, which represents port workers in both Long Beach and Los Angeles. 
Part-time workers are not getting any hours right now, Herrera said during a media briefing with Long Beach officials. He told CalMatters that full-time workers — who get first dibs on jobs — may not be getting 40 hours a week, either. Herrera was also speaking on behalf of a couple of other locals; altogether they represent about 9,000 full-time and 6,000 part-time port workers. 
As the tariff drama drags on, the impact will be felt by other workers along the supply chain, from truck drivers to the staff at warehouses to rail workers and those who work in retail. If and when people don’t have enough work or lose their jobs, their communities and local economies will suffer, port officials and workers say.
“We live and we work in our community,” Herrera said during a recent media briefing with Long Beach officials. “We spend in our community.”


Luisa Gratz is the president of International Longshore Workers Union Local 26, which represents most of the security on the docks in Los Angeles and Long Beach. The port security workers — who drive other longshore workers from parking lots to the ships, among other things — told CalMatters that her constituents are also struggling. 
“When there’s no work for longshoremen, there’s very little work for us except gate monitoring,” she said. “It’s heartbreaking. It’s putting people out of work.”
Truckers are also feeling the squeeze from the tariffs. 
Eric Tate is secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 848, which represents about 8,000 truck drivers in Southern California. He said truckers, especially part-timers who aren’t guaranteed any hours, are seeing less work, though he did say truckers saw a bit of a pickup in work after Trump temporarily reduced tariffs on China. 
“We’re trying to gear up and quickly move stuff around,” he said in an interview with CalMatters. “We’re trying to save Christmas.”

He said the continued uncertainty means many truck drivers are barely working 40 hours a week. Some shipper drivers, who transport cargo off ships to ease congestion on ports, may be working one to two days a week, Tate said. “When there’s no ship, there’s no congestion,” he added.
But in the Bay Area, the Port of Oakland is seeing a possible pickup in activity in June — as of last week, the planned canceled ships for that month have been reduced from 12 to five, port spokesperson Davis said.
The decline in cargo traffic at the ports could change depending on how different industries and businesses respond to an agreement the Trump administration reached with China on May 12, which lowers the tax on imports from China from 145% to 30% for 90 days.  
The volatility is a problem
Besides a decline in imports from places such as China, the ports are handling fewer exports from the state’s agricultural industry, thanks to retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. Stephanie Magnien Rockwell, chief of staff at the Port of Los Angeles, said in mid-May that California farmers are taking a hit. 
“One of our greatest exports are soybeans to China,” she said at a hearing held by State Treasurer Fiona Ma about tariffs. “(But) Brazil, in the month of March, exported more soybeans to China than they have in their entire history.”
The U.S. trade war with China has an outsize effect on California ports: Chinese goods have accounted for 40% of the imports at the Port of Los Angeles, 63% at the Port of Long Beach and 45% at the Port of Oakland.
Despite the temporary deal with China, the lack of clarity is a problem — and tariffs remain high, officials, business owners and others say. Continued changes in the costs of goods make it hard for businesses to plan. And only certain size businesses may be able to afford to take a leap and order goods from overseas now.
“We can’t generalize here, because of those 125,000 importing companies (whose) goods come through the Port of Los Angeles,” Seroka said to CalMatters. “But safe to say, if there was a little bit of a shortage on stock, or if some felt that the 30% average tariff might go higher, sure, people jump back in.” 
But the uncertainty persists, Seroka said. Case in point: On May 23, Trump complained about not being able to reach a deal with Europe on tariffs and threatened a 50% tariff on European goods — which he said over the weekend would be delayed to July 9. He also threatened a 25% tariff on iPhones unless Apple begins to make the devices in the United States.
A big deal
Long-term, the stakes are high and wide-ranging. Port of Long Beach CEO Cordero said a 10% decline in cargo could mean a 10% decline in jobs. “If you use a round figure of a million jobs stemming from the port operations, that’s a 100,000 job reduction,” he told CalMatters.
His port supports jobs worth tens of billions of dollars in income in the five surrounding counties, according to a report recently released by the port. The report estimates that in 2023, port activity contributed $84.4 billion in local, state and federal taxes. Those were taxes paid by individuals and businesses, said Kimberly Ritter-Martinez, the port’s manager of economics and funding, during the Long Beach media briefing.
“When workers and business owners earn income from working at the port or as one of our suppliers, they spend those dollars on groceries, entertainment, travel… and all of that activity supports the broader economy,” she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/50525_Port-Long-Beach_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-28 09:06:37.556077

Rep. Ken Calvert has represented the 41st Congressional District more than 30 years, but redistricting has made his seat competitive. Seven Democrats and a Republican are challenging him.


Last year Republican Rep. Ken Calvert fended off a challenge by former federal prosecutor and Democrat Will Rollins, holding onto his Inland Empire seat by a 3% margin. 
Rollins, who also failed to unseat Calvert in 2022 and 2024, is not running again in 2026. 
But seven other Democrats and one Republican are challenging Calvert for his Riverside County seat in one of California’s key swing districts.
Calvert, the longest-serving GOP member of California’s delegation, has held office for three decades in what was once a reliably conservative district. But recent redistricting made it closer to an even split. In February, Republicans held less than a two-point voter registration edge over Democrats, according to the California Secretary of State. 
Calvert’s campaign brushed off the challenges, saying he expects to prevail again next year. 
“It’s clear by the growing list of radical liberals jumping in the 41st District race that Democrats are in disarray,” his campaign said in a statement to CalMatters. “Rep. Calvert continues to deliver results for his constituents and just recently fulfilled his promise to lower taxes for Riverside County voters.”
Cody Wiebelhaus, a Palm Springs health care executive, is his Republican challenger.
The Democratic candidates are lawyer Anuj Dixit, school board member Abel Chavez, entrepreneur Brandon Riker,  investment banker Dave Karson, software engineer Jason Byors, small business owner Ferguson Porter and musician Tim Meyers, formerly the bassist for the pop band OneRepublic. 
In campaign messages some are tying Calvert to President Donald Trump’s tariffs and federal funding cuts and other policies.
Republicans are “trying to repackage the same old politics with shiny words and hidden agendas,” Chavez said in a video, referring to the GOP budget bill that reduces taxes for many while slashing social services.
Meyers argues on his website that Calvert has not delivered for constituents, as the Trump administration has waged trade wars and cut cancer research and veterans’ services.
“Our Congressman, Ken Calvert, has spent his entire career running for office, rather than solving problems for working families,” Meyers said on his website. 
The seat is one of a handful that could flip the balance of power in the midterm election. The top two vote-getters in the June 2 primary next year will face off in the general election.
Dixit grew up on March Air Force Base and has worked as a lawyer defending voters against “extreme and illegal forms of gerrymandering,” he stated on his campaign website.
He said he’s trying to “shake up a system that’s been rigged for decades by insiders” and pledges to “go after big businesses that buy elections and dodge taxes.” 
Chavez grew up in the Riverside County communities of Romoland and Nuevo, California, and  attended UC Riverside as a pre-med major.  He switched to business and banking, then became a high school science teacher but said he saw flaws in the schools.
“Underfunded schools, outdated curricula, and rigid bureaucratic policies were preventing students from truly thriving,” he stated on his website.
In 2022 Chavez became a board member for Nuview Union School District, a small district in Nuevo, California. He advocates for education reform and wants to help first-time home buyers.
Riker is a fourth-generation Californian who works as an investment manager and entrepreneur. He became involved in politics by demonstrating against the Iraq war as a teenager, he stated on his website. 
In 2008 he worked as an organizer for former President Barack Obama’s campaign. Now he serves on the board of SafePlace International, which works to find safe spaces for LGBTQ people around the world. His priorities are helping small businesses and improving education.
Pop rock star Meyers grew up in Corona and played for OneRepublic before founding his own label, Palladium Records. He lives in a neighboring area of Los Angeles County now, but unlike California state representatives, congress members don’t need to live in the district they represent. 
Meyers said in a campaign video the cutthroat business environment he experienced in the entertainment industry mirrors the country’s economic system, where he says “the playing field is stacked against hard working people.”
Though campaign finance reports for most of the challengers aren’t available, some have announced early fundraising windfalls. On April 3, Riker stated on his campaign website he raised $250,000 from individual donors during the first 24 hours of his campaign. Dixit reported he raised $150,000 shortly after jumping into the race, according to Politico.

Some called the report befuddling.,"In summary
A state report provided to CalMatters says 200 agencies reported no automation around sensitive decisions. Some called the report befuddling.


California uses algorithms to predict whether incarcerated people will commit crimes again. It has used predictive technology to deny 600,000 people unemployment benefits. Nonetheless, state administrators have concluded that not a single agency uses high-risk forms of automated decisionmaking technology.
 That’s according to a report the California Department of Technology provided to CalMatters after surveying nearly 200 state entities. The agencies are required by  legislation signed into law in 2023 to report annually if they use high-risk automated systems that can make decisions about people’s lives. “High-risk” means any system that can assist or replace human decisionmakers when it comes to encounters with the criminal justice system or whether people get access to housing, education, employment, credit and health care. 
The California Department of Technology doesn’t know which algorithms state agencies use today and only reported what agencies told them, state Chief Technology Officer Jonathan Porat told CalMatters. When asked if the employment or corrections department algorithms qualify, Porat said it’s up to agencies to interpret the law.
“I only know what they report back up to us, because even if they have the contract… we don’t know how or if they’re using it, so we rely on those departments to accurately report that information up,” he said.
“We don’t know how or if they’re using it… We rely on those departments to accurately report that.”Jonathan Porat, Chief Technology Officer, California Department of Technology
The agencies, which were required to submit answers by the end of August 2024, reported high-risk automated systems used within the past year. Had any found any high-risk systems, they were required to report the kind of personal data these systems use to make decisions about people, and the steps they take to reduce the likelihood of that usage resulting in discrimination, bias, or unfair outcome. 
Some automated systems used by state agencies raise questions about how risk is being defined. The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, for example, assigns recidivism scores to the vast majority of inmates to determine their needs when they enter and leave prison. One algorithm it uses, COMPAS, has a documented history of racial bias, but the corrections department told the Department of Technology it uses no high-risk automation. 
The California Employment Development Department also reported no use of high-risk automated systems. Between the Christmas and New Years holidays in 2020, the department paused unemployment benefits for 1.1 million people after the agency used AI tools from Thomson Reuters to give unemployment applicants fraud scores. Some 600,000 of those claims were later confirmed as legitimate, according to a state analysis.
The employment department refuses to say if that algorithm is in use today, providing a written statement that its fraud detection processes are confidential “to ensure we don’t provide criminals with information that could aid criminal activity.” 
‘They’re talking out of both sides of their mouth here’
The report also appears to be out of sync with a trio of analyses carried out in the past year by California Legislature staff, which indicated the state would have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars or more each year to monitor the government’s use of high-risk algorithms.
Last year, Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan proposed a bill that would have required state agencies to conduct risk assessments of algorithms that can make a “consequential decision” about people’s lives—much like the sorts of algorithms in the new Department of Technology report.
Three different legislative analyses of her concept by appropriations committee staff concluded it would be an expensive endeavor, costing hundreds of millions of dollars a year, with ongoing costs in the billions of dollars.
If there are no high-risk automated systems in California government, how can it cost millions or billions of dollars to assess them?
That’s what one source familiar with the analyses wondered. The person, who requested anonymity out of concern for potential professional consequences, said they see little daylight between the definition of a high-risk automated system in the Department of Technology report and a consequential decision in the Bauer-Kahan bill. They think somebody’s lying. 
“There’s no way those two things can be true,” they said. “They’re talking out of both sides of their mouth here.”
Authors of the legislative analyses did not respond to multiple requests for comment. And Porat of the technology department was also at a loss. “I can’t fully explain that,” he told CalMatters. “It’s possible that a department and agency in partnership with some group or even within the state may be considering something for the future that did not meet the definition that was laid out in the requirements last year.”
The legislation that required the high-risk automation reports specifically mentions systems that produce scores. Given the pervasiveness of tools that assign risk scores, the result of the Department of Technology inventory is surprising, said Deirdre Mulligan, director of the UC Berkeley Center for Law & Technology, who helped develop AI policy for the Biden administration.
Mulligan said it’s essential that the government put rules in place to ensure automation doesn’t deprive people of their rights. She agrees that analyses that predict potentially billions in testing costs may signal future plans to use high risk automation by state agencies, which makes now an opportune time to make sure such protections are in place.
Samantha Gordon, chief program officer of advocacy group TechEquity, which has called for more transparency around how California is using AI, said that state agencies need to expand their definition of high-risk systems if it does not include algorithms such as the one EDD used in 2020, which can deny people of unemployment benefits and imperil their ability to keep a roof over their head, feed their family, or pay for child care.
“I think if you asked an everyday Californian if losing their uninsurance benefits at Christmas time when they have no job caused a real risk to their livelihood, I bet they’d say yes,” she said.
High-risk generative AI in state’s future
The high-risk automated decisionmaking report comes at a time when state agencies are rolling out a slew of potentially risky AI applications. In recent weeks, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced that state agencies are adopting AI tools to do things like speak with Californians about wildfires, manage traffic safety, quicken the rebuilding process after wildfires in Los Angeles, and inform state employees who help businesses file their taxes.
Legislators want to track these sorts of systems in part because of the potential that they could make mistakes. A 2023 state report about risks and opportunities for government adoption of generative AI cautions that it can produce convincing but inaccurate results, deliver different answers to the same prompt, and can suffer from model collapse, when predictions stray from accurate results. Generative AI also carries the risk of automation bias, when people become overly trusting and reliant on automated decisionmaking, the report said.
In late 2023, Newsom ordered the technology department to compile a different report, an inventory of high risk usage of generative AI by executive branch state agencies. CalMatters requested a copy of that document, but the Department of Technology declined to share it; Chief Information Security Officer Vitaliy Panych called doing so an unnecessary security risk.
What AI deserves a high risk label is an ongoing debate and part of the legal regime emerging in democratic nations around the world. Tech that earns that label is often subject to more testing before deployment and ongoing monitoring. In the European Union, for example, the AI Act labels as high risk models used in critical infrastructure operations as well as those that decide access to education, employment, and public benefits. Similarly, the AI Bill of Rights compiled during the Biden administration defined as high risk AI that can make decisions about your employment, health care, and housing.
The California Legislature is currently considering dozens of bills to regulate AI in the coming months, if Congress doesn’t place a moratorium on state AI regulation for a decade. A report ordered by the governor about how to balance innovation and guardrails for AI is due out this summer. 
The law that requires the high-risk automated systems report has some notable exceptions, including the entire state judiciary and licensing bodies like the California Bar Association, which triggered controversy last month after it used AI to write questions for its high-stakes exam. The law also does not require compliance from local governments, who often use AI in criminal justice or policing environments, and school districts. where teachers are using AI to grade papers. The health care marketplace Covered California, which The Markup revealed is sharing the personal information of Californians with LinkedIn, is also using generative AI but that entity is not required to report to the Department of Technology.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/HIGH-RISK-AI_AH_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-28 09:06:37.556077

Gavin Newsom is asking lawmakers to approve.,"In summary
California’s experiment with increasing pay for jury duty would come to an early end under the new budget Gov. Gavin Newsom is asking lawmakers to approve.


In his attempts to solve a multibillion-dollar state deficit, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s new budget plan would terminate a legislative experiment that increased pay for juries in an effort  to make them more fairly represent the communities they serve.
Since September, jurors in seven counties have been eligible to receive $100 per day while serving on a jury, a significant improvement to the statewide norm of $15. 
The Jury Duty Pilot Program originated from a law Newsom signed three years ago. Killing it early would save about $27.5 million, according to Newsom’s latest budget proposal.  
Funded as a two-year program, the legislation required the Judicial Council, the agency that oversees all of California’s courts, to study juror data and produce a report on how the increased per diem impacts overall jury diversity.
Now after just eight months, several pilot program counties have moved to end the increased stipend after Newsom’s revised budget proposal came out in May.
Assemblymember Alex Lee, the Milpitas Democrat who authored the original bill that established the program, said it was “extremely disappointing” to see the governor  undo a law that passed through the Legislature and which he’d previously signed.
“Juror pay hasn’t been increased in 25 years. Because of the incredibly low pay of just $15 a day starting their second day of service, jurors are being excused for financial hardship. This decreases the economic and demographic diversity of our juries and can lead to trials that are not as representative of our communities.”
Although most of the participating counties have announced discontinuing the program immediately, Alameda County has yet to determine how it will proceed without state funding.
“I think it’s absolutely shameful that this program is being considered to be cut in the May Revise,” said Alameda County Chief Public Defender Brendon Woods.
“When you think about the cost of this program — about $27.5 million, and the cost that, as a state, we pay nearly $14 billion to incarcerate people in prison — it’s kind of ridiculous that this small amount was being cut to make sure that our juries are more diverse.”
Woods spoke not only about the impact of losing the Jury Duty Pilot Program, but also what that means in light of voters passing Proposition 36, which signaled a swing away from criminal justice reform and a return to more tough-on-crime, mass incarceration era policies. 
“As a state, we recently passed Prop. 36 — a law that is going to incarcerate more low income or Black and brown people,” said Woods. “They’re going to be in prison and jail because of that law. And while we’re doing that, we’re also saying that we’re gonna cut funding from a program that’s going to actually give people who are low income — Black and brown — a chance to have a voice in the system.
“So we’re increasing incarceration of people while also removing their power. I cannot think of something that’s actually more devious than that.”
San Francisco initiated its own $100 per diem, “Be The Jury” program in 2022 and generated its own study on how the increased pay led to demographic improvement directly proportional to its population. After one year, the city reported that people who qualified for the higher per diem had a lower household income than other jurors. It also found that people of color reported that the extra money “removed barriers” for them to serve on a jury at a higher rate compared to white jurors.
The San Francisco program and its well documented positive results, spearheaded in 2021 by then-Assemblymember Phil Ting, ultimately contributed to Lee’s bill passing in 2022 and taking effect last fall.
California does not collect demographic data from jurors. For many counties across California, jury pools generally tend to be filled mostly by retirees, those who can afford to lose multiple days of income, or those whose employers compensate for days’ wages. 
In a recent Los Angeles courtroom where jurors are paid the statewide per diem of $15, a Black mother sat and observed jury selection for the criminal trial of her son.
Regardless of racial demographics, almost everyone seated on that jury at the close of voir dire seemed to be educated, fairly affluent professionals and retirees.
“My son is 23 years old,” the Inglewood mom said, her eyes wrought with frustration. “Does that look like a jury of his peers?”
Less than two weeks later, her son was convicted of first-degree murder and now faces a life sentence in state prison.
Lee said that the Judicial Council will still be obligated to release a six-month report of Jury Duty Pilot Program data to the legislature for review.

Family Dollar in Rushville, 316 W 2nd St., on May 17 from 9 a.m. to noon.
Gordon Memorial Hospital Clinic in Gordon on May 21 from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.



The state health agency said people may have been exposed to measles in two cities in the panhandle and advised them to visit and complete the state DHHS risk assessment survey.

Measles is a highly contagious airborne disease that spreads when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. It can cause severe disease, complications and even death. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose and a rash over the body. Being vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with measles or spreading it to other people.
Measles can affect anyone, but it is most common in children.
The state health agency emphasizes that if an individual thinks they have symptoms of measles, they should isolate themselves and call a health care facility in advance to get tested. State health officials also said anyone with known measles exposure and no confirmed immunity needs to stay at home and away from others for 21 days from the last date of exposure.
Vaccines have made measles rare in the U.S., leading to its elimination in 2000, but the politicization of vaccinations has played a part in the resurgence of measles in the U.S.
Many nearby states have had measles cases this year. Kansas currently has 58 cases. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen held a press conference in April with state health officials urging Nebraskans to get vaccinated against a disease that can cause serious health complications, especially for children under age 5.
At the time, Pillen said, “It’s not if it’s going to come to Nebraska, but when.”
South Dakota has not reported a confirmed measles case so far this year, but reported a case last year that was the state’s first in nine years.

Families lingering at the edges, wary of being turned away – or worse. The heat only intensifies the tension that crackles in the breeze, while the sight of people with guns near the voting booths imparts an unsettling sense of danger.
Here’s the thing: you don’t have to rely on your imagination here. This scene isn’t unfolding in a distant war-torn landscape; this was Phoenix, Arizona, during the 2022 midterm election, where armed Americans in tactical gear stood next to a ballot drop box. 
A similar scene unfolded in Las Vegas, Nevada, where two armed men paced outside of a ballot tabulation center. The presence of firearms in close proximity to voters has become a troubling reality here at home, a reality we often think only happens far from American soil. Such intimidation tactics can sow fear and deter citizens from exercising their most fundamental democratic right: the right to vote.
Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui is addressing this problem in Nevada by introducing Assembly Bill 105. This legislation aims to ensure that Nevadans can cast their ballots without fear of violence or harassment.  Specifically, this bill would:

Prohibit the possession or presence of firearms within 100 yards of election sites, which include any polling place or central counting place.
Create exceptions for law enforcement officers carrying out official duties, security personnel, firearms stored in cars, and people whose homes or businesses are within 100 yards of election sites.
Establish a gross misdemeanor for individuals who violate this prohibition.
Upgrade to a felony any knowing violation of the prohibition when it is done with the specific intent to disrupt, interfere with, or monitor the administration of the election, the counting of votes, or any person who is voting or attempting to vote.

In 2023, Jauregui introduced similar legislation (AB 354), which passed along party lines and was subsequently sent to Gov. Joe Lombardo, who vetoed it as part of a trio of other common-sense gun laws.
Assembly Bill 105 recognizes the simple truth: voting is safer when firearms are not present. In fact, many states, including Arizona, California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and Washington – already regulate the carrying of firearms at polling places. Additionally, firearms are prohibited in courthouses and other sensitive government buildings, reinforcing the principle that certain environments necessitate stricter standards for public safety.
By keeping polling places free from the intimidation factor that firearms can present, Nevadans will be able to vote with confidence, free from the looming threat of violence. After all, polling places are where Americans exercise their most powerful democratic privilege: the freedom to cast a ballot and have their voice heard. AB 105 is a measured, necessary step toward safeguarding that right for everyone.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Voting_053024rc_011-1024x703.jpg,,,2025-05-28 09:06:37.556077

Lombardo gave his state of the state address in January. (Photo: Richard Bednarski/Nevada Current)The Nevada State Constitution requires the Legislature pass the K-12 education budget bill before other budget bills. But that doesn’t seem to stop lawmakers from bickering about education policy until the very end of each session.
This year may prove no exception.
Education. Of course.
Legislators must end the 120-day session — sine die, they call it — on Monday, June 2. In this final week, two major education bills backed by two major political players are still in play. Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro, a Democrat from Las Vegas, is pushing Senate Bill 460. Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is pushing Assembly Bill 584.
Both bills span more than 100 pages and cover myriad components of the education system, including oversight of school districts, charter schools, and the quasi-voucher program known as Opportunity Scholarships. Both bills have received hearings — in Senate Education and Assembly Ways and Means, respectively — but no action has been taken.
That status isn’t surprising given the partisanship of education policy. Amendments can almost be assumed.
Meanwhile, as of late Tuesday, the status of the state’s K-12 education budget was also unknown. Senate Bill 500 was passed by legislators and has been delivered to the governor. Lombardo had previously threatened to veto the bill over concerns about charter school teacher pay.
Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager’s Assembly Bill 398, which attempts to address the concerns that prompted the veto threat, passed the full Assembly nearly unanimously last week. Democrat Natha Anderson cast the sole vote in opposition.
Film tax credits
One of the two bills proposing a massive expansion of the state’s film tax credit program is administratively ready for a vote by the full Assembly, though whether the support is there is still unknown.
Democratic Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui’s Assembly Bill 238 was advanced out of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee over the weekend. Five of the 14 committee members opposed — Democrats Howard Watts, Natha Anderson and Selena Torres-Fossett, and Republicans Jill Dickman and Gregory Hafen. Several others disclosed that they would be voting to advance the bill but were reserving their right to oppose during the floor vote.
Two days after that committee vote, The Nevada Independent reported that a study commissioned by the Nevada Governor’s Office of Economic Development found that neither film tax credit expansion proposal is financially sustainable.
AB 238 would provide $1.8 billion in tax breaks to the film industry over 15 years to support the build out and operation of a 31-acre film hub currently referred to as the Summerlin Production Studios Project. Sony Pictures, Warner Bros, and Howard Hughes Holdings are attached to the project.
An economic analysis presented by a firm hired by the Sony Studios project developers acknowledged that the direct return on investment per tax credit is low — for every $1 in tax credits the state gives, the state would receive 20 cents in tax revenue. However, their analyses included much rosier projections about the indirect and induced impacts. Indirect financial impact includes things like the drycleaners and caterers used by productions, and induced impact includes things like the assumed household spending based on employee’s labor income.
Veto watch
Lombardo vetoed a record 75 bills during the 2023 session, including some bills that had received bipartisan support in the Legislature.
How this year’s session will compare remains to be seen. As of late Tuesday, the legislative website showed the governor as having vetoed only one bill: Assembly Bill 306. The bill would have expanded the number of ballot dropboxes in the state.
In his veto message, Lombardo called the bill “well intentioned” but said it fails “to guarantee appropriate oversight of the proposed ballot boxes or the ballots cast.” He added that he believes election reforms should be considered “as part of a larger effort to improve election security, integrity and allow Nevada to declare winners more quickly.”
Nearly 200 bills are now listed as in the governor’s office awaiting a signature or a veto. The governor has five days to sign or veto a bill, meaning some vetos may happen after the session ends.
Nonpartisan voters
Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager over the weekend introduced Assembly Bill 597, which would allow nonpartisan voters to participate in either a Democratic or a Republican primary without having to register to that political party.
To do so, the voter would have to request from their county clerk a mail ballot for one of the major political parties. Or they would have to vote in person.
Nevada voters last year rejected a proposal to open the state’s closed political primaries and create a ranked choice voting system instead. Question 3 was approved by voters in 2022 but defeated in 2024. It needed to pass on the ballot twice because it involved amending the state constitution.
Both major political parties opposed that ballot measure. Several party leaders suggested their problem with that proposal was with the ranked choice component, not the open primary. A third of all registered voters in the state are nonpartisan — if they were a political party they would be the state’s largest — and those wanting election reform have long argued those voters are being disenfranchised because they cannot participate in the partisan primaries.
Yeager’s emergency bill is a big policy discussion to have with only a week left, but the Legislature can move quickly when it wants.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250115_StateofState_Current-65800-1-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-28 09:06:37.556077

John Curtis, R-Utah, and John Zahurancik, president of Fluence in the Americas, after a tour of a Fluence Energy facility in Tooele, Utah. (Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)After Utah Republican Sen. John Curtis toured a battery module manufacturing facility located about 30 miles from the Salt Lake City airport, among open lands and farms in Tooele County, he reflected on an oil embargo in the ’70s that had deep impacts on the country’s economy. 
Since then, he thinks of energy independence as a national security issue — one that may ultimately need the help of energy tax credits that his party is considering removing in the version of the “big, beautiful” bill the U.S. House passed last week.
“I have been an advocate that not necessarily that we should take it all at face value, but that we should carefully evaluate every one and make sure that it’s a good decision for our country, for our energy future,” Curtis said on Tuesday. “The House did pass a bill that dramatically curtailed those. My friends in the House kind of call me up and say, ‘listen, we’re counting on you to fix it.’”
The budget reconciliation package, as it’s currently written, proposes eliminating major programs from the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, a 2022 federal law that propelled clean energy investments, as President Donald Trump ordered his cabinet to fight state-led energy policies tied to climate change that “threaten American energy dominance.”

However, Curtis, who founded the Conservative Climate Caucus in the U.S. House and has said that people don’t have to give up their conservative credentials to be good at the climate change conversation, is planning on making the case to his Senate colleagues on how Inflation Reduction Act incentives affect all types of energy, including the country’s fossil fuel industry via carbon sequestration tax credits to help control greenhouse gas emissions.
“A lot of Republicans don’t like (the Inflation Reduction Act) because we weren’t included in it. We didn’t get a chance to vote for it,” Curtis said. “And one of my missions right now in Washington is to point out that there are a lot of Utah-slash-Republican-slash-conservative principles in that, that we want to make sure that we make good decisions on, and part of that is this energy independence that I want for our country.”
Tax bill proposal terminating clean energy credits may increase Utahns’ energy costs

That, he says, includes the discussion of “be very careful with the decisions that we make and what we do, so we don’t do anything that messes with that energy independence that’s so important,” Curtis said in front of the staff of Fluence Energy, a Virginia energy storage production company with a Utah location. 
During his short tour, Curtis saw automation systems and lots of employees working on the battery modules, which integrate systems to store energy at a utility scale.
The manufacturing operation opened at Tooele business park in 2022, John Zahurancik, president of Fluence in the Americas, said during the news conference on Tuesday, when pandemic-related challenges still plagued global shipping. 
“We just couldn’t get these goods into the United States, the United States being one of the largest markets for battery, energy storage systems in the world,” Zahurancik said. “This is where storage originated. It’s where all the first projects were done. It’s where most of the largest projects in the world have been done.”
Utah stood out for its proximity to other clean energy facilities and for its great access to roads, he added. Since that start, the company has already gone through a few generations of production, with bigger and much heavier products, leading to a 2024 expansion bringing in a module manufacturing line.

As demand from the general public and large users, like data centers, keeps on growing alongside projections for massive rate increases, Zahurancik said his company has been looking to build new and reliable electricity generation.
“Batteries are right at the heart of that, both in terms of the affordability and the reliability,” he said.
Some Utah clean energy advocates also believe that the work being done at this facility is a big deal.
“It’s great to see a battery manufacturer like Fluence locate right here in Utah. Investing in a clean energy future and industries like energy storage is good for our state’s economy and meeting our energy needs,” Josh Craft, director of government relations and public affairs at Utah Clean Energy, said in a statement. “Like Senator Curtis said today, stable national investments in energy innovation are important to growing the industries of the future right here in our state.”
As for Curtis, he hopes that projects like this, and other emerging ones in the state, are able to lead the way in the country and the world. But, he suggested that state goals could be more ambitious.
“I was teasing in the other room, our governor wants to increase the amount of energy that we produce by double in the next 10 years. And if he were here, I’d put my arm around him and say, ‘governor, I love you. But that is not enough,’” Curtis said about Gov. Spencer Cox’s Operation Gigawatt. “There are demands coming on energy that far exceed doubling in 10 years.”

Pat Connick in the Louisiana Senate on May 27, 2025. (Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Senate president said his chamber will dramatically scale back funding for the new private school voucher program from what Gov. Jeff Landry and the House of Representatives have pledged. 
Sen. Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, has said for weeks that the Senate will only fund the new program with $50 million for 2025-26, its first school year. The governor and House lawmakers have allocated considerably more – $94 million – for LA GATOR in their own budget proposals. 
At $50 million, LA GATOR would only be able to cover the private school tuition costs of 6,000 students in Louisiana’s existing school voucher program for the 2025-2025 school year. Landry has pushed to expand private school assistance to 5,300 more children by spending $44 million more. 
Yet Henry has expressed skepticism about the new voucher initiative and said the Senate voted last year to set up LA GATOR on the condition it would be rolled out cautiously. Senators agreed to cover education expenses for longstanding voucher students in its first year, but no more than that, he said.

“We originally agreed there would be $50 million, and we’re going to stick with that,” Henry said in an interview with reporters Tuesday.

LA GATOR will use state tax dollars to pay for private school student expenses, including tuition, uniforms, after-school tutoring and computers. Those who homeschool could also use LA GATOR to cover their education costs.

Eventually, the program is meant to have no income restrictions – meaning students from wealthy, middle-class and poor families could all qualify for the publicly funded private school assistance. In the first year of the program, however, it was expected to be confined mostly to low-income students and children with disabilities because of the limited slots available. 

Landry touts LA GATOR as one of his signature initiatives and has put public pressure on Henry to dedicate more money to the program. 

Earlier this month, the governor attended a rally near the State Capitol  in support of LA GATOR with more than 100 students from New Orleans-area private schools. Landry led the students in a chant of “Please support GATOR scholarships!” in the courtyard of the Pentagon Barracks, the dormitory for state lawmakers during the legislative session. 
Louisiana homeowners might get option to insure their properties for ‘stated value’

Conservative groups aligned with Landry have also launched advertising campaigns in recent weeks that promote the LA GATOR scholarship and that urge Henry and other senators to “fully fund” the program. 
But on Tuesday, Henry appeared unfazed by the political pressure. 

“Not all conservative Republicans agree with what the governor wants to do,” he said. 

Instead of spending an extra $44 million on LA GATOR, Henry said the Senate would put the money toward a tutoring program for kindergarten to third-grade students that launched last year but is currently unfunded in the budget. 

The extra money could also be used to cover pay increases for public school teachers who work in hard-to-fill positions such as special education, math and science. Some of the money could also go to local sheriffs who house state prisoners, Henry said. 

The senator’s primary concern over LA GATOR is the long-term impact on state finances. He worries the program could potentially become so expensive as it expands that it would become harder for the state to pay for infrastructure projects, higher education and other priorities. 
Similar private education voucher programs have caused money problems in other states. The Texas voucher program is expected to cost $1 billion per year when it starts in 2026. The Florida program, started in 2023, costs $3.9 billion, or one out of every $13 of that state government’s general fund, according to the Associated Press, 

A large chunk of voucher funding in Florida and Arizona goes to wealthy families. Over two-thirds of the students drawing down the grants in Florida already went to private school before receiving the voucher, according to the Tampa Bay Times. 
Henry would like to prevent a similar situation in Louisiana, wherein the state finds itself subsidizing private education for families who would pay for it otherwise. He fears LA GATOR would result in the state not only having to pay for public schools, but also private schools it doesn’t currently support. 
“We also don’t want this to turn into where people are just creating schools just for [LA GATOR],” Henry said. “The point is to have established schools or programs that are helping these kids move from where they are to where they want to be.” 
University of New Orleans transfer to LSU System expected to cost $23 million this year 

The same education advocates pushing for LA GATOR also pressed for Louisiana’s current voucher program, set up under former Gov. Bobby Jindal in 2012. That initiative, which is focused exclusively on low-income families, has failed to live up to its promises, Henry said. 

Students enrolled in the Jindal voucher program have performed worse on standardized tests than their peers in public schools, according to The Times-Picayune, despite the state spending a half a billion dollars on their private education over the past decade. Voucher advocates deserve skepticism after they promoted a program that performed poorly, according to Henry. 

“If the voucher program was doing so well, we wouldn’t be changing it,” he said. 
The Senate is expected to unveil its markup of the budget next week and will have to reach a compromise with the Louisiana House over the final product by June 12.

Dina Neal listens while her Republican colleague Ira Hansen explains he's reluctantly voting against her bill to limit hedge fund ownership of housing at Gov. Joe Lombardo's request. (Legislative stream screengrab)Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo asked the Republican legislative caucus to block a bill that attempts to limit cash-rich corporate investors from purchasing large swaths of housing in Nevada, Republican state Sen. Ira Hansen said on Tuesday. 
State lawmakers passed several bills on Friday that seek to bolster tenant protections and make changes to the eviction system, many of which were based on similar proposals that were vetoed by Lombardo in 2023.
Democratic state Sen. Dina Neal also revived 2023 efforts vetoed by Lombardo to rein in corporate landlords. Senate Bill 391, which failed to pass Tuesday, proposed restricting corporate investors from purchasing more than 100 units per year.
Unlike the other housing bills that passed this session, SB 391 needed a two-thirds majority to pass since it imposed fees. A yes vote from Hansen, who had supported the bill, would have given the legislation the 14 to 7 vote needed to meet the two-thirds threshold. Instead, the vote was 13 to 8.
“For the first time this session, I have actually been asked by the executive branch to support a caucus ‘no’ position, which I have agreed to do,” Hansen said in a floor speech Tuesday, adding he was doing so “very reluctantly.” 
In an email to Nevada Current, Lombardo’s press secretary Josh Meny said the governor was asked for input on SB 391 and “voiced technical concerns with the initial draft of the legislation.” 
The efforts to block legislation is disappointing, especially since Nevada is in the middle of a housing crisis, Neal said.  
“Going into today’s vote, this bill had bipartisan support because preventing corporations from robbing Nevadans of the American Dream should be a bipartisan issue,” she said in a statement. “The only reason it didn’t pass is because of Gov. Lombardo’s intervention. Senate Democrats will continue to fight to enact this bill and protect Nevadans from predatory out-of-state investors.”
Hansen voted in support of Neal’s 2023 bill. On Tuesday, he reaffirmed he still “supported the concept” of the bill to do more to crack down on out-of-state investors, adding he was “a little frustrated” that he had to vote against the legislation.
He warned that private investors are buying up the housing in Nevada, adding that “in Clark County 15% of all the residential housing is owned by hedge funds.”
The estimate comes from Lied Center for Real Estate at the University of Nevada Las Vegas that found investors own roughly 15% of homes in the City of Las Vegas.
Las Vegas Review Journal has reported that corporate investors purchased 264 homes in a single day for $98 million. 
Hansen said it creates a system where regular Nevadans are unable to purchase a home when up against out-of-state private equity investors. 
“If me or a couple other ordinary people were bidding against Elon Musk, who is going to win that bidding war?” Hansen asked. 
Hansen said he hoped that “some of the better elements” of Neal’s bill “could somehow be incorporated in the last waning days of the session.” 
In response to the state’s growing housing shortage, Lombardo has brought forward Assembly Bill 540, which unanimously passed out of the Assembly Ways and Means committee Saturday.
AB 540 seeks a $133 million budget request to establish a Nevada Attainable Housing Fund and Council. 
The legislation originally sought an allocation of $250 million in funding for housing projects. 
Christine Hess, the chief financial officer of the Nevada Housing Division, said during the bill’s hearing in April that $50 million of the funds would be directed toward “loans and will remain assets of the division’s trust so that we can continue to issue the hundreds of millions of bonds annually for home ownership and multi-family rental housing.”
The bill also proposed ​​exempting projects from paying prevailing wages to construction workers that state law typically requires of publicly financed projects. 
In addition to reducing the dollar amount, the legislation removed language around the prevailing wage. 
“Any plans to address our state’s housing crisis, including the Governor’s own housing bill, mean nothing if there are no guarantees or protections that support access or attainment,” said Ben Iness, coalition manager of the Nevada Housing Justice Alliance. “Until the state of housing is taken seriously, Nevadans will continue to be squeezed and priced out of homes by large corporate interests.”
  Tenant protections, eviction reforms 

That bulk of bills proposed by Democratic lawmakers that sought broader tenant protections and changes to the eviction process passed their final House in party-line votes on Friday.
Those bills are now headed to Lombardo’s desk, where similar versions of several of them met their demise two years ago.
Assembly Bill 283, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Max Carter, once again, seeks to revise the summary eviction process. 
Nevada’s “summary” eviction system, which is unique to the state, allows landlords to evict tenants within days unless the tenant files a challenge to the eviction in court. Legal aid and housing groups have warned it has led to lightning quick evictions and worsened the state’s housing crisis. 
State lawmakers initially introduced efforts to change the system in 2021 when they had a Democratic state government trifecta, but the legislation was converted to a study bill. When a reform bill passed in 2023, Lombardo killed it. 
Democratic Assemblymember Erica Roth of Reno also brought forward Assembly Bill 201 to expand efforts to automatically seal eviction records. 
Democratic Assemblywoman Venecia Considine also brought back efforts that were killed in 2023 via Assembly Bill 121, which seeks to add transparency to the rental application process. 
Considine also carried bills to address the state’s habitation laws. 
Assembly Bill 211 allows a third party to take over the property until the repairs are made and living conditions improved. 
Assembly Bill 223 seeks to remedy the process and give tenants more power to hold landlords accountable for failing to provide livable conditions such as running water, working air conditioning, and a functioning lock on doors and windows. 
Legislation seeking to cap rent increases for seniors, which  was revived by Democratic Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, also passed out of its final house. 
Assembly Bill 280 would limit landlords from raising rents more than 5% on tenants 62 years or older or relies on Social Security payments through the end of 2026 and requires landlords to refund application fees if they don’t screen a tenant who applied for the unit.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/hansen.neal_-1024x648.jpg,,,2025-05-28 09:06:37.556077

HB 298 passed the House 72-1 with 29 abstentions and many floor amendments on April 30, but never received a Senate committee vote. The legislation would not have limited the ability of ELL students to participate

The bill in some ways reflects demographic changes in the state. About 5.7% of Alabama’s population is Hispanic or Latino, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. But the numbers are significantly higher in parts of northern Alabama. Marshall County’s population, where Colvin is from, is about 16% Hispanic or Latino. According to al.com, about 86% of ELL students in 2022-23 identified as Hispanic or Latino.

Colvin and other supporters of the legislation claim that ELL students were generally not participating in extracurricular activities, which meant that schools could be moved up to athletic classification levels where they would struggle.
“I didn’t understand why we have to count them, because it’s not an accurate reflection of our athletic pool,” Colvin said.
Through debates on the bill, Rep. Ginny Shaver, R-Leesburg, said Crossville High School in DeKalb County paused its varsity football team two years ago because it was moved to a 5A classification by the Alabama High School Athletic Association (AHSAA).
Crossville High School Principal Jon Peppers said in an interview last week the school only had about 20 kids on the team and competed against other 5A schools with 50-100 athletes.
“A lot of kids were playing football in the ninth grade, 10th grade, and they were having to go out on the field against teams like Guntersville, Albertville, Boaz,” Peppers said. “Their teams would have a whole offensive team, a defensive team, and we’d have kids that had to play both ways, and they had never played football before. Then they got hurt.”
Numbers on athletic participation by racial or ethnic background in Alabama are not available. The Alabama High School Athletic Association (AHSAA) does not have specific data on the race of its athletes.  A 2022 National Center for Health Statistics study found that in 2020, about 60% of non-Hispanic white students aged 6-17 had participated in sports in the last year, compared to about 47% of Hispanic students and 42% of Black students.
Allison Hamilton, executive director of the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice, said in an interview last week that English and a second language (ESL) and ELL students are not a direct correlation to high school teams not having enough participation.
“If a school’s population is growing, then maybe that’s what they need to address how they’re classifying,” Hamilton said. “In general, I think it’s discriminatory to choose to change classification based on ESL participation.”
DeKalb County is 16.4% Hispanic or Latino, according to the 2020 census. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 82% of the student body identified as Hispanic or Latino in the 2023-24 school year.  Peppers said most of the Hispanic students start working in high school instead of participating in sports.
“So once they get old enough, 15, to be able to work, they prefer their kids not to play sports,” he said. “They want them to get jobs to help pay for the bills.”
Hamilton said that while Hispanic students are working while in school, that is not unique to Hispanic families.
“I mean for sure, there are students that are choosing to take jobs after school so that they can help their families. I think that’s not just true of Hispanic families, but of many low income students,” she said.
The Hispanic and Immigrant Center of Alabama (HICA) said in a statement last week it could not comment on the specifics of the bill.
“We can say that Hispanic students, like all other students, enjoy the opportunity to participate in sports programs throughout the states,” Carlos Alemán, CEO of HICA, wrote. “Our Hispanic students also participate in post-secondary opportunities across the state, and they are one of the fastest-growing populations in our community colleges and universities.”
Peppers said he plans to bring back the varsity football team this year, but the team will consist of seventh to 12th graders. There are currently 40 kids signed up for the varsity football team this fall. 
“That’s been our downfall of our football program. They’re making us play against schools that have kids that are bigger, stronger, faster than us,” he said. “You know, we play the kids we have that’s never played football before.”
Attempts to schedule an interview with the AHSAA were unsuccessful, but the association has been vocal in its opposition to the legislation. 
Heath Harmon, executive director of the AHSAA, said in an April statement that he is disappointed by the legislation because it would discourage ELL students from participating in sports in the name of keeping a lower classification.
Colvin challenged the position saying the legislation does not prohibit ELL students from participating in sports, and they would still be counted towards the classification if they did participate.
“It’s emotional and maybe there’s some resentment towards the immigration population, but I think if we can get this issue fixed, it at least takes away that piece of frustration when it comes to immigration,” Colvin said Monday. “I think it would actually lead to more assimilation, more maybe even working with these ELL kids to try to get them more involved in sports, because if they play, they count.”
Peppers said the varsity football team was the only team that was paused because of low participation and high injury. He said the school’s soccer team often has to make cuts to make room for all the interested kids.
“The only sport that’s probably not affected is our soccer program,” Peppers said.
Hamilton said that the Coalition had many members “whose children are participating in athletic events at their schools.”
“I think that the concern I have is just that this bill seems to be potentially harmful for schools that have a significant English language learner population, limiting their ability to qualify for athletic competition.”

The decision, in a case involving three plaintiffs who sued in Cole County, is one of the reasons the company, which acquired Roundup as a product when it merged with Monsanto, in 2018, is considering dropping the product entirely. The company faces 67,000 lawsuits claiming the main ingredient, glyphosate, causes non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with many of those cases awaiting trial in St. Louis County, where the company has its Bayer Crop Science headquarters.
The company failed to win passage of a bill intended to shield it from litigation in Missouri. The bill narrowly passed the House but lobbying missteps, including a campaign targeting some of the most conservative members of the state Senate, doomed it. The company did win passage of similar legislation in North Dakota and in Georgia.
In November 2023, a Cole County jury awarded $1.6 billion to three plaintiffs who claimed their cancer was caused by glyphosate exposure while using Roundup. Cole County Circuit Judge Daniel Green reduced the $500 million punitive damages awarded to each plaintiff, instead reducing each award by varying amounts.
Green did not change the amounts awarded for actual damages, which ranged from $5.6 million to $38 million and totaled $61.1 million.
With post-judgment interest, the total Bayer owes is now in excess of $700 million.
“We’re certainly pleased with the court of appeals decision that vindicates the jury’s verdict and the trial court’s judgment,” said attorney Matthew Clement of Jefferson City, who represented the plaintiffs in the case. “We’re happy that nothing happened in the legislature, this year at least, that will affect future cases and and will continue to litigate our cases like we had been.”
In a statement issued through Bayer spokesman Brian Leake, the company said it would continue to appeal the case.
“We continue to believe that the trial court committed significant errors by allowing inadmissible and prejudicial testimony into the courtroom which poisoned the jury against the company,” the statement read.
Bayer is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to take its appeal of a 2024 Missouri case awarding $1.25 million in damages to John Durnell of St. Louis. The Eastern District Court of Appeals upheld that decision in February and on April 1 the Missouri Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal.
The U.S. Supreme Court has given parties until June 9 to file arguments on whether it should accept the case.
“The overwhelming weight of science as well as the assessments of the EPA and leading health regulators and scientists worldwide that support the safety and non-carcinogenicity of Roundup and we will continue to defend our products in court,” the company stated.
Bayer has paid out at least $10 billion for jury awards and settlements and earlier this year said it had an additional $6 billion set aside. That fund will be depleted quickly if decisions like the one upheld Tuesday are allowed to stand and the company suffers more losses like a  $2.1 billion judgment handed down in March by a jury in Georgia. 
According to a report from Reuters, Roundup produced $2.8 billion in revenue for Bayer in 2024.
The bill protecting glyphosate from litigation passed the Georgia legislature a few weeks after the $2.1 billion award.
 State Sen. Brad Hudson of Cape Fair speaks at a news conference Feb. 25 about flyers sent to his constituents attacking his opposition to a bill limiting lawsuits against Bayer over its herbicide Roundup. Joining Hudson, from left, are Sens. Nick Schroer of Defiance, Ben Brown of Washington, Joe Nicola of Independence, Mike Moon of Ash Grove, Rick Brattin of Harrisonville, Adam Schnelting of St. Charles, Jill Carter of Joplin and David Gregory of Chesterfield (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Gov. Mike Kehoe, at a news conference after lawmakers adjourned earlier this month, blamed defeat of the Missouri legislation on trial attorneys who have made “tens of millions of dollars” off the lawsuits.
“If, for some reason, that particular product is not produced anymore in the United States, farmers are still going to need that type of product, that type of weed control, and so that, glyphosate I think is what it’s called,will be produced somewhere,” Kehoe said. “And if it is, it won’t be produced in this country, and farmers will not have the same protections and liability recourse back on the companies who make it, if it’s made in China or somewhere overseas.”
Bayer is also being sued by shareholders in a class action lawsuit over its decision to spend $68 billion to acquire Monsanto in 2018. The lawsuit alleges Bayer misled investors over the risks of the acquisition and failed to properly perform due diligence before buying Monsanto,
When Bayer acquired Monsanto in June 2018, its stock price was about $30 a share. On Tuesday afternoon, the company’s shares were selling for $7 apiece.
In the appeal of the Cole County decision, Bayer argued that Green made numerous errors in the trial and in rulings on post-trial motions. The company’s lawyers’ main points challenged the admissibility of testimony about a case over EPA evaluations of glyphosate; surprise findings from an expert; the use made of medical billing records; and whether the punitive damages were unconstitutionally duplicative.
At the heart of most glyphosate cases, and the target of legislation, is the label and whether it includes a proper notice that glyphosate may cause cancer.
“The misconduct complained about in the complaints in the three California cases Monsanto relies on, and in (one plaintiff’s) petition, includes allegations that despite scientific evidence that Roundup was carcinogenic, Monsanto continued to sell Roundup, and that Monsanto failed to warn of the dangerous effects of using Roundup,” Judge Cynthia Martin wrote in the Western District opinion delivered Tuesday.
In a discussion of whether the punitive damage award should have been reduced more, Martin wrote that “Monsanto’s degree of reprehensibility was high.”
Martin noted that the evidence shows that while the EPA has registered Roundup “for sale since 1974, Monsanto has been aware since 1985 that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, has the potential to cause cancer.”
Each of the plaintiffs suffered damages because Monsanto sold a product that was “unreasonably dangerous when used as reasonably anticipated” without altering the labeling to provide a warning.
“Monsanto’s awareness,” Martin wrote, “of studies demonstrating the possibility of a causal relationship between glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, and cancer, particularly NHL, and then its decision to double down on its defense of Roundup in lieu of changing the product’s formulation or adding a warning label regarding the risk posed by Roundup demonstrates, at best, Monsanto’s indifference to or reckless disregard of the health of its customers.”

The Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles earlier this month issued new parole guidelines shortly after the Alabama Legislature made their funding contigent on their development. (File)The Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles earlier this month published an updated version of parole guidelines, weeks after the Alabama Legislature voted to make the board’s funding conditional on their development.
The state determines whether a person should be recommended for parole based on a a point system that accumulates based on a person’s predicted risk for recidivism and whether that person will endanger the public. If applicants receive a score of at least 8, the guidelines recommend they be denied. Under the proposed guidelines, With the proposed guidelines under consideration, the parole guidelines recommend that people be denied parole if they receive a score of 9 or higher.
The changes add weight to the crime committed by the applicant. Based on the current guidelines, those who commit the most severe crimes receive two points, but the updated guidelines increase it to four points. A severe offense using the current guidelines is given two points. That is the same number of points in the proposed guidelines for an offense characterized as moderate.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The new guidelines also use the Ohio Risk Assessment System or the Sex Offender Risk Assessment, which are the same as the current guidelines. However, the updated proposal does not consider a risk assessment from the Alabama Department of Corrections, the institution that most closely tracks the applicant’s behavior while incarcerated.
Messages seeking comment were left Tuesday with the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles and Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville, who chairs the Legislative Joint Prison Oversight Committee, and who has also criticized the parole board. Chambliss introduced the budget amendment that required the board to issue the new guidelines to receive funding.
The parole guidelines remain voluntary, and members of the parole board have the authority to deny parole to applicants even though the guidelines recommend they be afforded parole.
Some legislators and criminal justice advocates Tuesday had specific problems with some of the criteria, such as weighing the severity of the crime more heavily than in the past to other factors, from a person’s age to the risk assessment from the Alabama Department of Corrections. Those considerations were not included in the new guidelines.
Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, a longtime critic of the board’s relatively low parole rates, said Tuesday the new guidelines seemed aimed at increasing the board’s “conformance rate,” or the frequency at which its decisions align with parole guidelines. The board’s rate has been at roughly 20% for the past several years.
“I think it is unfortunate the new guidelines don’t take into account all the things that some of the applicants have done in order to gain their freedom,” he said.
England also called it “odd” that Corrections’ assessment was not included.
“The Department of Corrections basically allows someone to work unsupervised everyday offsite and leave for 72 hours at a time and earn that trust from the Department of Corrections, that the Board doesn’t appear to take that into account,” he said.
Others said the guidelines do not capture factors that weigh in the applicants’ favor, particularly in the section that measures an applicant’s behavior while incarcerated. According to the proposed guidelines, a person can receive points for sanctions for both violent and nonviolent actions known as disciplinaries within the past 12 months.
“There are people who have not gotten any disciplinary infractions for the past 10 years or five years and that hard work will not count in their favor for parole,” said Carla Crowder, executive director of Alabama Appleseed, a criminal justice reform organization. “The restriction to evaluating only 12 months of institutional behavior then serves as a disincentive to follow the rules over the long term.”
Another concern is the re-entry plan. Applicants will receive a penalty totaling either one or two points if they submit a reentry plan that is not complete. But to submit a completed reentry plan, it must include both work and home plans.
“It is very difficult for people to gain employment if they are still incarcerated,” Crowder said, explaining that the lack of a job plan should not count against someone, especially people who have no access to online resources to apply for employment or to reentry staff to assist them in that process.
By that logic, applicants will automatically be awarded at least one point counted against them for parole.
Critics also say the guidelines penalize  applicants if anyone from the public, regardless of whether they are the victim or not, speaks against them. The Alabama Attorney General’s Office as well as a staff member from Victims of Crime and Leniency (VOCAL), a victims’ rights group, regularly attend the parole hearings to oppose parole.
Oftentimes, VOCAL does speak with the applicant and bases their recommendations solely on the person’s criminal record.
“Also, all the evidence suggests that a person’s chances of committing another crime decreases dramatically with age, and there is no section in the parole guidelines where old age is a factor,” Crowder said. “This is a missed opportunity.”
Criminal justice reform advocates, and more recently legislators, have been increasingly concerned with a dramatic decrease in the number of paroles the board has granted in recent years.
There will be a public comment period on the proposed updates for the next month. If a legislator has an issue with the proposals, the person can ask that they be reviewed by the Legislative Council who can either reject them entirely, amend them, or accept them.

Gov. Garlin Gilchrist said that his campaign would build off his record of work in all 83 Michigan counties. 
“I think people from Detroit, just like people from all across Michigan, want to have a governor who is able to speak to the moment going forward. We are in an era where the economy is quickly evolving, where the support from the federal government, from [President Donald Trump’s] administration, is dwindling and is causing danger for people, and I think we’re going to need the kind of leadership that can speak to that forcefully. And I’ve demonstrated my ability to do that,” Gilchrist told the Michigan Advance at the Mackinac Policy Conference on Tuesday.
Gilchrist pitched his vision of health, wealth and opportunity for the state, noting the shared anxiety of parents that their child will leave and never come home, while pointing to his own experience of growing up in Detroit, but then leaving the state for nine years to pursue a career in software engineering.  
With Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer unveiling the state’s Growing Michigan Together Council at the 2023 conference, which later issued a report outlining strategies to help address Michigan’s dwindling population and improve its economic competitiveness, Gilchrist said Michigan needs to be an answer for whatever any person’s next step may be.

He highlighted a need for affordable childcare, highlighting his work on the Caring for MI Future Program, which helped open and expand more than 3,600 child care programs in the state. For people with school age children, Gilchrist pointed to efforts to improve equity in the state’s education budget, offering $10,000 in funding per student. 
He also noted the importance of exposure to different career paths through things like career and technical education and internships, noting how his own exposure to engineering eventually led to his career. 
For those looking to pursue education after high school, Gilchrist pointed to efforts to provide Michigan residents with a free or reduced-cost education at a local community college, four-year university or trade school. He also called for continued support for Michigan’s higher education institutions. 
For those starting their career, Gilchrist highlighted his work to support entrepreneurship through the Michigan Innovation Fund.
“I think it’s about making sure that whatever your next step is, you can say yes to it in the state of Michigan,” Gilchrist said.
Moving from 2026 into 2030, Michigan is set to hit its first interim goal of 50% clean energy, building up to a 100% clean energy standard by 2040. However, with the federal government threatening to harm Michigan’s clean energy industry by ending most tax credits, Gilchrist said he would continue to support businesses and entrepreneurs in the clean energy sector, where he can, through policy, programs and investments. 
However, the federal government does have a role to play, he noted.
“I am deeply concerned that members of the Michigan delegation, [U.S. Rep.] John James (R-Shelby Twp.), the Republicans, they voted for something to come out of the House that would be damaging to our clean energy future,” Gilchrist said. 
“Michigan is going to need a governor going to continue to fight for that and prioritize it…That’s what I’ll do,” he said.

The following are more excerpts from the interview: 
Michigan Advance: The governor has kind of sought to find common ground with President Trump. If you were to take the governorship, would you consider a different approach, or would you continue to try and find that middle ground?
Gilchrist: I’m a solution builder and a problem solver, and the governor’s job is to work with every and any person who can make something happen for Michigan. And so she’s done that and has put points on the board as a result of it.
So as governor, I will work with any and everyone to make sure that Michigan can make progress. And I recognize that when someone attacks Michigan, attacks Michigan communities, attacks Michigan universities, that it is my responsibility as the person who has the interest of the state of Michigan as my interest, have to make sure we stand up for that too, and I’ll do that as governor.
Michigan Advance: Is there a disconnect in the rhetoric that we saw in 2024 about Trump is this huge threat to democracy, to all of these different things, and then the rhetoric that we’re seeing this year about finding common ground with him?
Gilchrist: There is no disconnect from the reality that Trump has been an absolute, not just a threat, but has frankly, trampled on, is ignoring court orders, is accepting $400 [million] airplanes. I mean, like this guy thinks the Constitution is a joke. He treats it like toilet paper. I think we were, you know, right to call that out and I think that still remains true, and I’ll continue to do that. 
At the same time. We also need to make progress in Michigan. I think you can protect our values, promote our values and make progress and that’s the kind of thing that I’ll do. Look, I’m an engineer. We find a way to make progress and make things work. And so that’s the kind of posture I’ll have.

(Jordan Gale/Oregon Capital Chronicle)After dropping to historic levels last year due to ongoing drought and high temperatures, hydropower generated in the Northwest is expected to rise slightly this year from much needed precipitation.
Hydropower in the region is expected to increase about 17% compared to last year, a welcome boost to growing energy demand, but will still be below the 10-year average, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Officials at the Energy Information Administration published their 2025 forecast on May 19, as well as annual expectations for water supplies in key river basins generating the hydroelectricity.
Overall hydropower generation in the U.S. is expected to rise 7.5% in 2025, which will also still keep overall hydropower generation below the 10-year average. Hydropower represents about 6% of the country’s electricity.
The increase in hydropower expected in 2025 is due in large part to above average precipitation in northern California, Oregon and eastern Washington during the past winter and this spring. Parts of southeast Oregon received record rainfall this spring, causing Gov. Tina Kotek in March to declare a state of emergency.
Despite the increased precipitation in some parts of the state, the Upper Columbia River Basin near Grand Coulee Dam in Washington will have a below-normal water supply this year when compared to the past 30 years, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Northwest River Forecast Center. Water supply will be about normal or above normal in the southern portion of the Columbia River, which includes the Snake River Basin.
Eleven Western states produce up to 60% of the country’s hydroelectricity. Washington, California and Oregon are the three largest contributors, with dams in Oregon and Washington producing more than one-third of all U.S. hydropower. About 40% of the electricity used in Oregon comes from the region’s hydroelectric dams.
But ongoing drought, periods of low precipitation and rising summer temperatures that melt mountain snowpack too quickly have led to lower-than-usual power generating capacity at dams in the West.
Both Oregon and Washington generated 20% less hydropower in 2023 than they did in 2021, and hydropower generation in the Northwest dropped to a historic 22-year low between Oct. 2022 and Sept. 2023. Hydropower generated in 2024 was the lowest it’s been since 2010, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.
The loss in generating capacity has cost the hydropower industry billions in revenue in recent years, according to researchers from the University of Alabama. The sector lost about 300 million megawatt hours of power generation between 2003 and 2020 due to drought and low water compared with the long-term average, equating to about $28 billion in lost revenue. Half of the drop in power generation was due to drought in Oregon, Washington and California.
In Oregon, the hydroelectricity sector is estimated to have lost more than $1.5 billion in revenue over those 18 years.

Can the public sector take on challenges, solve problems, do things? These questions have important stakes.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Brett Yates: Real progressives don’t privatize.","This commentary is by Brett Yates of Burlington.When Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government of Efficiency sought to take a meat cleaver to federal agencies, Burlingtonians — like many other Americans — protested. On the local level, using a different rhetoric, a Progressive administration has undertaken a surprisingly similar project, and so far, relatively few Queen City residents seem to have noticed.A proposed elimination of the city’s in-house recycling collection program, if it happens, may change that. On May 19, the Burlington City Council authorized the Department of Public Works to solicit price quotes for private hauling services.The potential shift takes place amid a broader municipal downsizing. On May 9, Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak laid off 18 city workers in an effort to narrow an $8-million gap between anticipated revenues and expenses for fiscal year 2026.The administration initially framed its plan to contract out for recycling collection as another money-saving measure, albeit one that would, by DPW’s April estimate, add perhaps as little as $50,000 to the city’s general fund. But it now exists fully outside of the mayor’s current cost-trimming process.That’s because, with privatization as yet uncertain, budget season has already begun. DPW expects the Council to fund the municipal program for another year and then, in July or August, to vote on whether to transfer those same dollars to a private company instead, as part of a three-to-five-year contract.In its voluntariness, the drive to privatize recycling offers a unique window into the politics of a mayor whose neoliberal instincts elsewhere have enjoyed an appearance of choicelessness, owing to the disappearance of the pandemic-era federal funding that sustained City Hall under her predecessor. In reality, Burlington’s crisis is not merely fiscal — it is a crisis of political identity.Lately, a statewide outrage against rising property tax bills has tested Burlington’s commitment to the generous public sphere for which the small city earned a national reputation. Voters rejected the last Town Meeting Day request for a general fund rate increase in 2022.Since then, ostensibly left-wing politicians have acceded to the conservative tax revolt, attributing their reluctance to challenge homeowners’ stinginess to what they describe as the unfair, regressive structure of the property tax and becoming champions of an “affordability” that excludes renters.The resulting slide toward austerity has, by now, taken on an ideological character. While lamenting individual firings, Mulvaney-Stanak has routinely characterized her broad strategy of cutbacks as a “right-sizing” of city government.Now, she may liquidate a 36-year-old public service for no clear reason beyond her own department head’s disinterest in identifying an internal solution to a labor shortage that has recently hobbled the program — better and easier, in the view of Director of Public Works Chapin Spencer, to hand the headache of hiring over to the experts at Casella Waste or Gauthier Trucking.News of the dire state of municipal recycling arrived at the City Council this spring in the form of such a proposal, representing the administration’s first thought, not its last resort. Exhausted workers, sick of pulling double-duty, have signed on, pleading for relief. In the absence of a ready-to-go alternative, a spiritless AFSCME local has, on their behalf, tacitly accepted the erosion of its bargaining unit.A new, nonunion workforce will presumably suffer many of the same indignities that DPW workers do now, enduring impossibly long hours and on-the-job injuries. But privatization will make these problems invisible. They’ll become someone else’s issue to deal with, not the mayor’s.Can the public sector take on challenges, solve problems, do things? These questions have important stakes. At every level of government, officials offer their responses.The Vermont Progressive Party has traditionally said yes. Given its social-democratic orientation, it couldn’t say otherwise. “We believe the economy should be democratically owned and controlled in order to serve the needs of the many, not to make profits for the few,” its official platform states.Yet its supporters appear hesitant to condemn Mulvaney-Stanak’s intention to deliver a public service to unaccountable, profit-making entities. On debateable procedural grounds, the Progressive State Committee tabled a resolution that would have called on the mayor “to prioritize maintaining the city’s utilities under public ownership” on May 17, signaling a reluctance to confront the party’s most prominent elected official.Mulvaney-Stanak, who campaigned for mayor primarily on a promise of “community safety” (as opposed to her opponent’s “public safety”), may view herself as a pragmatic problem-solver, not as an agent in the big-picture, historical struggle for economic justice imagined by her party’s platform.Yet one doesn’t have to think in historical terms to become part of history; unless it changes course, Mulvaney-Stanak’s administration will do so, in its minor way, on the side of Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, and Musk.Just as the Vermont Progressive Party still has a chance to reclaim its soul, so too do Burlingtonians have a chance to reclaim the soul of their city.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Brett Yates: Real progressives don’t privatize.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Commentaries_featured-image-25.png,,,2025-05-28 07:02:10.540712

(Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Republican Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith went toe-to-toe with constituents at a Zionsville town hall Tuesday night — defending his stance on bringing religion into his public post and concerns about “chemtrails.”
About 100 Hoosiers attended the event, though some left as the event stretched to two hours. The night featured numerous interruptions from both Beckwith and those in the audience. Loud boos and noes were repeatedly lobbed.
“If you shoot little snide remarks at me, I might just shoot them right back,” Beckwith said during one exchange.
After the event, Beckwith said he considered it a success.
“I’m not trying to win somebody over to my side of the argument. I’m just trying to say, hey, let’s dialogue. And I’m going to tell you what I believe, why I believe it,” he told reporters. “And, you know, I believe people are adults. They can make up their own minds after they hear what I say, and then you can let other people, you know, let their voices be heard as well.”
One attendee, Scott Johnson, read several laws and constitutional provisions about religion in government, noting that the U.S. Constitution contains no references to the Bible or Christianity.

“I don’t understand how you can swear an oath to the Constitution and then violate it,” he said. “Your word should mean something, sir.”
Another woman told Beckwith, who is a pastor, that Hoosiers are his constituents and not his congregants.
His response was to point out God is mentioned in the Declaration of Independence four times. The crowd audibly groaned when Beckwith said the separation of church and state is a myth and that “we are a Judeo-Christian nation.”
One woman, who declined to provide her name, was concerned about the preservation of farmland in Boone County and other areas.
“I too believe in free enterprise, in the capital market, but I also believe that we have a responsibility to be good stewards of our land,” she said, specifically mentioning the Indiana Economic Development Corporation buying up land for the contentious LEAP district.
Beckwith said he wants Gov. Mike Braun to clean house at the IEDC.
“I don’t know if you can save the IEDC at this point because people don’t trust it. People have seen the abuse that has gone on,” he said, adding that the LEAP project was “slammed down the throats of the people of Boone County.”
Another speaker pointed to Beckwith’s recent peddling of a conspiracy theory that aircraft are nefariously spreading dangerous substances in the condensation trails — so-called “chemtrails” — they leave in the sky. A second man said this is an issue that concerns him.
“You mentioned chemtrails and that’s got my attention,” Alex Sutherland said. “You look up at the sky today, it doesn’t feel like May. It didn’t at the Indy 500. I know they are spraying stuff out of those high-altitude jet planes.”
Beckwith praised Florida and Tennessee for passing legislation targeting weather modification. And he noted a bill filed in Indiana to levy huge fines on anyone putting chemicals in the air to impact weather.

“I think it’s worth looking into,” he said, adding, “If we find out it’s laughable then great.”
During the exchange, Beckwith called the crowd “leftist socialists.” One woman yelled back, “We’re Americans, not socialists.”
Property taxes also earned discussion after a man gave examples of inconsistent assessed values in communities.
“We dropped the ball on this,” Beckwith said about the recently passed property tax reform package.
He supports limiting property tax payments based on the purchase price of a home but acknowledged the problems can’t be fixed overnight.
“It’s going to take us longer than just a few months to untangle this mess,” Beckwith said.
About 30 protesters gathered outside before the town hall began. Many were carrying signs. One said “Lt. Gov. Beckwith. This is our state, not your church.” Another said he was “0/5 of a person” — referencing comments he made on the Three-Fifths  Compromise.
“Micah Beckwith is harmful to children,” Amy Garman, of Indivisible Central Indiana, told the crowd. She said Republicans have banned books and outed transgender kids “under the guise of parental rights.”

Now, states may lose their ability to raise or implement new taxes. North Memorial Health Hospital in Robbinsdale in Feb. 2021. Photo by Will Jacott/Minnesota Reformer.The tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week targets a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government. The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.

Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.

But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.

Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture earlier this month requested sensitive data from states about participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, including their Social Security numbers and addresses, in what it says is an effort to ensure program integrity.
That request has prompted concerns among privacy and hunger groups, who have argued it violates federal privacy law and data protections. 
Currently, information about the names of people receiving SNAP and their personal information is held only by states, not the federal government. Some states with Democratic governors, including Kansas and New Mexico, have refused to comply with the request, citing concerns surrounding its legality.
Alaska has said it will comply, as have Ohio and Iowa.
“It is normal course of business for Missouri to securely share information regarding federal programs with federal partner agencies,” said Baylee Watts, spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Social Services.
The social services department, Watts added, “does not anticipate any concerns and will coordinate with the USDA to ensure appropriate follow up is taken from the state level.” 
SNAP is a joint state-federal program: The federal government pays for benefits that states administer. 
There were 652,427 people receiving SNAP benefits in Missouri as of April — or roughly one in 10 Missourians.
The request for personal data came in a letter dated May 6 from the USDA, which oversees the program. It was signed by Gina Brand, the agency’s senior policy advisor for integrity.
The letter requests personally-identifiable information from SNAP recipients including names, dates of birth, addresses and Social Security numbers, along with total SNAP benefits received. 
The data is required to cover Jan. 1, 2020 to present. Each state is currently a “SNAP information silo,” the letter said.
The federal agency will use the data requested to “ensure program integrity,” which will include verifying eligibility, the letter states.
The action will “ensure Americans in need receive assistance, while at the same time safeguarding taxpayer dollars from abuse,” Brand wrote. 
If states don’t comply, federal funding could be withheld, the letter warned.
The letter cited an executive order by President Donald Trump requiring that federal agencies “take all necessary steps” to ensure the federal government has “unfettered access to comprehensive data from all state programs that receive federal funding,” including data held by third-party entities.
The goal of such efforts, according to the executive order, is to “detect overpayments and fraud.” 
The Department of Government Efficiency — part of the executive branch under Trump — reportedly has used that order to combine personal data collected from several agencies to help the federal government track and arrest immigrants for deportation.
USDA didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from The Independent but previously told NPR: “All personally identifiable information will comply with all privacy laws and regulations and will follow responsible data handling requirements.”
A spokesperson for Fidelity Information Services, a vendor Missouri contracts with to distribute SNAP benefits, said by email that the company is “committed to safeguarding privacy and ensuring rigorous standards for data protection and compliance” and that it is “supporting the USDA and our state partners in their efforts to determine next steps.” 
A lawsuit filed last week by SNAP participants, a privacy organization and national hunger organization argued the request violates federal privacy laws and skirts safeguards designed to protect participants’ data. The lawsuit asked a federal court to halt the data collection.
The lawsuit, plaintiffs wrote, seeks to ensure that the federal government “is not exploiting our most vulnerable citizens by disregarding longstanding privacy protections, depriving the public of critical information regarding data collection and protections, and eviscerating the public’s right to comment on the mass collection and consolidation by the federal government of sensitive, personal data of tens of millions of individuals who rely on federal food assistance benefits.”

Kathy Castor stands next to Jennifer Nicholson speaking about the proposed cuts to the SNAP benefit program in St. Petersburg on May 27, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/ Florida Phoenix)Here are some of the consequences that will follow if Congress cuts a key federal nutrition program, as proposed in the U.S. House’s version of Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.”
“I won’t be able to get healthy foods like I am right now, as I have health issues,” said Peggy Shannon, 70, who lives in a senior rental apartment complex, whose only other income comes from her monthly Social Security check.
“The SNAP program helps provide all of that for me,” said Shannon, who described becoming “very depressed” upon learning of the potential cuts to the program, which still must go through the U.S. Senate before becoming law.
“Receiving SNAP benefits does help, especially if you’re trying to get your education or if you’re income is not where it needs to be,” said Jennifer Nicholson, a partially disabled single mother of four who is allowed to work a certain number of hours per month.
“Kids eat, especially with the summer months coming. They’re going to be home and they’re going to eat more and more. So cutting SNAP at this time would be very hard for some people,” she added.
SNAP means Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, cuts to which could cause nearly 3 million Floridians to lose access to federal food assistance, Tampa Bay area Democratic Rep. Kathy Castor and social service advocates warned during a press conference featuring the two women in St. Petersburg on Tuesday.
The program provides low-income people and families with financial assistance to pay for groceries. It’s funded through a combination of federal and state resources. The federal government now pays 100% of SNAP benefits, while the states and the feds share the administrative costs.
Included in the major tax bill advocated for by the Trump administration, and passed last week in the U.S. House, is a mandate that states pay between 5% and 25% of monthly SNAP benefit costs based on each state’s payment error rates (which reflect the amount of underpayments and overpayments.)
Florida’s error rate in 2023 was 12.6%, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That puts the state on the hook for 25% of the costs, or $1.6 billion in 2028 alone, if the bill were to take effect, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP).
And all states would also have to increase their portion of administrative costs from 50% to 75%.
Whether Florida’s Republican-led Legislature would be willing to fill that gap is questionable, and Castor isn’t optimistic.
“Part of the proposal is to say that, ‘Well, we’re not really cutting everyone, we’re just asking states to provide more money,’” she said.
“We know here in the state of Florida we have an unfortunate track record that often comes when the feds say we’re backing off,” she added.
“Part of the responsibility here in the state of Florida, a state without an income tax, and one where we don’t want an income tax, means that you have to be good stewards of the tax dollars that are there, and right now I would question if they are fundamental good stewards of our tax money as they send more money off to private, for-profit charters,” she said.
Deficits forecast
In addition, Florida economists project budget deficits starting as early as the summer of 2026 — another potential obstacle for the Legislature to get involved in increasing its share to SNAP.
More than 59% of SNAP participants in Florida are in families with children, and more than 41% are in families with older adult or disabled members, according to the CBPP.
Citing U.S. Department of Agriculture data, the Florida Policy Institute estimates that 99,000 veterans in Florida participate in the SNAP program. FPI bills itself as an independent nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing state policies and budgets that improve the economic mobility and quality of life for all Floridians.
U.S. House Agriculture Committee Chairman Glenn Thompson praised the restrictions on SNAP after the proposal passed his committee earlier this month. A spokesperson for Thompson told Newsweek that SNAP spends more than $13 billion per year in erroneous payments.
Among the new requirements in the bill are expanding work requirements for “able-bodied adults without dependents” to people up to age 64, from the existing gap of 59. Also, administrative requirements would increase, including more stringent identity and income documentation.
“What we know about SNAP in particular is that most people are working. Or they’re on a pathway, as you heard from [the people who spoke today] to get there,” said Castor.
The Tampa Bay area representative labels the legislation “the billionaire giveaway bill.” She says it increases bureaucratic hoops that will make it more difficult for people to collect benefits, adding that because individuals have busy lives they might miss one of those reporting periods.
“Which would mean that they would lose their food assistance, and that’s what Republicans in Congress are banking on, because the independent Congressional Budget Office [CBO] did an analysis … that says that all those bureaucratic barriers do nothing to reform the system, they simply work to kick people off, and that’s where they achieve savings to give the billionaire tax breaks,” she said.
Budget impasse
The Florida Legislature, which is in the midst of budget impasse, fueled by disagreement over the amount of tax relief to pass and how much money the state should spend, has not discussed what the loss of SNAP funding would mean to the state.
Florida Republican members of Congress are hailing the passage of the bill, noting other provisions of the measure.
“No tax on tips; No tax on overtime; Permanently Secures the Border; Largest Deficit Reduction in 30 years; Ends Taxpayer-Funded Healthcare for illegals,” U.S. Rep. and gubernatorial candidate Byron Donalds noted in a social media message last week.
“Huge win! The House just passed the Big Beautiful Bill — lower taxes and bigger paychecks,” South Florida U.S. Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar said in a video posted on X. “Your wallet just got a raise!”
Florida U.S. Sen. Rick Scott is reported to be concerned about the fiscal implications of the Trump tax bill, which economists have said could raise the federal deficit by at least $3 trillion.
“I want to get a deal done; I support the president’s agenda. I support the border, I support the military, I support extending the Trump tax cuts — but we have to live in reality. But we got to live in reality here: We got a fiscal crisis,” Scott said, according to The Hill.

She alleged the Idaho Attorney General’s Office retaliated against her after she raised ethical concerns related to her clients’ legal representation.

 Judge: ‘Answers can only be provided by the Attorney General himself’

The judge previously limited Labrador’s in-person deposition to last up to two hours. Labrador’s deposition is scheduled for this week, court records show.
“When neither party is providing the Court with testimony from someone other than the Attorney General answering these questions, it is easy to conclude that the answers can only be provided by the Attorney General himself,” Medema wrote in his ruling Friday.

Labrador’s office could not be immediately reached for comment. In a written statement, an attorney for Huang said they look forward to hearing what Labrador says.
“The Court again gave thoughtful consideration to the arguments made by Mr. Labrador and decided that Mr. Labrador must appear to give deposition testimony next week. It’s the right decision,” Huang’s attorney Guy Hallam told the Sun on Friday. “Mr. Labrador is the one who took adverse actions against Ms. Huang and should have to answer questions about why he did so. We look forward to hearing what he has to say.”
Previously, Idaho Attorney General Office’s spokesperson Damon Sidur said the office has maintained Huang’s termination “was based on legitimate, work-related performance issues.”
 Huang represented Idaho Dept. of Health and Welfare on scrutinized grants. Judge blocks investigation questions in deposition.

The lawsuit ties back to an investigation the Idaho Attorney General’s Office launched in early 2023 into how $72 million in child care grants were distributed by the Department of Health and Welfare. 
Idaho judge orders AG Labrador to be deposed in whistleblower lawsuit

Huang wrote legal guidance to Health and Welfare — which Labrador’s office later withdrew — that found the agency’s administration of the grant funds was legally sound. A 2023 state audit found issues in the grant distribution and spending. 
Judge Medema also limited the questions that plaintiff’s attorneys can ask Labrador in deposition, including preventing them from asking about “the Attorney General’s thought processes and reasons for his office having undertaken various official actions, what investigations to conduct or not, and what enforcement actions to conduct or not … (and) about his reasons for making certain statements to the press.”
“However, this Court did permit Plaintiff’s counsel to examine the Attorney General about why he chose to fire (Huang) where his office admits he made that decision, not someone else, and the person designated to testify on behalf of the (Attorney General’s) Office could not explain what documentation the Attorney General considered when he made it,” Medema wrote in his ruling Friday.
Labrador’s office also requested permission to appeal the judge’s previous partial rejection of a protective order in the case to the Idaho Supreme Court. The status of that appeal motion is not immediately clear. 
 Judge rejects Labrador’s attempt to apply higher legal standard that generally shields public officials from deposition demands

Labrador’s office has argued Huang hasn’t met a high legal standard, under an “extraordinary circumstances test,” meant to prevent government officials from being deposed in lawsuits.
“The Attorney General has a duty to serve the people of Idaho, and that work should not be interrupted by a deposition that imposes an undue burden or is not justified under the circumstances,” Idaho Chief Deputy Attorney General Phil Broadbent told the Sun in a written statement before a court hearing early last week. 
But the judge wrote even if he used the test Labrador’s office proposed, it wouldn’t have changed the result.
“Because several versions of the extraordinary circumstances test applied by other courts are not fundamentally different than the test this Court applied … and because the result would be the same even if the Court did apply some version of that test, the motion to quash is Denied,” Medema wrote. 
 Judge sanctioned Idaho AG’s Office for Labrador missing earlier deposition date. AG’s Office says plaintiff’s attorneys knew he was out of town.

The judge also previously sanctioned the Idaho Attorney General’s Office for Labrador’s failure to appear for his previously scheduled deposition — requiring the office to pay expenses related to Labrador’s deposition and Huang’s motion for sanctions. 
Ex-Idaho AG division chief was paid $26K for unused vacation. Then the office re-hired him.

Hours after the deposition was set to occur, the Attorney General’s Office filed a motion for a protective order that sought to stop Labrador from being deposed.
In legal filings, the Idaho Attorney General’s Office pushed back on that portrayal. 
Huang’s attorneys scheduled his initial deposition date on Feb. 14 “without first determining whether the Attorney General was available,” Jim Craig, a division chief in the Idaho Attorney General’s Office, wrote in support of Labrador’s motion to quash the subpoena. 
Labrador was already planning to be out of town that day, Craig wrote, and Huang’s attorneys knew that — and that Labrador’s office was planning to submit a legal filing for a protective order that sought to stop his deposition.
“Despite this fact, and despite knowing that the hearing on the protective order was scheduled” in March, Craig wrote, “Plaintiff’s counsel showed up for the February 14, 2025 deposition, knowing full-well that the Attorney General was not planning on attending and would be filing for a protective order. Plaintiff then feigned surprise and asked the Court for sanctions when the Attorney General was not there.”
Huang’s attorney Hallam said state law required Labrador to appear for his scheduled deposition, or before then file the motion for protective order.
“He did neither,” Hallam said. “We expect the Attorney General to follow the rules. So does the Court, which agreed that sanctions were appropriate.”
In October, Huang’s lawsuit is scheduled to go to a jury trial.

(Photo by Edwin J. Torres/N.J. Governor’s Office)The candidates running to become our next governor are making big promises to reform NJ Transit.
The six Democrats seeking their party’s nomination for governor on June 10 and the three Republican front-runners agree that the embattled public transit agency is broken, but they differ on what they’d do to address spotty service and funding problems.
Eight years ago, Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, began his first term pledging to fix NJ Transit even “if it kills me.” Since then, he has touted new, modern train cars and buses and a dedicated funding source via a new tax hike on businesses, but major delays, rising fares and a recent, four-day strike by train engineers have caused headaches for commuters.
Most candidates hoping to succeed Murphy said their top priority for NJ Transit is finding a financial fix. Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, a Democrat, criticized the new funding source — called the corporate transit fee — saying the “system and current structure from Phil Murphy’s not working.” Fulop said he would make that fee permanent.
“They only implemented it for five years, and you can’t capitalize or bond on five-year revenue, so you need to change that into perpetuity. It’s got to be in perpetuity,” said Fulop. 
Former state Sen. Steve Sweeney, a Democrat, said he would also make the fee permanent and would constitutionally dedicate the revenue from it to NJ Transit (the agency is expected to receive about $800 million from the fee in the next fiscal year). If that doesn’t happen, Sweeney said, lawmakers can take some of the revenue to plug holes in the state’s budget.
“That would be first and foremost because … you will see that money gone in three years if it’s not dedicated, and New Jersey Transit needs funding,” he said.
Sean Spiller, a Democrat and president of the statewide teachers union, said he also would stop transit funding from getting pulled into the state’s budget and repurposed for other projects. That would be key to funding improvements that make service better, he said.
“We’ve got to dedicate those dollars and use them to make the step-by-step improvements that we can map out then when we have that plan, and own that and live by that plan and keep people updated,” he said.
Republican state Sen. Jon Bramnick said he would turn to the federal government for funding help.
“We actually have infrastructure problems, and the major reform is you’ve got to get federal money on infrastructure. Otherwise, you’re going to continue to have serious problems. That’s the reform,” he said.
Candidates on both sides of the aisle hammered Amtrak for failing to maintain the tracks along the northeast corridor that are used by NJ Transit. Sagging catenary cables and aging signals on Amtrak’s lines are often assigned blame for NJ Transit’s delays, especially last summer.
NJ Transit gives Amtrak $200 million annually to rent the tracks, money Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a Democrat, said he would stop paying until the infrastructure problems are fixed. Gottheimer also said he would “immediately replace” NJ Transit’s aging trains and buses. 
“The broader point is to keep people safe … that’s why we need to fix these things,” Gottheimer said.
Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat, said she would “hold Amtrak accountable” for infrastructure upkeep but said her chief priority would be to spur more housing construction around transit stations.
“The long-term fix I would apply is transit-oriented development, which we’re doing to some extent, but really use that as a long-term funding mechanism so that we have a dedicated source of revenue for New Jersey Transit,” Sherrill said.
Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat, said NJ Transit is too focused on the commuters who travel between New Jersey and New York and Philadelphia. Baraka said he would require the agency to pay more attention to New Jerseyans who use its trains and buses to get around the Garden State.
“I think that’s important for us to do. Whether it’s the light rail in Hudson/Bergen or buses in Glassboro/Camden or from Atlantic City to Newark, we begin to focus on moving people up and down and around the state of New Jersey, and using some of the capital dollars that we have to do that, as opposed to widening these roads,” he said. 
Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican nominee for governor in 2021, said he would make NJ Transit part of a new Garden State Transportation Authority along with the Atlantic City Expressway, the Parkway, and the Turnpike, to bring the agency under more state control.
“It’d be better for accountability and transparency and a better management structure,” Ciattarelli said.
Bill Spadea, a Republican radio talk show host, said he’d monetize NJ Transit’s assets by giving the properties they own “back to the town” to be used as rateables. Spadea also said he’d “close the system” by requiring riders to show their tickets before boarding trains.
“That should be processed like they do at the MTA and others, where you can’t get on the platform until you show your ticket. That’s going to cut down on millions of dollars in lost revenue,” Spadea said.

Usually it’s a request for things, as a small but mighty staff of four journalists, that we just don’t have the flexibility to provide.
Reporting time, for one. With three to four months out of the beginning year tied up with covering the Idaho Legislature – a core mission for us here at the Idaho Capital Sun – as well as election seasons that can take a month out of our planning calendar before the primary election in May and another month before the general election in November, we very rarely have the luxury of time for truly long-term projects.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Financial support, for two. We’re a nonprofit here at the Capital Sun, which means we rely solely on donations large and small from readers like you to keep our lights on. Any written series worth doing and worth doing well requires not just investment in reporting time, but also travel costs like mileage and hotel stays to meet sources where they are. To do deep stories real justice, we need to experience and observe these Idaho spaces for ourselves. In this case, I would soon learn, we’d also need several hundred dollars worth of audio recording equipment.
And three? Institutional knowledge of the topic and experience with controversial issues. And for this series in particular, Idaho Capital Sun senior reporter Clark Corbin was sure going to need a lot of that. 
That’s because his story series idea – dubbed “Howl” – centers around the 30th anniversary of the reintroduction of wolves into Yellowstone National Park and Idaho, which might quite possibly be the most controversial topic the West has ever had to offer.
“Howl,” a  five-part print series and five-part podcast by the Idaho Capital Sun and Boise State Public Radio/NPR will launch Wednesday, June 4. Story installments will be released weekly each Wednesday morning at IdahoCaptialSun.com. Like all of our work, it will be available to any local news outlet to pick up for free with proper attribution. Podcast episodes will air on BoiseStatePublicRadio.org and are available on all the major podcast distributors, including the NPR app, Spotify and Apple Podcasts.

We’ll also co-host a live event that includes a panel discussion of three of our sources for this project: Former  U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Wolf Recovery Coordinator Carter Niemeyer, Wood River Wolf Project Co-Founder Suzanne Asha Stone, and Nez Perce Tribe Watershed Coordinator Marcie Carter. We’ll host the free event the evening of June 17 at Boise State University’s Special Event Center. Stay tuned for more details on this special opportunity to hear directly from the people who first brought wolves back to the West 30 years ago.
We can’t wait to start sharing this epic story – our most intensive reporting project to date –with all of you this summer. Here’s a bit more on how this massive project came to be.



“Howl” is the largest investment in time and resources we’ve put toward one project at the Idaho Capital Sun.

 Telling the story of wolves were reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park and the West, including Idaho

The second Clark said the word “wolves,” I knew we’d have our hands full. As a fifth-generation Idahoan with farmers on both sides of my family lines, and after being an Idaho reporter for the vast majority of my career, I immediately recognized just how sticky a subject they can be.
Wolves were extremely controversial in 1995 – when a team of biologists traveled to Canada to capture and bring the animals back to Yellowstone National Park and to the Lower 48 – and in 2025, 30 years later, they remain just as controversial still. 
Clark pitched to me a series of written stories and a multi-episode podcast by teaming up with Heath Druzin, an experienced audio reporter who has previously freelanced for us here at the Idaho Capital Sun. He’s a former war correspondent who covered the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and is the creator and host of the award-winning “Extremely American” podcast.

They wanted to spend weeks hiking through more than 20 miles of wilderness and drove more than 1,000 miles crisscrossing Idaho to interview sources directly in Yellowstone, the Frank Church-River of No Return Wilderness, the Nez Perce Reservation in North Idaho, and dang near everywhere in between. And they wanted to take even more time reviewing and researching all of the past articles, books and memoirs – as well as old film of the wolf captures – that dealt with the dozens of wolf-and-livestock related sources they’ve talked to for Howl.
They’d also need some financial help to pull all this off, they told me, including help with applying for grants to support the reporting, as well as a chunk of our not-so-sizable annual travel budget and a chunk of our finite freelance budget to support hiring a skilled photographer in Pat Sutphin. And they’d need some new audio equipment (and a few bucks for non-negotiable bear spray) to ensure the podcast was as clear and engaging as the written series.
So while I had my initial, with-good-reason reservations, I also recognized the history of the reintroduction of wolves to the American West  – and the impact the lineage that those wolves have on the West and Idaho today – is always a story worth pursuing. 
After having spent the last 14 months organizing trips across Idaho, editing and re-editing drafts of the written stories, reading podcast scripts and listening to the first iterations of the podcast episodes, I know I can safely say all those investments were well worth it.
In the written stories as well as the podcast episodes, we connect you with the sources who understand this issue better than anyone else: wildlife biologists, ranchers, Native American elders and tribal members, Idaho Fish and Game officials, Idaho Gov. Brad Little, and trappers. We take you right into the wilderness with us, with its sights, sounds and smells (and scat. They saw and tracked A LOT of scat.) 
We talked to wolf advocates who have spent decades of their lives following, documenting and trying to protect specific wolves in Yellowstone and across the West, and we’ve talked to people who have multi-generation ranches who have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars to wolf depredation. Importantly, we also talked to people like Suzanne Asha Stone of the Wood River Wolf Project, who has spent decades trying to bring all sides of the wolf debate to the table to find solutions – together.
We look not only into the past of how the U.S. government essentially exterminated all wolves from the Lower 48 in the 1920s and ‘30s, but into the present day by detailing how controlling the wolf population continues to be one of the most controversial issues facing the American West – and its future.
With all the time and resources we’ve put into this, I hope you like “Howl,” certainly, but I also hope you come away with a better understanding of our Western history and how we’ve come to be and live in such a special place that must find space for us: all of us.
We hope you’ll check it out June 4. Enjoy.

Ranch owner Eshelman wins extension to file petition for high-court review.
The post Hunters ready to fight for corner crossing in Supreme Court appeared first on WyoFile .","Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch on Tuesday gave Elk Mountain Ranch owner Fred Eshelman until July 16 to petition the court to review a corner crossing case that has implications for public lands access and private property rights across millions of acres in the West.
Meanwhile, a hunters group that’s been advocating for public access in the case says it’s ready should the legal fight reach the nation’s highest court.
Gorsuch was responding to a request by Eshelman’s counsel, Robert Reeves Anderson, that the Supreme Court extend a deadline for the petition. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a federal Wyoming judge’s decision that Eshelman cannot block people from corner crossing to reach public property.
If the Supreme Court takes this case, we’ll be ready because access for all is worth fighting for, all the way to the highest court in the land.” Patrick Berry
Without an extension, Eshelman had until June 16 to file a petition.
Corner crossing is the act of stepping from one piece of public land to another in the Western checkerboard landscape of public/private ownership. Corner crossers do not set foot on the kitty-corner pieces of private land, but they necessarily pass through the airspace above it.
Eshelman sued Missouri hunters Brad Cape, Zach Smith, John Slowensky and Phillip Yoemans, who corner crossed in 2021 (and without Smith in 2020), asking courts to declare that the men trespassed. They never set foot on Eshelman’s ranch.
Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, an advocacy group that has supported the hunters, is prepared. “If the Supreme Court takes this case,” Patrick Berry, president and CEO of BHA, said in a statement, “we’ll be ready because access for all is worth fighting for, all the way to the highest court in the land.”
Eshelman is likewise committed. “This case raises exceptionally important issues at the intersection of private property rights and public access,” his attorney wrote in the request for the deadline extension.
“The Tenth Circuit’s decision has vast reach, covering a huge portion of the roughly 300 million acres of checkerboard land and affecting landowners throughout the American West,” Anderson wrote. “This case seeks review of one of the broadest abrogations of private property rights in American history.”
Backcountry Hunters involved
Eshelman seeks to appeal a ruling by the 10th Circuit that affirmed Wyoming’s Chief U.S. Justice Scott Skavdahl’s conclusion that Eshelman could not block people from corner crossing. Skavdahl’s decision applied to the checkerboard area in Wyoming as long as corner crossers do not step on or damage private property.
By blocking corner crossing — either by erecting barriers or using threats, intimidation or lawsuits — a landowner can control public land enmeshed in private property.
Eshelman — a wealthy North Carolina pharmaceutical entrepreneur — is a hunter who enjoys elk and other hunting excursions on his wildlife-rich ranch. The Elk Mountain Ranch encompasses about 11,000 acres of public property only accessible by corner crossing, trespassing or with his permission.

The 1885 Unlawful Inclosures Act and subsequent case law prevent a landowner’s use of physical barriers, threats and even state trespass laws, to block access in the checkerboard, the 10th Circuit affirmed. The law, the ruling said, guarantees public access to public lands in the checkerboard — an ownership pattern that’s a relic of the 1800s railroad grant era, the appeals court said.
Congress passed the act to prevent settlers from erecting fences to incidentally appropriate public grazing land and water sources as their own. Subsequent court cases supported that broad notion.
The hunters “are ready to keep fighting for and defending public access to public lands,” their principal attorney, Ryan Semerad, said in a statement last week.
Anderson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the extension. Meanwhile, BHA has underlined its longstanding commitment to the hunters’ and the public’s cause.
“Corner crossing has always been about the right of the public to access the lands they own,” Berry said in a statement. “The 10th Circuit made it clear: stepping from one corner of public land to another is not a crime.”
“BHA has stood with the hunters from the outset,” the group said. With the help of the Wyoming BHA chapter, it raised more than $220,000 to fund the legal defense, the group stated. BHA also filed legal papers supporting the hunters.
The advocacy group seeks “a commonsense solution that recognizes private property rights and ensures access to millions of acres of public lands across the West,” its statement reads.
Here come Leo’s sheep again
In its decision, the 10th Circuit rejected Anderson and Eshelman’s arguments that a case known as Leo Sheep should prevail. In that 1979 ruling, the Supreme Court decided that the federal government did not have an implied easement to build a road across a checkerboard corner to provide easier access to the Seminoe Reservoir, also in Carbon County.
The Leo Sheep Company, a consortium of woolgrowers, derived its name from the community of Leo near the reservoir. It won the case against the federal road construction.
But the corner crossing case does not involve an implied easement, a permanent occupation of or a taking of private land, as was the case in Leo Sheep, the 10th Circuit said. Instead, the UIA allows a nuisance — the blocking of public access — to be abated or removed.
The 10th Circuit stated the case thusly.
“If a checkerboard landowner cannot impede access to public lands, then there is impliedly an access right.” Or, put another way by the court, “Iron Bar’s argument ignores that the reciprocal of preventing the right to exclude is to permit access.”
The 10th Circuit said other UIA cases prevailed instead of Leo Sheep. But 10th Circuit Judge Timothy Tymkovich wrote in the decision that the high court could again look at the woolgrowers’ 1979 case.
On that, Eshelman and Anderson may hang their Stetsons.
“The [10th Circuit] panel relied on Circuit precedent to distinguish this [Supreme] Court’s holding in Leo Sheep … that the United States [and the public] had no implied rights of way across private land in the checkerboard,” Anderson wrote. “In so doing, however, [10th Circuit] Judge Tymkovich invited this Court to ‘reconsider the scope of Leo Sheep as it applies to this case.’”

A panel called in federal experts to reassure the public about the safety of storing spent fuel after two bills that would have made exceptions to a state ban failed.
The post Wyoming lawmakers mull, again, allowing nuclear fuel waste appeared first on WyoFile .","After trying and failing to carve out more exceptions to Wyoming’s longstanding ban against storing radioactive nuclear power plant waste earlier this year, lawmakers will take another swing at gaining support for the idea. 
They’re particularly focused on clearing the way for Radiant Industries, which proposes manufacturing microreactors and “temporarily” storing their spent, radioactive fuel at a site near the towns of Casper and Bar Nunn.
After Senate File 186, “​​Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage,” went down in flames during this year’s legislative session, lawmakers on the joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee called in experts from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and U.S. Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory to answer questions about evolving safeguards and the industry’s track record.
In nearly 40 years of “dry cask” storage in the United States, “we have had zero release of radiation or radioactive material to the environment,” Idaho National Laboratory Used Fuel Management Department Manager Daniel Thomas told lawmakers last week in Casper. 
“Similarly, in transportation, we have moved [spent nuclear] fuel for several million miles on rail, on road, by boat, with zero accidents,” Thomas testified.

Those assurances, along with evolving federal safeguards, rang true for Lander resident William Almas, who offered his perspectives to the committee via Zoom.
Formerly part of a team that oversaw the decommissioning of the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant in California, Almas shares the same full faith in the safety and security of spent nuclear fuel in the nation. But that’s not the point, he noted. Such expert testimony won’t be, and it shouldn’t be, enough to convince others in Wyoming.
Health and safety concerns are valid, Almas said, particularly in a state that doesn’t yet host nuclear waste. All the pamphlets, slide decks and expert testimony in the world don’t matter a lick, Almas suggested, unless state leaders initiate a long conversation with residents that, ideally, is moderated by a “third party.”
“A key factor contributing to the lack of success of these projects is the failure of the community to reach consensus on the safety and the value of the projects,” Almas told the panel. “The facts must be clearly presented and discussed by an impartial third party, moving both the proponents and opposition in a forum for discussion.”
“We believe we are going to be a piece of the American energy independence work that’s going forward and it’s very relevant to the current administration’s focus on having the U.S. in a position of energy dominance.”Matt Wilson, Radiant Industries
Lawmakers on the panel nodded and noted the suggestion. The panel directed the Legislative Service Office to draft another version of SF 186 for further consideration when it meets again in July.
Radioactive hurdles
After decades of public opposition, Wyoming lawmakers tweaked statutes in 2022 to allow for storage of spent nuclear fuel — so long as it is associated with a nuclear power plant operating in the state. 
The move was made to accommodate TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant underway near Kemmerer. The “advanced” nuclear reactor will use liquid sodium for cooling. The plant, scheduled to begin operating in 2030, will generate a consistent 345 megawatts of power — enough energy to power about 250,000 homes — with a capability of ramping up to 500 megawatts for short periods of time, according to TerraPower. The reactor will use high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU) fuel.
Wyoming’s legal pathway for TerraPower to store its spent fuel on site is contingent upon the company receiving approvals from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which will oversee the plant’s operation and radioactive waste storage.

While SF 186 would have made another exemption to the state’s ban by allowing microreactor manufacturers such as Radiant to store spent fuel, House Bill 16, “Used nuclear fuel storage-amendments,” would have opened the door to commercial operations to potentially take the waste from nuclear power plants from all over the country. Both bills failed this year. Unless it’s a nuclear power plant operating in the state, like the Natrium power station, there’s no legal pathway for storing spent nuclear fuel here. State statute prohibits a commercial high-level radioactive waste facility, whether it’s spent fuel from a power plant from another state or a microreactor built in the state, as Radiant proposes, unless the federal government establishes a permanent repository.
That’s not likely to happen anytime soon, according to federal officials. It will take an act of Congress to resume efforts to establish one at Yucca Mountain, or anywhere else, according to Idaho National Laboratory’s Thomas, who worked for more than a decade on the Yucca Mountain project.
“Yucca Mountain has been defunded and is not being pursued,” Thomas said. If Congress were to direct the U.S. Department of Energy to resume the work, he added, “I would say that we are probably four or more decades off.”
That leaves Wyoming to consider whether to make another exception to its nuclear waste storage ban.
What’s at stake
The Wyoming Energy Authority and Wyoming Business Council are eagerly pursuing companies interested in reinvigorating the state’s uranium mines, hoping to launch a mining-to-reactor industry that becomes an integral piece of domestic energy security.

Rare Element Resources’ Bear Lodge Project in northeast Wyoming, to mine uranium ore and refine it, is well underway. That project has sparked interest among others on the nuclear fuel supply side to join the effort in the Equality State.
Having a nearby supply of refined uranium ore gives a leg up to companies like Radiant and BWXT Advanced Technologies that want to build portable microreactors here and deploy them to industrial customers throughout the nation and world, according to the companies. BWXT, with a matching grant from the state, is already building a nuclear reactor component supply chain among existing fabrication shops here. Though BWXT is still exploring whether to set up an actual microreactor manufacturing shop in Wyoming, Radiant proposes a manufacturing facility just outside of Bar Nunn. Further, it plans to fuel the reactors onsite, then store the spent fuel at the same location.
“We believe we are going to be a piece of the American energy independence work that’s going forward and it’s very relevant to the current administration’s focus on having the U.S. in a position of energy dominance,” Radiant Director of Operations Matt Wilson told lawmakers. “But when you look at other countries — Russia, China — they are well ahead of us when it comes to projects not just in the pipeline, but coming on every year. And that’s not just on the advanced reactor side. That’s on the nuclear fuel supply chain as well.”
Gillette Republican Rep. Christopher Knapp, who opposed SF 186 earlier this year, said the constituents he hears from are still overwhelmingly wary of nuclear reactors and storing nuclear fuel waste in the state. More public education and engagement are needed, he said, as well as details from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission about containment measures should there be an “episode” at a nuclear facility.
“I would recommend that we reach out and ask for testimony so that we can have all sides of a picture before we make decisions on things,” Knapp said.
The joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee will take up the issue again when it meets July 29-30 in Casper.

Opinion

He (my preferred pronoun) can reach into the junk drawer of his noggin, pull out something that he started but didn’t finish, comb its hair, douse it with aftershave and submit it as “commentary.”
It’s a tried-and-true trick that requires a bit of the ol’ soft shoe, a fast pair of hands, and ultimately, deception. But the editors don’t care as long as it slides over the transom under the deadline and within word limits, and the audience eats it up like bacon-flavored ice cream.
Sometimes I feel like I’m cheating when I do it. Other times, I have sugarplum visions of Pulitzers and a WTF moment.
It’s times like this, when my Muse has dumped me again to run off to Belize with her Jamaican cabana boy, that I realize that I am all alone with the King’s English and damn little to say. So it’s up to me alone to make our language dance like she’s in heat, or pull out his switchblade and gut you with words. I wouldn’t have it any other way.
So I’ll offer up a recent memory about the time I learned that I am no longer street legal.
It all started the other day when I ran out of Copenhagen. I drove to the C-store desperately jonesing, while Good Dog Henry rode shotgun and scanned the street for doggies, squirrels or anything he could bark at. My driver’s side turn blinker was out, so we had to resort to a series of right turns to get where we were going. That itself is probably probable cause for a bust that would hold up in court.
But Good Dog Henry and I are blessed with primo road karma, and we made it to the Copenhagen dispensary without being touched by the long arm of the law. So far, so good.
It was training day behind the counter, so when I asked for a roll of the Most Efficient Nicotine Delivery System On The Planet, the newbie cashier asked for my ID. Tobacco sales to minors are verboten in our quaint little village (a policy with which I disagree, but I am about as far from adolescence as a man can get and still be alive), so I tossed down my driver’s license like a good law-abiding citizen.
She examined my license through thick glasses, then scanned the back of it. “This license expired three years ago,” she informed me, “I can’t sell you any Copenhagen.”
Like I said, I have great cop karma and hadn’t had occasion to pull out my license for quite some time. I examined it myself, and the li’l gal was right. I looked her square in the eye with my grizzled beard and wrinkled Boomer visage, and said, “Does this look like a Gen-Z face to you? Hell, I have boots older’n you.”
But she wouldn’t budge. The law is the law.
It must have been the nicotine withdrawals talking when I patted my pockets and told the trainee clerk, “I have a note from my mom. She says it’s OK for me to chew this stuff.” She just shook her purple-haired head.
Good Dog Henry greeted me with his tongue lolling out and his flews drooling when I got back to the truck. He wanted a pinch of chaw between his lip and gum as badly as I did. “No dice, pard,” I told him. “We need to wait for the next shift.”
We corkscrewed our way back home, making right turn after right turn, to stare blankly at the walls for a few hours until there was a cashier on duty who would sell contraband to an undocumented cowboy and his dog.
So there you have it.
I wanted to write something with political heft — the box score of the culture war, or a clever dispatch from the battlefield of ideas. But I suffered a severe case of writer’s block, and was forced to resort to that ol’ Ace in the Hole. And quite often, what that consists of is nothing more than giving the world enough time to sort itself out around me.

(Seksan Mongkhonkhamsao/Getty Images)The Louisiana House of Representatives approved a bill Tuesday that would require insurance companies to let homeowners purchase “stated value” policies, which cover the home for an amount they declare rather than for its full market value.
House Bill 356, sponsored by Rep. Jacob Braud, R-Belle Chasse, cleared the chamber in a 79-20 vote and will head to the Senate for consideration. 
Braud said his proposal would allow people who do not have a mortgage to purchase a more affordable homeowner’s policy. Some homeowners prefer to take on the added risk of having to come out of pocket for damages if it allows them to pay less in homeowner insurance premiums now, he added.
“The premium costs have just been through the roof,” Braud said, citing what many of his constituents have said about their policies.
He and several of his colleagues championed the bill as a pro-consumer measure. 
Rep. Tim Kerner, R-Lafitte, said Braud’s legislation might be the only one this year that actually helps homeowners with affordability.  
“The downside is that if something happens to their home during a hurricane, they’re not gonna be able to replace it if it goes down,” Kerner told Braud on the House floor. “Well, let me tell you something, I know people losing their houses now.”
Rep. Gabe Firment, R-Pollock, opposed the bill’s mandate that all residential property insurers in the state create such policies upon request. Firment, who chairs the House Committee on Insurance, has spearheaded many of the tort reform bills this session in an effort to reduce premiums.  
“If we mandate every insurance company in the state to provide this product, I think people in South Louisiana will use it,” Firment said. “They’ll be sold a bill of goods without understanding because they’re desperate.”
Firment said he believes the proposal would shift insurance costs to other parts of the state and lead to an increase in blighted property from people abandoning their damaged homes after storms.
This legislative session, lawmakers have largely addressed Louisiana’s insurance crisis on the auto coverage front, passing a package of so-called “tort reform” bills that give insurance companies certain protections or advantages in litigation, making it harder for accident victims to file successful lawsuits. 
Braud’s bill is one of the few proposals that addresses the other component of the crisis: the skyrocketing cost of homeowner insurance that has mostly affected South Louisiana. The only way to truly address the crisis was to make the provisions of his bill mandatory, he said.
“It was clear to me that the insurers did not care to make this product,” Braud said, adding that he believes it would mostly be purchased in extreme cases. 
Insurers would only have to offer a stated value policy at a homeowner’s request, rather than make it a default level of coverage.
The proposal moves next to the Senate for consideration.

Wisconsin advocates said Tuesday the provision is likely to reduce Medicaid enrollment — not because people don’t qualify […],"The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) website for enrolling in Medicaid and other state benefits programs. (Screenshot)Among changes to Medicaid tucked in the federal reconciliation bill that passed the U.S. House last week is one that requires participants in the state-federal health plan for the poor to prove they’re eligible every six months.
Wisconsin advocates said Tuesday the provision is likely to reduce Medicaid enrollment — not because people don’t qualify but because of administrative errors and confusion.
Under current state and federal law, people covered by Medicaid must have their eligibility confirmed every year. Eligibility depends on various factors, chief among them household income. People whose Medicaid services are tied to a disability undergo an annual evaluation to determine whether their disability still qualifies them.
“We already do a really good job about making sure that everybody who’s in Medicaid is already eligible to be there,” Tamara Jackson, policy analyst and legislative liaison for the Wisconsin Board for People with Developmental Disabilities, said in an interview.
Checking eligibility more frequently isn’t likely to uncover more people who are enrolled in Medicaid and don’t qualify, Jackson said: “It will lead to a different result because people who are eligible for the program are losing coverage because they didn’t get the paperwork in on time.”
“It’s going to probably result in kicking people off the program — some of it through error and some of it just benign neglect,” said Bobby Peterson, executive director of ABC for Health. The nonprofit is a public interest law firm that assists people navigating the health care system get coverage and address problems such as medical debt.
“It’s part of a blizzard of paperwork to keep people off the program,” Peterson said of the twice-yearly Medicaid eligibility test. “And it’s not necessarily going to be very effective in maintaining program integrity.”
He said Medicaid participants are already required to report changes in their income that could change whether they’re eligible.  
“It’s calculated to deter people from staying with the [Medicaid] program,” Peterson said. “It’ll leave more people out and less people covered, more people uninsured.”
 
  Federal fallout
 As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.


With fewer people covered by health insurance, that could lead to “higher rates of medical debt, higher rates of uncompensated care, and then the socialization and redistribution of all that medical debt onto everybody else’s [health care] bill,” Peterson said. “So, it’s a lose-lose proposition.”
The House Republican majority drafted the reconciliation legislation in order to extend tax cuts enacted in 2017 during President Donald Trump’s first term.
The bill’s tax cuts largely benefit higher-income households, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The bill’s spending cuts to Medicaid and other programs, including federal nutrition aid, were included to reduce the tax cuts’ impact on the federal deficit.
In Wisconsin, about 1.3 million people are covered by Medicaid, according to the state Department of Health Services (DHS). About 900,000 are enrolled in BadgerCare Plus, which provides primary health care for families and single adults with incomes below the federal poverty guidelines. Another 250,000 are in one of several Medicaid programs for long-term care for people with disabilities or the elderly, and the rest are in other specialized programs.  
The change in how often Medicaid recipients must qualify for the program is just one of many changes in the program under the House reconciliation bill.
In a report produced in late April before the bill’s passage, the state Department of Health Services (DHS) calculated that its proposed Medicaid changes could cost Wisconsin up to $16.8 billion over the next date.
Current federal Medicaid regulations forbid states from determining a person’s eligibility more often than once a year. The House reconciliation bill would effectively override that rule.
A requirement to check every Medicaid recipient’s eligibility twice a year was part of state legislation that Wisconsin Republican lawmakers introduced earlier this year. That bill was met with sweeping criticism at a public hearing in April and has not advanced in the state Legislature.
Supporters of the change have argued that more should be done to reduce fraud in  the Medicaid program. But health care experts contend that the Medicaid cuts in the House bill are unlikely to address genuine fraud.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government temporarily suspended the annual Medicaid renewal requirement to ensure that people had health coverage and would seek medical help if they felt sick.
“Obviously if there’s a public health emergency, you want to maintain connections and access to health care and coverage,” Peterson said. Some people may have been still covered under Medicaid after they were no longer eligible, he added, and some “didn’t even know they had Medicaid or BadgerCare Plus in addition to some private insurance at various times.”
Nevertheless, “it wasn’t like there was wide-scale fraud” in the Medicaid program, Peterson said. “There’s very little evidence of a lot of consumer-related fraud in the program.”

(Allison Allsop / Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Legislature has unanimously approved a bill that grants a wish list of retirement reforms state higher education employees put forward, though it lacks one enticement faculty and staff consider critical to keeping them on campus. 
House Bill 24 by Rep. Tony Bacala, R-Prairieville, passed the Senate on a 36-0 vote and had previously cleared the House on a 97-0 vote. It next goes to Gov. Jeff Landry for his approval. 
Bacala’s bill expands eligibility for the Teachers Retirement System of Louisiana (TRSL) to include faculty at the state’s community and technical colleges. It also extends the period when employees can switch from a “portable” retirement plan to the fixed, pension style plan offered to most state employees.
Qualifying campus faculty and employees will have seven years, instead of the current five years to choose between the two plans, aligning it with the typical timeline it takes for professors to earn tenure. 
Bacala’s bill incorporates most of the recommendations from a Board of Regents task force he helped form.
An increase in employer contributions to TRSL retirement plans was among the most anticipated portions of Bacala’s bill. In its original state, it would have increased the minimum employer contribution to portable plan accounts from 6.2% to 8% of employee pay. 
The contribution bump was removed from the bill because it would have increased state spending more than $11 million annually, and the legislature is trying not to add to state spending amid uncertain fiscal times. 
Bacala said he would try to address this provision in future legislation. 
Last year, lawmakers gave certain higher education employees a limited window to switch from the portable plan to defined benefits. According to the Board of Regents, 795 applied for the change as of the end of 2024. 
Nearly 7,000 college and university faculty and staff members are enrolled in the state’s “portable” or optional retirement plan that allows them to take their accrued benefits with them if they choose to leave the state for another job.

The city is located in Loudoun County, which has been dubbed “Data Center Alley."" (Gerville | Getty Images)As a child, Nikki Forrester dreamed of living in a cabin in the woods surrounded by mountains, trees, water and the outdoor opportunities that came with the natural land. In 2022 — four years after earning her graduate degree and moving to Tucker County from Pittsburgh — Forrester and her partner made that dream a reality when they bought two acres of land near Davis, West Virginia to build a home.
Forrester has thrived in the small mountain town known for its mountain biking, hiking, stargazing, waterfalls and natural scenery. She and her partner moved into their new home in February. Hiking and biking trails are right outside her front door. In the winter, she said, snow piles up making the nearby mountains look like “heaven on Earth.” 
It’s been quite literally a dream come true.
“I feel like I’ve never felt at home so much before. I love being in the woods. I love this community. It’s super cheesy, but this was my childhood dream and now it’s actually come true,” Forrester said. “It felt so good to set down roots here. We knew Davis was where we wanted to start our future.”
But in March, one small public notice posted in the Parsons Advocate — noticed by resident Pamela Moe, who scrambled to find answers after seeing it — changed Forrester’s assumptions about that future. 
A Virginia-based company, Fundamental Data, was applying for an air permit from the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection for what it called the “Ridgeline Facility.” The company’s heavily redacted application showed plans to build an off-the-grid natural gas power plant between Thomas and Davis. That power plant will likely be designed to power an enormous data center just a mile out from Tucker County’s most populous and tourist-attracting areas.
Earlier this month, representatives for Fundamental Data — who did not respond to requests for comment on this article — told the Wall Street Journal that the facility could be “among the largest data center campuses in the world,” spanning 10,000 acres across Tucker and Grant counties if fully realized.
Now, Forrester said, she and her neighbors are in the middle of what feels like a “fight for [their] lives” as they attempt to learn more about the vague development plans and fight against “big data.” 
Her images of the future — skiing on white snow, hiking through waterfalls, looking up at clear and starry nights all with one-of-a-kind mountain scenery below — now exist in the shadows of a looming natural gas plant, an industrial complex and the contaminants that could come with them. The fresh, mountain air that surrounds her home and community could be infiltrated by tons of nitrogen oxide (gases that contribute to smog), carbon monoxide, particulate matter and other volatile organic compounds, per the company’s air permit application.
“Honestly, I feel like if this happens, it will destroy this place. People come here because it’s remote, it’s small, it’s surrounded by nature. If you have a giant power plant coughing up smoke and noise pollution and light pollution, it puts all of those things in jeopardy,” Forrester said. “It would honestly make me question whether I would want to live here anymore, because I do love the landscapes here so much, but they would be fundamentally altered and, I think, irreparably harmed if this actually comes to be.”
Tucker United and a fight against the many ‘unknowns’
Since learning of the project in March, Forrester and dozens of other Tucker County residents have banned together and formed Tucker United. The residents — all volunteers — want answers from Fundamental Data or anyone else regarding details of the proposed Ridgeline facility.
But that fight hasn’t been easy. The state DEP has allowed Fundamental Data — a company with little to no information publicly available — to submit a redacted air permit application, omitting details regarding potential air pollutants that could come from the site.
  A heavily redacted page from Fundamental Data’s air permit application to the state Department of  Environmental Protection.
According to reporting in Country Roads News, local officials were unaware of the project before reporters and members of the public brought it to their attention.
Reading the Wall Street Journal article was the first time most residents were alerted about the potential size of the planned development.
Josh Nease, who lives outside of Thomas and Davis in an unincorporated part of Tucker County, said the unknowns about the project have been the most frustrating part to grapple with.
“There’s no lack of uncertainty right now, that’s for sure,” said Nease, a sixth generation West Virginian who moved to Tucker County after spending vacations there as a child growing up in Bridgeport. “I think the unknowns here are really worrying.”
If given the chance, he would want to ask representatives of Fundamental Data the following questions: Why the lack of transparency? Why does the company want to locate in Tucker County and why not further out from the towns? And why does it feel like there’s resistance against working with the local governments and community members? 
Luanne McGovern, an engineer by trade who owns property in Tucker County and who sits on the board of West Virginia Highlands Conservancy, an environmental nonprofit in the region, holds similar frustrations to Nease.
Per the permit application, the Ridgeline facility — in its currently proposed form — would use gas-fueled turbines with heat recovery steam generators. Diesel would be kept on site in three 10 million gallon storage tanks as a backup power source in case of gas line interruptions. Those tanks would be 66 feet tall and 180 feet in diameter. Leaks from pumps and valves, among other pieces of equipment, are to be expected per the application. Operations for the facility should begin by 2028.
When residents started working together to make sense of Fundamental Data’s air permit application, they asked McGovern to look it over and share her thoughts. Having worked on similar permit requests before, she knew what she was looking at: A large, natural gas power plant.
What was more notable, however, was what she was unable to view.
Pollutants were listed on the request, but only in annual caps. There was no information on water usage despite some data centers using up to 5 million gallons of drinking water a day, straining resources in communities. While the heights of the diesel storage tanks were included, she said information on the turbines wasn’t.
While the DEP asked for clarification on Fundamental Data’s redactions following an influx of public comments from concerned residents, the company said it believed the omitted information met the state’s standard for confidentiality. The DEP ended up agreeing.
Fundamental Data, through its representative Casey Chapman, provided some details to the DEP in an attempt to put the public at ease: the site “does not plan” to use water from local water systems, rivers or streams and won’t discharge wastewater into them; mountains surrounding the development should “substantially limit” its visibility from populated areas and the facility “expects” to operate at noise levels that adhere with federal regulations.
But McGovern still had questions.
“Where is the water coming from? How high are these turbines? Where will they be? If we had some answers to these questions, we could do some modeling and figure out what the potential environmental impact would be, but we don’t,” McGovern said. “We’re just completely in the dark. There’s so many unanswered questions. As an engineer, there’s huge parts of this permit that are just bad. There’s no information provided, not even a level of standard of information that you would expect.”
Nease is realistic; he understands that these are complex issues and the state — as well as his region — are attempting to find new ways to bolster the economy and, hopefully, improve West Virginia’s economic standings long term. 
He sees the challenges hitting Tucker County residents every day. There’s a housing shortage and short-term rentals are driving up costs for the places that do exist, pricing out residents who can’t afford to live where they work. While tourism can bring in crowds, it’s often only seasonal. The county’s population — like most of West Virginia — is declining.
“I fully understand the need to diversify the economy. I support doing that, we talk about it all the time. I guess I’m just not sure that a project like this is the solution,” Nease said. “We just don’t know enough about it. We don’t know if this is going to benefit the Tucker County economy. I sure hope it does, but all I have to rely on for that are vague statements.”
‘It feels extractive:’ West Virginia data centers to operate with no local oversight, questionable economic gains
On March 18 — the same day that Fundamental Data submitted its air permit application to the DEP — House Bill 2014 was introduced at the state Legislature to incentivize data centers to locate in West Virginia and generate their own power sources through microgrids. Senate President Randy Smith, a Republican who represents Tucker County and voted for HB 2014, did not respond to requests for comment on this article.
Despite being a key priority for Gov. Patrick Morrisey who requested its introduction, the bill was presented more than halfway through the state’s 60-day session. In back-and-forths over several weeks, lawmakers amended the bill again and again. One change removed a requirement for microgrids to use renewable energy sources, opening the door for coal and natural gas. Several other amendments changed the tax structure for any property taxes collected on the developments. 
The version of the bill that now stands as law allows “high impact data centers” to curtail local zoning ordinances and other regulatory processes and establishes a certified microgrid program, which means data centers can produce and use their own power without attaching to already existing utilities.
The law creates a specialized tax structure for data centers and microgrids, which must be placed in designated districts. Local governments have little say or control over those districts, which are established at the state level.
Taxes collected on any data centers and microgrids operating in West Virginia would be split as so: 50% will go to the personal income tax reduction fund, 30% will go to the county where the data center is located, 10% will go to the remaining 54 counties split on a per capita basis using the most recent U.S. Census, 5% will be placed in the Economic Enhancement Grant Fund administered by the Water Development Authority and the final 5% will be put in the newly created Electric Grid Stabilization and Security Fund.
Initially, those taxes were going to be completely diverted away from localities where the data centers would be located, angering county commissioners and other local leaders from throughout the state.
Kelly Allen, executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said the fact that 50% of any tax revenue collected going to offset the state’s personal income tax cuts is a concern, especially while only 30% will return to localities that host the data centers.
“Local governments are really limited in the ways that they can raise revenue, which is largely controlled by either the state constitution or the state legislature. So taking away a significant slice of one of the only ways that they can raise revenue — through property taxes — leaves [localities] with fewer options to fund basic services,” Allen said. “At the same time, these data centers and micro grids are probably going to increase the need for the public services that local governments pay for.”
Allen pointed to the potential risks that come with operating power plants: county fire and police services will be needed for safety at the plants and water districts may be impacted, she said.
Essentially, she said, counties will be on the hook for funding more services while only receiving a fraction of the revenue generated by the sources of those costs. 
And, generally, there’s no guarantee — despite Fundamental Data’s claims for the Tucker County facility — that data centers will serve as massive employers.
Nationwide, according to the U.S. Census, jobs in data centers are increasing. But more than 40% of all jobs in 2023 existed in just three states. Per an analysis by Business Insider, most of the data center jobs available are only in construction and contracted from outside the places the centers are located.
Data centers are largely automated. Microsoft, for example, employs just 50 people per a facility. In West Virginia — because of the inclusion of microgrids, which aren’t mandated to be created for data centers — the picture could look different. But again, the lack of details from companies coming here makes the real impact difficult if not impossible to determine.
Allen said she’s wary of the state’s potential reliance on data centers for a financial boom given the state’s history of extraction-based economics.
Like with the coal economy, residents across the state will bear the aesthetic, environmental and health costs associated with living near data centers and their power plants. Most of the profits, however, may not return to them, Allen said.
“It’s not exactly identical to coal or natural gas or timber, but it feels extractive in the same way in that the benefits of the data center are borne by people outside of West Virginia, while the costs are borne by our residents,” Allen said.
Nease said that while he wants to be “pragmatic” about the potential for development in Tucker County, he can’t help but think of the state’s history in that regard either.
“I’m worried we’re going to fall into that same trap again. It’s an age old story — not just for West Virginia. Some people are going to benefit from this project, they just might not be here,” Nease said. “The company will benefit, its [shareholders] will. But will we?”
‘A race to the bottom:’ While West Virginia lawmakers want to compete with Virginia, locals say it’s not possible
While state lawmakers spent hours this legislative session debating how to craft the state’s new law to attract data centers, several couldn’t stop thinking about — or mentioning — neighboring Virginia, where the development of large, high-impact data centers have boomed.
Echoing sentiments shared by Morrisey through his “Backyard Brawl” plan to compete with neighboring states economically, delegates — including Del. Clay Riley, R-Harrison, who sits on the House Committee on Energy and Public Works, where the bill passed — said they wanted to see data center development here thrive like it has in Northern Virginia. 
Loudoun County, Virginia has been dubbed “Data Center Alley.” It’s home to the largest data center market in the world. 
But that development didn’t happen overnight, said Julie Bolthouse, director of land use at Piedmont Environmental Council in Virginia.
The industry started building in Northern Virginia in the 1990s and 2000s. Some of the largest data and internet providers at the time were located there. Over time, though, the market has changed.
Bolthouse said what used to be small complexes organized like business parks — featuring restaurants, shopping, day cares and more for people who lived in the region — are now large campuses with few people, no outside amenities and mostly computers and software.
And those “hyper-scaled” complexes — in Virginia and beyond — haven’t come without costs. The pollutants emitted by large centers are known to exacerbate respiratory problems and other health conditions. Residents nearby can hear the incessant buzzing and hums of the computers and generators at work. Light pollution, depending on the size and type of facility, can be impossible to ignore. 
But these issues — outside of the environmental ones — vary place to place because of local ordinances.
“That is like the only thing that’s really protecting Virginia communities, because the only way that the people who live in these localities are able to get any kind of protection is because of noise ordinances, because of the lighting ordinances,” Bolthouse said.
In West Virginia under HB 2014, residents won’t have the same protections or powers due to the state’s superseding of local ordinances.
And now, decades into Virginia’s ever changing data center sector, Bolthouse and other environmentalists are seeking more regulations on the state level since the nature of these data centers has changed so much over such a short period of time.
“That’s the push we’re seeing now — for the state to come in and add additional regulations, to look at the environmental impact,” Bolthouse said. “No one is talking about taking away the ability of localities to regulate these facilities. I can’t imagine that.”
And while the landscape for data centers is evolving in Loudoun County and beyond, the reason so many large companies have decided to locate their centers in Northern Virginia goes back to the 1990s. The infrastructure for them to be developed, Bolthouse said, already existed — it wasn’t newly created like West Virginia is attempting to do.
“There’s such a robust fiber network here. These data centers are kind of like a gigantic global computer. They talk to each other, and so the closer they are to all the other cloud providers, the better,” Bolthouse said. “When you put a data center here, your data is stored in Northern Virginia and you are in spitting distance to [Amazon], Google, Microsoft, all the big co-locators … probably every big business has an operation here in Northern Virginia. So it’s like the Wall Street of the data center industry. That’s why they want to locate here.”
Bolthouse warned that without regulations, without protections and without the advantages that Virginia has through its location and infrastructure, West Virginia could be attempting to enter a new sector by inviting in the “worst players.”
“What you’re going to get if you do it this way is the worst players, the ones that didn’t need to be in Northern Virginia … the players that are wanting that lack of regulations because they didn’t want to abide by rules and didn’t want to or need to protect communities, which is worse for West Virginia and the communities,” Bolthouse said. “What West Virginia is doing is not what Virginia is doing.”
She said West Virginia needs to look at the assets it already has, not the assets others in the sector have worked with for decades. 
Those assets, in Bolthouse’s words, are the same things that made Forrester feel like her childhood dreams were coming true when she built a home in Tucker County: the state’s “beautiful mountains, its rivers, its natural beauty and outdoor opportunities.”
“That’s what West Virginia should be leveraging. The state shouldn’t be trying to get something that another state has already secured the market on,” Bolthouse said. “I don’t know that West Virginia can become the next Data Center Alley. I don’t think that’s actually feasible … You’re trying to basically have a race to the bottom, and you’re only going to get the worst players.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The chairman of Tennessee’s campaign finance watchdog group is pushing for an investigation into a former state staffer’s secret political action committee to determine whether it involved criminal activity.
Registry of Election Finance Chairman Tom Lawless said Tuesday he is asking the group’s executive director to reactivate a 2020 request for the Williamson County District Attorney’s Office to conduct a probe of Cade Cothren, a former aide to one-time House Speaker Glen Casada, and the Faith Family Freedom Fund PAC. The investigation is expected t0 involve Casada as well.
“They have finished the criminal investigation, and those facts are available in our case, so come on people,” Lawless said, adding he believes the matter of renewal is “not open for discussion.”
The matter was put on hold as federal authorities pursued political corruption charges against Cothren and Casada, who were convicted in federal court this month on nearly 20 counts each in a kickback conspiracy. The two are expected to appeal, which could affect the board’s decision.
Bill Young, executive director of the Bureau of Ethics and Campaign Finance, said he is likely to review the matter with the Registry of Election Finance at its summer meeting. Sentencing for the pair is scheduled for Sept. 12.
“The guy’s looking at a number of years in prison, so I’m not sure we can do anything worse to him,” Young said.
Registry Chairman Tom Lawless recently told the Lookout he is interested in pursuing the matter.
The registry board subpoenaed Cothren in January 2022 in connection with an investigation into the Faith Family Freedom Fund PAC, which was accused of illegal coordination with the campaign of state Rep. Todd Warner in his race against incumbent Republican Rep. Rick Tillis, a political foe of Casada. Warner, whose home and office were raided by FBI agents the same day they hit Casada, Cothren and now-former Rep. Robin Smith in January 2021, defeated Tillis in the 2020 Republican primary. Cothren refused to comply with the subpoena.
Warner, who attended the trial several days this month in support of Cothren, is not facing any criminal charges.
​​The registry’s decision to subpoena Cothren, Casada and several other people came after a former girlfriend of Cothren’s testified that she formed the political action committee at his request so he could run it secretly. She said Cothren, whom she thought she loved at the time, also told her to ignore calls from the registry.
The Registry’s subpoena for Cothren has been on hold pending the outcome of the federal case.

Now, states may lose their ability to raise or implement new taxes. (Brandon Bell | Getty Images)The tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week targets a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government. The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.
Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.
But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.

Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

(Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Protect Our Care)All four Arkansas Republicans in the U.S. House reacted with undiluted pleasure last week after they and their colleagues pushed through a budget reconciliation bill, by a single vote, that makes significant changes in Medicaid and the SNAP food assistance program, including shifting costs from federal to state budgets.
French Hill veritably gushed, calling it a “critical win for families” that restores the “integrity” of Medicaid and SNAP, while Steve Womack said the bill will ensure that both programs “remain accessible and effective for those who truly need them.”
Rick Crawford trumpeted that House Republicans were “making safety net programs better serve those who really need them,” while Bruce Westerman said he and his colleagues are “making sure that people who are getting those benefits are American citizens and that they should be on those programs.”
Of course, determinations of who is truly in need or worthy of help and terms like “integrity” and “accessible” can be loaded, subjective and politically motivated. And all this happy talk discounts several factors that should give the congressmen’s constituents significant pause should these provisions ever become law.
According to an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, the House plan will drain nearly $700 billion from Medicaid over eight years, potentially jeopardizing Arkansas’ Medicaid expansion, which has been an unqualified success since it passed in 2013.
The program now provides health coverage for 813,000 Arkansans, including 309,000 children. In 74 of Arkansas’ 75 counties, more than 20% of the population is covered by Medicaid, with Benton County as the only exception; in 16 counties, it’s more than 30%. In 28 counties, more than half of the children are covered either by Medicaid or the CHIP program for kids from lower-income families, including five counties where the rate is above 60%.
Medicaid expansion has also cut Arkansas’ uninsured population from nearly 19% before expansion to 9.2% in 2023, according to figures compiled by the Kaiser Family Foundation. This puts us in the top 10 among states, a rare health metric in which we aren’t dragging along near the bottom.
The House bill also, for the first time, shifts part of the cost of SNAP to the states, which could blow a $109 million hole in Arkansas’ budget, according to an estimate from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research and policy institute. A shortfall of that magnitude could lead to significant cuts, or even elimination, of a program that feeds 235,000 Arkansans – in a state already ranked dead last for food insecurity.
Even Republican U.S. Sen. John Boozman, who chairs the Senate Agriculture Committee that oversees SNAP, acknowledged this point after the House bill passed, saying senators needed to consider whether the change was an “unfunded mandate” that might make “our governors call us.”
The centerpiece of House Republicans’ attack on Medicaid is a work requirement that would have a far-reaching impact on the nearly 243,000 Arkansans currently getting coverage under the Medicaid expansion — ignoring direct experience from right here in Arkansas that shows how putting more rigorous bureaucratic requirements on an already vulnerable population will push eligible people out of the program.
In 2018, with the blessing of the first Trump administration, Arkansas started requiring Medicaid recipients to verify their work histories. Some 18,000 people lost coverage before a federal judge ruled that the reporting requirements were contrary to Medicaid’s purpose of helping lower-income people obtain medical care.
Based on what happened in Arkansas seven years ago,  the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that as many as 95,000 enrollees in the state could lose coverage under the House reconciliation bill, which includes reporting requirements that are even more stringent than what Arkansas imposed in 2018. That’s equivalent to the population of Fayetteville.
And the most immediate deleterious impact these Medicaid cuts would have if they become law would be on our rural hospitals, most of which are already in significant financial distress.
Medicaid expansion helped rural hospitals’ bottom lines by reducing the number of uninsured patients and increasing Medicaid patient numbers, increasing revenues and operating margins (although hospitals argue that reimbursement rates need to be higher to fully meet actual costs). Since the program expanded in Arkansas, just one rural hospital, De Queen Medical Center, has closed, and it was replaced by the opening of Sevier County Medical Center.
By contrast,  in the three states bordering Arkansas that haven’t expanded Medicaid, 42 rural hospitals closed during the same period, cutting off a lifeline for rural residents.
Nearly 28% of residents in small town and rural Arkansas rely on Medicaid for health care coverage and on their rural hospitals for emergency room visits, surgery or even primary care, as often happens in rural areas with a limited number of health care providers. Reducing the number of people covered by Medicaid will reduce hospital revenues, as patients either skip care or are unable to pay for care they do receive.
And these proposed changes in Medicaid could not come at a worse time, with 35 of the 54 rural hospitals in Arkansas already losing money and 10 at imminent risk of closure, according to a new study from the nonpartisan Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform.
The study didn’t specify which hospitals were most in danger of closing. But its data shows 11 rural hospitals in Arkansas running a deficit of more than 20% in costs for providing patient care. Eight of those hospitals are in Crawford’s district; two are in Westerman’s, and one is in Womack’s.
The sobering fact is that only 19 rural hospitals in Arkansas are operating in the black overall, and 14 of those are still losing money on patient care. They are at a tipping point; our congressmen have endorsed a bill that could push them over.
Granted, the bill passed last week is unlikely to get through the Senate without major changes, so perhaps panicking unduly over the damage the House bill would do is premature. Yet the fact that Arkansas’ entire House delegation not only went along with this but got out their pom-poms to cheer along illustrates a clear disconnect from the needs of ordinary Arkansans.
It’s neither “big” nor “beautiful” to alarm people by supporting policies that threaten their health care and food assistance and could close their local hospitals. It also seems politically unwise — except, perhaps, if you’re a congressman who does not fear democratic accountability. Then, it’s a “critical win.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/medicaidmarkup-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-28 07:02:10.540712

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)Louisiana lawmakers are advancing legislation to transfer the University of New Orleans from the University of Louisiana System to the LSU System at a cost of about $23 million, Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said. 
Senate Bill 202 by Sen. Jimmy Harris, D-New Orleans, unanimously passed the Senate Tuesday. It will next be discussed in a House committee and must also receive approval from the House of Representatives and Gov. Jeff Landry before it takes effect.
The bill would reverse the action legislators took 14 years ago to move UNO to the University of Louisiana System from the LSU System, which it had been a part of since the university was founded in 1958. 
The implementation of Harris’ legislation is subject to funding. LSU estimates the transfer will cost $41 million in the first year and another $40.4 million over the next four years.
“That’s more of a pie-in-the-sky type thing,” Harris said of LSU’s estimate. 
Lawmakers don’t plan to spend that much this year, Henry said in an interview after the vote. Instead, he expects to spend $20 million to wipe out debt to vendors and another $3 million for must-do deferred maintenance costs. Those deferred maintenance dollars will likely come from existing funds for campus construction projects, Henry said. 
The university’s possible return to LSU’s control is in response to UNO’s acute budget crisis. The school faces a $30 million shortfall and has implemented a spending freeze, layoffs and staff furloughs in an attempt to make ends meet. 
UNO administrators have kept open the possibility of further layoffs and furloughs. Its budget crisis is largely tied to enrollment. The school had a student body of around 17,000 before Hurricane Katrina, with an immediate drop to around 6,000 after the storm. For the fall 2024 semester, its total enrollment was 6,488. 
Unlike UNO, every school in the LSU System has reported enrollment increases over the past few years, in contrast to nationwide trends of declining student numbers on college campuses. 
The Louisiana Board of Regents, which oversees all higher education in the state, has already approved the transfer. 
At the time of the system switch in 2011, UNO alumni and boosters applauded the plan, as many felt the university was overshadowed in the LSU System.
UNO would be the only institution in the LSU System classified as an R2 university, meaning it has high levels of research activity, second only to LSU’s main campus, which is a R1 school with the highest research activity rating. 
In the University of Louisiana System, there are two other schools with research-level rankings: the University of Louisiana Lafayette, an R1, and Louisiana Tech, an R2. 
UNO would also be the only other school in the LSU System with an NCAA Division I athletics program.

Just over 330 requests for religious and philosophical exemptions to West Virginia’s school vaccine policy have been submitted — and approved — for this school year and 35 have been granted for the coming year, according to records obtained by The 74.
The newly approved religious and philosophical exemptions already outpace the 203 permanent medical exemptions granted in the state over the past decade, at one time the only exemptions allowed in West Virginia.
Before January, when Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed an executive order opening the door for broader exemptions, the state had some of the nation’s strictest childhood vaccination policies.
The loosening of those policies is occurring amid a deadly measles outbreak that has infected over 1,000 people across 30 states and despite state legislators rejecting a bill in March which would have codified religious exemptions into state law. The conflict between the governor’s order and the legislature’s action has led to confusion over how West Virginia officials should proceed and could ultimately lead to legal action between the two branches of government.
In the meantime, the West Virginia Department of Health is granting religious and philosophical exemptions based on the governor’s order and shared those numbers in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by The 74.

No requests for the newer category of exemptions has been denied, the department said. In contrast, 125 requests for medical exemptions to mandatory school vaccines have been rejected since 2015. Temporary medical exemptions have been granted to 288 West Virginia children in the past decade.
Richard Hughes, a George Washington University law professor and leading vaccine law expert, said the 331 religious and philosophical exemptions sought in just five months represent a “drastic, dramatic increase in the request for exemptions, and that’s going to potentially have public health consequences.”
He added the state appears to be approving them liberally and without real scrutiny.
“Clearly, when you open the door to these types of exemptions, people use them,” he said. “There has been evidence before that when only religious exemption is available, people request them without any really sincerely held belief. This just opens the floodgates.”
While the 331 students who have received exemptions represent a very small percentage of the approximately 251,000 children enrolled in public schools across the state, experts fear the number will continue to rapidly climb, especially at the start of the coming school year.
“You see how fast we approved those? Hundred percent approved … So if we keep allowing an executive order that goes against West Virginia code, it’s going to change the vaccination rate …” said Sissy Price, a registered nurse who serves as co-director of West Virginia Families for Immunization. “And it’s not a matter of if it’s going to happen, it’s a matter of when.”
Experts also emphasized the importance of knowing which regions or schools in West Virginia the exempted students come from to better understand the impact on herd immunity and to allow parents — especially those of immunocompromised students — to make informed decisions about where to send their kids to school.
Despite the governor’s insistence that the state collect that information, an official at the Health Department wrote in an email to The 74, “Nobody in the Department of Health or the Bureau for Public [Health] tracks that.”
“There’s a failure of government there,” said Northe Saunders, executive director of the pro-vaccine SAFE Communities Coalition. “There’s a failure of making sure that parents can make the best informed decision that they can if we don’t know what immunization rates are like at the school level.”
The governor’s office and the Department of Health did not respond to requests for comment.
So far, West Virginia has no reported measles cases. Two children, both of whom were unvaccinated, have died during the current outbreak, whose case numbers have already surpassed 2024’s total and mark the second-highest number of confirmed cases in a year since the disease was declared eradicated in the U.S. in 2000. Some 96% of reported infections have involved a person who was unvaccinated or whose status was unknown and 13% have resulted in hospitalization.
In issuing his Jan. 14 executive order, Morrisey relied on an interpretation of the state’s 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act.
He argued that the law as it stood “forces” some West Virginians “to choose between their religious belief and their children’s fundamental right to public education,” and directed the commissioner of the Bureau for Public Health and the state health officer to establish a process for parents to object. The executive order noted that a “written, signed objection” was sufficient.
Based on the legislature voting down the measure to codify the broader exemption category, state schools Superintendent Michele Blatt issued a memo earlier this month to county superintendents recommending that students not be allowed to attend school next year without required immunizations, regardless of requests for religious exemptions.
“We are faced with the fact that state law has not been changed by the Legislature and there is no religious exemption provided for in West Virginia law,” Blatt wrote, according to reporting by West Virginia Watch.
But, by the end of the day she rescinded the memo, saying she had done so “at the Governor’s request.”
Morrisey then issued a letter May 9 saying that despite the legislative hurdle, the executive order “still stands, and I have no intention of rescinding it.” He further clarified the process to receive an exemption: Each year, parents or guardians must send a signed letter with basic information including their child’s name, date of birth and mailing address. Notably, the letter does not need to include the reason for the requested exemption.
In the wake of this confusion, some school districts have begun seeking legal guidance about how to respond.
West Virginia is not an outlier in its quest to allow parents to opt their children out of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine that is a requirement in all 50 states for children entering child care and schools.
“It goes towards the general erosion of vaccine policy,” said Saunders. “We’ve seen these kinds of small, incremental changes that are eroding vaccine policy in states across the country. There are still school entry requirements in West Virginia — just like there are in every single state — but this is one other chink in the armor of strong vaccine policy driving strong immunization rates.”
Childhood vaccination rates have been falling since COVID, and there’s fear that decline will accelerate now that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a well-known vaccine skeptic, is heading the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. He initially downplayed the measles spread in late February, and on May 14, at his first appearance in Congress since his confirmation, he waffled on the importance of vaccines.
When asked if he would vaccinate a child of his own against measles today he responded, “Probably for measles. What I would say is my opinions about vaccines are irrelevant.”
He continued, “I don’t want to make it seem like I’m being evasive, but I don’t think people should be taking medical advice from me.”
Last week, the Food and Drug Administration, which falls under HHS, released updated guidance for COVID vaccines, saying they may require additional studies before approving the shots for healthy Americans younger than 65.
Candice Lefeber, executive director of West Virginia’s chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said this move played into one of her fears: “I think the administration is going to make it harder for vaccines to be available.”
“Not only are we not going to require it, but then access to vaccines would be compromised,” she continued. “It’s just really disheartening for science and for our country — and we’re in big trouble.”

Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) said her caucus is “trying to put the pieces together that will create a plan that could actually get through the Legislature.”
“It’s not enough just to have a plan, and it’s not enough to even pass things through one chamber – if it’s not bipartisan and bicameral, it will not be successful,” Brinks said.
While Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, (R-Porter Township), and Sen. Jim Runestad, (R-White Lake), were scheduled to appear in a similar panel later in the day, Sen. Roger Victory, (R-Hudsonville), represented the Senate Republicans.

He proposed a reward system where the state would match local governments’ funding for local road repairs.
“Sometimes with state funding, we act like a fire department. We’re always out there trying to put fires out,” Victory said. “I think we need to get ahead of the fires and just do fire prevention.”
The GOP-led Michigan House passed a $3.1 billion road funding plan in March, which Democrats criticized as potentially endangering vital services, as well as the state’s School Aid Fund.

Now, states may lose their ability to raise or implement new taxes. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)The tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week targets a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government. The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
U.S. House Republicans push through massive tax and spending bill slashing Medicaid

Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.
Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.
But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.
Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

Tony Evers’ office Tuesday, their chants bouncing off the marble walls inside the Capitol. They were there to deliver a letter — which they urged others to sign online — demanding that Evers veto the state budget if it doesn’t include key elements of the governor’s own budget proposal.
“The whole Democratic grassroots is now demanding that national leaders stand and fight,” said Robert Kraig, executive director of Citizen Action of Wisconsin, who helped organize the effort, “and I think that spirit is now being translated down to the state level.” 
Public school advocates, child care providers, teachers’ unions and advocates for criminal justice reform and health care access came to demand that Evers take a stronger stand and threaten to use his significant veto power in negotiations with Republicans. 
“There has been a lot of talk over the last year about whether or not we can get this done as adults, or whether we have to be impolite,” Michael Jones, president of Madison Teachers, Inc., said of state budget negotiations. “Too much gets conceded about being polite,” he added. “Politeness without reciprocal respect is just being a sucker.”
In their letter, the advocates assured Evers that Wisconsinites were behind his original budget proposal — the one Republican legislative leaders threw in the trash. The advocates urged him to “hold the line” and reject any budget that doesn’t accept federal Medicaid expansion money, provide a 60% state reimbursement to schools for special education costs, close the Green Bay Correctional Institution, restore his proposed $480 million for child care and reject the snowballing growth of school vouchers.
Brooke Legler, a child care provider and co-founder of Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (W.E.C.A.N.), has been leading a recent high-profile effort to sound the alarm about the loss of child care funds. “So many of us are going to be closing our doors because we cannot keep going and parents can’t afford to pay what they are paying,” she said during a press conference in the Senate parlor. Treating child care like any other business doesn’t work, she added. Instead, it needs to be seen as a public good. “Gov. Evers declared this the year of the kid,” Legler said, but “it’s not going to be” if Evers signs a budget that leaves out crucial funding for child care. 
Tanya Atkinson of Planned Parenthood Wisconsin spoke at the press conference about congressional Republicans’ effort to cancel Medicaid funding for patient care at Planned Parenthood.
In Wisconsin, 60% of Planned Parenthood’s patients have Medicaid as their form of insurance, she said. Most of them live in rural areas, are low-income, or are women of color who “continue to be further pushed out of our health care system,” Atkinson said. “And it doesn’t have to be that way. It is time for us to take the politics out of sexual reproductive health altogether.”
Atkinson and the other assembled advocates praised Evers’ budget proposal, including the part that would finally allow Wisconsin to join the 40 other states that have accepted the federal Medicaid expansion, making 90,000 more Wisconsinites eligible for Medicaid coverage and bringing about $1.5 billion into the state in the next budget cycle.
Shaniya Cooper, a college student from Milwaukee and a BadgerCare recipient who lives with lupus, talked about how scary it was to realize she could lose her Medicaid coverage under congressional Republicans’ budget plan. “To me, this is life or death,” she said. When she first learned about proposed Medicaid cuts, “I cried,” she said. “I felt fear and dread.”
She described having a flare-up of her lupus, with swelling and fluid around her heart, and then finding out she had to fill out paperwork to reapply for Medicaid, since it was unclear if her treatment would still be covered. 
“It isn’t just about the paperwork. It’s about waking up each day with the fear that the care I might need might be gone tomorrow,” she said, “It’s about knowing that people are quietly suffering mentally and emotionally from the stress and the anxiety that these policies are creating.” Her voice broke and people around her yelled encouragement. “You got this!” someone shouted. “What’s at stake here is humanity,” she continued, “and if we do nothing, we allow these cuts to happen, we are silently endorsing the neglect and slow death of those who cannot afford prime insurance. That is not a civil society. That is not justice.”
“We are here because we will not be pitted against each other to fight for crumbs in a time of plenty,” said Heather DuBois Bourenane of the Wisconsin Public Education Network. “We will not be divided on the issues that matter most where we live, because some people refuse to listen to us.”
DuBois Bourenane derided what she called a “cycle of disinvestment, first of all, but it’s also a cycle of disrespect,” by Republicans who dismissed Evers’ budget proposals despite  overwhelming public support. Increasing funding for schools, expanding Medicaid coverage and reforming the criminal justice system by closing prisons and reducing incarceration are popular measures. “Gov. Evers has the power, with his veto pen, to break [the cycle],” she said, “and we’re calling on him to use the full force, the full power of that pen, to say, enough is enough. It stops with me.”
“There’s a tremendous amount of Democratic leverage in this budget, if you consider both the number of Democratic members in the Senate and the veto,” Kraig said. 
“These are groups with large memberships calling on the governor to stand and fight,” he added.
Evers did not make an appearance or respond to the rowdy group at the Capitol. But it was clear they have no intention of going away quietly,

(Photo Courtesy of the National Medal of Honor Museum)Carlyle Blakeney and Darwin Simpson took different paths to Patriots Point, but their volunteer work there culminated in the National Medal of Honor Museum that opened this spring — just not in South Carolina as they initially dreamed.
Blakeney, of Charleston, has spent all of his 80 years in the Palmetto State. Simpson, 81, is a native of Arkansas who split much of his adult life between the Army and being an executive for a chemical conglomerate. He’s lived in Spartanburg since McKesson Pharmaceuticals brought him to South Carolina in 1982.
They eventually met while volunteering at Patriots Point, a state-owned naval and maritime museum in Mount Pleasant, and found a common passion.
Simpson and Blakeney, who came from a military family but could not enlist due to hearing issues, met recipients of the Medal of Honor, the nation’s highest award for valor in combat, through their volunteer work.
Since its creation during the Civil War, the medal has been awarded to 3,528 people. Only 61 are still living, according to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, headquartered at Patriots Point. Since 1994, the society has operated the Medal of Honor Museum aboard the USS Yorktown in Charleston Harbor.
SC to finalize environmental cleanup of USS Yorktown

Medal of Honor museums, memorials or exhibits can be found in at least seven states. And in 1999, Congress designated three sites, including the museum on the World War II aircraft carrier, as national Medal of Honor sites.
But Simpson, Blakeney and others at Patriots Point envisioned a single, large “official home” of the Medal of Honor on land that pays homage to all recipients and educates visitors about them, Blakeney said.
The pair’s efforts ultimately helped lead to the construction of a 100,000-square-foot national museum that opened in Arlington, Texas, in March.
It’s expected to draw millions of visitors each year. Every awarded combat hero is named at the entrance.
“They became recipients because of some historic battles they’ve been in,” said Simpson, who retired from the Army in 2003 as a major general. “Most of them have been wounded, shot up and everything else. And some of them are not capable of getting out and about even to this day.”
South Carolina has 33 Medal of Honor recipients. Many of their stories were known to Blakeney and Simpson because both had stints on the governing board of Patriots Point.
“They’re all remarkable,” Blakeney said.
When Blakeney, a real estate broker in Charleston who served in the ROTC at Clemson, and Simpson first discussed the idea of a National Medal of Honor Museum in 2012, they hoped to put it at Patriots Point. It made sense to establish the national museum in military friendly South Carolina at a location already dubbed a national Medal of Honor site.
But the effort to build it there ultimately fell apart, partly due to squabbles over the museum’s design and height.
In 2018, after years of discussions with both local officials and state lawmakers, the National Medal of Honor Foundation announced it was opening up bidding nationwide.
“We absolutely could not raise the money,” Simpson said. “There were not enough people in the Mount Pleasant and Charleston area willing to support the Medal of Honor museum.”
In 2019, legislators redirected the $5 million they approved for the national museum in prior state budgets to fund maintenance at state parks and help cover the costs of turning the USS Clamagore at Patriots Point into an artificial reef. (In 2022, the submarine was instead taken apart for scrap.)
In the aftermath of losing out on what was estimated to be a $100 million museum, the Congressional Medal of Honor Society made the decision to renovate its own museum at Patriots Point, which reopened last May. That $3.5 million update was funded by a different nonprofit, the National Medal of Honor Center for Leadership. Since 2021, the Legislature has given $11 million total to that nonprofit, which has also been raising money for a $75 million center at Patriots Point with exhibit and classroom space.
Choosing Arlington

Those plans were drawn up after the National Medal of Honor Foundation moved on, and cities from around the country expressed interest. The group screened all applicants and settled on San Francisco, Arlington and New York City as the three finalists.
Arlington was ultimately the winner, thanks partly to the backing of Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who attended the University of Arkansas the same time as Simpson and donated land for the museum. His daughter, Charlotte Jones, led fundraising efforts that brought in roughly $280 million to design and build the museum and support its programs.
“From a practical standpoint, Arlington was head and shoulders the best location and best choice,” Blakeney said.
The opening came six years after Arlington was selected.
The museum has five interactive exhibits and five pillars representing the five branches of the military with Medal of Honor recipients. And at night, a line shines upward to represent the U.S. Space Force.
The museum is also located less than half a mile from the home stadiums for the Cowboys and the Texas Rangers’ baseball team, as well as many bars, restaurants and hotels.
“It’s in a big entertainment complex of land. It’s well situated,” Simpson said.
Simpson, the former head of the Spartanburg Downtown Airport, has yet to visit the museum. However, he’s an active pilot — even in his 80s — and plans to travel to Texas in his plane soon, he told the SC Daily Gazette.
Blakeney, who attended the March opening, said being at the museum was overwhelming.
It was just as great as he imagined.

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)As Fairfax County laid to rest longtime Democratic U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly Tuesday, attention shifted to the fast-moving process of replacing him in Congress — a decision that rests with Gov. Glenn Youngkin and could reshape the calendar for both parties in the politically vital 11th District.
Connolly, 75, died last week after a resurgence of cancer, just weeks after announcing he would not seek reelection. His passing leaves a vacancy in a district anchored in Fairfax that leans heavily Democratic and is home to tens of thousands of federal workers. 
A spokesperson for Youngkin on Tuesday declined to say whether the governor has made a decision on when to schedule a special election. Under Virginia law, the governor is required to issue a writ of election to fill a vacancy in the U.S. House of Representatives. However, there is no mandated timeline for doing so.
But state law also stipulates that special elections must be held on a Tuesday and cannot occur within 55 days prior to a general or primary election. With the June 17 primaries approaching, the earliest possible date for the special election would be June 24.
Manisha Singh, chair of the 11th District Democratic Committee, acknowledged the challenges ahead. 
“We do have to juggle a lot of things, and with the primary less than 20 days away, it is a lot,” Singh said in a phone interview Tuesday. 
She emphasized that once Youngkin sets the date, her committee’s job is not to pick a candidate but to oversee a transparent and accessible process. “Our committee is just responsible for the process of voting and not dictating who should or should not be filling these shoes.”
State Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, chair of the Democratic Party of Virginia, said the party is prepared to proceed with urgency. 
“We don’t have a process yet, because (we) didn’t want to get ahead of the governor’s announcement,” he said. “I’m going to encourage a process that offers the most amount of time for voters to be able to cast their vote and the most voters to be able to be engaged.”
Singh echoed that goal, saying the local party’s plan “is to organize our process and move swiftly” while ensuring that “everybody … is going to have a fair and open process, all inclusive.” She added, “Our voters will have plenty of opportunity to have their voice heard.”
Democrats are considering a “firehouse primary” in July to pick their nominee, assuming a late-summer special election date. The Fairfax County Democratic Committee has already begun lining up voting sites, with plans for at least one per magisterial district.
A handful of candidates have already expressed interest in the Democratic nomination, including: Braddock District Supervisor James Walkinshaw, a former Connolly chief of staff who has received the late congressman’s endorsement; state Sen. Stella Pekarsky, D-Fairfax; Fairfax Planning Commissioner Candice Bennett; and attorney Amy Roma, a Vienna resident and global energy policy expert.
Singh acknowledged the magnitude of the moment for Democrats in her district after Connolly’s death. 
“It is a humongous void that we are feeling right now, and it’s some really big shoes to fill,” she said. But she expressed confidence in the field of contenders. “We have some excellent candidates who I am very sure are up to the challenge.”
On the Republican side, Mike Van Meter, who lost to Connolly 67-33% last year, is running again. No other GOP candidate has announced a bid.
Political analyst Stephen Farnsworth of the University of Mary Washington warned that delays in setting the election date can serve partisan ends. 
“One of the problems with vacant congressional seats is that some governors use the timing for partisan advantage,” he said. “Democrats are very likely to win the seat, and so as long as it remains vacant, that creates a slight advantage for the narrow Republican majority in Congress.”
Farnsworth said governors from both parties have taken advantage of timing in tight political environments. “The country would be much better off if we had very firm rules about elections being called as soon as possible when there are vacancies,” he said.
He added that the 11th District’s deep-blue profile gives Democrats flexibility to nominate a progressive candidate. “In Virginia 11, if you have a Democratic nomination in one hand and a pulse on the other, you’re more or less going to be elected.”
And Singh said Connolly’s legacy will loom large in the coming campaign. “Fairfax is quite progressive, and Gerry Connolly has always reflected the sentiments of his constituents,” she said. “He has never been afraid to stand by his principles and what his district needs.”
“What we will need is a leader who, irrespective of where their belief is, is always putting the district before themselves or anything else,” Singh added. “I know the voters in the district will do us proud and will make sure Gerry Connolly’s legacy lives on.”
Connolly’s career bridged international policy and local governance. Born in Boston, he worked for a decade on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, overseeing issues such as narcotics, global economics, and U.N. affairs. He later moved into the private sector with firms like SRI International and SAIC.
He was first elected to the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors in 1995 and became chair in 2003, leading efforts around smart growth and environmental stewardship. In 2008, Connolly won election to Congress and quickly gained a reputation as a detail-oriented policymaker focused on government accountability.
Last month, he announced his plan to retire, writing, “With pride in what we’ve accomplished together over 30 years, my loving family and staff sustain me. My extended family — you all have been a joy to serve.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Once she became a mother, the unappealing prospect of parenting while hungover curbed Synthia Bialkowski’s social drinking. Though she still likes to imbibe in alcohol from time to time, she’s excited about exploring a new option: low-dose THC-infused beverages, like the mocktail line that just launched at Bingo Beer Co. in Richmond.
“I feel like this is something I can sit down with, it’s not a ton of calories or a ton of sugar, and I can still have the social aspect of a drink without the repercussions,”  Bialkowski said. 
That’s exactly what Bingo co-owner Jay Bayer had in mind when his company set out to create its line of THC-infused, alcohol-free cocktails called Level Up, produced in partnership with Virginia-based hemp grower Pure Shenandoah. The company released two flavors of the drinks — a ginger mule and a grapefruit paloma — ahead of Memorial Day weekend, adding to the brewery-restaurant-arcade’s lineup of booze-free products including non-alcoholic beer and kombucha. 
“But that doesn’t feel like it always tickles the funny bone of somebody who’s trying to have an alternative (to alcohol),” he said. “If you are either just abstaining from alcohol for the day or abstaining from alcohol in general, but you still want to find something that is fun, that’s what these are.”

 The science behind the sips

With 2 milligrams of THC — the chemical component in cannabis and hemp that can produce a euphoric feeling — paired with 5 milligrams of the non-psychoactive compounds CBD and CBG, the products are within Virginia’s legal requirements. Virginia law requires hemp-derived products to have 25 times as much CBD as it does THC. The company also posts the products’ lab results online. 
While THC, found in both hemp and marijuana, is the compound that produces a high for consumers, CBD does not. But CBD has been touted for potential benefits like treating anxiety, inflammation and epilepsy. Both compounds have become appealing in recent years as supplemental treatments for a variety of health conditions or as alcohol alternatives. 
The low dose in Level Up both complies with state law and allows consumers to build their experience, Bayer said. 
It’s something Harvard Medical School professor and researcher Dr. Staci Gruber recommends, particularly for new or first-time THC users. 
Unlike inhaling THC, which can alter one’s mind and body sooner, the effects of edibles or drinkables can take a few minutes to an hour for people to feel, and the duration of the experience varies by person.
“You also want to give yourself some time after you’ve had it to really see how you feel,” she explained. “For people who are novices, start low and go slow.”
 Concerning cannabis, Virginia is a mixed bag

While Bingo’s THC drink is new on the market in Virginia, THC-infused products from seltzers to gummies to tinctures have emerged more prominently in alcohol alternative markets in recent years. Many are marketed online, and though federally legal, some aren’t able to be shipped to every state due to differing state laws surrounding THC. Hemp and marijana are both derived from the cannabis sativa plant, but have different chemical compositions and legal statuses.
Youngkin’s vetoes take another hit on cannabis reform in Virginia

After legalizing marijuana possession in 2021, Virginia has yet to create a legal retail market for it. Efforts in the state legislature have stalled during Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s administration, whose term ends later this year. 
Virginia does have a medical marijana market though, for which patients need approval from their physicians to access a limited number of dispensaries around the state. Despite Virginia’s hazy laws surrounding the cannabis plants, Gruber isn’t surprised a market is growing for cannabis or hemp-derived products locally and nationwide. 
Alcohol use —  and heavy drinking, in particular — is linked to cancers, heart and liver disease or high blood pressure, and can exacerbate certain mental health conditions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“People really enjoy having options, right?” Gruber said. “With people being more mindful of the negative effects of alcohol, they’re trying to explore other ways of feeling a little bit more relaxed, or the ability to ‘kick back,’ but not necessarily use alcohol to do it.” 
Kicking back sans the hard stuff intrigued Russell and Lyn Gibbs, retirees who moved to Richmond from Washington D.C. occasionally seeking a healthier alternative to alcohol when socializing. 
“People tend to drink too much,” Russell said. “I’ve been in situations when I’ve had a club soda and a lime to feel like I’m drinking when I’m not.”
While Lyn still appreciates alcohol for its stress-relief properties, she said she has enjoyed alternative markets opening up for THC. The couple has tried THC-infused gummies in the past, they said at a tasting event for the new drinks at Bingo Beer Co. on Friday. 
 Hazy national outlook

A psychiatry professor at Harvard, Gruber also leads the Marijuana Investigations for Neuroscientific Discovery (MIND) Program at McLean Hospital. Her research has explored the impact of recreational cannabis use on the brain using brain imaging, clinical assessments and neurocognitive measures.
While hemp is federally legal, marijana is still not. Some states have legalized it, but the patchwork of laws around the nation can be confusing for consumers. Though people have been illegally growing and purchasing marijuana or hemp products for a long time, as legal markets emerge Gruber noted that “policy has outpaced science.”
Research is important, she said to help people “navigate this constantly shifting landscape with the good, the bad and the truth.” 
Gruber has provided testimony to members of Congress to help lawmakers better understand the chemical compounds in the plants plus their studied benefits and risks, as well as consumer behaviors surrounding them. 
What’s clear, she said, is that if people weren’t interested in using THC products, “you wouldn’t see a proliferation of them in the marketplace.”

It’s a trend that’s been advancing at a breakneck clip for years now, but according to a new report from the global nonprofit OxFam, the vast and immoral inequality that dominates the U.S. economy has reached truly stunning levels.
As the report notes, over the past year, the richest ten Americans increased their wealth by 365 billion dollars.
It would take ten average U.S. workers a staggering 726,000 years to make that much money.
But wait, it’s about to get worse.
Under Republican budget bills advancing in Congress and the North Carolina legislature, new and regressive tax cuts along with big reductions in services will assure that the gap between the super-rich and everyone else grows even wider.
It’s a situation so corrupt and toxic that it’s quickly undermining the fabric of a country founded on the premise of equal opportunity.
The bottom line: Elected leaders must confront and reverse these trends right away lest our once great nation soon becomes unrecognizable.

Obvious[...]","Getty ImagesA recent Michigan Advance article, “Michigan leaders call attention to the crisis of missing and murdered Indigenous people,” painted a poignant picture of the lack of attention scores of missing indigenous people have been given by the criminal justice system and society in general (nearly 4,200 missing persons cases have gone unsolved, nationwide).
Obviously, this isn’t a purely Michigan problem. Disregarding people, specifically women of native origin, that have gone missing is a worldwide issue, from the reservations of Arizona to the Outback in Australia, including Michigan, the majority tends to turn a blind eye to classes of people that the society, writ large, does not view as worthy of concern. We see this over and over again, but not only in the world of law enforcement. It is a general practice to put time and effort into finding missing women, regardless of race or gender or profession, but the importance that the voting public puts on those victims is directly related to the amount of budget applied to those cases.
There is a stark contrast when a member of the majority, say a Gabby Petito, goes missing. Large scale investigations are well-funded and equipped with manpower and there is an endless stream of media coverage. What if Gabby Petito was a Navajo woman? Would there be the same urgency? Or what if Gabby Petito were a sex worker? Homeless?
This is an extreme example, of course, but the relative ease of dehumanization (the act of relegating a group of people socially as ‘less than human’ by a majority of society) is something that isn’t solely in the world of extreme examples. Every day we dehumanize groups of people for any number of reasons. When we do that, it is easy to disregard them. It is also easy to harm them because, in a social appraisal, they aren’t really people, right?
The phenomenon is not limited to the world of crime and investigation. We can simply look to the Michigan House GOP’s attempt to legislate trans athlete participation as a way of providing safety for (italics are my emphasis) real girl athletes. This means that the existence of real girls is threatened by the existence of unreal girls in an obvious act of dehumanization.
It is like using the term ‘illegal alien’ as opposed to undocumented person. In both of these instances, the danger to the ‘non-human’ subjects of this type of rhetoric is apparent. State Rep. Matt Koleszar (D-Plymouth), in opposition to the bill, noted “Make no mistake, this legislation and the rhetoric that surrounds it could get somebody killed.” The words of the bill matter. It is immaterial that the Governor is unlikely to sign such a bill if it even made it to her desk, the damage is done in the nomenclature.
The speed at which this can happen is stunning. We learned a great deal from Philip Zimbardo’s Stanford Prison Experiment in 1971. The ethical concerns of the experiment helped lead to the creation of institutional review boards to police psychological ethics. In the experiment, Zimbardo collected twenty-four male college students with some assigned to be prisoner and some assigned to be guards. The prisoners were subjected to real arrest procedures and placed in cells while the guards were given uniforms and authority over the prisoners. The experiment was scheduled to last two weeks but was terminated after six days. The prisoners became increasingly sadistic towards the prisoners while the prisoners effectively became submissive and bought into their own dehumanization.
At its core, the experiment showed the power of situational forces on behavior and just how quick and easy we can react to the label a person wears. In this case, it was guard (power) or prisoner (less than human). The real shock is at the speed this can happen. Now, as we expand this, think of what one hundred years of systemic dehumanization can do to a society? How do you feel about prisoners, for example. Not individuals, but that group. How do you feel about police officers? Again, not individuals, but the group. As Zimbardo showed us, sometimes all it takes is a uniform for us to label a group as ‘pigs’ or ‘animals’ and treat them accordingly.
We don’t escape this in our faith systems, either. The dangers of using dehumanizing language in terms of antisemitic, anti-Muslim, anti-Christian, or any other faith of choice does nothing more than put either metaphorical, or in the case of most world conflicts at this point, literal crosshairs on the subject of the dehumanizing language. The innocent human beings being killed in both Palestine and Israel at this point in history, depending on which side your political rhetoric lands on, are either victims or ‘deserved it.’
This is the same process we use to pay little attention to missing sex workers or indigenous women and the same process a group of college students used to treat their classmates like animals in 1971. Beverly Eileen Mitchell takes a deep, and disturbing look, at the process in terms of dehumanizing language being components of White supremacy and antisemitism in her 2009 book Plantations and Death Camps: Religion, Ideology, and Human Dignity from Minneapolis Fortress Press. She writes, “The absence of empathetic imagination—the inability to see members of the “pariah” group as being like oneself—is the psychological foundation for participation in dehumanizing a fellow human being”.
This is where we have to assess our own participation in dehumanization. Those tiny, innocuous moments in our daily discussions can be harmful and carry with it the danger of relegating a group of human beings as pariah. The same way many of us bristle at the thought of being called “Libtards,” for example, as we are categorized into a fundamentally flawed person unworthy of consideration and potential violence is equally as dangerous as considering a group of people “MAGAts,” equitably categorizing the obverse of a political rhetoric as also fundamentally flawed and unworthy of consideration and potential violence.
It is that ease that we must be aware of. How we discuss other groups of people have direct consequences on how those people are treated.
Be careful, because words matter.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal)An Ohio Senate committee heard from opponents Tuesday of a measure placing restrictions on foreign ownership of land. The sponsors argue keeping foreign governments — particularly China — at least 25 miles from military installations and critical infrastructure is a matter of national security.
But opponents contend the bill casts too broad a net, wrapping in ordinary people who have visas or are working their way through the immigration process.
They add the bill violates several constitutional and statutory provisions. More to the point, they argue it would codify racism and xenophobia.
Ohio House Bill 1 and Ohio Senate Bill 88
The proposal finds its roots in a measure proposed during the last general assembly which found its way into the last state operating budget.
Gov. Mike DeWine left a prohibition on foreign ownership of farmland to remain in place that budget cycle, but he vetoed the provision restricting ownership within 25 miles of military bases.
“Restricting ownership of Ohio farmland protects Ohio’s rich agricultural tradition from adverse interests,” DeWine said in his veto message. “However, including other non-agricultural real property in this provision could have unintended economic development consequences.”
  Yanfen Yang, testifying against SB 88 holds up a map of Ohio overlaid with red circles around property prohibited from purchase under the bill. Effectively the entire state would be off limits. (Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)
The sponsors of House Bill 1 and Senate Bill 88 are taking another crack at that idea, and they’ve expanded their scope to include “critical infrastructure” like power, water, and transportation facilities. The list is broad enough, Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, acknowledged, to “effectively blanket the entirety of the state of Ohio.”
Under the bills, the Ohio Secretary of State would develop a list of entities barred from owning property in the state and update it at least every six months.
For countries identified as “foreign adversaries,” their government, citizens, and businesses would face ownership restrictions automatically.
“I introduced this bill,” Johnson said, “because I strongly believe that Ohio’s land should not be for sale to those who seek to destroy the American way of life.”
He added that while his bill is very similar to the Ohio House version, he takes “a hardline stance” against existing owners. Senate Bill 88 wouldn’t just prohibit purchases in the future, it would require any current owners subject to the restrictions to sell their land within two years.
But at the beginning of Tuesday’s hearing, the committee adopted an amendment eliminating the forced-sale provisions in the bill.
Opponents push back
At a press conference Tuesday morning, state lawmakers and grassroots organizers criticized the legislation as “a symbol for hate” and “legalized discrimination.”
“These bills represent a step backwards into the darker history of racism in America, rather than progress toward justice and inclusion,” Hongmei Li from the Ohio Chinese American Council argued.
She said the proposal hearkens back to legislation like the Chinese Exclusion Act, which restricted immigration and naturalization, and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.
Li added the measure seems to violate the Fifth Amendment and the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
What’s more, she argued, “there are multiple existing federal laws that already address legitimate threats without resorting to racial profiling and discrimination.”
At Tuesday’s committee hearing, more than 100 opponents showed up in person, filling the seats, lining the walls two rows deep, and spilling into the hallway.
The committee had to organize an overflow room to accommodate the spectators. More than 230 people submitted testimony against the bill.
Xu Lu, a college professor from Findlay and a U.S. citizen, acknowledged the bill would not target him directly, but he wanted to testify against it because it is “simply a wrong bill.” He insisted the measure is unethical.
“Imagine somebody who risked their life, escaped North Korea and ended up in Ohio,” he offered. “This bill will tell them they do not belong here.”
Caixia Jin is also a U.S. citizen and explained she works for an automotive company assisting foreign workers through the visa and green card process.
“They stand shoulder-to-shoulder with American citizens,” Jin said. “Many of them are immigrants or the descendants of immigrants themselves as well.”
ACLU Chief Lobbyist Gary Daniels emphasized that a less restrictive law in Florida has already been placed on hold, and promised lawsuits would be filed quickly if lawmakers pass the bill.
But he argued lawmakers shouldn’t reject the proposal over litigation, they should abandon it “because it is fundamentally wrong, it is profoundly unfair, and it is fueled by racial animus.”
Daniels described reading hundreds of bills and attending thousands of hours of committee hearings.
“I struggle to come up with a bill that has so much hostility against race and nationality as this particular bill — not even close,” he said.
Fourteen-year-old Melody Miao is an Oxford resident, and she’ll be a junior in high school this fall.
“Ohio is the only place I’ve ever called home,” she told the committee.
“I grew up here, went to school here, learned the Pledge of Allegiance by heart, memorized the Bill of Rights, and watched fireworks every July 4,” Miao said. “Still, I’ve lived my entire life, fearing that no matter how much I loved my country, I wasn’t American enough.”
“I can’t help but wonder,” she said, “how are we so blind to the foundations of our nation crumbling right beneath our feet?”

Underinsured and not qualifying for Medicaid, she had to search for a local nonprofit to pay for her sight-saving surgeries. (Photo by Nada Hassanein/Stateline)COLUMBIA, S.C. — It’s as if she’s squinting through a smoke-filled room. But it’s Charisse Brown’s eye condition, glaucoma, that diminishes her vision.
Brown, 38, has worked all her adult life, with a personal policy of keeping two jobs at once. But when she started losing sight in her left eye last year, she was forced to quit her call center job. That left her with one income stream, her marketing research job, to pay her $1,300 monthly rent and other bills.
If glaucoma is caught early, monitored by a doctor and properly treated, it’s possible to stall the progression of the disease. Eye drops are necessary for keeping eye pressure down to slow glaucoma-induced damage. Without insurance, the monthly cost of the medication can run anywhere from $80 per bottle for a generic version to $200 or $300 for a brand-name one.
As an adult without children, Brown doesn’t qualify for Medicaid in South Carolina, which has not expanded the program under the Affordable Care Act. 
She’s enrolled in the lowest-premium plan on her state’s health care insurance marketplace, but ophthalmologists in the area won’t accept her insurance.
She said she called 211, a hotline for community services in South Carolina, but her voicemails weren’t returned. In medical debt and about to get kicked out of her apartment, she had to choose between her medication and paying for daily necessities like food and feminine care items. One food stamps enrollment worker told her: “We can’t approve you. If you go and have a baby, this will be a lot easier.”
“Single people — we’re struggling,” Brown said. “I feel like I’m getting punished for trying to do what’s right.”
Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that can cause a buildup of pressure that damages the optic nerve. Long called the “thief of sight,” it’s the leading cause of blindness in Black Americans like Brown. Black people are five times more likely to have glaucoma, and lose their sight at six times the rate of white people. Hispanic and Latino communities suffer similar disparities.
Among Black patients, a timely diagnosis is paramount: Glaucoma occurs on average a decade earlier — and advances faster.
But diagnosis and treatment can be costly and out of reach for many.
In the Deep South, health care fights echo civil rights battles

In South Carolina and the other nine states that have not expanded Medicaid, opponents of expansion say it would be too expensive to provide health coverage to more people, even though the federal government picks up 90% of the tab. But forgoing expansion also has costs. People without insurance or not enough insurance are more likely to visit the emergency room, as glaucoma and other chronic diseases take their toll. When it comes to eye diseases, vision can deteriorate without coverage for preventive care. And racial health disparities are higher in states that have not expanded.
“You see a lot of end-stage disease,” said Dr. Rebecca Epstein, a glaucoma specialist and ophthalmologist at South Carolina’s Clemson Eye, which was not involved in Brown’s care. “They don’t have insurance, and so they will delay care. And then they come in, one eye is already gone, another eye is on its way — and I’m sitting here having to tell them I’ve got to operate on their only eye.”
For about two months, Brown was fully blind in her left eye. Surgeries to address her warping cornea, a condition called keratoconus, and another to relieve pressure causing her glaucoma would cost upward of $10,000. Asked if they could offer a payment plan, her doctor’s office staff said no.
For days, Brown and her siblings called dozens of charities, asking for help to pay for her surgery. They called doctors across the state, asking if they had the necessary surgeon specialists and whether they accepted her insurance. Some nonprofits told Brown she was too young, that their help was reserved for older adults.
She finally landed on the South Carolina charity Lions Vision Services, affiliated with Lions Club International. The group offers eyeglasses, vision screenings and reimbursements to local doctors for surgeries patients living below the poverty line can’t afford. The charity told her it could pay for her eye surgeries, and Brown was in disbelief.










You don't give them access to care. You let them go blind, and then you're going to pay for their disability when they go blind?


– Dr. Rebecca Epstein, ophthalmologist at Clemson Eye


“Access shouldn’t be this hard. Our state should do a better job of making sure that we have coverage for people and that they have access to care — before they’re blind,” Epstein said. “Here’s the crazy thing to think about: So, you don’t give them access to care. You let them go blind, and then you’re going to pay for their disability when they go blind, right? How backwards is that?”
Had she not gotten the surgeries, Brown would have lost sight completely in that left eye, doctors told her.
Before she found Lions, the search had been so frustrating that she told her mother through tears, “Maybe I should just let this eye go.”
‘Shoulder that burden’
Since Brown could no longer drive, she’d take Uber rides across town for her frequent appointments. For appointments in Charleston with her surgeon, her mother would drive from Myrtle Beach to Columbia, 2 1/2 hours away, for another two-hour drive to Charleston. After one surgery, she developed an infection and had to visit her Columbia doctor daily — $30 roundtrip — because her case was so critical. Knowing she couldn’t afford the appointments, her doctor stopped charging her at follow-ups.
Servants for Sight, a faith-based nonprofit that helps South Carolinians in poverty pay for vision care, offers to pay for surgeries, treatments and Uber rides to eye care appointments. Rideshares have helped people “not only start their care, but complete their care,” said Amy Evette, executive director of Servants for Sight.
The group also runs a mobile vision screening unit that visits communities across northwestern South Carolina. Volunteers and staff screen for signs of diseases such as glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy inside the white-and-green van, and connect patients to ophthalmologists for further care. The van is equipped with retinal imaging equipment and rows of free sunglasses. On the outside are logos of various eye care centers and nonprofits who volunteer to help.

“If people don’t have insurance or are not able to afford an eye exam once a year, it’s very difficult for them to detect any kind of eye disease,” said Sandra Torres, an ophthalmic technician of 17 years. The group works with homeless shelters, and she says many people end up on the streets because they lose their sight, and then their jobs.
The vehicle saw a busy recent Thursday morning in Spartanburg, a city of about 38,000 people roughly 30 miles southeast of Greenville. Stationed in the parking lot behind a free medical clinic, staff prepared for nearly three dozen patients scheduled that day.
Multiple residents filed into the van throughout the morning, many with thick contact casts wrapped around their calves and feet, used to heal and protect diabetic ulcers. Diabetes, which increases the risk of glaucoma, disproportionately affects people with lower incomes and communities of color, amid structural barriers to affordable health care and healthier food.

Angela Garrett, a local pastor, has been grappling with blurred vision and diabetes. Uninsured, she came to the unit to get her eye pressure and vision checked. Garrett, 55, is also recovering from a recent open-heart surgery. A caregiver for older adults, she said she’ll apply for Medicaid as soon as she’s recovered and can go back to work. In South Carolina, the income limit for a single person who is blind or living with a disability is $15,650.
She’s passionate about caregiving, a pursuit “from the heart,” even though her job is “the bottom of pay in medical,” she said. Despite her modest income, she may not qualify for Medicaid.
Often, patients don’t know help is available, or they stop coming to their appointments because they can’t drive and lack transportation, or they’re unable to pay, said Dr. Peter Daniel, another ophthalmologist and glaucoma specialist who works with the nonprofits. He recalled a glaucoma patient who stopped showing up for appointments. The man began to weep when Daniel told him not to worry about the cost and connected him with the charities.
“They’re in very difficult socioeconomic and complex situations,” Daniel said. “And those are the folks that I worry about going blind.”
Columbia optometrist Kendria Cartledge sees late-diagnosed glaucoma “daily.” She said the majority of her patients are on Medicaid, and that not enough eye care providers accept the public insurance program, putting more pressure on the ones who do.

The state Medicaid eligibility redetermination process has complicated matters. Patients may have had Medicaid in the past and are still struggling financially, but as states cull the rolls, they may lose coverage without knowing it. With glaucoma patients and others at risk of losing vision, timely care gets interrupted.
“A lot of these patients are getting lost to follow-up,” said Cartledge, who has been treating whole families with the disease among multiple siblings for years, building a relationship with them. “Some expansion would definitely help out these patients have better outcomes, have a better quality of life.”
The gigantic tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week could make that situation worse. The measure would cut federal Medicaid spending by $625 billion over 10 years, largely by enacting new work rules and additional paperwork requirements. The changes would remove about 7.6 million people from the Medicaid rolls over the next decade, according to initial estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.
Ophthalmologists like Daniel give care knowing they’re losing money, even after partial reimbursement from charities.
“If a charity can carry that burden, why can’t our state and federal systems help shoulder that burden? We do it for older patients, we do it for our Medicare population,” said Epstein, the Clemson Eye ophthalmologist. “Why can’t we do it for our younger patients?”
When ‘all else fails’
 Clad in a bright yellow tunic and woven sun hat, Jekeithlyn Ross stopped by the Servants for Sight check-in table to introduce herself. Only she didn’t have to. Marion Keller already knew Ross was the daughter of eye disease advocate J.C. Stroble as soon as she spoke her dad’s name. Keller has a bobblehead figurine of Stroble in her curio cabinet.

Ross has been on a mission to relaunch her nonprofit, the J.C. Stroble Glaucoma Awareness Foundation. Dormant during COVID-19, the organization is named for her late dad, who had glaucoma and was blind. The eye care advocate and Spartanburg icon died in 2013 at 71.
“Trying to get services to those that are falling between the cracks or the socioeconomically challenged is a challenge,” Ross said. “What we’re trying to do is go to the people, try to get the services to decrease the rate of blindness here.”
A volunteer with the South Carolina Lions Club and speaker at churches and national and local civic events, Stroble was also well-known in the community for his boisterous order-calling at the local fast-food fixture, the Beacon Drive-In. The eatery, where he was nicknamed the “Beacon Barker,” is popular among locals and as a stop on campaign trails. Inside, Stroble’s portrait adorns the wall chronicling the diner’s storied history, which includes presidential candidate visits, along with benchmarks like the launch of the internet.
Medicaid cuts may disproportionately affect Black, Latino doctors and their patients

At the Servants for Sight check-in table, the excitement was palpable: Ross and Keller talked about their mirrored missions as if they were old friends. Keller shared that she had a cornea transplant, and before they parted ways, she and Ross blew each other a kiss. “This is a marriage. This is only the beginning,” Ross said.
Ross said she was aware of glaucoma because of her dad, but others without exposure might not know the importance of getting their eyes checked, or even that it runs in their families.
“We’re back in action — because the need is great,” Ross said. “Education, awareness is the key. It’s essential, and it’s not enough foot soldiers out there putting that message out.”
She’s been going to churches, civic groups, clinics and mobile units to spread the word about the foundation.
“Nonprofits pick up the pieces. We have a little joke: ‘When the government and all else fails, then you come to us,’” she said with a wry chuckle. “Because what do you do? You help.”
‘Like looking through a plastic sandwich bag’
Servants for Sight helped pay for glaucoma surgery and eye drops for 71-year-old Jimmie “Coach Sheek” Robinson. The retired school bus driver and Little League coach said he’s had trouble accessing Medicare.

“It was like looking through a plastic sandwich bag,” he recalled. “I’m asking, ‘Lord, what is happening to my eyes?’”
Often running in families, glaucoma can sneak up in those with 20/20 vision all their life, like Robinson.
He couldn’t see his fellow churchgoers’ hands, extended to greet him with a handshake. He’d have to explain that his peripheral vision was waning.
Handshakes matter at Piney Grove Baptist, a small congregation with scarlet carpets in Anderson, about 30 miles southwest of Greenville. A “flimsy grip won’t do it,” said one deaconess at the podium on a recent Sunday. “You can tell someone loves you,” she said, by their handshake.
“Shake my hand,” she exclaimed as parishioners laughed. “Show up with love.”
That day, Robinson, donning glasses, was able to do that. Throughout the sermon, he’d wave his hand in prayer over his daughter and grandchildren, who filled the pew behind him.
“I’m not going to get depressed over my eye,” he said. “God been good to me.”
Back in Columbia, with those costly prescriptions, doctor and rideshare visit costs adding up, Charisse Brown said she is now steeped in about $7,500 in debt, with Uber costs totaling $1,500 alone. She’s kept a GoFundMe up to try to chip away at bills through donations.

She has just moved into another apartment, a gray-floored two-bedroom, where rent is $300 cheaper than her previous one-bedroom flat. Leaving lights on at night, along with the beaming lamppost right outside her back door, helps her navigate her apartment after dark.
“That’s pretty much the only way that I am able to see, is enough light is coming in, especially in my left eye,” she said.
Brown said her friends have noticed her own light dimming.
Friends have always called her “Kumbaya” for her outgoing and positive attitude. But after her vision crisis, she fell into despair. She stopped going out, self-conscious about the appearance of her left eye, which is sometimes swollen and has strabismus. Because she can’t hop in her car for a spontaneous road trip like she used to, she’s leaned on her personal avatar in the online game “Second Life,” where she simulates going to the beach and streams her pastor’s sermons, as if she’s sitting in the pews.
She’s trying to lift her spirits by writing poetry and tending to her plants. In the corner of her sparsely furnished living room sits a fern she’s named Duchess, a pothos called Prince and a few other small pots, studded with budding succulents.
Sitting on the couch, she reads from her poem “Overcome.” She’d been lying in the hospital bed after a surgery, using speech-to-text to write:
Darkness and light both dwell in the same universe, but light always outshines – so I nicknamed myself ‘Bright,’
To be able to blind the Dark from coming my way.
It’s so blinding that maybe he would give up
And leave me alone today.

(Getty Images)State lawmakers are pushing to allow ivermectin — an antiparasitic drug that became notorious during the COVID-19 pandemic — to be purchased without a prescription in New Hampshire. And they’re doing it by tacking on a provision to a Medicaid cost-efficiency program.
Senate Bill 119 was introduced in the New Hampshire Senate earlier this year with the goal of making the state Medicaid program more cost-efficient. The bill seeks to allow Medicaid to purchase name-brand drugs when they are cheaper than generics. Medicaid has long been prevented from buying name brands because historically they are more expensive. However, recent market developments have made some name-brand drugs cheaper than their generic counterparts, so lawmakers have worked to alter that rule this year. This has been a priority in Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s budget agenda amid a difficult fiscal environment this year.
“My wife loves to shop at Hannaford, and nine times out of 10, if there’s a Hannaford brand, I pick the Hannaford brand up,” Sen. James Gray, a Rochester Republican and the bill’s sponsor, said during a hearing on the bill last month. “But you know what? Sometimes that national brand has a coupon. Sometimes that national brand has a discount. Sometimes it’s just on sale. And that’s exactly what this bill does. It says, ‘Hey, you don’t have to buy generic if the national brand is cheaper.’”
The Senate approved SB 119 through a voice vote in March. However, when it got to House lawmakers, Rep. Yury Polozov, a Hooksett Republican, proposed an amendment that added a provision allowing ivermectin to be purchased at New Hampshire pharmacies without a prescription from a doctor.
The House passed the amended version of SB 119 on Thursday, sending the bill back to the Senate for another vote. House Democrats criticized the change.
“It is very bad legislative policy to attach unlike things together in the hopes of forcing somebody else to do something that they would not otherwise do,” Rep. Lucy Weber, a Walpole Democrat, said on the House floor Thursday. “Anything that is good legislative policy stands on its own and should not be attached to anything else.”
Ivermectin was discovered in Japan in the 1970s and subsequently used to develop a veterinary drug to treat parasitic infections in horses, cattle, dogs, and other animals, according to the American Chemical Society. Years later, researchers from Merck Pharmaceuticals and the Kitasato Institute began experimenting on uses of the drug for humans. They were able to use the drug to treat river blindness and saw so much success they won a 2015 Nobel Prize. The medicine is now used to treat several kinds of worm and lice infections in humans. However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cautions that high doses of ivermectin can cause seizures, coma, or even death. The Mayo Clinic also warns that the drug could interact poorly with other medications and that it hasn’t been tested for safety and efficacy among small children, geriatric patients, and breastfeeding babies.
Ivermectin gained notoriety during the pandemic when people began using it as a treatment for COVID-19. Research was conducted on whether the drug could be repurposed for COVID-19 treatment. However, that research was never able to prove ivermectin was effective at treating the virus. Still, online misinformation and faulty studies drove people to seek the drug anyway. In 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported a sharp increase in the number of people calling into poison control centers due to ivermectin overdoses. It also said it received reports of people who, unable to get a prescription for the drug, had resorted to buying and taking formulations made for animals from veterinary suppliers unsafe for humans. Some online posts have claimed ivermectin could be used to treat cancer, a claim that is unsubstantiated, though there’s early-stage research investigating its use for cancer treatment in combination with other drugs.
A few other states have turned ivermectin into an over-the-counter medication. Legislatures in Arkansas, Idaho, and Tennessee have done so already. North Carolina, Louisiana, and several other states are considering following suit. This state-by-state approval marks a departure from the typical process for approving an over-the counter medicine. Typically, federal health authorities with the FDA have weighed scientific evidence and determined whether a drug can be sold safely over-the-counter. In these states, lawmakers have superseded that process and made the determination themselves.
This isn’t the first effort to make ivermectin over-the-counter in New Hampshire. In 2022, the Legislature passed similar legislation, but then-Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, vetoed it, arguing that, “Patients should always consult their doctor before taking medications so that they are fully aware of treatment options and potential unintended consequences of taking a medication that may limit other treatment options in the future.”
Introducing the amendment, Rep. Kelley Potenza, a Rochester Republican and one of its supporters, said the proposal “lies at the intersection of public health, personal freedom, and frankly common sense.”
Potenza claimed the drug “carries a much lower risk than over-the-counter pain relievers like Tylenol.” She also called claims that ivermectin is dangerous and ineffective in treating COVID-19 “propaganda” and “lies.” Potenza said when she had COVID-19 during the pandemic, she got a prescription from a doctor in Arizona for ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine. She attributes her recovery to it. She said the government’s actions during the pandemic is what inspired her to run for office.
The Mayo Clinic says that claims about ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine, or chloroquine being effective at treating COVID-19 are false. The CDC and FDA both say current research has been unable to demonstrate that ivermectin is effective at treating COVID-19.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ivermectinhb1022-1024x609.jpg,,,2025-05-28 05:01:45.521206

(Robert Breck Chapman Collection, Langsdale Library Special Collections, University of Baltimore, CC BY-NC-ND)In cities across the U.S., the housing crisis has reached a breaking point. Rents are skyrocketing, homelessness is rising, and working-class neighborhoods are threatened by displacement.

These challenges might feel unprecedented. But they echo a moment more than half a century ago.
In the 1950s and 1960s, housing and urban inequality were at the center of national politics. American cities were grappling with rapid urban decline, segregated and substandard housing, and the fallout of highway construction and urban renewal projects that displaced hundreds of thousands of disproportionately low-income and Black residents.
The federal government decided to try to do something about it.
President Lyndon B. Johnson launched one of the most ambitious experiments in urban policy: the Model Cities Program.
As a scholar of housing justice and urban planning, I’ve studied how this short-lived initiative aimed to move beyond patchwork fixes to poverty and instead tackle its structural causes by empowering communities to shape their own futures.
Building a great society
The Model Cities Program emerged in 1966 as part of Johnson’s Great Society agenda, a sweeping effort to eliminate poverty, reduce racial injustice and expand social welfare programs in the United States.
Earlier urban renewal programs had been roundly criticized for displacing communities of color. Much of this displacement occurred through federally funded highway and slum clearance projects that demolished entire neighborhoods and often left residents without decent options for new housing.
So the Johnson administration sought a more holistic approach. The Demonstration Cities and Metropolitan Development Act established a federal framework for cities to coordinate housing, education, employment, health care, and social services at the neighborhood level.

  New York City neighborhoods designated for revitalization with funding from the Model Cities Program. (The City of New York, Community Development Program: A Progress Report, December 1968.)
To qualify for the program, cities had to apply for planning grants by submitting a detailed proposal that included an analysis of neighborhood conditions, long-term goals and strategies for addressing problems.
Federal funds went directly to city governments, which then distributed them to local agencies and community organizations through contracts. These funds were relatively flexible but had to be tied to locally tailored plans. For example, Kansas City, Missouri, used Model Cities funding to support a loan program that expanded access to capital for local small businesses, helping them secure financing that might otherwise have been out of reach.
Unlike previous programs, Model Cities emphasized what Johnson described as “comprehensive” and “concentrated” efforts. It wasn’t just about rebuilding streets or erecting public housing. It was about creating new ways for government to work in partnership with the people most affected by poverty and racism.
A revolutionary approach to poverty
What made Model Cities unique wasn’t just its scale but its philosophy. At the heart of the program was an insistence on “widespread citizen participation,” which required cities that received funding to include residents in the planning and oversight of local programs.
The program also drew inspiration from civil rights leaders. One of its early architects, Whitney M. Young Jr., had called for a “Domestic Marshall Plan” – a reference to the federal government’s efforts to rebuild Europe after World War II – to redress centuries of racial inequality.

Young’s vision helped shape the Model Cities framework, which proposed targeted systemic investments in housing, health, education, employment, and civic leadership in minority communities. In Atlanta, for example, the Model Cities Program helped fund neighborhood health clinics and job training programs. But the program also funded leadership councils that for the first time gave local low-income residents a direct voice in how city funds were spent.
In other words, neighborhood residents weren’t just beneficiaries. They were planners, advisers, and, in some cases, staffers.
This commitment to community participation gave rise to a new kind of public servant — what sociologists Martin and Carolyn Needleman famously called “guerrillas in the bureaucracy.”

These were radical planners — often young, idealistic and deeply embedded in the neighborhoods they served. Many were recruited and hired through new Model Cities funding that allowed local governments to expand their staff with community workers aligned with the program’s goals.
Working from within city agencies, these new planners used their positions to challenge top-down decision-making and push for community-driven planning.
Their work was revolutionary not because they dismantled institutions but because they reimagined how institutions could function, prioritizing the voices of residents long excluded from power.
Strengthening community ties
In cities across the country, planners fought to redirect public resources toward locally defined priorities.

In some cities, such as Tucson, the program funded education initiatives such as bilingual cultural programming and college scholarships for local students. In Baltimore, it funded mobile health services and youth sports programs.
In New York City, the program supported new kinds of housing projects called vest-pocket developments, which got their name from their smaller scale: midsize buildings or complexes built on vacant lots or underutilized land. New housing such as the Betances Houses in the South Bronx were designed to add density without major redevelopment taking place — a direct response to midcentury urban renewal projects, which had destroyed and displaced entire neighborhoods populated by the city’s poorest residents. Meanwhile, cities such as Seattle used the funds to renovate older apartment buildings instead of tearing them down, which helped preserve the character of local neighborhoods.
The goal was to create affordable housing while keeping communities intact.

What went wrong?
Despite its ambitious vision, Model Cities faced resistance almost from the start. The program was underfunded and politically fragile. While some officials had hoped for $2 billion in annual funding, the actual allocation was closer to $500 million to $600 million, spread across more than 60 cities.
Then the political winds shifted. Though designed during the optimism of the mid-1960s, the program started being implemented under President Richard Nixon in 1969. His administration pivoted away from “people programs” and toward capital investment and physical development. Requirements for resident participation were weakened, and local officials often maintained control over the process, effectively marginalizing the everyday citizens the program was meant to empower.
In cities such as San Francisco and Chicago, residents clashed with bureaucrats over control, transparency and decision-making. In some places, participation was reduced to token advisory roles. In others, internal conflict and political pressure made sustained community governance nearly impossible.
Critics, including Black community workers and civil rights activists, warned that the program risked becoming a new form of “neocolonialism,” one that used the language of empowerment while concentrating control in the hands of white elected officials and federal administrators.
A legacy worth revisiting
Although the program was phased out by 1974, its legacy lived on.
In cities across the country, Model Cities trained a generation of Black and brown civic leaders in what community development leaders and policy advocates John A. Sasso and Priscilla Foley called “a little noticed revolution.” In their book of the same name, they describe how those involved in the program went on to serve in local government, start nonprofits and advocate for community development.
It also left an imprint on later policies. Efforts such as participatory budgeting, community land trusts, and neighborhood planning initiatives owe a debt to Model Cities’ insistence that residents should help shape the future of their communities. And even as some criticized the program for failing to meet its lofty goals, others saw its value in creating space for democratic experimentation.

Today’s housing crisis demands structural solutions to structural problems. The affordable housing crisis is deeply connected to other intersecting crises, such as climate change, environmental injustice, and health disparities, creating compounding risks for the most vulnerable communities. Addressing these issues through a fragmented social safety net — whether through housing vouchers or narrowly targeted benefit programs — has proven ineffective.
Today, as policymakers once again debate how to respond to deepening inequality and a lack of affordable housing, the lost promise of Model Cities offers vital lessons.
Model Cities was far from perfect. But it offered a vision of how democratic, local planning could promote health, security and community.

(Pool photo by Samantha Madar, Columbus Dispatch.)The Ohio Missing Persons Working Group has made 18 recommendations to lawmakers, the Ohio Attorney General’s Office, and various statewide agencies to better investigate missing persons cases. 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine created the 24-member working group in January after The Columbus Dispatch published a series last year about how police handle missing persons cases. The group met six times and DeWine announced the recommendations Tuesday. 
“We believe, from the bottom of our heart, (the recommendations) will improve the way the state of Ohio handles reports when somebody goes missing,” said Ohio Department of Public Safety Director Andy Wilson. 
There were 21,342 missing Ohioans in 2024 — including 16,404 missing children, according to the Ohio Attorney General’s Office.

One of the recommendations is that lawmakers would allow law enforcement to get a search warrant to help find someone who is missing. In order to currently get a search warrant, law enforcement has to allege that a criminal act has occurred and have probable cause. 
“We know for law enforcement that as much information they can get early on in an investigation will certainly help, a lot of times, bring the outcome to a speedy resolution,” Wilson said. “One of the tools that law enforcement officers use to gather that information is a search warrant for records pertaining to phone records or internet records or social media records.” 
The working group is also asking lawmakers to increase penalties for crimes of interference with custody, which is currently a fifth-degree felony. 
“A lot of times, missing children go missing because of a family member or a parent who doesn’t have legal custody of the child, takes that child in violation of custody orders, and sometimes takes that child out of state,” Wilson said. 
In some situations, the missing child is taken out of the country, he said. 
“In those situations, once you remove the child from the state, it becomes very difficult to get that child back, especially if you’re only dealing with a lower level felony offense,” Wilson said. “If you take the child out of the country, it should be enhanced even further, because then it becomes very difficult for law enforcement to get that child back. We believe that not only would that have a deterrent effect on people taking their kids and running, but it would adequately address the system from a justice point of view.” 
Some of the most tragic cases DeWine has seen were custody cases where the child was taken out of the country. 
“It is extremely difficult for anybody to do anything about that once that child is outside the custody of the United States,” he said. “And so anything we can do to increase that penalty, try to make that more of a deterrent, is certainly something that we should do.”
State Reps. Christine Cockley, D-Columbus, and Kevin Ritter, R-Marietta, introduced a bill that would require law enforcement agencies to enter a missing person’s information in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System.
“We believe from the bottom of our heart that (the) bill is probably a good vehicle for us to maybe amend or add some of the recommendations from this working group,” Wilson said.
Andy Chapman
Andy Chapman went missing in 2006 and his family has been working to bring him home ever since.
“Nineteen years we have held out hope that Andy would come home, 19 years of worry, heartbreak, anger, sadness, and unimaginable grief,” his sister Aimee Chapman said.
Andy went missing when he was 32 years old, a few years after his life “was turned upside down” by addiction after getting in a car accident, his sister said. He was last seen in Columbus.
Aimee said her brother’s case has been closed and reopened by several detectives over the years.
“Throughout all this time, we have continued to advocate on behalf of Andy and our family and other families of missing persons,” she said. “Families are the key to that individual’s habits, friends and records. … Knowing these cases are not forgotten about is so important to us.”
18 recommendations

The Ohio General Assembly should codify criteria for Ohio’s Endangered Missing Child Alert.
The Ohio State Highway Patrol should work with the Attorney General’s Bureau of Criminal Investigation to create an automatic process to notify necessary law enforcement agencies of Endangered Missing Child Alerts. 
The U.S. Department of Justice should expedite work to connect National Crime Information Center to the NamUs database as required by the federal Help Find the Missing Act, otherwise known as Billy’s Law. 
The Ohio General Assembly should create legislation authorizing law enforcement and county prosecutors to seek search warrants to gather information and records that may help them locate a high-risk missing person. 
The Ohio General Assembly should create legislation to increase the criminal penalty for suspects who interfere with custody by removing a child or children out of the state or to a foreign nation
The Ohio General Assembly should mandate that interference with custody arrest warrants be entered into LEADS and NCIC with a nationwide pickup radius. 
The Ohio Office of Criminal Justice Services should expand its Ohio Prisoner Extradition Reimbursement Program to allow grant funding to be used to pay law enforcement for costs associated with returning interference with custody suspects to Ohio. 
The Ohio General Assembly should create legislation requiring local law enforcement agencies to digitize unresolved missing persons reports prior to the destruction of paper files. BCI should also create a digital repository to store missing persons’ case records from local law enforcement agencies. 
The Ohio Peace Officer Training Academy within the Ohio Attorney General’s Office should develop advanced training for new missing persons investigators and law enforcement dispatchers.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Ohio Republicans plan to pass recreational marijuana reform by the end of June. Both the House and Senate are working together to create restrictions, which have drawn criticism from legalized marijuana supporters around the state.
Under the law passed by Ohio voters in November 2023, if you are 21 years old or older, you can smoke, vape, and ingest marijuana. Individually, you can grow six plants, but you can grow up to 12 plants per household if you live with others.
What is the latest with marijuana?
Right now, Ohio House and Senate leaders are negotiating for multi-chamber-approved cannabis reform.
“Generally, trying to get to a place that more people support,” House Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, said.
The lawmakers are trying to combine two bills: Senate Bill 56 and House Bill 160. Both make dozens of changes to cannabis access, but most notably, S.B. 56 limits THC content and reduces home growing to six plants, while H.B. 160 limits THC and keeps home growing the same.
Asked if Statehouse Republicans had come to an agreement yet, Stewart said “stay tuned.”
He added that he did like the House’s substitute bill — one that addressed the “desire in the caucus to have low-dose drinks.”
“I think that there are going to be some adjustments on the criminalization side that should hopefully address some of those concerns,” Stewart said.
Why did they really move to change the law?
That answer depends on who you ask.
Ohio Senate Republican leaders have continued to say that the voters knew they wanted legal weed — but the lawmakers claim that voters didn’t know everything they were voting on.
Stewart and House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, have echoed those claims.
“It’s obviously a complex issue growing out of the ’23 initiative and with the growth of the THC, hemp, and artificially created hemp products,” he said.
Huffman said he wanted to deal with delta 8, low-level THC products sold in convenience stores with no age limits first, as his “primary goal is regulating the sale of all these products, including getting them out of the stores where they’re accessible to minors.”
Ohio Democratic lawmakers, and some Republicans, disagree with Huffman, saying it’s about control.
“We want to make sure that the will of voters is protected,” House Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, said. “We want to make sure that the use of that revenue is upheld.”

Many campuses nationwide saw students protesting that country’s legalized system of racial oppression, apartheid. 
In that era, roughly 30 years from the civil rights movement, the fight against apartheid had gained traction in politics and in popular culture. The 1985 protest song “Sun City” played on a loop on video music shows, while President Reagan seemingly coddled the regime. 
Most people, however, may have forgotten the role of Kansas and the United States in this winding human rights saga. 
First, some perspective. White South Africans represent 7 percent of the population but own 72 percent of the land. Black South Africans represent 81 percent of the population but own 4 percent of the land. 
White South Africans are not oppressed, though the late comedian Robin Williams once rhetorically asked the white minority there: “Does the name Custer mean anything to you?” 
Apartheid, which means “apartness,” mirrored American racial segregation. A person’s race determined where people could live, where they could work, and whom they could marry. 
This month, President Trump ambushed South African President Cyril Ramaphosa during a White House meeting, peddling a false narrative of “white genocide” there. Trump, while aggressively deporting immigrants of color, recently welcomed 59 white South Africans who he claimed were fleeing oppression. If there is a genocide, why are only 59 people trying to escape it? 
It’s important to note that truth matters little to this president. What is important is the continued building of a false, white grievance narrative for his base. He’s reassuring them that he’s for them. Always. 
The more news media press him about this, the deeper and wider his base’s roots of loyalty strengthen and spread. 
Nevertheless, Kansas and America had an interesting connection with South Africa, apartheid, and with the jailing and eventual release of Nelson Mandela, who would eventually rule the nation that imprisoned him. 
Former U.S. Sen. Nancy Kassabaum, then chairwoman of the Senate Subcommittee on African Affairs, helped develop sanctions against the apartheid regime. 
President Regan vetoed the legislation, but Congress overrode his veto. The sanctions, along with international pressure, helped dismantle that system. 
A Kansan stood watch over apartheid on its deathbed. 
President Clinton dispatched Ronald Walters, the noted political science expert and co-architect of the historic Dockum sit-in, to South Africa to monitor elections that would spell the end of apartheid. 
Walters, also an architect of the Congressional Black Caucus, knew Mandela, who phoned the Walters’ home in 2010 after Walters died.
Another Kansan, Gretchen Eick, now a retired professor of history and award-winning author, lobbied against apartheid for 30 years and was part of the final 1986 passage of comprehensive sanctions over Reagan’s veto. 
“A stunning experience!” Eick wrote via email. 
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, who researched apartheid as a Harvard student in the 1980s, told The Wichita Eagle years ago that he’d grown interested in South Africa because its issues had reached that campus. Kobach said then that he didn’t oppose sanctions, but he thought disinvestment removed American companies from fight. Those companies, he said, could form a powerful anti-apartheid bloc. 
He reportedly wrote his senior thesis at Harvard about how South African businesses had become politicized. Kobach based that report, for which he won a campus award, on research conducted during a 1987 visit there. 
Harvard professor Samuel Huntington advised Kobach’s work, and reportedly believed South Africa should pursue a “policy of simultaneous reform and repression,” said a review in The Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper. 
Black South Africans faced brutal repression, and the U.S., under President Kennedy, helped imprison Mandela. 
NPR, in a 2016 interview with a former CIA official, reported Mandela’s 1962 capture happened because of a U.S. tip to South African officials. That capture and arrest led to Mandela’s nearly 28-year imprisonment. 
According to Time magazine, when the South African government released Mandela in 1990, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution quoted a “senior CIA operative” regarding Mandela’s capture. 
Within hours of Mandela’s arrest, operative Paul Eckel said: “We have turned Mandela over to the South African security branch. We gave them every detail, what he would be wearing, the time of day, just where he would be. They have picked him up. It is one of our greatest coups.” 
Our country played dual roles in Mandela’s life. 
It delivered him to his captors but also lobbied South Africa not to hang him for treason and later applied political and economic pressure to end apartheid. 
And our “Free State,” played a small role in Mandela’s and in that nation’s liberation.

Marcy Kaptur is being slammed in right-wing attack ads running on targeted streaming services in the state. 
The flatly misleading ads are part of a nationwide campaign produced by a dark money group (backed by Big Pharma and linked to a Republican super PAC) dedicated to electing Republicans to the U.S. House. 
American Action Network launched its $7 million advertising campaign across 30 congressional districts in the country with two separate ad versions. 
One aims to convince (fool?) voters in red districts that Republicans aren’t coming for their health care and food stamps — when they are — and the other attempts to shift the focus from the hundreds of billions House Republicans just voted to cut from Medicaid to an item not yet on the GOP chopping block. 
U.S. House Republican cuts to Medicaid, food assistance would impact hundreds of thousands in Ohio

The conservative nonprofit pivoted to Medicare to go after vulnerable House Democrats with identical attack ads airing through the first week of June. 
They all feature an older blond woman lambasting — fill in (Marcy Kaptur) the name — for threatening Medicare and for “crippling the development of lifesaving drugs for cancer, Alzheimer’s and other diseases.” The 9th District congresswoman is derided for “playing politics with our Medicare and medicine.” 
The twisted narrative is obviously designed to deflect from the GOP tax cut agenda to benefit the rich at the expense of the poor and damage susceptible Democratic representatives ahead of next year’s midterms. 
For the record, Kaptur voted against the GOP’s continuing resolution in March that funded the government through September — which the ad framed as voting against Medicare. Like most Democrats, she did so because the stopgap spending bill did nothing to check the Trump administration’s lawless withholding of congressionally appropriated funds. 
The Toledo Democrat also supported the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that included measures to lower prescription drug costs opposed by Big Pharma — which the ad frames as disincentive to develop breakthrough drugs. 
Gross distortions aside, GOP-affiliated organizations are homing in on defeatable Democratic incumbents to attempt to grow the narrow Republican majority in the House in 2026. 
The fact that they’re doing it so early in the election cycle speaks volumes about the perceived weakness of not only Kaptur but the Democratic Party writ large in Ohio and the country. 
Kaptur, who will be 79 next month, has represented Ohio’s 9th congressional district in the northwestern quadrant of the state for 42 years. She is the longest-serving woman in the U.S. House and broadly respected for that commitment back home. 
But Kaptur barely hung onto her seat last November, winning by less than 1% against a young hardliner notable for pitching a tantrum as a crybaby state rep. 
To be fair, the congresswoman has been uniquely challenged by the gerrymandered contortions Ohio Statehouse Republicans forced her to accommodate, including the egregious “Snake on the Lake” rendition that absurdly snaked the district between Toledo and Cleveland.
But besides unconstitutional redistricting, Kaptur faces strong headwinds as a member of the Democratic gerontocracy that exceedingly frustrates rank and file Democrats for utterly failing to meet this moment of existential terror. 
Only one major political party in America remains faithful to the founding principles of the republic but it is on habitual disconnect. Meanwhile, freedom of speech, assembly, and due process are being shredded in real time by the felon-in-chief as Republicans on Capitol Hill do nothing.

Yet, with few exceptions, the opposition party isn’t doing much either while the jaw-dropping corruption, intentional chaos, and abject cruelty of the Trump administration mocks the rule of law. 
There is no sense of urgency to course correct among play-by-the-books, protocol-loving Democrats in Congress. There is no sense that the same old losing strategies and recycled candidates that keep popping up — and relegating federal and state Democrats to legislative minorities — need to be ditched ASAP.
A changing of the guard is imminent in the Ohio Democratic Party, but there is no sense that internal horse-trading will be guided by the growing army of angry and alarmed voters screaming for effective, fearless leadership now to fight every day/all day for government of, by, and for the people. A year from now will be too late. A revitalizing force of risk-takers with a solid bench is long overdue. 
In 2024, Ohio Democrats played it safe, unwisely distancing themselves from a Democratic presidential ticket packing venues that could have driven up voter turnout in traditionally Democratic urban counties. Instead, those metro areas recorded the state’s biggest drops in turnout. 
Will the party rerun predictable candidates in 2026 for U.S. Senate or governor in Ohio to again play it safe and scramble to find warm bodies to run in other statewide races while legislative races go unchallenged? Probably.
But maybe a gutsy Gen Zer or impatient millennial will rise up at this most critical juncture to preserve self-governance and confront tyranny head on with the energy and passion and resolve of past generations of Americans who carried the torch forward.
Maybe Democrats still talking and acting like politicians afraid to make waves will finally wake up. Maybe the septuagenarian incumbent in Ohio’s 9th will decide to go hard or go home. Reticence only invites dark money attack ads. A full year and a half before the midterms.

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)The tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week targets a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government. The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.
Children’s health services could see trims even under scaled-back Medicaid cuts

Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.
States that enshrined Medicaid expansion in their constitutions could be in a bind

But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.










Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them.


– Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals


Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

After examining more than 100 multifamily projects in three states, RAND concluded that building them in California is 2.8 times as expensive as in Texas and 1.5 times higher than in Colorado, “with much of the difference driven by state and local policies that contribute to long permitting and construction timelines, and higher local development fees.”
Even more shockingly, RAND found that projects for low-income families cost 1.5 times as much to build as market-rate housing in California and four times the average cost in Texas.
Last week, the California Senate appeared to double down on making housing development more difficult and costly, shunting a bill aimed at making it easier to build housing for lower-income families by exempting some projects from the California Environmental Quality Act.
Senate Bill 607, carried by state Sen. Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat, was gutted in the Senate Appropriations Committee, apparently because Senate leaders such as President Pro Tem Mike McGuire caved into fierce opposition from environmental groups and labor unions, which celebrated the move. The committee announced that SB 607’s contents were being stripped out and replaced by vague language declaring intentions to negotiate further, leaving the fate of the proposal unclear.

Those who either oppose housing projects on environmental grounds or demand concessions, such as requiring them to use union construction labor, have often used — or misused — CEQA as a tool. Over the last half-decade, the Legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom have nibbled at CEQA’s provisions, but when SB 607 was introduced, environmental and labor groups drew an opposition line in the sand.
After the bill was bowdlerized last week, the coalition praised McGuire and other Senate leaders “for recognizing that the language of SB 607 would have created significant unintended consequences on communities and new legal uncertainties.”
Just days earlier, Newsom had urged the Legislature to pass SB 607 and a similar measure, Assembly Bill 609, as much-needed reforms to increase housing development.
“It’s time to get serious about this issue, period, full stop,” Newsom said. “If you care about your kids you care about getting this done. This is the biggest opportunity to do something big and bold and the only impediment is us.”
The SB 607 blockage may indicate that Newsom is losing clout with the Legislature as he nears lame duck status. However, he could revive the bill as part of the forthcoming negotiations over the state budget, as a statement by Wiener and McGuire suggested.
 The RAND study reveals why the state is falling behind.
“California is significantly more expensive than both Colorado and Texas in every cost category that we examined,” Jason Ward, lead author of the report, said in a statement. “One way to address California’s high housing costs is to look for lessons from states where it is easier and less expensive to build new housing.”
The report urges California to emulate a Texas law giving local governments just 30 days to approve or reject projects to reduce California’s 22-month average processing time, to reduce mandatory fees, and to consider modifying California’s strict energy efficiency requirements.
The most poignant finding in the report, however, is that “if California had Colorado’s production costs for publicly subsidized affordable apartments the roughly $1.25 billion in recent spending by the state’s four largest funding programs would have produced more than four times as many units.”
That’s what California is giving up as it continues to make housing development more costly than it needs to be.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/051823-Senate-Appropriations-Committee-Hearing-MG-CM-03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-28 04:00:21.300358

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThe Georgia Secretary of State’s office will decide on Wednesday whether Public Service Commission candidate Daniel Blackman can remain on the ballot for the Democratic primary on June 17.
On Tuesday, the first day of early voting in two statewide PSC races, Administrative Court Judge Dominic Capraro ruled in an initial decision that Blackman does not meet the residency requirements to be a candidate for a metro Atlanta Public Service Commission seat.
The District 3 Democratic primary also includes Keisha Waites, a former member of the Atlanta City Council and the Georgia House of Representatives, as well as Peter Hubbard, founder of Center for Energy Solutions and an expert witness at PSC hearings, and Robert Jones, who has had a career involved in energy regulation in California.
The primary winner will face sitting GOP Commissioner Fitz Johnson in the Nov. 4 general election. The five-member state regulatory board has faced criticism for a series of Georgia Power rate hikes over the last several years. Early voting for two PSC commission primaries will run until June 13.
The residency dispute involves a one-bedroom dwelling in Atlanta that Blackman leased on Oct. 4, 2024. Blackman testified that he purchased the property to live closer to work while his wife and children continued to reside in their Forsyth County home, according to the 12-page ruling.
2540751_1465937
Capraro wrote that Blackman failed to provide evidence that he actually lived in the home, such as property tax records, utility bills or mail being delivered to the Atlanta address.
“The testimony presented by (Blackman) did not establish that he actually resided in Fulton County during the relevant period,” Capraro wrote. “Other than (Blackman) himself, no witness had personal knowledge of (Blackman’s) supposed residence at (the property) or anywhere in Fulton County, in the 12 months preceding the upcoming election.”
Under Georgia law, the Secretary of State and any Georgian who is eligible to vote for a candidate can challenge the qualifications of the candidate by filing a written complaint with the Secretary of State within two weeks after the deadline for qualifying. Public Service commissioners must reside within their PSC district boundaries for at least 12 months prior to the general election.
PSC District 3 comprises Clayton, DeKalb, and Fulton counties. Although the commissioners must reside in the geographical district that they represent, every Georgia voter can determine the winner since the state regulators are elected statewide.
This year was the second time that Blackman made a bid for a commission seat after he lost a 2021 runoff against Republican incumbent Lauren “Bubba” McDonald. Blackman, who would later after become a regional administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency under President Joe Biden, said Tuesday that he would appeal the Secretary of State ruling if it upholds the disqualification.
Blackman said he did not want to put the “cart before the horse” ahead of Wednesday’s ruling and that he doesn’t plan to scale back on campaigning.
The state administrative court held a hearing on the case following a complaint filed by Atlanta resident Rodney Stephens, which challenged the legality of Blackman’s qualification.
Waites, Jones and Hubbard declined Tuesday to comment on Blackman’s residency challenge.
This year’s primary and general elections will mark the first time since 2020 that PSC contests have appeared on Georgia ballots following lawsuits challenging redistricting and the fairness of the PSC election process for Black voters.
Republican incumbents Tim Echols and Johnson are facing challengers seeking to upset their bids to remain on the board. Johnson was appointed to the seat in 2021.
Echols, who is seeking his third term on the PSC, will face challenger Lee Muns in the Republican primary for the commission’s District 2 seat. Whoever wins will go on to face Alicia Johnson of Savannah, the sole candidate for the Democratic Party.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The University of Maryland Global Campus said Tuesday it will reintegrate offices that it had previously spun off as independent businesses, after a highly critical audit last year suggested that the move was both costly and that it skirted normal procurement procedures.
In letters to the campus community and to university and legislative leaders, UMGC President Gregory W. Fowler said the decision came after an outside consultant reviewed the relationship between the online campus and Ventures and AccelerEd, the two independent units it created.
“The final [consultant’s] report has been completed, and pending the receipt of appropriate notifications and approvals, UMGC intends to reintegrate Ventures and AccelerEd back into the University of Maryland Global Campus (UMGC), ” Fowler wrote.
He said the university expects to notify the University System of Maryland Board of Regents of the proposal at regents’ next June 13 meeting. If approved, Fowler said UMGC planned to target July 1 as “Day One” of the transition, which is expected to take a year to 18 months to complete.
Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Anne Arundel and Howard), who served as co-chair of the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee that grilled university officials last year on the audit, welcomed Tuesday’s announcement as a “positive development.”
“It makes sense,” he said, noting that the audit “demonstrated a conflict of interest and a loss of state funds” with UMGC arrangement.
Lawmakers grill UMGC officials over ad spending, ‘unique’ contract system

Lam said that he and other legislators questioned “whether this was an arms-length relationship” between the university and the supposedly independent firms that received virtually all of their business from UMGC. He said the arrangement allowed AccelerEd to “circumvent normal procurement process.”
“This [bringing AccelerEd in house] is a recognition that this probably should not have happened,” Lam said, noting that the initial decision to separate the IT business from UMGC was probably “shortsighted and maybe not the best use of taxpayer dollars.”
An August 2024 audit by the Office of Legislative Audits said UMGC spun off AccelerEd and Ventures under a University System of Maryland policy called the High Impact Economic Development Activities program. Under HIEDA, campuses in the system are allowed to give preferential treatment to businesses they spin off, under specific circumstances.
According to the audit, the campus created Ventures in 2016 as a tax-exempt holding company for UMGC businesses that the university seeded with $15 million. A year later, in 2017, UMGC spun off its information technlogy office into AccelerEd, a subsidiary of Ventures.
Ventures had $215.3 million in revenues from fiscal years 2017 to 2022, the audit said, but about $198.1 million of that money came from UMGC. And of the $198.1 million, about $184 million of those service agreements were made without competitive bids and with little oversight afterward, the audit said.
While HIEDA policy doesn’t require institutions to seek competitive bids, the audit noted that “the law does not mandate exclusive use of these entities.”
University officials defended the arrangement in the audit, and when they appeared before the joint committee nearly three months later, in a November hearing, they said they still stood “by the intent” of the program, even if there were issues in how the intent was executed.
But lawmakers pressed university officials about the use of millions of dollars through HIEDA. The university subsequently hired Attain Partners of McLean, Virginia, to conduct an assessment of “our relationship to UMGC Ventures and AccelerEd.” A final version of that report has been delivered, a copy was not immediately available Tuesday.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Please know that we are committed to managing the transition thoughtfully and transparently every step of the way,” Fowler wrote. “I assure you that we deeply value the contributions of every team member – at UMGC and AccelerEd – and will proceed with the utmost respect and care for all involved.”
Fowler said he planned to share more details with the campus community at a July 1 “global town hall.”
“I know that change can bring uncertainty, and questions are sure to arise about how this transition could affect individuals or teams across our operations,” Fowler wrote. “And as always, I thank you for the work you do on behalf of our learners and in support of our mission.”

Glenn Ivey is typically calm, but he admitted to being “angry” after a weekend trip to El Salvador where officials refused to let him see a constituent who’s been detained in prison there since March on orders from the Trump administration.","Rep. Glenn Ivey (D-4th) of Maryland speaks at a February  rally in support of federal workers outside the Department of Health and Human Services.

Glenn Ivey (D-4th) is usually calm and mild-mannered, but he admitted to being “angry” after a weekend trip to El Salvador where officials refused to let him see a constituent who’s been detained in prison there since March on orders from the Trump administration.
“We crossed all the Ts, dotted all the Is. We get down there, they [El Salvador authorities] won’t open the gate,” Ivey said Tuesday of his attempt to visit Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a migrant who was living in Beltstville when he was seized by federal officials and deported, despite a court order allowing him to stay here.
Ivey said he spoke with El Salvadoran authorities outside the prison through a small, sliding window in “95-degree heat” and was told he needed to get a permit back in San Salvador, which was about 90 minutes from the prison where Abrego Garcia is being held. This after Ivey met with the Salvadoran ambassador to the U.S. before heading there.
“If you talk with the ambassador, you shouldn’t need a permit,” Ivey said. “This is a congressional delegation coming to look at how you’re spending American tax dollars to jail people we deport. That’s ridiculous.”
Abrego Garcia, a native of El Salvador, was living in Prince George’s County with his wife, a U.S. citizen, and their child, while he worked as an apprentice sheet metal worker in a local union. He was driving home from Baltimore on March 12 with his son when he was stopped by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and held for being in the U.S. illegally.
Abrego Garcia has been shielded from deportation since 2019, when an immigration judge in a previous hearing determined that, if sent back to El Salvador, he had a credible fear of being harmed by the gangs there that caused him to leave the country in the first place.
Abrego Garcia judge questions administration’s broad use of state secrets privilege

ICE officials told Abrego Garcia his status had changed, even though they later admitted in court papers that it had not. Three days after he was stopped, he was sent to El Salvador on one of several planeloads of deportees who were ordered held in that country’s Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT, in exchange for millions in payments from the U.S.
Abrego Garcia has since been moved to a lower-security prison, but he remains held in El Salvador even though ICE and the  Justice Department have adknowledged in separate court filings that his deportation was an “administrative error” under the 2019 court order.
But the Trump administration, up to and including President Donald Trump (R), insist Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, a charge Abrego Garcia and his supporters vigorously deny. They note that he has not faced criminal charges in the U.S.
His supporters have challenged the administration to bring Abrego Garcia back to face charges in court, but the White House has refused to do so. The deportion without a hearing violates his due process right, they argue, and courts have agreed, all the was up to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ordered the Trump administration in April to “facilitate” his return to the U.S.
Ivey said Tuesday that the administration’s disregard of the law is pushing the country toward a “constitutional crisis, it looks like refusing to comply with court orders. That’s scary.”
ICE did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Tuesday afternoon.
Ivey was accompanied on his trip by Abel Nuñez, executive director of CARECEN, the Central American Resource Center, in Washington, D.C. Nuñez, who traveled to El Salvador to help schedule meetings with nonprofit organizations, accused the Trump administration of mimicking the Salvadoran government, by arresting people without justification. He said he was scheduled to meet over the weekend with an attorney who works with a human rights organization called Cristosal, but she was arrested on “trumped-up charges for a couple of days.”
“No one knew where she was,” Nuñez said. “This is what an authoritarian state does to create fear, sort of imposed to dominance on the people they are meant to be serving. We can think of El Salvador as a case study.”
Ivey summed up the trip in one word: bad.
“Kilmar’s wife had messages she asked me to convey to him. His lawyer had messages he wanted me to convey to him. I wasn’t able to do that,” Ivey said.
“Even in our supermax prisons here in the United States, you can talk to your lawyer,” he said. “It was just bad all the way around.”

The project will be managed by Hines, an international real estate company. (Rendering courtesy WMATA)State and local leaders touted the promise of a proposed mixed-use development to be built over an existing North Bethesda Metro station as a way to grow Montgomery County’s burgeoning life sciences and tech industries.
The facility is still years away from breaking ground. But Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich said the effort could transform the area into something similar to Kendall Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where technology firms are located close to MIT.
“I had been fascinated by the people I had been talking to about life sciences, and talking to me about Kendall Square in Boston, and talking about the urban campus, and talking about the value of collision spaces … rather than everything being done in office parks, where you never talk to the scientists in the next building,” Elrich said.

The county executive said too often research is confined to offices and research parks where there is little interaction with others.
“And in Boston and in Kendall Square, they created an environment … where brains could get together and have lunch, could have dinner, could talk to people from different companies, meeting with each other and talking about the work they’re doing,” Elrich said during a Tuesday press conference to unveil the proposal. “And I saw this as an opportunity to create that kind of collision space in Montgomery County.”
The plan calls for construction of as much as 3 million square feet of mixed-use space at the North Bethesda Metro station, which is adjacent to the Food and Drug Administration offices.
Officials with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which owns the 14-acre parcel, annouced Tuesday that Hines, a global real estate investment firm, would act as master developer on the project.
“This public-private partnership represents a shared commitment to creating a vibrant, mixed use, transit-oriented development,” said Andrew McGeorge, senior managing director at Hines.
“This project embodies a forward-thinking plan for life science that features state-of-the-art science facilities and brings online much needed residential and retail space,” he said. “It establishes North Bethesda as a hub for innovation and sustainable growth.”
Hines already has a sizable footprint in the area. In 2016, the firm acquired two office buildings near the site of the proposed Metro station project.
Metro General Manager and CEO Randy Clarke said there is no exact timeline for groundbreaking, but he expects Hines executives will want to move as quickly as possible.

“I wouldn’t even dare to put a date on something like that, because those things are really a little bit out of their control, like financing, permitting, design,” Clarke said at Tuesday’s event.
“Stuff like this could take several years to really put all those pieces together. The most important step is selecting the developer, and that’s what we did today,” he said.
The mixed-use facility, when built, is expected to include a second entrance to the North Bethesday Metro Station just north of the existing one. That new entrance would be funded by $25 million in federal aid approved under President Joe Biden (D). It is unclear if President Donald Trump (R), who has focused his early administration on cutting federal funding, agencies, and employees, will make good on the aid under his predecessor.
The new facility would be anchored by the University of Maryland Institute for Health Computing and its roughly 100 employees. About $33 million for the project will come from the state, with $24 million of that for the UMd. Institute for Health Computing.
Gov. Wes Moore’s (D) budget for fiscal 2026 also includes $3 million for operations at the institute. Another $5.6 million in state aid is earmarked for the new station entrance.

“This center will be the hub for cutting edge research in many areas and in many places, because Maryland is uniquely positioned to win in things like AI and life sciences and biotech,” Moore said during Tuesday’s event.
Moore has made growing life sciences and artificial intelligence a key focus of his desire to grow the state’s economy and become less dependent on federal jobs and related contracting.
The project is less than a mile from the site of the former White Flint Mall. The razed retail facility provides another 45 acres of land that could be used to expand the focus on life sciences along the corridor. Elrich said he expects an announcement on the future of that property soon.
“We’ve got 14 acres up here. We could build the core of a center up here,” Elrich said.

It’s time for real, structural change — because our kids deserve better.","Across Connecticut, parents, teachers, and school leaders are sounding the alarm: the way we deliver special education is failing too many students.
Parents are exhausted from fighting for services their children are legally entitled to. Teachers are burnt out from trying to meet overwhelming needs with limited support. School leaders are stuck between budget pressures and growing demand. And taxpayers are paying more each year for a system that still leaves too many children behind.

Maryam Khan
For far too long, we’ve patched holes instead of building a system that works. It’s time for real, structural change — because our kids deserve better.
This week, the Connecticut House of Representatives will address comprehensive special education legislation toward these issues. For too long, Connecticut’s special education system has lacked the structure and consistency that students, families, and educators deserve. House bill 5001 is about fixing that by making much-needed investments in special education resources and improving access for students in every community.
This legislative session, I had the honor of chairing the new select committee on Special Education that was tasked with addressing special education needs in our state. The committee held four public listening sessions across the state where we heard directly from parents, educators, school administrators, advocates, and community members. We also convened three informational committee meetings featuring insights from experts including the co-chairs of the Connecticut Special Education Task Force; the Executive Director of the Connecticut Association of Public School Superintendents; the Legislative Chair of Special Education Equity for Kids in Connecticut (SEEK) and the attorney for the Connecticut Council of Administrators of Special Education.
In addition, we consulted directly with Bryan Klimkiewicz, Connecticut’s State Director of Special Education. As chair, I also met individually with superintendents from across the state, parents who fought tooth and nail to get services for their children, and CAPSEF—the association representing Connecticut’s private special education providers. This bill reflects their collective experiences, expertise, and the urgent needs they shared.
One of the key features of this bill is investing in special education and interventions that help students struggling with academic or social emotional needs. Connecticut currently ranks 43rd in the nation for fourth-grade reading proficiency, and the gaps are even more pronounced for students with disabilities. This bill directly addresses this challenge by providing the resources needed for schools to implement proven interventions to help all students succeed. The bill expands access to opportunities so students get the support at the right time to gain critical academic skills they need and parents do not have to fight tooth and nail to get that support.
Additionally, the bill invests in the recruitment and retention of special education staff, tackling the critical workforce shortage that has hindered districts in providing the high-quality services that students with disabilities need. It also increases access to behavioral and mental health services, ensuring that students with more complex needs can receive the support they deserve to thrive in their education.
Another essential provision of the bill is the investment in in-district programs and facilities. Grants will help districts create or improve local placements, allowing more students to be served in their communities whenever possible. New construction and renovation funding will enable schools to build and redesign spaces that meet the needs of students with disabilities, reducing the reliance on costly out-of-district placements and creating better opportunities for students to learn in inclusive environments.
At the same time, the bill addresses a long-standing issue that’s been holding our special education system back —unpredictable costs and a lack of clarity around rate-setting for private providers. By establishing a transparent pricing structure for services, we ensure that districts have clear expectations and the financial certainty needed to make timely and informed placement decisions for students. 
This will also address the disparities in service pricing, which currently prevent many districts from providing consistent, timely services for our students who need them. When costs are unclear or unpredictable, districts may hesitate to place students in certain programs. This bill establishes clear, fair, and consistent standards, ensuring that resources are used effectively and equitably, so that more students can access the support they need, when they need it.
The bill provides clarity, equity, and transparency in a system that’s been unpredictable for too long, and confusing for families to navigate. It’s about ensuring that the supports students need are not contingent on budget limitations but are instead available across the state, regardless of placement, equitably and efficiently. This legislation strengthens our special education system. It supports what’s working and provides tools to address what isn’t. It ensures that every student gets the right support, in the right setting, at the right time, because that’s what Connecticut’s students deserve.
As a mother first and a special education teacher second, this work is deeply personal to me. I’m proud to have authored this legislation, and I look forward to its passage —so that every child in Connecticut can learn, grow, and thrive in a system that truly invests and supports their growth

While AI might sound like something out of Silicon Valley, it’s very real and very helpful right here in Connecticut. We use it to manage food inventory, forecast customer traffic, and even fine-tune our marketing —all of which helps us run more efficiently, reduce waste, and keep our doors open in a competitive industry.
That’s why I strongly support Senate Bill 1249, which takes a proactive approach to ensuring AI is used responsibly in our state. This legislation creates important protections around transparency, bias prevention, and accountability while still allowing for innovation and growth. It’s a framework that helps businesses like mine use AI with confidence, knowing that there are reasonable guardrails in place.
Small business owners don’t always have access to legal or technical teams to vet the tools we rely on. SB 1249 offers much-needed clarity and fairness by setting statewide standards that apply to everyone —big corporations and small entrepreneurs alike. That’s not just good for business— it’s good for consumers, too.
Connecticut has an opportunity to lead the way in ethical, inclusive AI policy that supports economic development and community empowerment. I encourage lawmakers to pass SB 1249 and ensure that the benefits of AI are shared across all industries and communities, including right here in Meriden.

LEXINGTON — Before Kosair for Kids Center for Safe and Healthy Families was founded in 2024, Kentucky children with bruised faces or sexual trauma waited for medical care alongside those with the flu. 
This was “not trauma-informed care,” said Barry Dunn, the president and CEO of Kosair for Kids, which then put up $2 million to do something about the problem. Kosair for Kids is a Louisville-based organization that advocates for children’s wellbeing.

“Do we want a child who has just experienced the worst moment of their life — who has just been sexually assaulted — being seen … beside a kid who’s there because the child is running a fever?” Dunn said. “Not to minimize the fever, but as you’re talking through what happened to you being sexually or physically abused, do we really want that to happen in an ER setting?”
The obvious answer to Dunn and others was no, children facing the worst moments of their lives need personalized and private care. It also helps if there is a therapy dog whose entire job is to comfort traumatized children.  
Dr. Christina Howard, a forensic pediatrician and Kentucky’s leading expert on child abuse, said the sterile ER is just “not an ideal” place for sensitive conversations about abuse. 
“As a parent, if you see a kid whose face is just bruised, it’s hard to look away,” she said. “It’s hard to not pay attention to that and want to do something.” 
It also was not a comfortable setup for much-needed mental health services, Howard said. 
The Kosair for Kids Center for Safe and Healthy Families at the University of Kentucky Hospital was built with this need for privacy and trauma-informed care for the smallest patients in mind. 
Now a year old, the clinic is a model for treating abuse — and trying to prevent it. 
‘It’s really, really hard to be a parent.’

Anyone, including parents, can bring a child to the clinic for treatment. A “large majority” of patients are referrals from the UK Hospital, which has consulting protocols when children come in with certain injuries, Howard said. 
The Department for Community Based Services, in the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, may refer children to the clinic, as well as concerned caregivers, police and other hospitals throughout the state. 
The clinic has three exam rooms, including one with a shower — which sexual abuse survivors can use after a rape kit, for example — and therapy rooms. One is a “play therapy” room for younger children. 
Another therapy room is where non-offending caregivers can get mental health treatment, a much-needed component because a lot of child neglect and abuse instances aren’t straightforward cases of cruelty, Howard said. 
Many other factors play a role, she said — addiction and other mental health issues are key culprits, as well as child care challenges. 
“We’re in a world where it’s really, really hard to be a parent, especially to be a single parent,” Howard said. 
Child care is expensive, she said, which sometimes forces parents to leave children in suboptimal situations so they can earn a paycheck to support the family.
“It’s one of those (decisions): cheap child care that might not be the safest, or work.”  
Howard said parents in such situations need support, including more affordable child care.  
“It’s pretty much on a daily basis, where I will see a single parent asking how other parents are surviving? ‘How are they putting food on the table and getting child care?’” she said. 
Plentiful data backs this struggle up. A 2024 survey of 1,357 parents from 88 Kentucky counties showed that some parents had already chosen to exit the workforce because of inaccessible child care.

Many families put off having more children, delayed big purchases and sacrificed health care needs because of child care complications, the Lantern previously reported. 
Child care centers closing during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in “fewer eyeballs on kids,” Dunn with Kosair explained. It’s also difficult to get people to work in child care facilities, he said, due to the industry’s low wages. An increase in wages helps with retaining good workers — but parents bear the cost. 
“For some it’s just unsustainable,” Dunn said. “It’s not possible to pay those rates.” 
That difficult choice between work and child care puts children in jeopardy, Dunn said. A lot of abuse cases happen when a working parent has to leave their child with a boyfriend or girlfriend, he said, and the child is then harmed. 
“There is a misconception out there that child abuse is perpetrated by random strangers that one has never met, and they just show up out of the blue in (an) ice cream truck or van going down the road and somebody steals the child,” he said. But “the majority of child abuse is perpetrated by someone who knows the child. It’s family, it’s a friend. It’s someone that you thought was safe, but it turns out they were not.” 
Meanwhile, more than 85% of the clinic’s patient population is enrolled in Medicaid, a program currently under federal threat of deep cuts. 
Howard cannot bill parents — even if they are the perpetrators of child abuse — but she can bill Medicaid and said providers like her need an intact Medicaid reimbursement.
Fentanyl and guns

In Howard’s Lexington office, she keeps a clear plastic tub full of gun locks and gives them out for free to people who need them. Guns remain the leading cause of death for children and teens in the United States. 
“We do, unfortunately, see a lot of pediatric firearm injuries as well unintentional ones. And so if we can prevent that, then that would be the best course,” Howard said. “Storing bullets separate from the gun, for example, always treating a gun like it’s loaded, are definitely tips to have when you have young children in the home.” 
Kentucky’s 2024 Child Fatality and Near Fatality External Review Panel report, released in February, showed the extent of this neglect. It found that most fatalities were “potentially preventable.” 
In one case, a 1-year-old ingested fentanyl and died. In another, a 7-year-old fatally shot his 4-year-old brother while playing with a shotgun, which was loaded and kept beside the refrigerator.

“As a child abuse pediatrician: we don’t want to see abuse. We want to prevent as much as we can,” Howard said. “Unfortunately, we’re just not able to prevent it.”  
Still, she tries to educate guardians and parents about safe storage of guns and medicine, both culprits in hurting and killing Kentucky’s children. In a state with extremely high rates of opioid use disorder (OUD) and addiction, children are too often exposed to medications that can kill them. 
“We’re huge advocates for parents to get medically assisted therapy, but having that in the home still is dangerous, so we do recommend safe medication storage on those,” Howard said. “We’ve provided medication lock boxes and bags and recommend that for any caregiver that has something like that in the home.” 
All medications should be stored safely out of reach of children, she said; “even medicines like Tylenol can be dangerous to a child.” 
UK also offers a variety of classes, including ones for new dads, Howard said. At this “daddy boot camp,” new fathers are paired with established fathers and learn important parenting skills. 
This is another way of going far upstream to prevent neglect and abuse. 
“Families …. (have) a lower risk of child maltreatment if the father is involved and supportive,” Howard said. 
Darcy, the golden therapist 
  Research shows the value of therapy dogs such as Darcy. “There is clear evidence that they are beneficial. There’s kids that won’t talk to anybody, but will tell a dog something, says Dr. Christina Howard. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes)
At the Kosair clinic, most patients are 4 and younger. In many cases, they don’t understand what is going on and can’t — or don’t want to — talk to an adult. Sometimes the trauma is too great for words. 
Enter Darcy, a golden retriever raised to be a therapist. 
“We actually first had the idea of a therapy dog when we had a child that unfortunately did not survive injuries; it was a homicide,” Howard said. She went to evaluate the child’s siblings, who were in the emergency room. 
“You walk in the room and you could feel the burden of it in there; they knew their sibling had passed away,” she recalled. “None of the kids would make eye contact. It was just complete silence.” 
A hospital volunteer brought her therapy dog into the ER, who then immediately transformed the mood. 
“As soon as that dog walked in the room, one of the older girls was like, ‘a dog!’ And then she just completely started talking to us about school, what she does at school,” Howard recalled. “It just made her more comfortable already, just that automatic thing.”  
Howard knew she had to research the benefits of therapy dogs, especially in the child abuse field. She found plenty. 
Purdue University researchers say therapy dogs help survivors of violence by providing comfort during their treatment process. The American College of Qualitative Research found that therapy dogs helped decrease anxiety in school shooting survivors. 
“There is clear evidence that they are beneficial,” Howard realized after her research. “There’s kids that won’t talk to anybody, but will tell a dog something.” 
Using grant money from Children’s Miracle Network, Howard applied for a therapy dog, who came from Ultimate Canine in Indianapolis. 
Darcy came to Howard in January 2024 at 10 months old, having passed her therapy dog training and ready to work at the Kosair clinic.

Her days vary widely depending on the patient. If the patient is an infant, Darcy may focus her energy on the parents while she will climb in bed and cuddle with an older child. 
There are a few times Darcy can’t be in the room — when a patient is allergic or during rape kit evidence collection. Sometimes her help is quite practical — a reserved child can “teach” Darcy how to step on a scale and get weighed or may take her for short walks. 
“You always hear they’re man’s best friend, and I think it’s because they’re … not judgmental. They’re just there for you,” Howard said. 
In her spare time, Darcy loves to collect socks and bring them to Howard, who is one of her handlers. But she loves her job at the clinic, and starts a happy purr when Howard pulls into the parking lot in the mornings. 
Each day she works, Darcy is helping kids with their anxiety and coaxing them into sharing terrible things that they’ve been through so they can receive proper care. 
“We had a child that was just up in the pediatric ICU because she had a pretty significant injury, and she wouldn’t talk to anybody,” Howard recalled. “She’d be like, ‘No, leave me alone.’ So we’re like, ‘Well, we’ll try Darcy.’ And we did. She was one that was like, ‘a dog!’ (Darcy) got up on the bed with her, and the girl snuggled her. By the end of it, she was like, ‘I love you, Darcy.’”

Is it abuse and neglect or is it poverty? 
In 2024, about 16% of Kentuckians lived in poverty, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Nearly 17% of Kentuckians are food insecure, meaning they don’t have enough to eat and may not know where their next meal will come from. 
Poverty like that can blur the legal line between true neglect and a family who lacks the resources to meet middle class ideals. 
For Dunn, the president and CEO of Kosair for Kids it’s important to not punish people who lack resources and said the dividing line is what parents do about their lack of resources. Those who are trying to get help for their children, he said, need more support. 
To protect children, Dunn said, Kentucky needs to take a serious look at environmental factors in neglect and abuse — food insecurity, child care, housing. He also wants to make sure Kentucky has enough social workers who can properly investigate every report of mistreatment. 
“As much as I want to see (child abuse) end overnight, I think we are on a march toward the day where we can get those rates down to a point where it really is only the cruel, irredeemable folks who are committing child abuse, not the people who are just poor or have financial stresses,” Dunn said. “But it’s going to take a while. It won’t be overnight, unfortunately.”

These students—both athletes and non-athletes, from families of all income levels— use their college years to gain life-changing knowledge, skills, and experiences. They graduate ready to be valuable members of their communities and the workforce. For many learners, however, the cost of college presents a daunting obstacle.
Although some Division I athletes receive scholarships that cover tuition and expenses while they are in college, they represent only a fraction of the students we have known. Most struggle to pay their bills and to balance work and study; many approach the beginning of each academic year wondering whether they will have the resources to stay in school.

Rona Free
Students and their families need to save and plan for college, but for most of them, financial aid will be essential. Connecticut colleges and universities provide millions of dollars of aid to their students each year in the form of scholarships, thanks in large part to the generosity of alumni, friends, and philanthropists.
As donors ourselves, we understand the importance of supporting learners who demonstrate both financial need and academic promise. Students also get help from the federal government in the form of grants and loans.
But to continue to attract outstanding students to its colleges and universities, both private and public, and increase the chance that after graduation they will help fill jobs in Connecticut and build their lives here, the state needs to provide adequate funding for the Roberta B. Willis Scholarship Program (RWSP).

Jim Calhoun
Grants from the RWSP are awarded only to Connecticut residents with demonstrated need who attend college in the state. These grants can make the difference between a student staying in Connecticut or going out of state for school. They open the possibility for a student to attend the college that is the best match for their abilities and career plans, whether that is an institution like the University of Connecticut  that has a campus that is as big as many towns, or one like the University of Saint Joseph, small enough where everyone knows your name.
Each year, more than 10,000 students attend Connecticut colleges and universities with the help of the RWSP. Nearly 15,000 additional students are eligible to receive the grant, but inadequate funding leaves them without state scholarship support.
Students and their families are doing their part, Connecticut higher education institutions are doing our part, alumni and friends are helping with their financial gifts—we ask that the state do its part by providing needed funding for the Roberta B. Willis Scholarship program.

House Bill 5002, which passed 84-67, is an expansive bill tackling issues including zoning, transit-oriented development, parking, homelessness and fair rent commissions. It combines Democratic priorities from across a few legislative committees and aims to address the impact of the severe lack of housing, particularly affordable housing, in Connecticut.
“You can’t solve this crisis one step at a time,” said Housing Committee co-chair Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport. “We need a big move that makes progress, and I think this bill does that.”
Housing costs have been rising for the past few years, and more people have felt the impact of those increases. Homelessness has increased. Studies say Connecticut lacks tens of thousands of units of housing that are affordable to its lowest-income residents, and that the state has the most constrained housing market in the country.
Democrats said they’d bring the bill to the floor late last week, but delayed the vote under threats of a filibuster. Over the weekend, leadership met and made what House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said were clarifications and compromises to get the bill through.
“I think the marketplace is going to determine whether a big apartment building gets built or not,” Rojas said. “So a lot of it [the opposition], I think, is just fear of this unknown, or fear or concerns about change.”

Rojas said he thinks the sections on parking and those that encourage more middle housing, or housing such as duplexes, triplexes and townhomes, will help the state’s economy.
The clarifications made over the weekend were largely centered around a zoning policy that requires towns to plan and zone for a set number of units of housing. These included making sure it was clear that litigation couldn’t be used as an enforcement tool and adding in a process for towns to contest their assigned numbers.
Lawmakers also removed commercial properties from the reforms to parking policy. And they set a new, lower population limit for towns required to establish fair rent commissions — thereby expanding the number required to have one — rather than mandating that all towns create commissions.
Still, the bill drew ire Tuesday.
Republicans took particular issue with the policies around zoning and parking. Debate stretched across nearly 12 hours, and centered largely on local control, what members called one-size-fits all solutions and concerns that towns don’t have the infrastructure to support more housing.
During this portion of the legislative session, the minority party’s power increases because the session ends next week. Republicans can talk for longer, spend more time on bills and limit Democrats’ ability to pass legislation.
“It will change your district. It will change your municipality. It will change your town or city,” said Housing Committee ranking member Rep. Tony Scott, R-Monroe, of the bill, who spoke for about four hours. 
Much of the discussion Tuesday centered around a policy known this session as “Towns Take the Lead.” The proposal analyzes the regional housing need, then divides that need up among towns and assigns each a set number of units. Towns would have to include how they’d plan and zone for those units in their 8-30j plans, which are due every five years.
It’s similar to fair share policies proposed in past sessions, and uses the methodology from a fair share policy to determine how many units of affordable housing towns would need to plan and zone for, with a general goal to increase housing stock and cut down on segregation. The bill contains some other specifications for the housing, including requirements to build units for families and for certain income levels.
Under the bill language, towns would be able to contest their assigned numbers and tell the legislature how many units they think they can accommodate, and lawmakers will approve or deny the towns’ proposals.
Opponents have said the proposal dilutes local control and imposes cookie-cutter solutions on towns. Scott, whose hometown of Monroe would have to plan for 326 units, called the numbers “astronomical,” “unrealistic,” and “comical.”
Political strategy
Republicans charted a peculiar political course Tuesday by introducing an amendment that bill proponent Rep. Joe Zullo, R-East Haven, asked his GOP colleagues to vote against. Zullo, the Planning and Development Committee ranking member, said those in favor of the legislation should support his amendment because it added a list explicitly stating the number of units that towns should plan and zone for, rather than the formulas and references to studies in the bill.
“This is a really odd position to be in today because what I’m actually saying to my colleagues on this side of the aisle,” Zullo said, gesturing to his Republican colleagues, “is ‘if you’re like me and you don’t believe that your town should have to build this share of housing, you should vote no.’ I’m proposing an amendment where you should stand up and say ‘I don’t want this number.’”

Then, Zullo directed his attention to Democrats, saying they should “unabashedly,” support the numbers.  
“On the other side of the aisle, it’s interesting. If you’re going to vote yes for this bill, well then you should be voting yes for this amendment.”
Part of the confusion stemmed from the numbers themselves, which weren’t true to the bill language. The housing allocations in Zullo’s amendment were quadruple what the bill proposes. For his town of East Haven, the bill says they would need to zone for 251. Zullo’s amendment said it would need 1,005. 
The housing bill language says towns would only have to build a quarter of the number of units assigned for each town in a recent state commissioned study about the housing need. But Zullo put 100% of the numbers listed in the study, saying that because the language calls for affordable housing, towns would need to add more market-rate units as well.
“I think it needs to be made abundantly clear that in the bill, we’re asking for 25% of that number,” in Zullo’s amendment, said Planning and Development Committee co-chair Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, D-Avon. “There is absolutely no enforcement if you are unable to build those and what you would say is, you would come back with reasons why you weren’t able to build that 25%.”
The measure was unanimously voted down, an unheard of event in recent memory at the House of Representatives.
“We are all on the RMS Titanic, and I am standing here shouting to you all ‘Iceberg right ahead,’ and a lot of you are going to ignore me and this ship is going to sink just like that ship sank because these proposals are dangerous,” Zullo said as he concluded his remarks on the bill.

Some moderate Democrats voted against the bill. Rep. Minnie Gonzalez, D-Hartford, called it a “monstrosity,” and urged her fellow urban lawmakers to vote against the measure. She said it would result in a loss of local control.
Rep. Geoff Luxenberg, D-Manchester, gave an impassioned speech Tuesday night, pointing to the circumstances under which the federal Fair Housing Act was passed in the wake of Martin Luther King, Jr.’s assassination. That bill had bipartisan support, he said. Luxenberg questioned why loss of local control and cost to towns was the center of the conversation.
“The cost of inaction, the cost of stagnation, the cost of looking the victims of this housing crisis in the eye and saying, ‘Sorry, we’re not going to build one more house. Sorry, you can’t get into that high opportunity neighborhood. There’s a wall that keeps you out,'” Luxenberg said, “Mr. Speaker, that cost is far too high.”
Zoning, parking
The legislation also includes a proposal from Gov. Ned Lamont’s office that would offer towns easier pathways to moratoriums under 8-30g. The decades-old housing law offers developers court remedies if their affordable housing proposals are denied, unless it’s for a reason of health or safety.
Towns can get moratoriums under the law by showing they’re making progress toward increasing their percentage of designated affordable housing and are exempt from the law if at least 10% of their housing stock is designated affordable.
Lamont’s proposal would allow municipalities to establish a “priority housing development zone” that would set a minimum density of four units per acre for single-family housing, six for duplexes or townhouses and 10 for multi-family housing.
The zones would allow this type of development “as of right,” or without a special hearing before the local planning and zoning commission. Towns that adopt these zones would have easier pathways to moratoriums under 8-30g.
It’s a controversial proposal among housing advocates who object to changes to 8-30g and say too many adjustments could render the law ineffective.
The bill also aims to get towns to increase residential density near train and bus stations by prioritizing certain infrastructure funding for towns that establish “transit-oriented districts,” where certain development is allowed without special hearings before the planning and zoning commission.
The bill, known as Work, Live, Ride, aims to increase the housing stock and encourage people to use public transportation, which advocates say would be a boon to the environment.
Opponents say the prioritization of funding effectively means that towns that don’t participate in the program would be deprioritized and could risk losing funding.
It also includes a measure that would ban minimum off-street parking requirements for residential developments. This would mean developers can cut down on costs of building housing by not adding as many parking spaces. The legislation had originally included a ban for commercial properties as well, but that was removed as part of the compromise over the weekend.
Rojas in particular has advocated for this measure, saying it would increase housing and allow more development in areas that may already have sufficient street parking or are close to public transportation.
Meanwhile, opponents say it would weaken local control and run the risk that developers would ignore parking needs.
The bill would require towns to allow developers to convert commercial buildings to residential with nine or fewer units without a special hearing before the planning and zoning committee.

The proposal is a favorite of Planning and Development Committee co-chair Sen. MD Rahman, D-Manchester. He’s said it would utilize office space and other commercial areas that have been vacant since the COVID-19 pandemic. Opponents say it would usurp local control.
Homelessness, fair rent
H.B. 5002 also includes a couple of measures to help the unhoused population. It would ban towns from using so-called “hostile architecture” on public property. Hostile architecture is an urban design architecture in which certain public structures are designed to discourage behaviors such as sleeping or lying down in public. It often comes in the form of spiked surfaces under bridges, narrow benches or rocks strewn across grassy areas.
Under the bill, the state Department of Social Services would also be asked to create a program to offer portable showers and laundry services to people experiencing homelessness, as funds allow. The Office of Fiscal Analysis estimated it would cost between $200,000 and $300,000 annually. 
The bill would also expand the number of fair rent commissions in Connecticut, mandating that any town with a population of 15,000 or more establish a commission, which are local bodies empowered to hear and make legally binding rulings on landlord-tenant issues such as complaints about unfair rent increases.

Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw speaks during a debate on a housing bill on May 27, 2025. Credit: Shahrzad Rasekh / CT Mirror
This year’s bill would require an additional 32 towns to have fair rent commissions and allow towns to establish regionalized commissions through their local councils of government, according to 2023 population estimates.
In 2022, the state legislature passed a law that required municipalities with populations of 25,000 or more to have such commissions. The 2022 law required 27 additional towns to create these boards. Before the law passed, 25 towns had commissions.
Supporters say the commissions help oversee rent increases and make sure they aren’t excessive as housing costs rise across the state. Opponents fear the measure interferes in local control and that small towns may struggle to find people to volunteer to be members of the commissions.
Rojas closed debate late Tuesday night with a statement about the importance of passing housing policy in Connecticut.
“There is a lot that we can’t control when it comes to housing,” Rojas said. “We can’t produce more land. We can’t control the cost of lumber. We don’t control interest rates. But there are many things we can do if we have the political will to act. This bill is but a step in the direction that is needed to adequately address what has long been a running crisis. 
“As I have feared for some time, if we continue to do nothing today, 10 years from now, our communities and the people we represent will be in a far more precarious position if we do nothing.”

This story was originally reported by Jessica Kutz of The 19th.  Meet Jessica and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
The Trump administration wants to eliminate the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a little-known piece of the social safety net that helps low-income people pay their utility bills.
Congress created the program in 1981, initially to help people pay for heating in the winter. The program — which has had broad bipartisan support — has increasingly been used to pay for cooling as summers grow hotter and more dangerous to human health due to climate change.
At a recent budget hearing, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, called the program a “lifesaver” for residents in Alaska when questioning Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about its future.
Kennedy acknowledged the importance of the program but also said Trump’s proposal to eliminate the funding was based on the expectation of lower future energy prices. Yet according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, residential energy prices are expected to go up in much of the country at least through 2026.
Murkowski and lawmakers from across the aisle have been pressuring the administration to commit to funding the program, which provided $4.1 billion to states, territories and tribal nations in fiscal 2025. But the administration has not only called to defund the program in its entirety, but also has put the staff that administer the program at Health and Human Services (HHS) on leave.
Advocates say the end of the program could be disastrous for households who rely on other government benefits that are also under threat, like the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) and Medicaid, which are both facing deep cuts.
As the funding of LIHEAP continues to be debated on the national level, here’s an explanation of what the program does and who it helps:
What does the Low Income Housing Energy Assistance Program do?
LIHEAP helps about 6 million households pay their heating- and cooling-related utility bills annually and prevents disconnections through an emergency assistance fund. The payments typically go directly to the utility companies.
States tailor the program to best fit the needs of residents. For example, in places like Arizona, where extreme heat kills hundreds of people a year, a higher allocation of funding goes to cooling assistance. In some states, funds can be used to repair furnaces or air conditioning units.
States are required to account for both a household’s income and its energy burden, or the percentage of a family’s income that goes to pay utility bills, to target those most at risk for utility disconnections.
Low-income households typically have higher energy burdens, often due to homes with poor insulation or drafty windows and doors.
Who does it help? 
The LIHEAP program targets households with family members who are particularly vulnerable to extreme temperatures. In fiscal 2023, the program reached 2.1 million households where a resident had a disability; nearly 1 million households that had small children; and 2.4 million households that housed an elderly person.
Both children and the elderly are more sensitive to extreme temperatures because they are physiologically less able to regulate their body temperature. People with complex medical needs also shoulder higher energy costs, due to electricity-dependent medical equipment.
Single parents, who are disproportionately women, are more likely to be energy insecure, as are rural residents, Black, Indigenous and Latinx households.
And the people who utilize the program are usually on the brink of an emergency — either already disconnected from their utility or on the verge of it. “By the time they’re reaching out for help, it’s that their situation has escalated,” said Diana Hernandez, an associate professor and sociologist at Columbia University who studies energy insecurity.
Only about 17 percent of eligible households receive LIHEAP assistance, said Hernandez, who has been pushing to increase funding for the program.
“The money always runs out,” she said.
Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, an organization that works with state officials to implement LIHEAP, said electricity costs are going up at a higher rate than inflation and that rising temperatures are also leading to a greater need for cooling.
“In Southwestern states the length of the [heat waves are] getting longer,” Wolfe said. “The bills are going up, and a lot of housing is just poorly built …  so the costs are going up faster than expected,” he said.
Why is it important? 
LIHEAP has multiple benefits that all center on keeping people safe and healthy in their homes, advocates say.
While in many states residents have some protection from a utility disconnecting their electricity, without energy assistance programs like LIHEAP more households would likely keep their homes at dangerous temperatures to keep their bills down.
In a Census Household Pulse Survey from 2024, nearly 23 percent of households reported keeping their homes at unsafe temperatures over the previous 12 months due to rising energy costs.
But doing so is risky in places like Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located. While there is a moratorium on electricity shutoffs during the summer, in 2024, 138 people died indoors of a heat-related cause, with 18 percent of those deaths in a home where the AC was functioning but not turned on. Seventy percent did not have a working AC unit in a place where average summer temperatures are over 100 degrees.
These deaths occurred in a state where over 20,000 households received LIHEAP assistance in fiscal 2023, according to the National Energy Utility Affordability Coalition, which tracks state use of funds.
Without the program, “we’ll be having more and more of these unnecessary deaths,” Wolfe said.
Helping to pay energy bills has also been shown to help keep families more food secure. According to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 20 percent of U.S. households said they skipped meals and medicines to pay for electricity bills in 2020, a time when households were under additional stress due to the pandemic. And in a 2019 survey of LIHEAP recipients, 36 percent said that before they began to receive energy assistance, they went without food for at least a day to pay utility bills.
It’s called the “heat or eat” phenomenon.
“Just because the bill gets paid, people should not assume that that’s not at great cost,” said Olivia Wein, senior attorney with the National Consumer Law Center. But with multiple social welfare programs facing deep cuts, “it’s going to be harder and harder for people to do that, to juggle enough to get the bills paid on time,” she said.
Wein points out that people’s housing security could also be impacted. Maintaining a utility connection is a condition on many housing leases, and without LIHEAP, more people could face evictions, Wein fears.
She’s also worried children could be taken from their parents. “Not having heat in the winter could result in Child Protective Services getting involved because your home is not habitable,” she said. “So there are all of these ripple effects from unaffordable energy that we will unfortunately see on the grand scale without a strong LIHEAP program.”
Where does the program stand now? 
For fiscal 2025, all of the program’s funding has already been released, so residents won’t see an impact until fiscal 2026, which starts in September. But even if the program is funded, Wein says there will be issues with disbursement because of the federal layoffs.
While each state develops individual programs, they still have to run their plans by the federal agency every year to determine state allocations, Wein said. This plan is also accompanied by a complicated formula that happens each time funding is released. Right now only four people are managing the LIHEAP program on the federal level; after the entire office was laid off in April. Wein predicts this will delay funding being sent to the states.
HHS did not respond to a request for comment by press time.
Additionally, community action agencies, places around the country where people go to apply for benefits like LIHEAP, could be shut down, due to a separate move to defund the Community Services Block Grant. This would make it harder for residents to apply to the program. “We need that funding as part of our whole ecosystem,” Wein said.
Trump also sought to zero out LIHEAP funding in his first term, but Congress ultimately is in charge of approving a budget. But Wein said the precarity of the program feels different this time around. “Congress is really looking at cutting, cutting, cutting, cutting. … Things that you would never imagine being cut like entitlement programs are in live discussion right now. So that’s the unknown.”
Advocates say that there really isn’t any other comparable safety net for residents seeking energy assistance if LIHEAP ends up being cut. Though alternatives like charitable giving and religious organizations can help pay for energy costs, it doesn’t come close to meeting the needs of 6 million people who were previously reached by the program, Wein said.
“There is no easy fix and there is no comprehensive fix to losing LIHEAP,” she said. “Every state is going to be devastated with the loss of this funding.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DSC05679-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-27 22:02:34.213078

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A legislative proposal that would ban most consumable hemp and other THC products in Nebraska advanced Tuesday without amendments as opponents blocked changes.
Throughout a four-hour debate on Legislative Bill 316, from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area, only a handful of senators spoke. That’s because of pointed opposition from State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, who filed nearly 30 motions or amendments throughout the bill’s life, largely to push senators toward considering regulations instead of a ban. 
LB 316 advanced 32-15 with 32 of the 33 Republicans voting for it and all 15 Democrats voting against. The Legislature’s one nonpartisan progressive was not in attendance.
  State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha. July 21, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst, who was “present, not voting” on advancing the bill, said he did so to wait for possible future changes. He said he recently toured a consumable hemp shop in his district and has concerns about whether the bill could freeze those operations.
LB 316 would prohibit raw hemp above 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) of any concentration and for processed hemp the lesser of 0.3% THC on a total weight basis or 10 milligrams per package, effective Jan. 1. The mature stalks of Cannabis sativa and its fiber, oil, cake and any other naturally derived products would not be considered hemp, leaving a narrow legal path for some products such as fibers and textiles.
If the bill passed, it would include a “consumer safe harbor period” through the end of 2025 to give consumers time to discard any “illegal hemp” as newly defined under LB 316. Legal products would face an additional 10% wholesale tax at the time of purchase.
Regulations again rejected
Part of Cavanaugh’s tactics included a regulatory-focused amendment that he termed a “compromise.” It would have still banned “synthetic” cannabinoids of any THC concentration but protected “hemp-derived” cannabinoids, such as CBD lotions. 
  State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln at a listening session on property taxes in Lincoln. July 22, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The Cavanaugh amendment would have required ID checks before purchases, in-state testing, tamper-proof and child-resistant packaging and licensing similar to the Liquor Control Act.
Cavanaugh and State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln said most hemp-derived products require chemical processes, such as heat, to be manufactured. Cavanaugh said the “synthetic” marijuana that opponents detest as a “great evil,” including K-2 and spice, was already banned in Nebraska in 2011.
“This is a compromise that allows people, good actors, to continue to act and sell their product in the State of Nebraska, to collect taxes, collect revenue, create jobs, all of these sorts of things,” Cavanaugh said.
Cavanaugh’s regulatory amendment failed 16-27. State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney was the only eventual supporter of LB 316 who supported his proposal.
‘Russian roulette’
Around Cavanaugh, Kauth is seeking to amend LB 316 to explicitly state her bill would not conflict with voter-approved medical cannabis legalization and regulations in the state, a request of State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair.

The other major change would allow consumers to prove via an “affirmative defense” in court that they purchased what would become “illegal hemp” under LB 316 for personal use before September 2025, when the law would take effect. That’s a change made to appease State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth.
Brandt and Hansen, both Republicans, have so far supported LB 316 under the condition that it be amended in the future. Lawmakers have five legislative days left to do so and are set to adjourn by June 9.
Kauth disagrees that most products would be banned and envisions a three-step process for products under her bill:

Is the product cannabis?
Is it free of any synthetic or modified cannabis?
Does the product comply with THC limits of less than 0.3% any THC (the current law is 0.3% delta-9 THC)?

If so, Kauth said the products would remain legal. She said the role of government is to put up guardrails and that LB 316 is about “trying to keep our populace healthy.”
“We are essentially allowing consumers to play Russian roulette every time they go into a store and they can buy a product off the shelves,” Kauth said. “They’re assuming that it is legal. They’re assuming that we’ve already done our jobs.”
  State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth. July 25, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Kauth was the only supporter to speak in favor of the bill outside of an exchange with Hansen, during which he said promised changes would help protect medical cannabis access. Kauth and the Attorney General’s Office, which is pushing LB 316, have said that the measure was never intended to conflict with the medical cannabis laws but worked with Hansen anyway.
Hansen confirmed that if the amendment is not attached at the next stage of the debate, he won’t vote for the bill.
‘Scalpel’ vs. a ‘hammer’
Dungan said that instead of taking a “scalpel” to THC concerns, supporters approached with a “hammer.” 
Part of the reason there are concerns about “clean” products is the lack of regulations that Cavanaugh sought to add, Dungan said. He said some senators see the word “chemicals” and “get all freaked out and they think to themselves, ‘Oh my goodness, this is all scary stuff.’”
But Dungan said chemical reactions are normal, as simple as putting toast in the toaster.
  State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha. Jan. 15, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
“I know a lot of people in here have this perception of CBD or delta-8 or THC where it’s a classic sort of ‘Reefer Madness’ idea, that it’s a bunch of hippies sitting out on the hill smoking joints,” Dungan said. “But really, what we’re talking about are little old ladies putting cream on their joints.”
Fiscal concerns
Dungan, who sits on the Revenue Committee with Kauth, also raised concerns over the revenue loss from fewer sales if LB 316 passes. A fiscal estimate projects at least $2.9 million in lost revenue and about $530,000 in administrative costs over the next two fiscal years. Revenue losses would grow over time, with about $85,000 in annual administrative costs in the future. 
That’s more than the state currently has in its piggy bank after filling, for now, a major projected budget deficit. The state has about $2.6 million left to work with, about $1.5 million of which is expected to be used to raise judges’ salaries.
LB 316 would require another bill to pass and generate revenue or cut spending.
  State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, center. March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
The new excise tax revenue raised by the bill would be directed toward property tax relief.
State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, who selected LB 316 as his 2025 priority, has previously said “effective regulation of this industry is impossible” and that the products are “garbage” attached to a little bit of cannabidiol (CBD) to vape, smoke or eat.
Storm said during the first-round debate he would never jeopardize “the health or safety of our citizens of this state, especially children and young adults, for revenue.”
Possession felony charges
Other opponents said the bill would enrich a “felony factory” of the 2025 session, a phrase coined by State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha, vice chair of the Judiciary Committee.
DeBoer said more Nebraskans could be charged with a felony if they possess products under the existing limits of 0.3% delta-9 THC, because the bill would count the 0.3% based on any THC concentration, not just delta-9.
  State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln. April 11, 2023. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska News Service)
State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, a former prosecutor and chair of the Judiciary Committee, said defining hemp as “marijuana” under LB 316 is about a “clarification” and not new penalties. Instead, she said it would place hemp products above the legal THC limits on the same criminal scale as marijuana possession — an infraction for less than 1 ounce, a misdemeanor between 1 ounce and 1 pound and a felony for more than 1 pound.
Bosn previously said the penalties were a “clarification.” She had said trying to regulate the drugs was like “playing Whac-a-Mole.” 
DeBoer said the “affirmative defense” indicates that felony charges could be coming because the defense would need to be asserted in court. Cavanaugh said it’s not a “get out of jail free card,” such as in the case of a “little old lady” who didn’t save a receipt.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, as well as Cavanaugh and Dungan, said LB 316 would put Nebraskans out of business and that supporters of the measure weren’t listening to Nebraskans who have said they could be harmed, including small business owners and farmers.
“Nebraskans feel like they’re being gaslit by this Legislature, and that’s because they are,” Conrad said. “This is politics at its worst.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-28 01:03:32+00:00,CT Mirror,CT lawmakers pass expanded Trust Act,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/27/ct-expand-trust-act-immigration/,Bill allows individuals to sue over violations of the law and expands situations where officials can comply with ICE detainers.,"After a nearly four-hour debate, the Connecticut Senate approved on party lines a bill allowing individuals to sue towns and cities that cooperate with federal immigration authorities in a way that goes against state law. 
The bill modifies the Trust Act, Connecticut’s law outlining the circumstances under which local and state officials are allowed to work and communicate with the federal government’s efforts to detain unauthorized migrants. 
The current Trust Act, which was passed in 2019, generally prohibits Connecticut law enforcement from arresting someone solely on the basis of a detainer — a request from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement that police hold a person for up to 48 hours so federal agents can pick them up — with some exceptions.
Local law enforcement and corrections officials in Connecticut may only comply with a federal detainer request if ICE presents a judicial warrant, if the person is on a terrorist watch list or if the person in their custody has been convicted or pleaded guilty to a class A or B felony — crimes like murder, sexual assault, kidnapping, robbery and first-degree manslaughter.
While the bill passed Tuesday allows individuals to sue over alleged violations of the law, it also expands the situations in which officials can comply with federal immigration detainers — and not be subject to such litigation.
The bill adds 13 crimes — including sexual assault, injury or risk of injury to a child, strangulation, burglary with a firearm, possessing child sexual abuse material, enticing or sexually exploiting a minor and violating a protective order — for which state and local law enforcement can comply with a federal detainer request. The bill also expands the definition of law enforcement officials to include members of the Board of Pardons and Paroles, state’s attorneys and juvenile probation officers.
“ What we’re showing is that Connecticut is a moral example for what other states should be like,” Sen. Herron Gaston, D-Bridgeport, himself the son of an immigrant, said. “Connecticut has positioned itself as a leader in human rights and immigrant justice. Expanding the Trust Act shows that this state is willing to stand by its immigrant community and promote a compassionate, just legal framework — something that other states need to emulate,” he said.
During Tuesday’s debate in the senate, Sen. John Kissel, R-Enfield, noted that a public hearing on proposed changes to the Trust Act lasted approximately 12 hours, the longest hearing the legislature’s Judiciary Committee sat through this year.
Sen. Gary Winfield, D-New Haven, said people at the public hearing sought to add “teeth” to the current Trust Act, expressing concern that if someone violated the act, there was no way to hold them accountable. Winfield said he’d spoken with constituents who were so concerned that the modifications to the Trust Act would not pass that they had considered self-deporting. 
“I don’t have hard data — what I do have are the stories of the people who experience what it is to live with the Trust Act now, and some of them have experienced living without the Trust Act. And they suggest to me that on the whole, the Trust Act is good for them,” Winfield said. 
Kissel said he was sympathetic to undocumented immigrants, but he questioned the advantage of the state forbidding compliance with the federal government. “ I find it very hard to believe that if the department of environmental protection of the federal government issued some kind of civil request of our state that we would tell [Department of Energy and Environmental Protection] Commissioner Katie Dykes, ‘Don’t comply with that,’” Kissel said. 
Kissel proposed an amendment eliminating the provision allowing someone who is detained by federal immigration authorities because of a violation of the Trust Act to sue the town or city whose police officer or other agent complied with the federal request. The bill also provides for that person to be able to recoup legal fees. 
“I find this to be an unnecessary exposure of liability for the municipalities,” Kissel said. He said that since most lawsuits are settled out of court rather than going to trial this would be costly for towns, and that town insurers would not cover these settlements. He also suggested that towns might discourage police from cooperating with federal immigration authorities if there were a chance the town could be sued.
Winfield disagreed, saying the legal recourse was what gave the law teeth.
Sen. Rob Sampson, R-Wolcott, called the Trust Act a bad policy, saying immigration is the responsibility of the federal government, and that there were legal pathways immigrants could pursue.
“We are, by policies like the Trust Act, trying to encourage people to break our legal immigration policies, and to come to this country not through the legal process,” Sampson said. “It is no favor to help someone get into this country or to stay here unlawfully. It’s not.”

Sampson said he agreed that additional crimes should be exempt from the Trust Act, but he questioned why only certain ones were included in the bill. Sampson and Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, proposed amendments adding more crimes to the list of exemptions. They all failed.
Winfield said individuals who commit crimes have to face the criminal justice system and incarceration. “There’s a prison for people who have committed crimes. Immigration policy is a different thing,” he said.  
The Trust Act changes were just one part of a larger bill with several provisions regarding law enforcement, all of which passed the Senate Tuesday evening. The House of Representatives passed the bill last week 96-51 on a largely party-line vote. 
The bill also requires the Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection to provide the state’s attorney with any DNA evidence that could potentially exonerate someone alleged to have committed a crime. Kissel referred to the provision as “a long time coming,” noting that taxpayers have in the past had to pay millions in damages to people who have been wrongfully incarcerated. 
The bill also creates a process for labeling sexual assault evidence kits, allows people who have served prison time in other states to have that time deducted from their sentence once they arrive in Connecticut, removes tasers or stun guns from being considered “deadly weapons,” and allows police officers to use chokeholds when a third person is in danger.
The bill passed the senate 25-11, and will now go to Governor Ned Lamont’s desk. 
Members of the Trust Act, Now Coalition, an advocacy group representing students, religious congregations, immigrants, unionized workers and others, said they saw the legislation as a “meaningful and hard-won step forward.” But they said they were discouraged by the exemption of certain felonies from the Trust Act and the elimination of a section of the bill that would have prohibited federal immigration authorities from detaining migrants at courthouses.
“Advocates say that more action is needed to prevent our state and local resources from being commandeered to advance the federal government’s cruel mass deportation agenda,” they wrote in a press release.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TRUSTACT-SENATE-0527-SR-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-27 22:02:34.213078

On Tuesday, the Nebraska Legislature voted 37-0 to advance an amended Legislative Bill 707, intended to update, clarify and add guardrails to a pair of previously adopted laws: the Good Life Transformational Projects Act of 2023 and the related cleanup bill enacted the following year.

State Sen. Brad von Gillern, chair of the Legislature’s Revenue Committee, said the latest attempt to fix “cracks” in the laws governing up to five statewide good life districts was complicated and time-consuming but now projects a $3.6 million savings for the state over the next two years at a time when lawmakers grapple with a budget shortfall.
 ‘Blank check’ 

Lawmakers have heard concerns about potential changes to the laws from developers of approved good life districts. But more recent objections came, they said Tuesday, from west Omaha’s Avenue One district. Developer Curt Hofer, who is leading that estimated $1.4 billion project site, did not return a reporter’s phone call Tuesday.
Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers signed off on proposed changes, von Gillern told colleagues who pressed him about legal ramifications to clarifications made after agreements were approved. Von Gillern said that if developers had problems with changes, they’d have to take those matters up with the attorney general or the Nebraska Department of Revenue.
“I think we came up with a good landing point,” von Gillern told the Nebraska Examiner. “Most parties were satisfied with the outcome today.”
He said the intent was to ensure that the districts achieve their intended purpose: to foster transformational economic developments that in the long run will be a boon to the state in the form of increased sales tax revenue.
“There were serious concerns from multiple parties that the good life district program was simply handing a blank check to development groups with little to no assurance that the state would reap a fair return on its investment,” von Gillern said. 
He said LB 707 would steer the state away from “possibly devastating” financial impact.
 Gretna spotlighted flaws

LB 707 now moves forward to a third and final reading, with several amendments approved Tuesday. Among those were changes submitted on behalf of the Cities of Grand Island and Bellevue, which represent two of the four good life districts approved so far by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development.

Bellevue, for example, objected to language that would require it to go back and hold a special election. State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue said the district is underway, and that would introduce “unnecessary costs, uncertainty and risk” of delay or cancellation.
In addition to Omaha’s Avenue One, the other approved district includes and surrounds Gretna’s Nebraska Crossing shopping center. Kearney and Papillion are vying to be designated as the final of five districts allowed under the law.
Problems with the current good life legislation were spotlighted in, but not limited to, the Gretna area district, which is the largest and most high-profile of the four approved. 
Among the controversy was how more than $2.2 million in state sales tax revenue was lost as progress on the Gretna district was stymied. 
The host city and Nebraska Crossing owner Rod Yates, whose application established that district’s boundaries, deadlocked over terms for his multibillion dollar mega sports-themed vision. Yates demanded concessions that Gretna officials said put taxpayers at financial risk.

As designed, the good life law created a major incentive: State sales taxes imposed within good life districts were to be cut in half, from 5.5% to 2.75%. The idea was to recapture the difference to help finance unique entertainment and shopping districts that over time would draw more tourism for the state.
Gov. Jim Pillen earlier this year proposed clawing back an annual $5 million in state incentives budgeted to help development in good life districts. Even the law’s primary champion and architect, former State Sen. Lou Ann Linehan of the Elkhorn area, criticized how the legislation was being carried out.
Von Gillern said the amended LB 707 proposes a dozen key fixes to address what had been identified as flaws.
He said, for example, his team caught on to a “scheme” that would have allowed sales tax revenue from retailers nearly a mile away from the current Omaha good life district boundaries to go to a developer. “It’s not right …we fixed that,” von Gillern said.
“It’s not right that a developer could have relocated a substantial ongoing business to their new development and then capture half of the sales tax revenue,” von Gillern said. “We fixed that.”
Changes include: 

Prohibited use of eminent domain. That became a conflict in Gretna, when Yates suggested that the city force acquisition of other property so that he could control the entire district.
Language allowing multiple developers, essentially sub-good life districts or project areas, within a district.
A $5 million cap on annual sales tax income that a developer can capture from retailers already in a good life district. That applies to Grand Island and Gretna, von Gillern said, which have pre-existing stores within approved boundaries.
Defining a “new to market” retailer as one not existing within 40 miles of the district. (New business and tourism is required to qualify for the tax incentive.)
Requiring that tax-exempt owners within a district still pay sales tax on construction materials.

Von Gillern denied what he said were accusations that the effort seemed aimed to kill an existing or future project.
He said he has spent a career in real estate development and that the Legislature’s recommended changes represent an attempt to “check aspects of projects that threaten to take advantage of Nebraska taxpayers for no other purpose than to satisfy private interests.”

Mike Dunleavy’s desk.
According to legislative records, the state’s operating, capital and mental health budgets were transmitted to the governor on Tuesday, giving the governor until June 19 to veto the bills or sign them into law.
The governor has the ability to use a line item veto to reduce or eliminate specific items within the budget, and Dunleavy has previously indicated that he may reduce funding for public schools below the amount prescribed by a formula in state law.
State legislators voted to raise that formula in the session’s last days, overriding Dunleavy’s decision to veto the bill containing a $700 increase to the base student allocation, the core of the state’s school funding formula.
If Dunleavy reduces education funding below what’s called for by the formula, it would be unprecedented and akin to former Gov. Bill Walker’s decision in 2016 to veto part of the Permanent Fund dividend: Since the education funding formula was created, every governor has followed the law.
Two policy bills also were transmitted to the governor on Tuesday. 
The first, House Bill 75, cleans up some state laws pertaining to the Permanent Fund dividend and was uncontroversial in the House and Senate. The second, Senate Bill 183, would require the executive branch to deliver reports in the form requested by the Alaska Legislature’s auditor.
Under the Alaska Constitution, the Alaska Legislature has audit authority over the executive branch, but since 2019, lawmakers have been unable to analyze the performance of the section of the Alaska Department of Revenue that audits tax settlements with large oil companies.
Lawmakers say the Department of Revenue has switched policies and no longer provides a report that once allowed them to examine the section’s work. 
Members of the department testified that they have turned over raw data, but the legislative auditor testified that her department lacks the information and capability to turn that data into actionable information on the state’s oil revenue. 
The bill was transmitted to the governor’s office with a letter from the Speaker of the House Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham and Senate President Gary Stevens, R-Kodiak, asking Dunleavy not to veto it. “This letter accompanies the bill not as a routine legislative communication, but as a reflection of the extraordinary nature of the circumstances we face,” it read. “The ongoing obstructions by the DOR must not be allowed to become a precedent for future administrations. We must reinforce, not erode, the norms of oversight and accountability that are vital to Alaska’s republican form of government.”

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)State officials experienced first-hand the perils of distracted driving, before a state law banning the use of handheld cell phones and other electronic devices takes effect next week. PennDOT hosted a distracted driving simulation Tuesday in the State Capitol in Harrisburg to raise awareness about the dangers it can pose to motorists. 
The legislation takes effect on June 5. Gov. Shapiro signed it into law last year. Named after 21-year-old Paul Miller Jr., a college senior who was killed by a distracted driver in 2010, the law bans any use of a handheld cell phone, tablet or other electronic device while driving, including while stopped at a red light.
Miller’s parents Eileen and Paul Miller, representatives from PennDOT, the Pennsylvania State Police, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, the state Insurance Department, and the law’s prime sponsor, state Sen. Rosemary Brown (R-Monroe), watched as Insurance Commissioner Michael Humphreys attempted to drive in a simulator while typing a text message. It ended with a crash and simulated court date.
PennDOT uses the simulator at events across the state to highlight the dangers of distracted and impaired driving. 
“At almost every school we go to, we have young people stand up from this and go, ‘I am never going to drive distracted, because I see now just how quickly things can go wrong,’” PennDOT spokesperson Steve Harmick said. “So our hope is, in the future, we’ll see things like distracted driving incidents go down.”
PennDOT Secretary Mike Carroll emphasized the law will “save lives across our Commonwealth,” adding, “It’s time for drivers to put the phone down and focus on driving and text while they are not driving.”
The enactment of Paul Miller’s law is the culmination of over a decade of advocacy by Eileen and Paul Miller. Brown first introduced a bill on distracted driving over 12 years ago after Eileen, a constituent, contacted her to request help advocating for distracted driving legislation.
“Pennsylvania has a very serious problem with distracted driving, particularly drivers using cell phones and electronic devices behind the wheel,” Brown said. “These distractions aren’t occasional or brief. They’re consistent. They’re repetitive and they’re dangerously long lasting, which makes them the highest focus.” 
PennDOT reported 9,950 crashes caused by distracted driving last year, which resulted in more than 6,000 injuries and 49 deaths. 
“Every day, our troopers respond to crashes that could have been prevented. Crashes that happened simply because someone wasn’t paying attention to the road,” state police Maj. Robert Krol, director of the Bureau of Patrols, said. He emphasized troopers will be enforcing the law.
“Police will be actively looking for this behavior and can stop a driver solely for this violation alone,” he said. “No other reason is needed.”
For the first year, police will only issue warnings to drivers caught violating the law. Starting in June 2026, violators will be hit with a $50 fine. Motorists will still be permitted to contact emergency services while driving and continue to use hands-free technology to make calls and send texts.
Critics of the legislation, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, have argued the law will “expand police power to engage in pretextual traffic stops for a crime that will be difficult to prove.”
The Black Legislative Caucus, as well as Shapiro, have argued that collecting this data will increase transparency and prevent racial bias in the enforcement of traffic laws.
The collected data will not be publicly available. The law specifically states the data will be exempt from access through Pennsylvania’s Right-to-Know law. Instead, the state police or a designated third-party will compile and annually release a report based on the data. 
State police have previously released similar third-party reports on their traffic stops in the past.
“As one of the first police agencies to voluntarily collect traffic-stop information, [Pennsylvania State Police] has one of the most comprehensive and high-quality data collection efforts on traffic stops in the country,” according to Myles Snyder, state police communications director. “Our Contact Data Reporting program is designed to analyze demographic and other information from traffic stops to examine whether any racial or ethnic disparities exist, build trust with the public and identify opportunities for improvement in policy and training.”

Doug Burgum, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for Interior Department secretary, waits for the beginning of a confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee at Dirksen Senate Office Building on Jan. 16, 2025, on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)A uranium mine in southern Utah is the first project to be approved under President Donald Trump’s emergency declaration streamlining the development of energy infrastructure.
Owned and operated by the Canadian company Anfield Energy, the Velvet-Wood uranium project received a green light on Friday under the federal government’s new, 14-day environmental review process for energy projects.
The permitting process for similar projects has taken years in the past — but in January, Trump declared a national energy emergency, slashing the environmental review process for a number of energy projects like uranium, crude oil, natural gas, coal, biofuels, geothermal and critical minerals.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced the mining project in Utah would be the first to be reviewed. And on Friday, Anfield received approval from the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM.
“This approval marks a turning point in how we secure America’s mineral future,” said Doug Burgum, Department of the Interior secretary, in a statement. “By streamlining the review process for critical mineral projects like Velvet-Wood, we’re reducing dependence on foreign adversaries and ensuring our military, medical and energy sectors have the resources they need to thrive. This is mineral security in action.”
Sitting near the Utah-Colorado border in San Juan County about 40 miles east of Canyonlands National Park, the Velvet-Wood project is the combination of two mines — the existing Velvet Mine, which produced nearly 400,000 tons of ore between 1979 and 1984, and the nearby Wood area, which hasn’t yet been mined according to an economic assessment from Anfield.
“We are very pleased that the Department of the Interior has greenlit our Velvet-Wood project in an expedited manner,” said Anfield CEO Corey Dias in a statement. “This confirms our view that Velvet-Wood was well-suited for an accelerated review, given that it is a past-producing uranium and vanadium mine with a small environmental footprint. The Company will now pivot to advancing the project through construction and, ultimately, to production.”
Anfield has been eyeing this site for years, purchasing it in 2015 and submitting a plan of operation to the state of Utah and BLM in 2024. According to the Department of the Interior, the operation will disturb about three acres, and much of the mining will take place underground.
The normal environmental review process usually takes local input into consideration, weighing environmental and cultural concerns against the project’s goals. That includes a public comment period that, depending on the project, can result in thousands of comments.
According to BLM documents, public input was not required because of the president’s emergency order. Still, the region’s tribal governments have concerns, as noted in BLM’s environmental assessment.
The agency met with representatives from the Hopi, Pueblo of Zuni, Navajo, Pueblo of San Felipe and Ute Mountain Ute tribes, all of whom were critical of the operation and the federal government’s expedited review.
“The Tribal Nations expressed similar concerns with the emergency procedures, water impacts, transportation, and uranium contamination,” the BLM documents read, including worries that the mining and transportation of uranium ore, which would take place near Bears Ears National Monument, could impact cultural sites.
Anfield also owns Shootaring Canyon uranium mill, located in Garfield County between Hanksville and Lake Powell. Just one of three licensed and completed uranium mills in the country, it hasn’t been operational in years — Anfield says it plans to reopen the mill, although that will require additional licensing and infrastructure improvements. If it becomes operational, the mill will be used to convert uranium ore into concentrate to be used in nuclear reactors.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The Columbia City Council again deferred a vote to repeal an ordinance banning so-called conversion therapy Tuesday despite the looming threat of losing millions in state dollars.
The 2021 ordinance, which threatens a $500 fine for licensed therapists who attempt to change the sexual orientation or gender identity of an LGBTQ+ minor, has never been used, according to the mayor’s office. At stake for not repealing it is an estimated $3.7 million the city would otherwise receive in state funds.
A clause included in the state budget plan advanced last week would revoke state funding for any local government that prohibits so-called conversion therapy. Columbia is the only city in the state with such a rule on the books.
The city will move forward with its budgeting process under the assumption that the ordinance won’t be repealed before council members must pass a budget, City Manager Teresa Wilson said. When or whether the ordinance might come up for discussion again is unclear.
In every case reported to the city as potentially violating the ordinance, the so-called conversion therapy was being performed by a private religious group, to which the ban does not apply, Columbia Mayor Daniel Rickenmann said.
“There’s no teeth in the ordinance,” Rickenmann said. “It didn’t really do anything to protect.”
Even if the ordinance hasn’t been used, it’s an important show of support for the LGBTQ+ community, said Matthew Butler, LGBTQ advocacy strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina. It shows businesses, counselors and LGBTQ+ people that Columbia won’t stand for harmful practices, he said.
“The city did what the city could do under current law in this state,” Butler said. “It’s still worth having on the books.”
Some of the 20 advocates who spoke to the council for over an hour questioned whether there were zero reports because people weren’t able or comfortable coming forward to report abuse, or because the ordinance did what it was supposed to do and prevented therapists from the practice in the first place.
For Rickenmann, the question was not about the contents of the ordinance itself but about what the city stood to lose by keeping it in effect, he said.
With a general fund about 3% lower than last year’s, losing the money would leave a “gaping hole,” Wilson said. The money seems comparatively small in comparison with the approximately $444 million the city spent last year, but after some federal funds have run out, there’s no “wiggle room” to spare, she said.
“There’s no room in the general fund to replace $3.7 million, and I say that with all sincerity,” Wilson said.
Facing a deadline to pass a final budget July 1, the city will move forward with its backup plan to fill in the gaps using revenue from its tax on food and beverages, known as hospitality tax. Much of that $15 million has already been set aside for long-term projects, so the first cuts will likely come from the festivals and cultural institutions the money funds, Wilson said.
Any alternative would mean cutting services, such as park operations, public safety or road repairs, Rickenmann said.
“We want to make sure we protect the community,” Rickenmann said. “At the same time, we want to protect the whole community. So, that leaves us in a quandary for where we go, what we do and how we handle it.”
The issue came to the forefront for the city after Attorney General Alan Wilson sent a letter to the city last month threatening to take legal action unless the city repealed the ordinance. The rule likely violated a 2022 state law allowing only the state to regulate medical fields, as well as the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment right to free speech, Wilson wrote.
Sen. Josh Kimbrell, a Spartanburg Republican who first questioned the law, proposed the change to the state budget.
A council member asked House Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister to include the clause in the negotiated spending plan to drum up support for repealing a rule they felt was likely unconstitutional, Bannister said. He declined to name the council member, and Rickenmann denied Bannister’s comments, saying that while council members have had discussions with legislators, none asked for the change.
Rickenmann and advocates for repealing the ban blamed politicking as the reason the ordinance was thrust into the spotlight four years after it began. Kimbrell and Wilson have each said they’re considering a run for governor next year. The race has no official candidates yet.
“To be honest, I wish it had all gone away,” Rickenmann said of the issue. “But we are where we are today.”

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado small businesses from various sectors have made changes to their operations and even lost customers as a result of uncertainty around Trump administration tariffs. 
Grady Cope, CEO of Reata Engineering and Machine Works, a Colorado-based manufacturing company, said his company spent most of last year working to bring a Canadian customer on board. But in February, that customer said it would stop working with Reata because it was their only U.S.-based vendor, and “our people would just be really upset if we were buying from a U.S. vendor.” 
“So they’re gone after a year’s worth of work,” Cope said at a press conference Tuesday with U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado and other small business leaders.

Many of the materials used to make Reata’s products are not made in the U.S., Cope said. The company also ships parts to customers all over the world, with two of its biggest customers in Germany and the United Kingdom. 
“One of the things that has truly surprised all of us is that the inconsistency of we-don’t-know-where-the-tariffs-are-from-day-to-day is causing many of our customers to put orders on hold,” Cope said. “Everybody’s waiting for some stabilization and normalcy.” 
President Donald Trump has issued executive orders to implement tariffs that involve every country in the world, including those with which the U.S. conducts extensive trade, such as Canada, Mexico and China. He has said trade deficits are a national emergency, and part of his goal is to force more companies to manufacture products in the U.S. But he has repeatedly changed course on tariff policy.
Democratic attorneys general, including Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, have sued the administration saying tariffs are the purview of Congress, not the president. 










All these tariffs, in one way or another, they’re not bringing manufacturing back to this country ... What they’re doing is putting an unbearable burden on small businesses like we see here.


– U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado


Hickenlooper said people well versed in economics tell him that “tariffs have never worked” except in specific situations. He said all tariffs do is create “a level of uncertainty that is almost untenable” and prevents businesses from growing and maintaining supply chain relationships. 
“All these tariffs, in one way or another, they’re not bringing manufacturing back to this country,” Hickenlooper said. “What they’re doing is putting an unbearable burden on small businesses like we see here.”
Hickenlooper toured 4 Noses Brewing Company in Denver before hosting the press conference there with local business leaders. He sits on the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. He is running for reelection in 2026. 
Jack Caporal, trade policy chair at the World Trade Center Denver, said trade is an “engine of growth” in Colorado, as 1 in 5 jobs in the state is supported by trade, and gives Colorado consumers a choice on how and where to spend their money. He said tariffs are “aggressive taxes” that small businesses “have the hardest time absorbing the cost of.” 
“When there are trade issues that ought to be resolved to open that market access for Colorado businesses, the approach should be one that’s surgical and well thought out and well intentioned … Colorado businesses shouldn’t be caught in the crossfire of unnecessary trade wars that raise costs for consumers and businesses,” Caporal said.  
Caporal said the uncertainty and the “whiplash” that comes with changing tariff policies prompts other countries “to become less reliant on the U.S. market” and to do business outside of the U.S. He said it also makes it harder for American businesses to enter those markets. 
Jeremy Petersen, CEO of Identity Pet Nutrition, said while his business is headquartered in Colorado, all of its products are made in Canada because the U.S. had “no available production to create the quality of product that we wanted to create for pets.” During the COVID-19 pandemic, the business tried to bring manufacturing into the U.S., but it is not possible in the U.S. to achieve the quality the company wants, he said. 
While Identity’s products have a “made in Canada” label and the country was the second top retail market last year for the company, Petersen said Canada is now his worst market.
“Despite being Canadian made, they know we’re U.S.-owned, and so the boycott is on,” Petersen said. 
Petersen said the company has also seen panic buying worse than it saw during the pandemic. It will be increasing its pricing by 6% on June 1 because of uncertainty of how tariffs will change. He said this has been “the most difficult year” of his professional career because of the uncertainty that comes with fluctuating tariffs.
“It’d be really nice if the president could just put this all on the back burner and recognize that we can’t exist solely with products created in America,” Petersen said. “We’ve always been a land of opportunity, and a land of small businesses and making it easier for small business owners, and now here at the flip of a switch this year, that’s all threatened.”

(Photo by Nicole Girten/Daily Montanan)The Flathead National Forest announced on Friday that it would issue a special use authorization for the operation of Holland Lake Lodge. 
Under the new ownership of Eric Jacobsen and Thomas Knowles, the historic Holland Lake Lodge, will operate under a new 20-year special use permit within the property’s existing footprint, according to a Flathead National Forest press release.
No expanded facilities or activities are approved with the new operating permit for the private lodge operating on public land. 
“Holland Lake Lodge is a historic lodge that has provided recreation opportunities for one hundred years. Providing a diverse range of recreation services is a valued resource for the community, a driver for the local economy, and helps improve visitor access to the surrounding National Forest Lands – all desired conditions identified in our Forest Plan,” Flathead National Forest Supervisor Anthony Botello said in a press release. “I look forward to working with the new owners and community to continue this opportunity into the future.”
Bortello said the decision was based on a review of public comments and analysis of potential environmental effects.
Members of the public submitted more than 300 comments about the project. Many focused on deficiencies within the water and wastewater systems and alleged a lack of enforcement by the Forest Service for problems that occurred under the previous owner.
Bortello said in his decision that “no further actions are necessary to comply with all applicable laws, regulations and policies,” due to there being no proposed changes in activities or facilities under the new permit. 
Situated on the edge of the Bob Marshall Wilderness, Holland Lake Lodge has been under public scrutiny for several years after the public learned that longtime owner Christian Wohlfeil had proposed a sale to outdoor adventure company POWDR and an accompanying expansion plan would have added an additional lodge and 26 cabin structures on the property.
The plan drew public outcry for its rushed timeframe and a determination by the Forest Service the expansion did not need an environmental analysis. The Forest Service also drew criticism for announcing the plan to the public more than one year after it had learned of the potential sale and for misstating information about the scope of the proposal. The Forest Service later rejected the plan, but said it would consider other proposals.
Wohlfeil listed the property for sale in October of 2023, and late last year, Jacobsen, a private equity investor, announced he had secured a contract to purchase the lodge.
Jacobsen held several public meetings prior to the purchase to meet with local members of the Swan Valley community and conveyed his intention in purchasing the property was to “Preserve and protect the lodge and the lodge experience in harmony with nature into the future” and not develop the property.
Jacobsen grew up in Montana and now splits his time between Whitefish and Park City, Utah. He did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday about the Forest Service decision and potential summer operations. 
Last year, the lodge was unable to provide public services due to deficiencies in the wastewater treatment system, which services both the lodge facilities and nearby campground. The deficiencies prevented the lodge from operating during its 100th anniversary year.
However, the Flathead National Forest has submitted a preliminary report for upgrades to the Department of Environmental Quality.
Jacobsen is required to draft and submit an annual operating plan for approval by the Forest Service before the special use permit is finalized. All documents related to the permit will be available for the public to see.

(Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream) Insurance middlemen who switched South Carolinians’ health care plans without telling them accounted for 22% of fraud cases reported to the state Department of Insurance last year, the agency director told legislators Tuesday.
Of the 5,000 complaints of fraud reported throughout 2024, 1,100 came from people who signed up for insurance through the online marketplace Healthcare.gov — created by the Affordable Health Care Act also known as Obamacare — and said their health care plan was changed without permission. That’s illegal, but the scam is relatively easy. All it takes is for a licensed broker to have the insured’s name, date of birth and home state, said Michael Wise, director of the state Department of Insurance since 2023.
The agent pockets the commission, while patients usually have no idea they’ve been had until they try to use their insurance card at a doctor’s office or pharmacy, Wise told a House oversight panel.
“They might switch these policy orders a good many times. And so that has become a trend that we’re looking out for,” he said, adding he’s heard of plans being switched up to 16 times.
It’s a national problem, with agents often scamming people from multiple states.
The Center for Medicare Services and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that oversees the online marketplace, received 73,884 complaints of unauthorized policy switching in the first six months of last year.
That led to the agency announcing last July that it would no longer authorize changes from agents or brokers unless they were already associated with the person’s enrollment.
Any unassociated or new broker now has to do a three-way call with the customer and a federal call center.
“That has become a trend that we’re looking out for. The federal government is too, and some things have been put in place to try to curb that,” Wise told the House subcommittee.
In April 2024, KFF Health News reported that CMS emailed a plan to industry representatives to handle complaints from people who’d had their insurance switched. The scam became common enough to get its own acronym: UPS, for unauthorized plan switch.
The slideshow says CMS found a “large number of 2024 UPS cases” involving plans that were auto-renewed because the person was unaware.
In South Carolina, cases are under investigation, but no one has been charged yet with a crime related to the scam, said Jason Spencer, a prosecutor for the Department of Insurance.
He did not specify how many cases remain open.
Spencer added that Florida seems to be a hotbed for agents doing this and he’s in regular contact with that state’s Department of Insurance.
The scam involving health plans subsidized through the federal marketplace started popping up in 2022 and were initially sparse, Spencer told the SC Daily Gazette.
By 2023, it had become a trend. Then in 2024, the complaints skyrocketed, he said, though he didn’t have the exact numbers.
“It took a steep jump very quickly,” he said.
Brokers typically make $20 to $25 for every person they enroll and can make that commission multiple times from the same person, according to KFF Health News.
“They could sign that same person up for another plan again, and that was how they were just continuing to churn commissions,” Spencer said.
He explained that the scammer and victim often never talk to each other. A licensed broker can get information from the federal database. But sometimes the rogue agents will call their victims, claiming they’re signing people up for a survey, saying they could win a potential prize, when they are actually gathering potential information to switch their insurance policies.
“They would be in contact with somebody that’s advertising discount cards or gift cards — ‘Oh, just sign up for this survey’ — and they don’t really pay attention to what they are signing up for,” Spencer said.
“The person who’s actually supposed to be insured doesn’t have any idea any of this is going on until they go to their doctor, and their doctor’s like, ‘Oh, well, where’s your copay?’” Spencer said.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Members of the Governor’s Council of Economic Advisors raised alarms during a virtual roundtable Tuesday about volatile Trump administration tariff policies, saying they’re driving up costs, stalling housing developments, and threatening key sectors of South Dakota’s economy.
“It’s a really regressive tax,” council member John Hemmingstad, of Avalon Capital Group, said of tariffs.


Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.

Hemmingstad said his team has paused multi-family housing investments due to the price uncertainty of building materials. He added that South Dakota, which relies heavily on sales taxes, could be especially vulnerable if higher tariffs cause inflation that dampens consumer spending.
Retailers are also feeling the strain. Kevin Nyberg, owner of Ace Hardware stores in Sioux Falls and Watertown, said suppliers are warning of price increases on up to 50% of inventory. He compared it to the economic disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“This is the psyche of a retailer right now,” Nyberg said. “You scramble before the price increases go into effect.”
U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, made a separate visit later Tuesday to Maguire, a water tower manufacturer and maintainer in Sioux Falls.
“When we hear from businesses locally, and we have, we’re obviously doing what we can to intervene with the administration,” Thune said. “On a broader level, the tariffs are, I think, designed to sort of rebalance trade, create more reciprocity with other countries who, in many cases, have been taking advantage of us.”
Last year, before Trump took office, Thune said an across-the-board tariff strategy would be “a recipe for increased inflation.”

At the Council of Economic Advisors meeting, South Dakota State University economics professor Evert Van der Sluis called the Trump administration’s approach a “deliberate policy to dismantle some of the pillars of American prosperity,” citing cuts to education, immigration and research as compounding the harm. He said economic modeling does not support the idea that tariffs will offset federal revenue losses or reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing.
Van der Sluis and others also expressed concern for South Dakota’s export-dependent agricultural sector, which remains vulnerable to international tariff retaliation.
“Agriculture is very much dependent on exports,” he said.
During Trump’s prior four years in office, the U.S. Department of Agriculture paid out billions of dollars to support farmers suffering from retaliatory tariffs. Thune said discussions are underway among Congress, the USDA and the White House about how to shield farmers from tariff fallout.
“I think you want to try and ensure that nobody gets harmed,” Thune said. “And agriculture oftentimes is the place where a lot of countries retaliate first.”
Hemmingstad said bailing out ag producers alone would be a tough sell politically.
“This time it’s not just ag. Every industry is going to be impacted,” he said. “Is ag really going to get one and no one else does?”
While farmers received significant aid during the last tariff standoff, Van der Sluis noted, “those bailouts, they come from federal revenue,” and so “it adds to the fiscal irresponsibility.”

Gayle Harrell (L) and Senate President Ben Alblritton. (Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix)A bill that increases early detection opportunities and educational interventions for children with autism and their families (and a top priority for Senate President Ben Albritton) was signed into law Tuesday by Gov. Ron DeSantis.
“Thank you Governor DeSantis for signing this comprehensive legislation into law. With this bill, Florida is offering new support from all angles, coordinating research and training, expanding early detection, and increasing education opportunities and other treatment that will help families navigate a diagnosis of Autism,” Ben Albritton, a Republican from Wauchula, said in a prepared statement.
“As always, parents are in control and equipped to make the best decisions to help children reach their full potential.”
The bill directs the Florida Department of Health to provide Florida families with early intervention therapies and services through the Early Steps program until the child turns four. That program provides intervention services to eligible infants and toddlers. Under existing law, children age out of the program when they turn three.

The bill creates two education-related grant programs: one for specialized summer programs for children with autism and the other to support charter schools exclusively serving them. The University of Florida Center for Autism and Neurodevelopment is designated as the  statewide hub for autism research, services, and best practices.
The center also will be in charge of a grant program to establish charter schools for children with autism. Grants will be prioritized for schools serving rural and underserved areas, those with demonstrable success in establishing and operating a charter school exclusively for students with autism and related disorders, and programs that use existing facilities.
SB 112 was the first bill to pass the Senate during the 2025 session. At the time, Albritton said the legislation was the state’s response to an outcry from parents of children with autism he has met over his political career.
‘Game changer’
Bill sponsor Sen. Gayle Harrell in a prepared statement called the new law a “game changer.”
“Research is clear. Early detection and intervention services promote positive outcomes for infants, toddlers, and children with a disability or developmental delay,” Harrell said.
“This bill gives parents the opportunity to continue critical early intervention services provided through the Early Steps Program until their child turns four and begins receiving services at school. Additionally, by developing summer programs designed specifically for children with Autism, we can help parents find summer camps and other activities that can accommodate the specific needs of a child with autism, ensuring year-round continuity of care.”
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), defines autism spectrum disorder as a condition characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction and repetitive behaviors. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of 2020, one in 36 children aged 8 were estimated to have autism.
The bill is policy-driven only. There is no appropriation in the legislation to help fund the new law. The money will have to be included in the state fiscal year 2025-26 budget, which the Legislature has yet to pass. The Legislature is at an impasse over state spending and tax relief.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)A uranium mine in southern Utah is the first project to be approved under President Donald Trump’s emergency declaration streamlining the development of energy infrastructure. 
Owned and operated by the Canadian company Anfield Energy, the Velvet-Wood uranium project received a green light on Friday under the federal government’s new, 14-day environmental review process for energy projects. 
The permitting process for similar projects has taken years in the past — but in January, Trump declared a national energy emergency, slashing the environmental review process for a number of energy projects like uranium, crude oil, natural gas, coal, biofuels, geothermal and critical minerals. 
Trump administration expedites permitting for Utah uranium mine to a two-week process

Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced the mining project in Utah would be the first to be reviewed. And on Friday, Anfield received approval from the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM. 
“This approval marks a turning point in how we secure America’s mineral future,” said Doug Burgum, Department of the Interior secretary, in a statement. “By streamlining the review process for critical mineral projects like Velvet-Wood, we’re reducing dependence on foreign adversaries and ensuring our military, medical and energy sectors have the resources they need to thrive. This is mineral security in action.” 
Sitting near the Utah-Colorado border in San Juan County about 40 miles east of Canyonlands National Park, the Velvet-Wood project is the combination of two mines — the existing Velvet Mine, which produced nearly 400,000 tons of ore between 1979 and 1984, and the nearby Wood area, which hasn’t yet been mined according to an economic assessment from Anfield.

“We are very pleased that the Department of the Interior has greenlit our Velvet-Wood project in an expedited manner,” said Anfield CEO Corey Dias in a statement. “This confirms our view that Velvet-Wood was well-suited for an accelerated review, given that it is a past-producing uranium and vanadium mine with a small environmental footprint. The Company will now pivot to advancing the project through construction and, ultimately, to production.” 
Anfield has been eyeing this site for years, purchasing it in 2015 and submitting a plan of operation to the state of Utah and BLM in 2024. According to the Department of the Interior, the operation will disturb about three acres, and much of the mining will take place underground.
The normal environmental review process usually takes local input into consideration, weighing environmental and cultural concerns against the project’s goals. That includes a public comment period that, depending on the project, can result in thousands of comments. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to BLM documents, public input was not required because of the president’s emergency order. Still, the region’s tribal governments have concerns, as noted in BLM’s environmental assessment. 
The agency met with representatives from the Hopi, Pueblo of Zuni, Navajo, Pueblo of San Felipe and Ute Mountain Ute tribes, all of whom were critical of the operation and the federal government’s expedited review. 
“The Tribal Nations expressed similar concerns with the emergency procedures, water impacts, transportation, and uranium contamination,” the BLM documents read, including worries that the mining and transportation of uranium ore, which would take place near Bears Ears National Monument, could impact cultural sites. 
Anfield also owns Shootaring Canyon uranium mill, located in Garfield County between Hanksville and Lake Powell. Just one of three licensed and completed uranium mills in the country, it hasn’t been operational in years — Anfield says it plans to reopen the mill, although that will require additional licensing and infrastructure improvements. If it becomes operational, the mill will be used to convert uranium ore into concentrate to be used in nuclear reactors.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/burgumjan162025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-27 20:03:31.302484

The family became unhoused when Mia was an infant in 2023. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current) Luis Negron stood in the State House rotunda Tuesday afternoon among a crowd of 250 with his 2-year-old daughter Mia atop his shoulders holding a sign that said “shelter was my lifeline.”
Negron said that two years ago he, his partner, and then 3-month old daughter were evicted from their apartment and had to sleep in their car.
“We didn’t know what to do,” he said in an interview inside the State House. They eventually connected with the Providence-based social service organization Amos House which got them into a shelter. Now his family lives in permanent supportive housing.
Advocates fear Rhode Island’s unhoused community could lose such critical lifelines if lawmakers fail to address a $17.8 million budget shortfall for homelessness services as they finalize the fiscal 2026 budget. Which is why Negron and his family were at  the State House Tuesday afternoon, joining others in urging state leaders to fill that gap.
“Unfortunately, there’s not enough money for everything that has to happen in our state,” Eileen Hayes, CEO of the Providence social service organization Amos House, told the crowd. “But people whose lives are at risk should not be the ones that have to forfeit their needs.”
Federal pandemic money has allowed Rhode Island to more than double its number of shelter beds since 2020, but with that funding now gone, advocates fear as many as 926 beds could be lost statewide.
“We need shelter beds to stay open while we build affordable housing for all,” Hayes said. 
According to the state, advocates’ projections rely on outdated numbers. Rhode Island Department of Housing spokesperson Emily Marshall pointed to a request for proposals for homeless service providers issued by the state on May 7 which “anticipates provider savings” which would reduce the number of beds that may have to come offline should the state not plug the department’s budget.
Marshall did not immediately provide an estimate on how many shelter beds the state would have to reduce.
“We remain committed to maintaining emergency shelter access within available funding while strategically investing in long-term solutions like affordable and permanent supportive housing,” Marshall said in an email Tuesday.
The state’s shelter dashboard notes a total of 1,514 beds available across the entire state, with 181 unused as of May 23.

Where could funding come from?
Advocates are urging state lawmakers to consider new taxes to help cover provider costs, including a tax on second homes, a higher real estate conveyance tax on property sales over $800,000, and increased income contributions from the state’s highest earners.
They are also calling on the General Assembly to approve Gov. Dan McKee’s budget proposal to fund shelter beds by extending the state’s 5% hotel tax to include short-term rental homes.
McKee’s recommended fiscal year 2026 budget calls on the state to eliminate the exemption whole-home short-term rentals have from the state’s 5% hotel tax starting Jan. 1, 2026. The governor projects an annual revenue of roughly $5 million.
Advocates supported a similar proposal McKee introduced as a budget amendment in 2024, but the General Assembly ultimately replaced it with its own $46 million plan which relied on remaining pandemic relief aid. The governor’s plan also faced competition from municipalities that have historically received a quarter of the revenue from the state’s hotel tax. 
Municipal interests are again vying for that expanded share of the fiscal pie.
Legislation introduced by Sen. Matthew LaMountain, a Warwick Democrat, would maintain that existing split to towns, if McKee’s proposal is approved. 
Rep. Lauren Carson, a Newport Democrat who chairs a legislative panel studying short-term rentals, has again proposed returning all of the revenue generated by a hotel tax on short-term rental houses exclusively for municipal infrastructure.
“If we don’t have infrastructure and the stormwater not running and toilets not working, then the tourists ain’t coming,” she said in an interview.
And the potential tax revenue could always go toward funding homeless services, Carson said, it would just be up to the municipalities rather than the state.
“Newport is perfectly qualified to make decisions on homeless shelters and how to assist homeless people,” she said. 
Keeping housing decisions local is a preference of the Rhode Island League of Cities and Towns, whose executive director said a cookie-cutter approach will not work with each municipality.
“Not one of my 39 communities are all the same, they’re all unique,” Randy Rossi, executive director of the league, said in an interview. “What Burrillville might need, Westerly may need something completely different.”
Kimberly Simmons, executive director for the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness, said she would prefer any potential revenue from the tax expansion end up in state coffers.
“The state has the ability to get it out evenly,” Simmons said in an interview. 
Carson’s bill was heard before the House Committee on Finance on May 13 where it was held for further study, as is standard procedure for an initial vetting by a legislative panel. Companion legislation sponsored by Sen. Victoria Gu, a Westerly Democrat, was held by the Senate Committee on Finance on March 4.
House Speaker K. Joseph Sheakrchi has not taken any official stance, but said he will continue to prioritize addressing homelessness in the final budget.
“In recent years, the General Assembly has gone above and beyond the Governor’s budget requests for homeless assistance,” he said in a statement. “Despite an extremely challenging budget year, homelessness will remain a priority of the legislature.”
At least 2,442 unhoused people across Rhode Island were counted when volunteers conducted an annual survey in late January 2024 — up 35% from the 2023 count. ​The coalition conducted the annual Point-In-Time count for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development this year on Jan. 28, but results aren’t expected to be released until some time in the summer.

(Photo courtesy Western New Mexico University)Western New Mexico University’s faculty members say they are forming a local National Education Association union while a search for a new university president commences.
According to a news release from the organizing committee, organizers collected signatures and authorization cards from two-thirds of the university’s faculty and librarians within weeks of beginning a formal campaign to gain support. They presented the cards to the New Mexico Public Employee Labor Relations Board on May 13. 
According to the board’s website, the petition for unionization is still pending. 
By moving to unionize, WNMU’s faculty is set to join faculties from Central New Mexico College, New Mexico Highlands University, San Juan College, University of New Mexico’s Main Campus and New Mexico State University, which petitioned for unionization in March 2024. 
“As WNMU looks to the future, unionizing will ensure that faculty have a voice in any changes that may be considered for programmatic, administrative, and reporting structures,” Andy Hernandez, a professor of history at WNMU, said in a written statement. 
He pointed to the “tumultuous events” at WNMU in the last year, including former President Joseph Shepard’s termination; the board of regent’s decision to award Shepard a $1.9 million severance package; the resignation of the board and the ongoing lawsuit New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez filed against university administrators for unjust enrichment and violation of fiduciary duties. 
A new university board of regents took over early this year and are tasked with searching for a new president to replace Shepard, who left his position in January and moved into a professor position in the university’s School of Business. 
The board voted on May 23 selecting firms to conduct the national search for both an interim university president and permanent president.
“Creating a collective bargaining unit offers us the chance to take important sections from our [faculty] handbook related to critical elements of our working conditions and to give them the strength of an enforceable contract backed by an organization with a proven track record of supporting educators. Doing so lets us put more of our focus back onto our classrooms and our students,” Hernandez said in a written statement to Source NM. 
David Scarborough, associate professor of management at WNMU since 2016, said in a written statement that now is the “perfect” time for faculty to organize. “Our new executive will arrive with unionized faculty as one more invested stakeholder among many. For faculty, it represents a positive inflection point signaling renewal and continued commitment to shared governance.”

File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThe Vermont division of U.S. Bankruptcy Court has dismissed Daniel Banyai’s attempt to block the town of Pawlet’s claim to his property, after he accumulated more than $300,000 of debt to the town. The May 22 ruling marks the latest action in a yearslong legal battle over Slate Ridge, a 30-acre property Banyai used as a paramilitary training gun range, which violated local zoning rules.Banyai filed for bankruptcy in December, temporarily pausing the town’s legal actions against him. Shortly after, Banyai filed a motion to avoid the town’s liens under the homestead exemption of Vermont’s property statutes. The attorney representing the Town of Pawlet, Merrill Bent, said the court ruling brings the town “one step closer” to foreclosure on the Slate Ridge property, and that subsequent proceedings will determine whether the debt can be discharged. Bent said the town’s position is that the debt cannot be waived because it includes “fines owed to a governmental unit,” or the town of Pawlet.As of Dec. 3, Banyai owed the town approximately $325,000 in total noncompliance fees and that debt continues to accumulate at a flat rate of 12% interest amounting to an additional $98 every day since, according to Bent. READ MORE
The U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Heather Cooper acknowledged that Banyai met debt relief requirements under the homestead exemption under federal bankruptcy code. However, Cooper ruled that Pawlet still has a claim to the property due the narrow scope of the exemption and the timeline of ownership of the homestead.Banyai formed and served as director of a 501(c)(3) organization called Slate Ridge Inc. during the litigation and transferred ownership of the Pawlet property to the nonprofit organization through quitclaim deed in December 2022. He then moved the property back to his individual ownership in November 2024. The fees Banyai owes to Pawlet — including the contempt lien from January and June of 2024 and the town’s attorney fees granted by the Superior Court in May 2024 — were all issued before Banyai personally reacquired the Slate Ridge property this past November.According to the court’s memorandum, Banyai “held neither legal nor equitable title” to the homestead when the town claims were issued, as it was owned under a separate legal entity — Slate Ridge Inc. As a result, the court ruled that the property remains subject to the town’s liens and that the debt claims cannot be avoided under the homestead exemption.Bent said the court examined the question of whether Banyai had a “clear right to acquire the property from the company at the time the town’s liens attached.” She said, “there was no evidence that he had any such right.”The town first took legal action against Banyai in 2019 after he began making changes to the property and erecting structures without permits — actions that alarmed neighbors living in West Pawlet. After the Environmental Division of Vermont Superior Court imposed fines against Banyai in January 2022, Banyai did not alter his property to comply with zoning bylaws and continued to make changes to his property. The lack of compliance ultimately led a judge to hold Banyai in contempt of court in February 2023, issuing sanctions and a warning of arrest. That same judge issued a warrant for Banyai’s arrest in 2023, which was reissued in 2024 after continued noncompliance. Bent said the town is continuing to pursue “all the steps necessary to enforce its bylaws and to recoup the expense of having to do so.”“Ultimately, Mr. Banyai is the one who’s going to pay the cost of the enforcement,” Bent said. Banyai’s lawyer, Michael Fisher, was not immediately available for comment Tuesday. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Bankruptcy judge dismisses Banyai’s attempt to block town’s property claim .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/daniel-banyai-3-20221104.jpg,,,2025-05-27 19:04:07.251849

The options will likely include doing nothing, mitigation, which involves removing some PCBs and encapsulating others, or demolishing structures with PCB contamination, according to the state.An important component of the action alternatives plan is “the degree of community acceptance for the remedy and overall costs of the work,” Kassandra Kimmey, a Department of Environmental Conservation project manager who is overseeing Hartford’s PCB response at the state level, wrote in an email to the Valley News.After the action alternatives plan is completed, the school district is encouraged to hold a public meeting to discuss its findings before moving onto creating a “Corrective Action Plan,” Kimmey said. That plan includes the method selected to deal with PCB contamination and its cost.“Until a cleanup option has been chosen and a (Corrective Action Plan) is written and approved, remediation work may not begin,” Kimmey wrote in a letter to Hartford Superintendent Caty Sutton.The ECAA requirement cannot be met in time for the district to begin remediation work this summer, Garthwaite said in a recording of last Wednesday’s School Board meeting.“At the same time, we’re not committing to a financial obligation that we cannot meet until we understand the entirety of that financial obligation and what our funding options are,” he said later in the meeting.In 2021, Vermont lawmakers passed Act 74, which requires educational facilities built prior to 1980 to be tested for PCB air quality contamination. Under the law, if PCB levels are found to be above state-approved levels, school districts are required to address it even if state funding is not available.In the upcoming fiscal year state budget, which begins July 1, $9.5 million has been allocated in the Environmental Contingency Fund for PCB “testing and remediation in schools.” Gov. Phil Scott signed the budget bill last Thursday.State officials have previously said that the money will be split between six schools deemed priorities by the state, a list which includes Hartford, and that the funding will be available on a first-come, first-serve basis.“I can’t guarantee that we will have enough funding to conduct all the work outlined in the (Contamination Action Plan) and we may need to prioritize certain portions of your school or conduct a phased cleanup,” Kimmey wrote in her letter to Sutton, the Hartford superintendent, before the state budget passed.The meeting with the state doesn’t change Hartford’s plans, Garthwaite said. The school board “has created a mandate that we deal with this problem completely … and at the end of this process we do not have toxins in the walls,” he said in a phone interview.Garthwaite acknowledged the state “could possibly come to a conclusion that is less expensive or less permanent that would be acceptable to meet their mandate in good faith, but would not be acceptable to the district.”When asked why Hartford is taking a more aggressive approach than the state has mandated, Garthwaite pointed to a PCB informational page posted on the school district’s website: “Previous experience has proven that, while addressing air quality is critical to mitigating immediate health hazards, it does not address in any meaningful way the long-term risk associated with unabated contamination,” according to a statement.It called PCBs “inherently unstable,” meaning that air contamination levels can increase and decrease based on heat, humidity and how buildings are used, and require that air quality be monitored regularly.“Unaddressed material contamination represents significant financial and operation liability that will increase over time,” the website said.The board authorized district officials to test materials — including paint, caulk and adhesives — that are in areas of the school that tested negative for PCB air quality contamination, Garthwaite said. The district is seeking proposals for testing.The additional testing will take place in parts of buildings that were built around the same time as spaces in the technical center and high school that have exceeded PCB safety levels set by the state.Last August, Hartford officials relocated the technical center’s culinary arts program because PCB contamination exceeded the state’s “immediate action level,” which the state deems as unsafe for students to be in the space.Other areas of the building, including the gym, cafeteria and auditorium, met the state’s “school action level.” Students are allowed in the space for a limited amount of time and regular air quality testing must be done to check on whether PCB levels have increase.“… Where we stand right now is the testing program proceeds as planned,” Garthwaite said during last Wednesday’s meeting. “… That’s something the board decided to do in the best interest of the school and the community, to know the total extent of this problem or to rule it out once and for all.”Since planned testing exceeds requirements under Act 74, the state will not reimburse Hartford taxpayers for it, said Patricia Coppolino, senior environmental program manager with the Vermont Agency of Natural Resources.Where PCB concentrations in indoor air are low, Coppolino said, “I think it’s going to be very difficult to find the PCBs in those spaces.”It costs $12,000 to $129,000 to test a school for PCB contamination, according to January 2025 estimates provided by Coppolino. The lower end of that range includes air testing only, while the higher figure includes both air and material sampling.To date, the Hartford School District has run up a bill of $145,500 for PCB testing. It has not yet asked the state for reimbursement, Jacob Vezina, the district’s finance director, said in an email. He’s waiting to hear back from the contractor regarding how much of the amount billed out falls under the state-approved scope and how much of the additional testing the district conducted was not approved by the state.Until the school district understands the scope of the PCB contamination, projects planned at the high school as part of a $21 million bond voters passed in 2024 have also been put on pause.“I’m not going to put a fire alarm system in a building, in a space that might be demolished in the process of abatement,” Garthwaite said. “We’re not going to spend that money and leave it behind.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Hartford pauses plans to demolish school buildings to allow for further study of chemical contamination.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/hartford-area-career-center.jpg,,,2025-05-27 19:04:07.251849

A teachers union is calling on the Española School Board to intervene after an effort last month at the high school to collect student immigration data. (Photo courtesy EVHS)The National Education Association of New Mexico sent a letter Tuesday to the Española School Board asking for a “full and detailed explanation” of who authorized Española Valley High School’s directive to teachers last month, ostensibly as part of a standardized test, to collect students’ immigration statuses.
The union also accused the district of deleting the information it collected, which leaders said amounted to “destruction of evidence during an open union investigation.” That prompted the union to file a Prohibited Practice Complaint with the Public Employee Labor Relations Board of New Mexico. 
“We fear not only the impact these actions have on our membership but the students as a whole,” the union wrote in the letter. “We are writing to seek your help to rectify these matters. The district and staff deserve to have a school district that is lawful and free of fear and intimidation.”
A teacher posted on Reddit on April 21 that they had reached out to the union after teachers were asked to collect the data as part of the WorkKeys standardized test, an assessment that the ACT created to measure job readiness. 
An ACT spokesperson told Source New Mexico last month that it never seeks that information, saying its collection is “not a requirement for taking our exams and is not information we collect or use in any way.”
Española high school sought students’ immigration status as part of standardized test

The letter calls on the school board to, by June 2, provide copies of all internal communications and documents regarding the directive; an “explanation of the rationale” for later deleting the collected data; and confirmation about whether the data was ever transmitted to ACT, Inc.
In an interview Tuesday with Source New Mexico, NEA-NM spokesperson Edward Webster said the district needs to “stop playing the game” with the union and teachers about what happened and be transparent about what happened and why. 
Eric Spencer, the Española superintendent, did not respond to an email Tuesday afternoon from Source New Mexico. The school board meets this evening at 6 p.m., but the matter is not on the agenda. School board president Javin Coriz did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday afternoon. 
The effort to collect the data occurred amid fears that that information could be turned over to federal immigration authorities, and a few months after border patrol agents boarded a Las Cruces swim team’s school bus. 
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham recently said in an interview with Source that the state is continually beating back efforts by the federal government to collect private data about New Mexicans, including immigration data. The Legislature also passed several bills aiming to keep immigration data out of federal hands.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-27 22:42:34+00:00,CT Mirror,CT passes bill ensuring access to reproductive care for youth under 18,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/27/ct-youth-reproductive-care-bill/,The bill guarantees that minors in Connecticut can receive contraceptive and pregnancy-related care without permission from their parents.,"Connecticut lawmakers on Tuesday gave full passage to House Bill 7213, a proposal to codify into state law a guarantee that minors in Connecticut may receive contraceptive and pregnancy-related care without permission from their parents. 
The legislation passed 31-5 with bipartisan support in the Senate. The House earlier this month voted 117-27 to pass the bill, with seven legislators missing the vote.
In Connecticut, minors can consent to a range of health services, including emergency medical treatment, testing for sexually transmitted infections and abortion. But contraceptive and pregnancy-related care are exceptions. Providers say that can lead to inconsistencies in care. 
People under the age of 18 in Connecticut can generally access contraceptive care — like birth control — without parental consent, though it’s not explicitly guaranteed in law.
“This bill allows minors under the age of 18 in Connecticut to consent independently to contraceptive and counseling services — also to prenatal care, and care and pain management during labor and delivery,” Public Health Committee co-chair Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, said during the floor debate. “This bill is not about abortion.”
The measure prohibits providers from sharing information, including billing, with parents without the minor patient’s consent, but it also specifies that parents cannot be held financially liable for services their child receives without their knowledge, Anwar said. 
Anwar addressed concerns he’d heard from “a very small minority” about why such care must be provided without parental notification, pointing to medical research showing that kids are less likely to access contraceptive care if parental consent is required. But, Anwar clarified that the bill does not make changes to existing mandatory reporting laws, including Department of Children and Families notification if a child under the age of 13 is engaging in sexual activity or diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease. 
During a public hearing on the bill in March, which lasted over ten hours, the testimony overwhelmingly supported the proposal, though some constituents expressed unease that parents might be kept out of important conversations they want to have with their children. Several health providers testified that one of the steps they take when providing reproductive care to young people is to encourage them to talk to a parent or trusted adult. 
Sen. Heather Somers, R-Groton, ranking member of the Public Health Committee, called the legislation a “pro-woman, pro-baby, pro-saving lives bill,” and she said its most important component was the ability it guarantees for minors to receive prenatal care.
“Early prenatal care saves lives,” Somers said, adding that adequate care plays a critical role in preventing dangerous outcomes for both the mother and the baby. “Teen pregnancies are at a higher risk for complications and delaying care can result in premature birth, low birth weight, and stillbirths.”
Gretchen Raffa, chief policy and advocacy officer for Planned Parenthood Votes! Connecticut, called the legislation “a necessary step to ensure young people can continue to access essential health services confidentially and without unnecessary barriers.”
Reproductive and maternal care legislation
The legislature is considering a handful of bills aimed at increasing access to maternal and reproductive care in the state.
A bill that would broaden Connecticut’s “shield law”, to guarantee legal protections for physicians who provide reproductive and gender-affirming services via telehealth to patients in other states, is slated for an initial vote in the House as soon as Wednesday of this week, according to one of its main proponents, Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, co-chair of the legislature’s Reproductive Rights Caucus. 
Another measure passed out of the Judiciary Committee, which hasn’t yet received a floor vote, would allow people who are incarcerated to breastfeed children during visits. Sen. Somers, a co-sponsor of the proposal, called it in a written statement “a compassionate and necessary step forward, not just in criminal justice reform but in the overall health of our communities.”
There are also proposals requiring studies of improvements to perinatal mental health care services, expansions to the number of birthing facilities in underserved areas of the state and the feasibility of importing ingredients for reproductive health medications, like the abortion bill. These measures have yet to be called for a final vote.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MINORS-REPRODUCTIVE-CONSENT-0527-SR-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-27 19:04:07.251849

The measure is a response to the Trump administration's push to limit how people can express their gender on U.S. passports, supporters said.

Chloe Tomlinson, P/D-Winooski, chats on the floor of the House during a recess at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Tuesday, May 27, 2025. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerTucked into this year’s miscellaneous motor vehicle bill, which passed the House Tuesday, is a measure supporters say could ensure Vermont driver’s licenses continue to reflect their holders’ true gender identities, even as the White House has restricted how transgender, nonbinary, intersex and other people can express their identities on U.S. passports. The legislation, S.123, would allow people to renew their Vermont licenses “at any time prior” to when the ID expires. Right now, renewals are allowed within six months of the expiration date. State driver’s licenses are valid for either two or four years from the date that they’re issued. Since 2019, Vermont has allowed people to select from three gender marker options when getting a driver’s license: male, female or “other,” the third of which is denoted by an “X.” But in January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order seeking to eliminate a similar “X” gender option from U.S. passports — and declaring that “it is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female.” That’s had legislators and advocates in Vermont concerned about residents’ access, in the long term, to identifications that accurately represent their identities.The changes in S.123 would, effectively, allow Vermont residents to extend the lifespan of the state-issued IDs they already have that carry a gender-neutral marker. Put another way, it would let people “restart the clock,” said Rep. Chloe Tomlinson, P/D-Winooski, who sits on the House Transportation Committee and presented the measure on the House floor Tuesday. Those new licenses would also be compliant with the REAL ID requirements that took effect earlier this month, supporters noted. REAL IDs are now required to board domestic flights as well as access certain secure federal government facilities, such as U.S. military bases.But some legislators and advocates are concerned the Trump administration could make it more difficult in the months to come for people, who don’t want to choose a “male” or “female” option, to get a state-issued license that is also REAL ID-compliant — even if they have one now. “This puts us in a real crunch point where it’s critically important that trans and nonbinary folks in Vermont continue to retain access to identification that matches their gender identity in order to move freely,” said Monica Allard, an attorney who co-founded the organization Vermont Queer Legal Professionals, in testimony to the House Transportation panel late last month.The renewal timeline would also apply to state-issued driver’s privilege cards, which don’t require proof of U.S. citizenship. Notably, though, those cards are not compliant with REAL ID rules.Some legislators this year have also sought to create a new class of driver’s license that is valid for eight years, in addition to the two- and four-year classes already on the books. Rep. Troy Headrick, I-Burlington, introduced an amendment to the DMV bill on the House floor Tuesday — which he then promptly withdrew — that would have created the new eight-year option. Headrick pointed to how Trump has repeatedly suggested he’d seek a third term in office, a move that most legal scholars agree would run afoul of the U.S. Constitution. The license renewal language was added into the DMV bill while it was in the Senate. Now that the House has passed the bill, it will head back over to the Senate to consider changes that the House made. It’s not clear yet whether the bill will head to a committee of conference.— Shaun RobinsonIn the knowThe U.S. Department of Commerce has rescinded a $23.8 million grant the department previously awarded to advance semiconductor research and manufacturing in the state.

File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerAccording to Doug Merrill, UVM’s regional innovation officer, the nearly $24 million grant awarded to the Vermont tech hub would have helped fund three ongoing Vermont-based projects related to the research and development of semiconductors made of gallium nitride. The material can purportedly produce microchips that are more efficient and powerful than traditional silicon semiconductors.The projects include a publicly accessible lab for testing devices with gallium nitride technology, a software design center and a workforce development project that would provide technical education to train students in microchip manufacturing.Merrill said the Vermont consortium had learned as early as February that the process of finalizing its grant had been put on hold. Consequently, no funds had actually been received or spent yet. “There’s nothing that this announcement does that’s going to cause us to have to undo anything,” he said. Although the grant’s cancellation was “disappointing,” Merrill said, the Vermont group expects to continue moving forward with the projects using alternate streams of funding and plans to reapply for federal funds through the Tech Hubs program when the opportunity arises.“We feel very strongly that we’re going to be very competitive in the next round,” Merrill said. “We were competitive in the last round, and we think we’re going to be as competitive if not more competitive in this round.”In general, the CHIPS and Science Act, aimed to expand domestic semiconductor manufacturing while increasing investment in technological research in the United States. The Tech Hubs program in the bill contained multiple phases.In fall 2023, as a part of phase one of the initiative, the U.S. Department of Commerce named the Vermont consortium as one of 31 tech hubs out of almost 400 similar collectives across the country that applied. That designation allowed the winning groups to apply for phase two funding.The Biden administration had already distributed over $500 million in phase two funding to other tech hubs when it announced the latest round of grants in January. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Trump administration cancels nearly $24 million semiconductor grant awarded to Vermont partnership under Biden-era program.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/uvm-campus-8-20230920-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-27 19:04:07.251849

(Courtesy of Katharine Clark)Santa Fe County Clerk Katharine Clark recently announced her 2026 campaign to lead New Mexico’s highest election office.
The New Mexico Secretary of State oversees elections, enforces ethics rules, keeps the official records for state government and lies third in succession, behind the lieutenant governor and governor. Current Democratic Secretary of State Maggie Tolouse Oliver cannot run for the seat again, having served two consecutive terms.
So far, Clark faces Doña Ana County Clerk Amanda López Askin in the June 2, 2026 Democratic primary. Currently, no Republicans have announced a run for the seat.
Voters reelected Clark, a Democrat, for her second term in the Santa Fe County Clerk’s office in November 2024. She says will remain in her current position and limit campaigning to weekends and evenings.
In a call with Source NM, Clark cited the Trump Administration’s cuts to federal cybersecurity election protections in her decision to run. She has served on the national committee for election security called Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center since December 2024.
“I am uniquely positioned to make sure we are able to get by and that we have national policy protecting our elections’ cybersecurity,” Clark said. “We really need a secretary of state who’s going to make sure we have those protections in place and have the relationships and strategic mindset and proactiveness to get it done.”
Trump signs broad elections order requiring proof of citizenship

A generally positive report earlier this month from independent, nonpartisan election observers on New Mexico’s 2024 general election said requests for for same-day registration overwhelmed the system, and cited one Santa Fe County location where same-day voter registration stopped for 90 minutes. 
Clark noted that same-day registration delays were statewide and said the county clerk’s office worked to restore access and offered provisional ballots, which voters use as a failsafe when their registration status can’t be determined.
“We did explain to voters ‘here’s your options,’ and some opted to wait, but others wanted provisional ballots and did those,” she said.
The report also notes one location in Santa Fe County, where Observe New Mexico’s “watcher reported that the presiding judge tried to provide provisional ballots to voters experiencing long lines to same-day-register but concluded that the location had not been provided with any means of producing a provisional ballot.”
Clark told Source NM those specific provisional ballot findings in the report “were in dispute,” and attributed the problems at that site to a new presiding judge who did not know all the options for issuing provisional ballots, which she said was rectified by the office later that day.
“The presiding judge, I think, thought it had to be the envelope way and was not utilizing the ballot-on-demand system — something we did explain to them,” she said.
Clark said she would bring a mindset of “radical transparency” to the office and would continue work to innovate elections, pointing to efforts at Santa Fe County to educate people and candidates on the elections process.
“Not only do we want someone who is pro-voter, but I’m making sure I’m strategic and meeting the moment and ensuring that I’m being proactive to prevent misinformation from the beginning,” she said.
According to campaign finance documents, Clark entered the race with $14,215.50 on hand, which was transferred from her campaign for Santa Fe county clerk.
Clark is listed as “non compliant” in the Secretary of State’s campaign finance system. Clark shared emails with Source NM dating back to May 6, in which secretary of state staff say the issue is “taken care of,” and noting that Clark is compliant in the system.
“They keep charging me $50 per day, even though my report is compliant,” Clark said.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)State lawmakers delivered 423 bills to Gov. Bob Ferguson this year and he signed them all.
Except one. Its sponsor hopes the Washington Legislature will override the veto the next time it is in session.
“It shocked me,” said Rep. Mark Klicker, R-Walla Walla. “People were excited about this and the governor turned around and vetoed it.”
Klicker authored House Bill 1108 that sought to unearth “the primary cost drivers for homeownership and rental housing” in Washington. 
It had 25 co-sponsors – 14 Republicans and 11 Democrats – and cleared the Legislature with only nine people voting against it.
It directed the Washington State Institute for Public Policy to research, analyze and determine “to the extent practicable” the forces at play in the cost of building single-family homes, apartments and other types of residential construction. 
Those conducting the study would have had to gather perspectives from all players with a tie to the housing industry. Economists, builders, unions, lenders, and realtors are on the list. So too are tenants and landlords, as well as cities, counties and public utility districts. 
The report would have been due Dec. 1, 2026. The bill carried a $233,000 price tag. 
Ferguson vetoed it quietly in his office on May 20, the final day on which he could act on legislation.
“Given the pressures on Washington’s budget, our state’s limited resources should be spent on identifying and implementing solutions to the housing crisis; I do not believe the cost of another study on cost drivers is warranted,” Ferguson wrote in his veto letter to lawmakers.
Klicker learned of the veto the day before from Ferguson’s staff.
“I am pretty upset,” Klicker said. “I’ll be honest with you. He doesn’t want to know the truth about the reasons for the cost drivers.”
The bill passed by margins of 94-4 in the House and 44-5 in the Senate. 
“I really appreciated the Democrats working with me to get it to the governor’s desk,” he said. 
He said Rep. Strom Peterson, D-Edmonds, and Sen. Jessica Bateman, D-Olympia, the chairs of the House and Senate housing committees, respectively, were each instrumental in helping get it to the finish line.
While the vote margins in the House and Senate exceed the two-thirds majority required to override a veto, it won’t be easy to convince the Democratic leaders of the Legislature to do so, especially since the governor is a Democrat.
“I am going to talk to them,” Klicker said. “This was the bill that was most important to me.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1612-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-27 19:04:07.251849

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A familiar face will continue to occupy the president’s office at Brown University for the next two years.
Brown President Christina H. Paxson’s contract was set to end on June 30, 2026, but the university’s Corporation unanimously approved a two-year extension earlier this month, according to a letter sent by Chancellor Brian T. Moynihan to the Brown community on Tuesday. 
Paxson’s contract will now last through June 30, 2028. Paxson was compensated nearly $1.8 million in 2022, according to the Brown Daily Herald. That represented a 14% decrease from Paxson’s record compensation of more than $2 million in 2021, the Herald reported. 
“During a tumultuous time facing American higher education, Brown is fortunate to benefit from President Paxson’s steady and principled leadership,” Moynihan wrote. “We are excited that the University will continue to benefit from her strategic vision, boundless energy, unwavering dedication and fortitude during periods of momentous change. Our community has been made stronger by her sincere belief in all the good that Brown can do in the world.”
The Corporation of Brown University is the school’s equivalent of a board of trustees. Terms for presidents can be extended at any time with mutual agreement from both the Corporation and the president, according to Moynihan’s letter. The chancellor noted a “vigorous” consensus among Corporation members for Paxson’s continued tenure, based on her accomplishments in the past 13 years. 
Paxson, who became Brown’s 19th president in 2012, earned her doctorate in economics from Columbia University in 1987. Before joining Brown, she served as dean of Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. At Princeton, she founded the school’s Center for Health and Wellbeing and served as its director for nine years. She also founded and directed the school’s Center for the Economics and Demography of Aging.
Paxson’s major initiatives have included a wide-ranging campus equity initiative known as Pathways to Diversity and Inclusion, and the Brown Promise, which eliminated loans from the university’s financial aid packages. During her tenure Paxson has overseen the launch of the Brown Arts Institute, Data Science Initiative, and the Jonathan M. Nelson Center for Entrepreneurship. 
“The uncertainty of the times we are in, while challenging, has reaffirmed my belief in our mission and the dedication of Brown faculty, students and staff to serve the community, the nation and the world with distinction,” Paxson said in a statement. “Having the opportunity to lead this great university continues to be a privilege and an honor, and the work we have done together has been both fulfilling and inspirational.”
Paxson’s research bibliography includes economic analyses of early-life poverty, health, educational attainment, and other factors’ influence on long-term outcomes in health, income and inequality. Papers by Paxson have investigated the socioeconomic impact of Hurricane Katrina, how a dearth of health services exacerbated the AIDS pandemic in Africa, and how rural Thai households managed their savings income amid agricultural dry spells. The first article listed in Paxson’s CV is a 1986 study she co-authored that examined how differences in work hours were driven mainly by the kinds of jobs people held, rather than by personal preferences or life circumstances.

(Photos courtesy of Community College of Rhode Island)Two finalists remain in the running for a new permanent president of the Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI), the state agency steering the selection process announced Tuesday.   
One of the finalists, Rosemary Costigan, has been president in an interim capacity since the 2023 resignation of predecessor Meghan Hughes, the community college’s first female president. The other finalist is Christopher Reber, who has been president of Hudson County Community College in Jersey City, New Jersey, since 2018.
Both candidates will participate in a series of forums with students, faculty, staff, alumni, and members of the CCRI Foundation Board on June 4 and June 6. According to the CCRI website, each candidate will give a 10- to 15-minute presentation, followed by informal Q&A sessions with the CCRI community, who will also be able to fill out feedback forms for each candidate. 
“The finalists will be interviewed and will conduct Q&As with the CCRI community on one day each,” Beth Bailey, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Office of the Postsecondary Commissioner, said in an email Tuesday. She added that the agenda has not yet been finalized.
Bailey said the announcement of CCRI’s next president will likely come before July 1. She added that once a selection is made, the postsecondary council will work with the incoming leader to finalize the contract, salary, and start date.
The commissioner’s office is the administrative arm of the Rhode Island Council on Postsecondary Education, which oversees public higher education in the Ocean State. The commissioner’s office announced the search in January and formed a nine-member search committee. At the helm were co-chairs Elizabeth Ortiz, associate justice with the Rhode Island Family Court, and Steve Smith, an educational consultant who previously led the Providence Teachers Union. 
To lead the process, the commissioner’s office hired AGB Search — the same firm hired to identify the next president of Rhode Island College in 2023. The community college’s national search for a new president was posted on Feb. 25, according to the AGB website, and set an April 22 deadline for applications. A total of 44 candidates applied in that timespan. The search committee narrowed the options down to eight semifinalists. 
“The process to cut the list of candidates down from 44 applicants to these two was highly competitive,” Ortiz said in a statement Tuesday. “The diverse pool of candidates, many with formidable resumes, provided the opportunity for the search committee to choose the finalists that were indeed the best match for CCRI at this time.”
“Of the eight semi-finalists, there was much discussion about which candidates had the vision and experience to lead the college through its next era,” Smith added in his own statement.
According to the job posting, the new president will play a crucial role in advancing the college’s 2022-2027 strategic plan, which emphasizes student outcomes among a diverse population of learners, workforce partnerships, and sustainable finances. The student body includes more than 12,000 students across four campuses and two satellite centers — 62% of whom attend part-time, with an average age of 25. CCRI is also a federally designated Hispanic-Serving Institution.
CCRI’s finances are in good health, and the most recent independent audit found its assets increased by $11.1 million from the previous fiscal year, according to the job profile. Nearly half the college’s revenue is appropriated by the state, making legislative advocacy an important duty for the CCRI president.
While salary data is presently unavailable for the incoming president, in the current fiscal year of 2025, Costigan has a salary of $299,999, according to the state’s payroll transparency portal. Costigan is also the first CCRI alum to occupy the president’s post. Costigan’s inclusion in the final group of contestants mirrors the Rhode Island College presidential search, which eventually saw interim leader Jack Warner emerge victorious among 65 candidates.     
Costigan, a first-generation college student from Pawtucket, finished her studies at CCRI, then known as Rhode Island Junior College, and went on to earn her bachelor’s from Rhode Island College and her master’s and doctorate in nursing from the University of Rhode Island. According to Costigan’s LinkedIn, she has worked at CCRI in various roles for almost 26 years, starting as a professor of nursing in June 1999. She previously chaired the school’s nursing department and also served as its assistant dean. Before becoming interim president, Costigan served for nearly eight years as CCRI’s vice president for academic affairs.
In his tenure at Hudson County Community College, Reber launched the Hudson Scholars program, which offers up to a $625 stipend per semester for students who meet with mentors and reach certain academic milestones. Reber also helped lead DEI initiatives at the school, such as establishing a President’s Advisory Council on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, and an Office of DEI.
Previously, Reber was president of Community College of Beaver County in Pennsylvania from 2014 to 2018 and executive dean of Venango College of Clarion University from 2002 to 2014. He holds a doctorate in higher education from the University of Pittsburgh and completed postdoctoral studies at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education.

Patrick Penn, seen here during a March 5, 2024, debate in the House, was appointed to a position at the U.S. Department of Agriculture shortly after vacating his House seat. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — President Donald Trump appointed former Kansas Republican Rep. Patrick Penn, who resigned from his House seat earlier this month, as the deputy undersecretary for the department’s food, nutrition and consumer services.
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, appointed by Trump in February, announced Penn’s new position Tuesday, along with a slate of other state-level leadership designations.
“President Trump is putting Farmers First, and so is the incredible team we are building at the Department of Agriculture,” Rollins said in a press release. “Our latest additions to the USDA family are personally invested in ensuring farmers and rural America prosper.”
Penn resigned from the Wichita-area House seat he held since 2021 on May 14, submitting letters to Republican party and state officials. A special precinct election to select a representative to fill the vacant 85th district seat is set for Wednesday. Penn’s term was set to expire January 2027.
Penn is a former Army signal officer who was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan. He was first elected to the Kansas Legislature in 2020, where he was dedicated to pushing Second Amendment legislation, including repeated attempts to pass a firearm education program bill.
The USDA’s Food and Nutrition Service administers 16 food assistance programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as food stamps, and emergency food assistance.
Penn voted during the 2025 legislative session in favor of prohibiting SNAP beneficiaries from purchasing candy and soft drinks with their food assistance dollars. Also during the 2025 legislative session, Penn was involved in a handful of disruptive moments. In March, he questioned a Democratic lawmaker’s motives during debate on the House floor. In February, while on the House floor, he alluded to a hypothetical act of violence against a former Hutchinson Democratic representative.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/P3051160-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-05-27 18:06:47.033752

Free.,"RFK Jr. ends COVID vaccine recommendation for healthy children, pregnant people",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/rfk-jr-ends-covid-vaccine-recommendation-healthy-children-pregnant-people,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. changed the federal government’s recommendation for the coronavirus vaccine on Tuesday, saying healthy children and healthy pregnant people no longer need to get it.Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic who had to broker several deals with Republican senators to secure confirmation, didn’t explain why he was making the change in a brief video.“I couldn’t be more pleased to announce that as of today the COVID vaccine for healthy children and healthy pregnant women has been removed from the CDC recommended immunization schedule,” Kennedy said. “Last year the Biden administration urged healthy children to get yet another COVID shot despite the lack of any clinical data to support the repeat booster strategy in children.”National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Martin A. Makary both spoke briefly during the social media video to say they supported the decision. But neither pointed to new studies regarding COVID-19 boosters or any evidence of safety issues.“It’s common sense and it’s good science,” Bhattacharya said.Kennedy made several promises to Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy — chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee — in order to secure Cassidy’s vote so that Kennedy could be confirmed as HHS secretary.Among those was that Kennedy would “maintain the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory committee on immunization practices recommendations without changes.”Cassidy’s office did not respond to a request for comment.‘Extremely disappointed’Public health organizations raised concerns about the change in policy. Dr. Steven J. Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said the organization was “concerned about and extremely disappointed by the announcement that HHS will no longer recommend COVID vaccination during pregnancy.”“As ob-gyns who treat patients every day, we have seen firsthand how dangerous COVID infection can be during pregnancy and for newborns who depend on maternal antibodies from the vaccine for protection,” Fleischman wrote. “We also understand that despite the change in recommendations from HHS, the science has not changed.“It is very clear that COVID infection during pregnancy can be catastrophic and lead to major disability, and it can cause devastating consequences for families. The COVID vaccine is safe during pregnancy, and vaccination can protect our patients and their infants.”Dr. Sean O’Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, wrote in a statement HHS’ “decision bypasses a long-established, evidence-based process used to ensure vaccine safety and ignores the expertise of independent medical experts, including members of CDC committees who are examining the evidence regarding the vaccine to make recommendations for the fall.” “By removing the recommendation, the decision could strip families of choice,” O’Leary wrote. “Those who want to vaccinate may no longer be able to, as the implications for insurance coverage remain unclear. It's also unclear whether health care workers would be eligible to be vaccinated.”“What is clear is that pregnant women, infants and young children are at higher risk of hospitalization from COVID, and the safety of the COVID vaccine has been widely demonstrated.”Former surgeon general under Trump criticalDr. Jerome Adams, the surgeon general during Trump's first administration, wrote in a detailed social media post that Kennedy’s announcement “raises significant concerns, as it overlooks both available evidence, and the complexities of public health.”“Shifting from vaccine mandates to outright prohibitions does not reflect medical freedom; it represents a different form of government intervention, one that restricts individual choice and access to evidence-based care,” Adams wrote. “A balanced approach would prioritize informed decision-making, ensuring that vaccines remain available to those who need them while respecting personal autonomy.“Hoping as this policy change is implemented, anyone who is truly high risk can still easily get a vaccine, and that we don’t let politics trump science, health, and previous proclamations about ‘personal choice.’”American Public Health Association Executive Director Dr. Georges C Benjamin wrote in a statement that “(v)accines offer the best protection from severe symptoms and death associated with the COVID-19 virus for all populations.“This decision by Secretary Kennedy puts kids, pregnant moms and their babies at risk of unnecessary suffering that is preventable. Lots of questions remain as to how HHS leadership plans to implement this poorly thought out announcement that is not supported by the scientific evidence and our national experience.”An HHS press secretary wrote in an email to States Newsroom that “as part of the Trump administration’s commitment to common sense, the COVID-19 vaccine will be removed from the CDC’s recommended immunization schedule.”“With the COVID-19 pandemic behind us, it is time to move forward,” the spokesperson wrote. “HHS and the CDC remain committed to gold standard science and to ensuring the health and well-being of all Americans—especially our nation’s children—using common sense.”",,,,2025-05-27 18:06:47.033752

Senate Bill 130, sponsored by Sen. Heather Cloud, R-Turkey Creek, seeks to implement a series of data-driven checks and technological tools to ensure that only eligible residents receive Medicaid benefits.
The bill requires the Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) to conduct regular cross-checks with state and federal agencies, including the Department of Revenue and Social Security Administration. LDH must also review death records monthly, verify incarceration status quarterly and independently determine eligibility.
It also limits automatic (ex parte) renewals unless required by federal law, with a phase-out of current waivers by January 2026.
The bill is part of a broader effort to curb waste and fraud in the program, which provides health coverage to more than 1.8 million low-income Louisianans. But critics of the bill warn that the proposed changes could create administrative hurdles for eligible individuals and lead to disenrollment of vulnerable residents due to paperwork errors or data discrepancies.

“We know that any time that there is any additional step for verification, it’s an opportunity for someone to lose coverage,” said Courtney Foster, senior policy advisor for Medicaid at Invest in Louisiana, a nonpartisan policy research organization. “A lot of what this bill says will be savings is for people getting kicked off of Medicaid.”
That doesn’t necessarily mean that all of those people that are getting kicked off are ineligible, Foster said. It could just mean that they didn’t respond to official correspondence. Sen. Gerald Boudreaux, D-Lafayette, brought up these concerns on the senate floor.
“If for whatever reason I don’t answer the first time, or I think it’s junk mail, it gets thrown out,” Boudreaux said. “How do we have comfort knowing that on the certification process, that we’re going to go above and beyond before we drop people off of the Medicaid rolls?”
Cloud responded saying the bill doesn’t change the current process for removing people from Medicaid if they don’t meet eligibility requirements.
The removal process, as she explained it, starts when LDH identifies a possible issue with a person’s Medicaid eligibility — such as needing to verify income or address — they begin by sending a letter requesting more information. This initial letter follows federal guidelines and allows five days for delivery.
After that, LDH gives the person an additional 15 days to respond. During this combined 20-day window, the department also tries to contact them through other means, including phone calls, emails and text messages, to make sure they know what’s needed to keep their coverage.
If there’s still no response after 20 days, LDH sends an official “advance notice of termination” letting the person know their Medicaid coverage will end. This notice must be sent at least 15 days before the termination takes effect. Because Medicaid coverage usually ends at the end of a month, this timing can sometimes give people a bit of extra time — potentially another full month of coverage — before they’re removed from the rolls.
Cloud added that even after someone is dropped from Medicaid, they have another 90 days to provide the needed information and get their coverage reinstated retroactively.
“So theoretically, they have up to 125 days after the first [letter] was sent out to get their coverage reinstated if they are terminated,” Cloud said. “It would be as if they’d never lost coverage. So that gave me a lot of comfort.”

The fiscal note says reducing enrollment of ineligible recipients could save $74.9 million by 2026 and $941.5 million over five years, including state and federal dollars. The methodology for this savings includes the state assuming a majority of applicants won’t respond to requests for more information, and only a fraction will attempt to re-enroll.
Foster said most of the savings would come from procedural denials, not necessarily policy improvements. And the cost-savings associated with the bill are “questionable,” she said, because most of the time, when someone loses Medicaid coverage, they don’t realize it until the next time they go to the doctor or emergency room. That could mean people who are disenrolled from Medicaid for procedural reasons, but do qualify for coverage, may simply get back on Medicaid.
“A lot of people who will be kicked off are likely eligible and may roll back on within a couple of months,” Foster said.
Implementing the bill would also cost money, including operating expenses of $139,297 for printing and postage, $4.5 million for professional services, like system modifications and subscription services, and $104,050 for equipment, like computers and phones.
It also calls for creating 50 new positions with salaries and benefits, which Foster said adds additional layers of bureaucracy dedicated to “kicking people off of Medicaid.”
It’s also important to remember, Foster said, that Medicaid beneficiaries are not the ones getting paid. The program gives low-income people access to consistent health care coverage.
“It’s people that are showing up to the doctor and then maybe the doctor should be getting paid from one source versus another,” Foster said. “But the patient themselves is just going to the doctor.”
If signed into law, the bill would go into effect Jan. 1, 2026.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa’s statewide temperatures were nearly 10 degrees Fahrenheit below normal last week, and the state had almost double the normal amount of precipitation, according to State Climatologist Justin Glisan.
The rain came at a good time following corn and soybean planting, which is more than 90% complete across the state, and helped to replenish soil moisture conditions. 
The latest crop progress and condition report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture rated corn and soybeans for the first time this season. Corn measured 83% good or excellent, and soybeans at 80% good or excellent. 
Most of the crops have emerged as of the May 19 through May 25 reporting period. Soybean emergence, at 60%, is eight days ahead of last year and four ahead of the average. Seventy-six percent of corn has emerged, putting it six days ahead of last year’s pace and just two ahead of the average. 
Nearly all of the season’s oat crop has emerged, and 26% has headed. Hay in the state is also reaching maturity and 40% of the first cut has been completed. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the “cool and soggy” conditions from last week sidelined some work for farmers, who had an average of 3.8 days suitable for fieldwork.

“Despite the delays, most farmers are grateful to receive the rain as we recharge our soils and give the crops a strong early season boost,” Naig said. 
Indeed, the week’s moisture returned soil moisture conditions to their admirable ratings from earlier this spring. Subsoil moisture conditions rated 67% adequate and 76% of topsoil conditions rated adequate for the state. Central Iowa, which saw 250-300% normal rainfall for the reporting period, had 16% of its topsoil condition rated surplus.
The average temperature across the state measured 55 degrees Fahrenheit, which is 8 degrees below normal, according to Glisan who said the week had “unseasonably cool and wet” conditions. 
Average rainfall for the period was 2.10 inches, a full inch above the normal. 
According to the report, many farmers are waiting for drier, warmer conditions to begin spraying their fields.

Ben Ray Lújan (D-N.M.) on May 27, 2025. (Leah Romero / Source NM)State and local leaders representing food banks, health care and senior services voiced their concerns to U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Lújan (D-N.M.) with possible cuts to federal social programs as Congress considers the “big, beautiful bill.”
Lújan held the roundtable at Munson Senior Center in Las Cruces Tuesday where local advocates spoke of the impacts federal funding cuts to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and federal nutrition programs will have on all New Mexicans, but particularly seniors. The U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill, which would make spending cuts to social programs, on May 22 and it now goes to members of the U.S. Senate to debate. 
“This is quite concerning. These are the biggest cuts we’ve ever seen since the inception of this program,” Lújan said during the meeting.
Joseph Roybal-Sanchez, director of AARP New Mexico, said about one in three New Mexicans receive Medicaid assistance, which provides health care for lower-income people, while about 930,000 New Mexicans receive Medicare assistance, health care for people 65 and older. Lújan noted that some people don’t realize that many older people rely on benefits from both programs, not just one or the other, further “compounding” the issue of defunding the programs. 
Las Cruces resident Jody Crowley shared that her adult son is on the autism spectrum and receives Medicaid benefits. He also works as an Uber driver in town, but the federal benefits help make ends meet. 
“He is exactly the kind of person they want to throw off Medicaid. He’s an able bodied young man with no dependents, and I am terrified,” Crowley said. “ I’m 77, my husband is 80. In five years, are we both going to be here?  Are we both going to be competent? I don’t know. So my concern is, who are they going to throw off and what is going to be the alternative?”

Sonia Saldaña, director of senior services for the City of Las Cruces, pointed to all of the services offered to older New Mexicans by senior centers, which are funded at least partially by federal dollars, such as in-person meals, meals on wheels, home care services, respite care for caregivers and programs supporting grandparents raising their grandchildren. 
“People have to remember that our programs and our services are designed to allow people to stay living in their homes longer. We want people to stay in their homes longer. We don’t want people to go to an institution early in life,” Saldaña said. “For us, having those federal dollars and making sure that our constituents keep those Medicaid and Medicare dollars is at the top of the list because without that funding, a lot of these wouldn’t be what they are.”
Las Cruces resident Eileen Rosenblatt shared how she benefitted from the local meals on wheels program when she had to deal with medical situations that left her unable to cook for herself. “It was a blessing in disguise because I didn’t realize how hard it was for me…Cooking would have been terrible, just standing up and cooking,” Rosenblatt said.
She added that she knows of another woman locally who is in her 90s and relies on meals on wheels regularly and “cherishes” seeing the delivery person each day.
Casa de Peregrinos Executive Director Lorenzo Alba explained that the Las Cruces food pantry has already had to deal with federal funding cuts in recent months and further cuts would have a “major effect” on their operation. At the same time, he said food prices have increased by 24% in the last two years, putting another strain on their limited funds. 
“The state can’t fund everything. We need the federal government to help fund some of these programs for nutrition to get food out to the communities,” Alba said.

(Photo by Erik Gunn/Wisconsin Examiner) With a spirited rally, a picket line march around the building and a small brass band, nurses at UnityPoint Health-Meriter hospital in Madison launched a five-day walkout Tuesday, reiterating their demands for changes in safety practices, minimum ratios of nurses to patients and improved pay.
The strike — the first ever by nurses at Meriter hospital — is scheduled to run through Saturday. It follows the end of bargaining on Monday, May 19, when the nurses’ union bargaining team turned down the hospital management’s latest proposal.
Services Employees International Union (SEIU) Wisconsin and UnityPoint Health-Meriter have been in negotiations since earlier this year on a new contract covering about 950 nurses. The nurses’ most recent two-year agreement expired in late March and they have since been working without a contract.
The nurses’ contract demands include establishing required ratios of nurses to patients, improved safety for hospital employees and pay increases — particularly for senior nurses, according to union officials.
“Time and time again, Meriter’s management refused to meet us halfway,” said nurse Lindsey Miller, one of three bargaining team members who spoke at the strike’s opening-day rally Tuesday morning. “At our last bargaining session, it was management, not nurses, who walked away from the bargaining table.”
Miller said the most recent management officer included “an unacceptable raise that doesn’t cover the cost of living” and made “no progress” towards the nurses’ union’s demands for staffing commitments or security improvements.
“I am striking because I love working here,” said Madison Vander Hill, a birthing center nurse and one of six union speakers at the rally. “I love getting to walk alongside and care for families as they go through one of the most transformative experiences of their lives.”
Vander Hill said she and other nurses were striking “because we must see tangible change from management in order to ensure that safety and security are prioritized and the things we love about the work that we do are protected.”
Her coworker, Audrey Willems Van Dijk, said the nurses’ concerns extended to concerns for the hospital’s patients.
“We are fighting for every single person who walks through Meriter’s doors,” she said. “Yes, we deserve adequate compensation, but more than that, we deserve safety and security for ourselves and our community. We deserve respect.”
Dane County Executive Melissa Agard declared her support for the nurses and connected their dispute with former Gov. Scott Walker’s signature legislation after he took office in 2011 — Act 10, stripping most public workers of most union rights.
“It was his mission to crack the foundation of union rights in the state of Wisconsin. And that crack has continued not only in Wisconsin but across our nation, and you guys are here to say, ‘No more,’” Agard said.
As the strike got underway this week, Meriter told nurses that health benefits — including health insurance — would be cut off as of June 1 for nurses who do not report for their first scheduled shift during the strike this week.
A union spokesperson said the effect of the order would be to cut off benefits for strikers for the month of June if the two sides don’t reach a tentative agreement on Thursday, when their next bargaining session is scheduled.
Meriter spokesperson Nicole Aimone confirmed in an email message Tuesday that nurses who do not report for their first shift during the strike will be put on “inactive status” through Sunday, June 1, with their benefits ending as of that date.
Nurses whose benefits are cut off would have to use the federal law known as COBRA to maintain their coverage, paying for their insurance out of pocket. The law, enacted in the 1980s, enables fired or laid-off workers to maintain their employer’s health insurance temporarily at their own cost.
“They will have the ability to re-enroll once they are placed back into active employee status,” Aimone said.
The union has filed an unfair labor practice charge with the National Labor Relations Board over the hospital’s action.
“It is outrageous and it is disgusting,” said Ben Wikler, the outgoing chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin, addressing the rally. Wikler went on to lead hundreds of sign-carrying nurses and supporters in chanting, “Union busting is disgusting!”
“When management says you’ll lose your health insurance if you insist that there [should be] enough nurses on the floor to make sure that everyone is taken care of — it is disgusting,” Wikler said.
He described the dispute in the larger context of President Donald Trump’s return to the White House.
“They think that the Trump administration and the National Labor Relations Board that this administration has gotten is going to turn its back on working people,” Wikler said.
“They will still have to come back to the negotiating table and they will have to do what’s right, because you are building the power to make them do what’s right,” he added.
The hospital is continuing to operate during the strike. Aimone said that the hospital has contracted with an outside agency for replacement “travel nurses” to support ongoing patient care.
She said she did not have information on the cost for the contract nurses who are filling in during the walkout.

The two-page order imposes a “de facto abortion ban” in the state, according to the leaders of the state’s two Planned Parenthood affiliates.
Over the course of two rulings — one in December and one in February — Jackson County Judge Jerri Zhang pointed to the voter-approved constitutional amendment in issuing a temporary injunction blocking abortion restrictions enacted over numerous years by state lawmakers.
Most notably, Zhang struck down licensing requirement for abortion clinics, arguing the regulations were “unnecessary” and  “discriminatory” because they do not treat services provided in abortion facilities the same as other types of similarly situated health care, including miscarriage care.
The injunction allowed abortions in the state to resume while the case made its way to a January 2026 trial.
Missouri clinics will ‘immediately’ offer abortion across the state after judge’s ruling

On Tuesday, the state Supreme Court determined Zhang applied the wrong standard in rulings, ordering her to vacate her earlier orders and re-evaluate the case using the standards the court laid out. That leaves the door open for Zhang to potentially implement another injunction.
Tom Bastian, spokesman for the Missouri ACLU, painted Tuesday’s ruling as only a temporary setback. His organization believes its arguments for halting restrictions met the standard set by the Supreme Court and expects Zhang will grant another injunction “blocking the ban and restrictions, once again allowing Missourians access to abortion care.”
Despite the potential ambiguity, Republicans celebrated the Supreme Court ruling.
“Today’s decision from the Missouri Supreme Court is a win for women and children and sends a clear message – abortion providers must comply with state law regarding basic safety and sanitation requirements,” Attorney General Andrew Bailey said in an emailed statement.
Emily Wales, president and CEO of Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains. and Margot Riphagen, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, released a statement decrying the ruling as putting Missouri “back under a de facto abortion ban and is devastating for Missourians and the providers they trust with their personal health care decisions.”
A decade ago, more than 5,000 abortions were performed in Missouri, according to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services. By 2020, when abortions were still legal, that number fell to 167, a drop that abortion providers attributed to the state’s growing list of regulations.
Missouri’s trigger law banning all abortions with limited exceptions for medical emergencies went into effect the same day the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022.
Last November, Missourians narrowly approved Amendment 3, which states, in part, that “the right to reproductive freedom shall not be denied, interfered with, delayed, or otherwise restricted unless the government demonstrates that such action is justifiable by a compelling governmental interest achieved by the least restrictive means.”
Earlier this month, the GOP supermajority placed a new constitutional amendment on the 2026 ballot that would reinstate the abortion ban with limited exceptions for medical emergencies, rape and incest.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092623_supremecourt1-1024x669.jpg,,,2025-05-27 18:06:47.033752
,Pennsylvania Capital Star,2025-05-27 21:33:02+00:00,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,“Undoubtedly disappointing” voter turnout in 2025 Pennsylvania primary,John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/election-2025/undoubtedly-disappointing-voter-turnout-in-2025-pennsylvania-primary/,Pollster Berwood Yost said preliminary data shows about 22% of Democrats and 18% of Republicans voted.,"Voters cast their ballots at Fairmont Junior High in Boise during the Idaho primary on May 17, 2022. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Pennsylvania was at the center of the political universe in 2024 as a key battleground state in the presidential election, and as a result, saw record high voter turnout.
But, most voters stayed home when it came to last week’s primary, even with races that would likely determine who would lead the state’s biggest cities on the ballot.
“The turnout was undoubtedly disappointing,” said Berwood Yost, the director of the Franklin & Marshall College Poll.
Low voter turnout in “off-year” municipal primaries is not uncommon for a variety of reasons. Local races tend to not garner the same attention as those for statewide or federal offices do, despite the bigger impact the positions have on communities across the state.
“They’re for offices that probably affect you most directly and in a most regular way,” Yost said. “And yet the turnout is low.”
Some potential voters often don’t realize which elections are on the ballot, while voter fatigue may also contribute to lower turnout, since Pennsylvania was in the spotlight last year.
In 2025, turnout appears to be lower than the previous two off-year municipal primary elections. Yost told the Capital-Star it looks like about 22% of Democrats voted last week, while 18% of Republicans cast ballots.
Two years ago, 27% of Democrats and 24% Republicans voted in the primary. In 2021, the numbers weren’t much different with 28% of Republicans and 25% of Democrats participating in the primary election, he said.
This year’s primary didn’t feature state Supreme Court candidates on the ballot like those two previous years, which can impact turnout. However, candidates for the Superior and Commonwealth courts were up for a vote.
In addition to the statewide judicial races, several of the largest cities including Pittsburgh, Allentown, and Erie, held mayoral elections, while Philadelphians went to the polls to vote in a closely watched district attorney race.
The Democratic Party is the dominant party in those cities, and the winner of the primary ultimately enters November as the heavy favorite to win a full term in office.
Sam Chen, principal director and chief strategist of The Liddell Group, previously served in various roles for former Republican elected leaders including Gov. Tom Corbett, U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, and U.S. Rep. Charlie Dent.
He says he believes there was lower turnout in the GOP primary for a few reasons, including that some in the Republican Party are more complacent since President Donald Trump won the White House and the party claimed control of both chambers of Congress.
“We tend to vote for change, and if everything is great, (some say) I’m not going to the polls,” Chen said.
Even though turnout wasn’t particularly high for Democrats, Larry Ceisler, a public affairs expert, believes they should be optimistic about their chances of winning races in November and potentially 2026.
His example? Bucks County.
The suburban county located just north of Philadelphia is viewed as one of the premier purple counties in Pennsylvania. In 2024, Republicans regained a narrow voter registration edge over Democrats in the county, while Trump became the first Republican candidate for president to win Bucks since 1988.
Despite the recent momentum for the GOP there, Democrats saw higher turnout in the same countywide races in the primary.

Did the primary election signal which way the Democratic Party is moving?
The results in the state’s two biggest cities showed that it isn’t clear which direction Democrats are headed.
In Philadelphia, incumbent progressive District Attorney Larry Krasner cruised to earning the Democratic Party nomination over former Philadelphia Municipal Court Judge Pat Dugan, who was viewed as the moderate candidate.
Turnout was 17%, which is lower than the 2021 primary in the city, the last time the district attorney was on the ballot.
Lauren Cristella, President and CEO of the Committee of Seventy, said the low voter turnout in Philadelphia should “alarm all of us.”
“We cannot dismiss this as ‘just another low-turnout election’ or chalk it up to the ‘Philly Shrug.’ Turnout this low goes well beyond that kind of reasoning, and that kind of thinking lets a broken system off the hook,” Cristella said. “Low turnout like this is a warning sign. It means too many of our neighbors feel disengaged, disillusioned, or disconnected from the process.”
Cristella added that the most recent primary election’s turnout in the city “should be a wake-up call” and called for “bold action,” including changes such as open primaries and “selecting judges based on merit rather than electing them.”
Pittsburgh Mayor Ed Gainey, who was backed by various progressive organizations and elected officials, lost his bid for a second term in the Democratic primary to Allegheny County Controller Corey O’Connor.
Turnout in the city was “slightly higher than 26%,” which was a 2% increase in comparison to the 2021 mayoral primary election, according to WESA.
The experts who spoke with the Capital-Star agreed that each race was unique.
“I think that’s what we’re seeing now. The Democrats are trying to define themselves, trying to figure out what their message is and what they stand for, and find candidates that can express that effectively,” Yost said. “And I don’t think this particular election did anything to settle that question.”
“I don’t think there’s an overarching narrative to this one, besides turnout is low and people don’t care about local elections,” Chen added.

Next test? November’s retention races.
Pennsylvanians in November will vote to fill one open seat on the Superior Court and Commonwealth Court.
However, all eyes are expected to largely be on the vote for retention of three Democratic Supreme Court justices.
Earlier this year, an open seat on Wisconsin’s Supreme Court garnered a lot of attention and outside spending.
“You saw the way they pursued the open Supreme Court seat in Wisconsin, a pivotal swing state. You’ve got three bites at the apple in Pennsylvania to start changing the dynamics of that court,” Yost said. “And so you better believe Republican operatives are going to be here trying to keep those justices from being retained, but that’s hard to do.”
Justices in retention races in Pennsylvania are often not close, but if efforts from conservative organizations are successful, the Democratic majority of the court could change.
Yost noted since Trump won in November, there has been a swing towards Democratic candidates, including in a special election for a state Senate seat in conservative Lancaster County which was won by a Democrat earlier this year.
“It’s going to be an uphill fight for (Republicans), because I suspect that the turnout is going to favor Democrats,” Yost said. “But I think there’ll be more spending, and there’ll be more conversation and probably more activity around the races. So, we’ll see higher turnout even than we saw in 2023, just because the more money that’s spent and the more aware people are about the campaigns and the candidates, the more likely they are to vote.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/voingbooths-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-27 18:06:47.033752

The new study, “Our Housing Future: A Call to Action for Northwest Arkansas,” builds on a 2019 report, finding that housing priority needs identified five years ago — a lack of regional housing policies, need for diverse housing options, limited choices for low-income households and weak links between housing and transportation — remain “even more acute.” 

05.27.25 NWA Housing Report 
The 2025 report also identified a new need: more intentional planning beyond the region’s four largest cities — Bentonville, Rogers, Springdale and Fayetteville.
Independent, nonpartisan national housing consultancy Enterprise Advisors wrote the report, which the Walton Family Foundation commissioned.
“While progress has been made in some areas, the challenges outlined in 2019 have only grown,” Walton Family Foundation Home Region Program Director Robert Burns said in a statement. “Our region is at an important juncture, requiring action to ensure affordable and accessible housing for all residents.”
Northwest Arkansas, one of the 20 fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the country, is expected to have more than 1 million residents by 2050, according to the Arkansas Economic Development Institute. 
The region is home to Fortune 500 companies like J.B. Hunt, Tyson Foods and Walmart, which unveiled its new 350-acre Bentonville campus in January. Northwest Arkansas’ economic development has spurred population growth that has outpaced housing availability, according to the report. 
The University of Arkansas Center for Business and Economic Research reported a 70.9% increase in home prices over a five-year period, significantly higher than price increases in peer regions. 
According to U.S. Census data, between 2017 and 2022, median rent increased 30% in Rogers, 38% in Bentonville and 27% in Fayetteville, higher than the statewide increase of 22%. 
Meanwhile, the area median income has increased by 35%, from $69,900 to $94,400 for a family of four. The most recent numbers released in May by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development show the average median income is now $101,800. 
While the four largest communities’ populations keep growing, land is finite, according to the report. Several affordable housing developers have focused on smaller nearby towns as land costs skyrocket in cities. According to the 2024 Skyline Report, 61% of growth is happening outside Northwest Arkansas’ four largest cities.


Let us know what you think...


 

Critical actions identified in 2019 remain relevant today, according to the latest report, including establishing a regional housing vision, creating a regional housing trust fund, introducing development incentives to promote participation in regional and local housing initiatives, using publicly owned land for housing, and expanding and leveraging federal, state and local resources for affordable and workforce housing. 
Though work remains, strides have been made, including in local land use reforms, the creation of a regional housing organization and the philanthropic investment in more than 1,000 attainable housing units, said Stacy Jurado-Miller, a WFF Home Region Program senior program officer.
Northwest Arkansas officials to address growth challenges with regional strategy

“But progress on the five critical actions identified in 2019 has been limited,” Jurado-Miller said in a press release. “Challenges like clarity on legal parameters, limited funding, accessible resources, and unclear responsibility and accountability will require regional collaboration and a shared plan for creating the tools to build a better housing future.” 
Limited progress was also made on previously identified critical actions because many resources were focused on pandemic response efforts and development costs have increased, according to the report. Parts of Benton County are also being rebuilt after being struck by large tornadoes last May.
Economic development has attracted people to Northwest Arkansas, but that trend could reverse if residents can’t find affordable housing. Regional employers and employees have indicated housing “is critical to economic competitiveness, workforce retention, and business growth,” according to the report. A recent nationwide survey found that 42% of employees have declined better job offers due to higher housing costs, the report states. 
“Safe and affordable housing is critical infrastructure, essential to preserving the quality of life that makes Northwest Arkansas unique,” Burns said. “Housing is a cornerstone of community stability and economic prosperity, and regional leaders will need to work together to adopt bold, collaborative measures to secure a sustainable future.”

“This school has a special place in this community. It has an identity of this community, not only as an economic engine, but also as a guardian of the historic trust, which includes a lot of assets that are not only important to this community, but to this state,” Diaz said during a special Board of Trustees meeting Tuesday.
Earlier this month, President Martha Saunders announced her plan to resign before her contract expired. She will return to her role as a professor after Diaz becomes interim president on July 14. The Board of Governors, to which Diaz belongs, will need to confirm the interim appointment.
The process in part mirrors the resignation of former Florida International University President Kenneth Jessell, also before his contract expired. Former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez was named interim president and later as sole finalist for the permanent job. DeSantis’ office reached out to FIU before Nuñez took the job, according to FIU’s board chair. 
Nuñez is an alumna and adjunct professor at FIU. Diaz is from Hialeah and did not attend or work at the Pensacola school. 
DeSantis named Diaz education commissioner in June 2022 after he’d represented the Hialeah area in the Florida House from 2012 through 2018 and the Florida Senate from 2018 through 2022.
While serving in the Legislature, Diaz served as chief operating officer of Doral College from 2013 until 2022. That’s a private college focused on charter schools. Before that, he was a teacher and administrator in Miami-Dade public schools. 
Diaz focused on education as a lawmaker, serving as chair of the PreK-12 Appropriations Subcommittee and chair of the Choice & Innovation Subcommittee in the House and chair of the Education Committee in the Senate.
Diaz makes nearly $324,000 per year as education commissioner. Saunders’ base salary is $536,273 with up to 20% performance-based bonuses.

New trustees
UWF made headlines this legislative session after DeSantis and the Board of Governors appointed a slate of candidates to the school’s Board of Trustees last winter. Those candidates, many politically connected, faced extensive questions from senators during confirmation hearings. Two of the eight resigned before being confirmed; another the Senate rejected.. 
Sen. Gayle Harrell told appointees that the Senate would be “closely watching” the UWF board. She and other senators voiced concerns about the trustees’ lack of local ties. One of the appointees lives in Idaho, another in West Virginia. 
“I understand that this institution has a very unique place in this community, that this community has an identity, and that needs to be part of this institution,” Diaz said.
“And I also understand that there are programs here that have great potential for national prominence, and that we have a large military population that should be served, has been served, will be served by this institution, and we need to continue to maximize that.”
Senators asked the UWF trustees during April confirmation hearings whether they thought major changes were needed in regards to administrative or political problems at the university. Most said they weren’t aware of any major changes that needed to be made, the Phoenix reported.
DeSantis, by contrast, said last month “big changes” are in store for UWF, while bragging about the political overhaul of New College of Florida.
DeSantis said UWF has some of the “most liberal programs in the state” and that Florida will not tolerate “indoctrination camps” during an April 15 news conference about Hope Florida in Pensacola.
UWF stakeholders and some senators have questioned how liberal the university could be, considering the significantly higher number of registered Republicans than Democrats in the counties the school primarily serves.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Drought is starting to creep back into Utah on the heels of an average winter, with long-term forecasts pointing to an abnormally hot summer.
According to the three-month seasonal outlook from the National Weather Service, the Beehive State is expected to have above average temperatures through August. Meanwhile, the service says it’s unclear whether there will be above or below average precipitation this summer — according to its models, there’s an equal chance of both.
“Hotter doesn’t always mean drier. We are right now showing for most of the state at about equal chances of average precipitation,” said Joel Williams, deputy director of the Utah Division of Water Resources, speaking to lawmakers earlier this week.
Amid dry, warm spring, Idaho may need to tap into water reservoirs

Those three month outlooks are not an exact science — but they do come amid increasingly bleak water conditions for much of the state. Despite an average snow year for northern Utah, the southern regions had a “dismal” winter, Williams said.
The snowpack for some basins in the southwest veered into unprecedented territory this winter and according to the Natural Resource Conservation Service, much of southern Utah remained below 45% of normal moisture.
 Abnormally dry conditions expected across Utah this summer

And across the state, drought is starting to rear its head again after two good years. This time last year, about 25% of the state was considered abnormally dry, while just 0.2% was in moderate drought — now, 39% of Utah is in severe drought, with 3% in extreme drought, according to data from the U.S. Drought Monitor.
Just the high elevation areas of Utah, Salt Lake, Wasatch, Summit and Morgan counties, and a sliver of Box Elder County, are in the clear. The rest of the state is facing at least abnormally dry conditions.
Most of Washington County is in extreme drought, extending into parts of Iron County. And Tooele, Juab, Millard, Beaver, Iron, Kane, Garfield, San Juan, Grand and Uintah counties all have areas in severe drought.
“The last two years of above average snowpack helped us but now we’re starting to see the drought creep back in. And as we say in Utah, we’re either in drought or preparing for the next one,” Williams said.
Those conditions led Utah Gov. Spencer Cox to issue a drought-related emergency declaration, giving farmers in the state access to low-interest loans to help weather the dry conditions.
Eligible farmers can apply for seven-year loans of up to $100,000 each, with two years of no interest and 2.75% interest thereafter, according to the department. Applications for the loans will be accepted until Oct. 23.
The good news, Williams said, is Utah’s reservoirs are in healthy shape. Across the state, reservoir levels are about 20% higher than normal, with nearly every reservoir in northern Utah above 80% capacity. Utah Lake, Strawberry, Jordanelle, Deer Creek, Rockport, Smith and Morehouse, Pineview and Starvation reservoirs are all around 95% or higher.
“Those full reservoirs that we have, those could really help us if we’re heading into another drought,” said Williams.

Jim Pillen talks with reporters after his annual State of the State speech to the Nebraska Legislature. Jan. 15, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen on Tuesday withdrew his intended $14.5 million in general fund line-item vetoes to Nebraska’s next two-year budget, ending a possible constitutional dispute among the state’s three branches of government.
Pillen joined Secretary of State Bob Evnen and Speaker of the Legislature John Arch to announce an end to the short-lived line-item veto saga Tuesday. The line-item vetoes were first identified last Wednesday in a letter to the Legislature, but the actual budget bills with his marked-up objections were not filed with the Legislature until Thursday morning.
The latter is important because each line-item veto can be individually overridden, or the changes can be overridden as a group. The Nebraska Constitution requires vetoes to be filed with the Legislature within five days, excluding Sundays, while the Legislature is in session.
Pillen had said Thursday he would consult with the Attorney General’s Office and other legal counsel on next steps, with the thinking being that a court order could have enforced the vetoes.

On Tuesday, Arch, Evnen and Pillen said that while they continue to disagree whether the constitutional requirement for the line-item vetoes was met, “given how closely the budget bills match the governor’s originally introduced budget,” Pillen signed Legislative Bill 261 and LB 264 as passed by the Legislature on May 15. The bills were then refiled in Evnen’s office.
“That will render the underlying constitutional dispute moot and bring the matter to a close,” the three officials said in a joint statement.
Arch told reporters last week that to his knowledge, nothing like this had happened before.
The Legislature, as well as the offices for Pillen and Evnen, are in the Nebraska State Capitol. A spokesperson for Evnen told the Nebraska Examiner that both budget bills intended to be vetoed were received by the office’s administrative assistant just before 5 p.m. last Wednesday.
“We fulfilled our responsibility by receiving the bills for filing,” the spokesperson said.
No one from Evnen’s office delivered the bills to the Clerk of the Legislature’s office, which is a responsibility of the Governor’s Office.
The Legislature remained in session until 9:20 p.m. last Wednesday, but the copies of LB 261 and LB 264 that the governor issued line-item vetoes to, not just the veto letter, were not delivered to the Legislature by a midnight deadline.
Line-item targets
The line-item vetoes sought $14.5 million in less spending from the state’s general fund, Nebraska’s main pocketbook that will cover a total of $11 billion in total spending through June 2027:

$11.99 million reduction of an increase to the Nebraska Supreme Court because the governor argued “every branch of government” had to contribute to budget balancing.
$2 million cut from public health departments, zeroing out COVID-19 pandemic-era increases because the “pandemic is over” and “spending must be shrunk to pre-pandemic size.”
$511,972 from the State Fire Marshal for salary and health insurance premium increases because he argues the agency has “sufficient funding” already.

Those spending decreases would not have increased the state’s coffers as they would have similarly been offset by $14.5 million in fewer funds being transferred from the cash reserve fund.
A fourth veto sought to prevent an $18 million diversion of cash funds for Lake McConaughy recreational upgrades. Pillen said the project’s scope has changed over many years, and further discussion is needed about how local casino revenue could support improvements.
A copy of those specific objections obtained by the Examiner indicates line-item vetoes in:

Six of the eight budget sections for the Nebraska Supreme Court (LB 261).
Two of the three sections for the State Fire Marshal (LB 261).
One of the 25 sections for the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services (LB 261).
One of the 24 sections for the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission (LB 261), as well as a companion cash fund transfer (LB 264).
One section for cash reserve fund transfer (LB 264).

Lawmakers would have had until this Friday to override the vetoes had the reductions been delivered properly.
2026 budget adjustments
Pillen and Arch said budget adjustment measures for the 2025-27 fiscal years “will be a priority” when lawmakers reconvene in 2026, just seven months away.
“To avoid a similar future dispute,” the statement continues, “all parties have agreed to meet during the interim to clarify and confirm procedures that meet the constitutional requirements for transmittal of budget vetoes, and ensure they are maintained in a clear written guidance for future implementation by all offices.”
The Governor’s Office has not responded to a request for comment on the current process of delivering vetoes and whether there were any variations in this process this time.
Pillen in 2023, for example, vetoed $38.5 million in general fund spending for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 fiscal years. Lawmakers overrode about $850,000 of that.

(Courtesy Photo)Ahead of the Memorial Day Weekend, dozens gathered in Butte for a ceremony renaming the city’s Veterans Affairs Clinic to honor Montana’s last survivor of the attack on Pearl Harbor.
The Montana VA Heath Care System renamed the clinic to the Charlie Dowd Veteran Affairs Clinic, honoring Dowd, a World War II veteran who was awarded seven bronze stars throughout his military career, and died in March 2023 in Butte at the age of 99.
“We are honored to be able to rename this clinic after a local Veteran like Charlie,” Montana VA Executive Director, Duane Gill said in a press release. “At 17 years of age, this proud Sailor ran out to defend Pearl Harbor in only a t-shirt and trousers. It is that fighting spirit that we will recognize. That same fighting spirit is in the hearts of every Montana Veteran. In some small way by renaming this clinic, we hope to memorialize the honor, commitment and courage for every Veteran who walks through those doors.”
U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke and U.S. Montana Sen. Steve Daines introduced companion bills to rename the Butte clinic, which was signed into law in July 2024.
“Montana is home to nearly 100,000 veterans. As the proud son of a United States Marine, I think it’s safe to say each one of our veterans has his or her own story,” Daines said in his remarks at the renaming ceremony on Friday. “And each one is a hero is his or her own right.”
Dowd joined the U.S. Navy in 1941, when he was 17 years old, and was assigned to a station in Pearl Harbor.

According to Daines’ remarks, “Charlie did not hesitate when we were attacked and ran straight toward danger to defend his country.”
“Wearing just a t-shirt and trousers, Charlie sprinted to the armory, climbed to the roof with a Springfield rifle, and fired at the torpedo bombers.  During the attack he suffered burns on his arms and neck when the USS California, which was nearby, was engulfed in flames,” Daines said. “His bravery in that moment is both astonishing and inspiring. He had the Montana fighting spirit.”
According to the Montana VA, the Butte clinic opened in 2022 and is four times larger than its former location in Anaconda. More than 1,750 veterans receive care at the clinic each year from Silver Bow, Deer Lodge, Beaverhead, Madison and Jefferson Counties.
Following his military service, Dowd settled down in the Butte area and was an active member of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association, a member of the Anaconda Sportsmen’s Club, and worked as an outdoor writer for the Anaconda Leader newspaper.
“I had the privilege of visiting with Charlie many times over the years, and I’ll never forget listening to him share stories from Pearl Harbor and the South Pacific. Even at 99, he could still fit into his uniform and tap out Morse code like he did in the service. The ‘Charlie Dowd Department of Veterans Affairs Clinic’ will serve as a lasting reminder of Devil Dog Dowd’s legacy of bravery and lifelong commitment to his country, his fellow veterans, and his community,” said Zinke, in a press release.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1166-scaled-e1748379564215-1024x582.jpeg,,,2025-05-27 18:06:47.033752

Tate Reeves announced on Tuesday that he will call lawmakers into a special session beginning on Wednesday to adopt a $7 billion state budget for the coming budget year that starts July 1. 
Reeves, a Republican, said he and legislative leaders agreed to a budget that keeps most government agencies level-funded, with only small increases for employee insurance costs and pension contributions and “staying true to our conservative principles.” This will leave the state well over $1 billion in untapped cash, which Reeves and some legislative leaders is a good idea given uncertainty on federal spending.
“S​​ince it became apparent that a budget would not be passed during this year’s regular session, I’ve been clear that we should prioritize funding core government functions and keeping spending under control,” Reeves said. 
Mississippi lawmakers must return for a special session because they adjourned their 2025 regular session earlier this year without passing a budget. Lawmakers were mired in political infighting over tax cuts and increases and capital projects, including many pet projects lawmakers wanted for their districts.
Legislative leaders, after the regular session ended, continued to bicker over spending on projects for weeks, pushing the special session closer to the end of the fiscal year. In order to have the Legislature quickly pass a budget and hopefully avoid prolonged argument, Reeves said legislators wouldn’t consider special projects or other major issues during the special session. 
The state constitution gives the governor, not the Legislature, the sole power to call a special session and set its agenda. He had to call them back into session before June 30 to prevent much of state government from shutting down.
The governor said he hopes legislators can quickly pass the budget, but Democratic leaders have criticized the rushed nature of setting a budget in recent years and said they have not received advanced copies of the bills that direct the spending. 
Senate Minority Leader Derrick Simmons, a Democrat from Greenville, and House Minority Leader Robert Johnson III, a Democrat from Natchez, in a joint statement criticized the rushed nature of the special session and urged legislative leadership to provide members sufficient time to vet the 100-plus budget bills. 
“Withholding finalized legislation from duly elected lawmakers jeopardizes the integrity of the legislative process and erodes public trust,” the two leaders said. 
For years, rank-and-file lawmakers have complained that they often don’t have time to read the lengthy budget bills because of the rushed nature of Saturday-night budget negotiations in regular session. This hurry-up has also caused lawmakers and staff attorneys in previous years to make mistakes in legislation.
The governor said he believes lawmakers will have sufficient time to review the budget. He also dismissed the Democratic leaders’ concerns about the schedule, saying he doubts they read every bill during the regular session. 
Last year, lawmakers passed a little over $7.05 billion state budget. Reeves said lawmakers will likely provide around $100 million more in deficit spending for the current fiscal year, putting the total spending for the current fiscal year around $7.15 billion. 
If lawmakers follow through with the agreement legislative leaders reached with Reeves, the governor said the budget for the next fiscal year will be roughly $7.135 billion.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/04190603/Roger-Wicker-11.jpg,,,2025-05-27 17:06:44.944704

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Senate on Tuesday confirmed Gov. Kevin Stitt’s four new appointees to the State Board of Education along with picks for several other state leadership posts.
With no discussion, senators approved the appointments of Mike Tinney, of Norman, Christopher K. Van Denhende, of Tulsa, Ryan A. Deatherage, of Kingfisher, and Becky Y. Carson, of Edmond, to serve on the state board tasked with governing the state’s public school system.
Gov. Kevin Stitt in February removed three prior members from the board and criticized them for creating “needless political drama” following their vote requiring schools to collect students’ immigration status. 
Stitt then named Deatherage, Tinney and Van Denhende to fill the vacancies, saying the board needed fresh eyes. 
State Superintendent Ryan Walters accused Stitt of firing the three former board members for political purposes.
The three booted members had voted in line with Walters since he took office in January 2023.
They approved Walters’ budget requests, which included $3 million to spend on Bibles, along with controversial new rules that would require the student citizenship checks and require teachers to pass a naturalization test in order to be licensed.
During the session, the Republican-controlled Legislature rejected all three proposals.
In April, Stitt appointed Carson, a retired educator, to fill a seat representing Congressional District 5 that has been vacant for two years.
Walters and six members appointed by the governor make up the board.
During the committee vetting process, some Republican senators objected to Stitt’s decision to overhaul the board’s membership. 
Senate Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, carried Tinney’s nomination after his hometown senator, Lisa Standridge, R-Norman, declined to do so. Standridge told some media outlets she was friends with Kendra Wesson, who served on the board before being booted.
In other business, the Senate confirmed John Budd of Oklahoma City to serve as the Department of Commerce CEO.
Richard L. Rose of Oklahoma City was confirmed as Office of Management and Enterprise Services director.
Jeffrey Cartmell of Edmond was approved to serve as Department of Human Services director.
Timothy N. Tardibono of Oklahoma City was confirmed as Office of Juvenile Affairs executive director.

Through subpoenaed witness testimony, recorded phone calls and online messages, the trial revealed private conversations Michelino Sunseri had with peers and the rangers’ deliberations. 
The post Grand Teton trial reveals new details around ultra runner’s shortcut and feds’ decision to charge him appeared first on WyoFile .","JACKSON—The 32-year-old ultra runner cited with a federal misdemeanor for cutting a switchback during his fastest-ever climb of the Grand Teton did not take the witness stand during his trial last week in Jackson federal court. 
Even without Michelino Sunseri’s testimony, however, the proceeding offered new insight into the circumstances leading to the fateful shortcut and the law enforcement decisions that followed. Through subpoenaed witness testimony, clips of recorded phone calls and social media messages obtained by law enforcement, the trial pulled back the curtain on private conversations Sunseri had with peers, the switchback-cutting route’s years-long history of use and the rangers’ decision to issue a citation. 
“It’s not a good look” to be taking the switchback cut for a public record, Jackson native and professional athlete Kelly Halpin said from the stand while clarifying why she urged Sunseri to avoid the shortcut ahead of his attempt. 
Grand Teton National Park Climbing Ranger Michelle Altizer, meanwhile, was asked if the federal misdemeanor citation was prompted by Sunseri’s status as a professional athlete and the online buzz that followed his feat. 
“The amount of people this reached” did factor into the conversation among park staff, she said. “The hope … was to deter this activity from happening again.”
After a day and a half of testimony, the trial concluded without a verdict. Magistrate Judge Stephanie Hambrick opted instead to review the exhibits and arguments before issuing her finding.
Not up for debate is whether or not Sunseri left the park-maintained trail on his scaldingly fast descent of the mountain in favor of a historically used shortcut that saved him roughly a half-mile. He admitted as much shortly after the climb in a log on the speed-tracking website Strava.

Hansen Courthouse on Tuesday during a recess in his federal trial for cutting a switchback in Grand Teton National Park during an attempt last fall at the “Fastest Known Time” for an ascent and descent of the Grand Teton.

At trial, Sunseri’s team set out to establish that the park service didn’t fulfill its obligations required to enforce trail closures and singled him out for a penalty that hadn’t been handed to past speed-record holders who had taken the shortcut. 
Extensive debate about a trail in the lofty Teton Range may appear frivolous. But the case has drawn intense attention in the outdoor-athletics world, and both sides believe much is at stake — from the preservation of a natural park landscape to the ability of public lands visitors to move about with reasonable freedom. At the same time, the case is being used in a national conversation as an example of injustices caused by the proliferation of federal regulations. President Donald Trump criticized such “overcriminalization” in a May 9 executive order.  
Hambrick’s verdict could have implications for future law enforcement and trail norms in the increasingly popular world of elite mountain sports.
The infraction 
On Sept. 2, Sunseri ran and scrambled the 13.2 miles from the Lupine Meadows parking lot to the summit of the 13,775-foot Grand Teton and back with a time of 2:50:50 — a stunning feat that broke a 12-year-old record. 
But he did so by cutting the switchback. He acknowledged his decision in unapologetic terms in a Strava post, which also published a GPS track of his route showing where he cut the trail. Fastest Known Time — the organization that arbitrates and tracks official speed attempts — rejected his submission due to the offense. Not long after, park rangers issued him a citation.
Rangers gave Sunseri a ticket for violating 36CFR2.1(b), which prohibits “leaving a trail or walkway to shortcut between portions of the same trail or adjacent trail in the national park.” The citation comes with a maximum penalty of $5,000 and six months in jail. 
When offered a plea bargain of a misdemeanor conviction, a five-year ban from the national park and a fine, Sunseri opted to challenge the charges. Supporters say the government’s offer was overkill and a park ban is unreasonable for Sunseri, whose livelihood as an athlete depends on his ability to travel there. 
The bench trial opened May 20 in the Clifford P. Hansen Federal Courthouse in Jackson. A small crowd of Sunseri supporters showed up, including his father Edward Sunseri, who traveled from Florida for the event. Many wore hats emblazoned with the words “free Michelino.” They were not allowed to wear those hats in the courtroom, where recording devices and cameras were also barred. 

Supporters of ultra runner Michelino Sunseri have created stickers, T-shirts and music videos under the label #freemichelino to protest what they say is an over-harsh penalty for his switchback-cutting infraction on the Grand Teton.

The old climbers trail 
Over the two days of testimony, the shortcut was carefully examined. 
It’s not merely an untrodden landscape he ventured onto to connect two switchbacks. Instead, the route is a historic trail so well-used that it’s become a skinny singletrack. The National Park Service has installed small signs near the bottom and top of the trail. One says “short cutting causes erosion” and the other says “closed for regrowth.”
The signs make it clear the trail is closed, prosecuting attorney Ariel Calmes argued, and Sunseri’s communications show he traveled it with that knowledge. The defense, meanwhile, set out to show the established nature of the trail is evidence that it’s been commonly used throughout the years and the park service did not do enough to close it. The trail is known as the “old climbers’ trail,” according to the defense, though others said they had never heard that name. 
Prosecutor Calmes’ first witness was Halpin, a professional mountain runner and acquaintance of Sunseri. The attorney focused on Instagram messages between the athletes in the run-up to the speed attempt in which Halpin urged Sunseri not to take the switchback cut.
Halpin didn’t explicitly say the trail is illegal in those messages, but told Calmes that she saw it as a stewardship no-no that the park service doesn’t want users on — a “bad look” especially for professional athletes who set the standard for those to follow.
Sunseri’s team, meanwhile, called several witnesses to recount how they have used the trail dating back decades. Bryce Thatcher, who set a Grand Teton speed record in 1983, said it was recognized back in the day that “the climbers’ trail was what you transitioned to when you got really strong” since it’s steep and grueling. Galen Woelk, another climber who has accomplished hundreds of climbs in the park, said he has seen even park rangers take the old climbers’ trail.
He remembers the signs at the top and bottom, but said, “we never believed the signs informed us it was closed.” Rather, he said, “we always presumed it was there to direct tourists” to take the maintained trail. 
Calmes, however, argued that these old memories are irrelevant to something that occurred more than 20 years later. “I think it’s far too remote in time to be relevant in this case,” she said of Thatcher’s testimony. 

Michelino Sunseri posted his route to the Grand Teton and back on Strava. (screengrab)
Defense attorney Ed Bushnell called to the stand Utah Statewide Trails Program Manager Patrick Parsel, who has worked in trail management his whole career. Parsel had hiked up to view the shortcut the previous day, he told the courtroom. 
If he was advising the park service on effectively closing and revegetating the old climbers’ trail, Parsel said, he would recommend conspicuous signage that contains specific language that it’s closed and illegal — “regulatory rather than educational.”
Bushnell also repeatedly brought up another park trail, Delta Lake, that is popular with hikers but not on the park’s official map, in an attempt to show inconsistent park enforcement. 
Singled out?
After training all last summer, including climbing the peak dozens of times, Sunseri intended to try for the record between Aug. 25 and Sept. 3. It snowed in the high peaks on Aug. 26, narrowing the window. 
Warm temperatures followed, and Sunseri set out the morning of Sept. 2, Labor Day. The holiday is among the busiest days of the year in the park. GTNP Social Scientist Jennifer Newton testified that the day Sunseri climbed was “one of the top five days in trail usage for that trail” in the park’s history.
Sunseri’s achievement created an immediate buzz in the mountain sports world. One of Sunseri’s sponsors, The North Face, posted an announcement to its more than 5 million Instagram followers that he had broken the record.
Ranger Altizer found out from coworkers on Sept. 3 that a new speed record attempt had occurred. Rangers took notice immediately that Sunseri cut the switchback, she testified. 
Sunseri was open about it in his Strava log, which was read aloud during the trial.
“I flew down towards the catwalk, making questionable choices and being absolutely reckless,” Sunseri wrote about his descent. “I was jumping down sections that if I made one mistake or caught one toe, death was surely imminent. I didn’t really care at this point. I wanted this thing so bad, this was literally the only option.”

When he saw a member of his team, Sunseri wrote, “I yelled out ‘1:52:20, we’re cutting the switchbacks!’”
“I made the decision to cut the last switchback and avoid the Congo line [sic] of hikers that would be heading up Lupine Meadows Trailhead,” he wrote. “If I had to make this choice again, I would 100% make the exact same choice.”
If anyone disagreed with him, he continued glibly, they were welcome to try the speed record themselves, talk to former record holders “or fight me, whatever.”
The speed record was “particularly public,” Altizer said. Bushnell asked why she decided to cite Sunseri when others hadn’t received the same punishment. He prodded her about the publicity, and she said the public nature “contributed” to the citation. She and her colleagues felt they would fail at their jobs of stewarding and protecting the landscape if they did not cite him, she said. 
Jenny Lake District Ranger Chris Bellino also took the stand. Bellino contacted Fastest Known Time within a week of Sunseri’s climb to advise them of the violation and encourage them not to acknowledge the record, he testified. 
“We felt that would set a precedent” for future speed attempts, he said of the decision. “Shortcutting is prohibited” in the park regardless of the trail in question, he added. 
“It was pretty egregious and it was pretty public,” Bellino said on a September phone call to Sunseri, parts of which were played for the court.
Sunseri also cut switchbacks higher up on the mountain, Bellino said on the stand. That was reported by a trail crew who reported seeing the athlete knocking rocks down in their general area. The park service considered issuing a further violation for creating a hazardous situation there, he said. 
Good faith or criminal intent?
Sunseri formally offered to resolve the case with a deferred prosecution and community service to close the old climbers’ trail, court documents show, but the prosecutor declined to capitulate on the ban.
Now, fate rests in Judge Hambrick’s hands. It will take some time to weigh the evidence of the important matter, she told the court. 
In her closing argument, Calmes said it’s a question of the facts. The Park Service does not have to place a sign on every corner of every switchback, she said, and park visitors don’t get to substitute their judgment for park management. Further, just because something was done in the past and not cited does not mean it can’t be cited now. 
“This is somebody who made a deliberate decision to make that cut,” Calmes said, calling Sunseri a “power user” of the mountain who had memorized his route.
Bushnell, however, said the court must consider “that unless it’s posted and prohibited, park users are able to travel where they like.”
As for Sunseri? Despite his earlier words that he would “100% make the same decision again,” Sunseri wrote in an Instagram post after the trial concluded, “to be clear and to offer up advice to others- don’t use this trail anymore. 
“Never in my wildest dreams did I foresee such a wild outcome,” he continued, estimating costs of $50,000 of taxpayer money, $10,000 of his own and $30,000 of his lawyer Alex Rienzie’s pro bono time. He also noted that he offered “five separate times” to close the trail at no cost to the NPS.

Someone’s grandparents always seem to remember one, and sometimes you can still find the scuffs and scrapes of shoes and boots on the floors. But where’d those hoedowns go?
Read the story on VTDigger here:  When Vermont barn dances were all the rage.","People dancing in a barn in Louisiana in 1938, as shown in a film negative from Farm Security Administration photographer Russell Lee. Photo courtesy Library of CongressKate Lewton is a reporter with the Community News Service, a University of Vermont journalism internship.Vermont’s barns are generally for cows, but years ago, with a spare Saturday night and a broom, plenty of them played home to a now half-forgotten art — the barn dance. Someone’s grandparents always seem to remember one, and sometimes you can still find the scuffs and scrapes of shoes and boots on the floors. But where’d those hoedowns go? What were they like? And what did they do for small, rural communities?The history of barn dances in Vermont is dynamic with movement itself. Many of the forms throughout local history have been European-inspired, influenced by early French-Canadian, Scottish and English settlers, with modifications throughout modernization. The dances spanned country styles: square, line, contra.Some of the earliest 19th century dance events recorded in Vermont were called kitchen tunks or junkets. First mentioned in 1868 by a St. Albans newspaper, tunks entailed stripping the furniture from a farmhouse kitchen and bringing in a fiddler. Usually they followed a community labor or gathering.Terry Bouricius, who went to Middlebury College in the 1970s, said he’s heard plenty of folklore about those kitchen tunks from his longstanding time in the Vermont dance community.“People would have a dance in the winter,” he said. “You know, it is not harvest season, it’s not planting season — there’s downtime. The joke, and I don’t know if it is true or not, (is that) the fiddle player would stand in the sink so there would be more floor space.”Though he never attended a tunk, Boruicius has gone to his fair share of community dances, especially ones focused on contra dancing — which involves partners in opposite lines, rather than in square formations. The gatherings came a little too late, roughly the mid-’70s onward, to be considered classic barn dances. But they were an offshoot of the old Vermont tradition. Boruicius remembers dawn dances in particular — contra dances held with live music until the sun came up and dancers dropped. “There were dawn dances in the community recreation gym in Brattleboro,” he said. “They would have a whole list of bands lined up, and they would start at like 8 p.m., and they would go till 8 a.m. with live music and people contra dancing all through the night. And occasionally there would be dawn dances in other parts of the state too.”He remembers them as popular events, recalling that people were willing to travel for the hurrah.  “I lived in Charlotte at the time, and we would get a carload of people, and we’d drive, you know, 2 ½ hours to get to go dance till dawn and then take turns driving back ’cause we were all too sleepy to drive the whole way back,” he said. “I did that probably 10 times over the years.”Barn dances played in small corners of communities for decades. By local accounts they appeared most popular in the 1930s-50s but remained a staple up into the 1970s and 1980s. Initially inspired by the western music of Nashville, many families operated small-scale bands that would travel around the state playing events, becoming something of local celebrities. Daniel Cole, president of the Charlotte Historical Society, remembers how many people enjoyed the music of his father, Al Cole, when his swing band would play barn dances — and the dust they kicked up. Front row: Bernie Gelineau; Al Cole; Cliff Cole; Andy Butler, standing; back row; Harmon Sheltra on drums; unknown with upright bass; Earl Hedges on piano.

You just remember that when (it would) be kind of dusty because of hay and things in the barns, they would water the floor to keep the dust down.”Local stardom wasn’t the only allure for the performers, as they would take home $8 a night, pretty good for local standards considering that was nearing almost a day’s work pay for some in 1950. But from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m., they were expected to play no matter the situation, said Cole. Cold didn’t count.“They would set up in a corner, and it was unheated. So if it was cold outside, it was cold inside, and they had what were called milkhouse heaters that they would place in front of the bandstand to try to keep them warm so they could play,” he said.Cole’s father was a regular player at the Hen House in Underhill in the 1940s and ’50s. His music brought people together.Jean Tarazewich is of a younger generation than Al Cole and a New Jersey native who relocated to Johnson in the 1970s. The culture shock was one of her first challenges.“Everything closes at 5 o’clock at night, you know what I mean? It’s like, ‘Oh, my God. There’s like — the nearest McDonald’s is 50 miles away. The nearest traffic light was 50 miles away,’” she said.She remembers asking a local boy about the happenings. There had to be something for young people.“There was nothing. I remember asking him when I got up here, ‘What do you guys do for fun? You know, in Vermont?’ And he’s like, ‘Well, you know, we get in the car, and we drink beer, and we ride around, and we go to the quarry,’ and it’s like, ‘Oh, gee, you know, my life is over.’”But soon she’d meet a friend in school whose family hosted a weekly barn dance in Westfield.“They would drive their bus from Jeffersonville with their band, and they would pick anybody that wanted to go to the barn dance on the way,” she said. “All you had to do is stand by the side of the road, and they’d pick you up. They didn’t charge you anything.”The dances were really for all ages, she said. Teens like her could raise hell while parents swaddled babies.“Remember the Neil Diamond song? You know, ‘Pack up the babies and grab the old ladies, and everyone goes.’ It was called ‘Brother Love’s Traveling (Salvation) Show.’ A preacher would come to town, and they’d set a tent up, but barn dances were like that. Pack up the babies and grab the old ladies, and everyone goes.”That spirit helped create families and friendships in small towns across counties. You could meet your best friend’s uncle’s little brother’s wife at a barn dance, or something like that.“There’s a bunch of people in the world, like my sister’s four kids, that wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for that night at that barn dance,” Tarazewich said. “That’s how you did it back then,” she added. “Because how else would two girls from Johnson, Vermont, meet two guys from Orleans?”A barn in St. Albans with three silos, as photographed in 2017 by Carol Highsmith. Photo courtesy Library of CongressKathleen Meeks lives in Wardsboro on property with a barn her father built in 1947. It served the practical purpose of a place for milking, but the upstairs was for music and dances. Her family ran barn dances when she was a little girl and later in the 1970s and ’80s with the children as adults, known together as the Bills Band. It was her younger years when the barn dances felt especially meaningful and freeing. “When we had the farm, you didn’t go and hang out with your friends or anything ’cause we had work that we had to do, and we weren’t allowed to go hang down in the village with some of the other kids that could just be down there raising the devil,” Meeks said, remembering young people rolling up cigarette packs in their shirtsleeves and racing cars. “We had to stay here and work. So to get to go off to a dance was pretty special.”The same went for older folks, many of whom were farmers who rarely got leisure time.Her wild times look different now, but Meeks keeps those memories close.“I’m 77 now, so I don’t know how much dancing I would do, but I just loved the sound,” she said. “I love the smell. I love, you know, listening to people just laugh and have such a fun time. It was really great.”So why did they stop? Entertainment options have skyrocketed with new developments since the heyday of the dances. People interviewed also wonder whether a greater awareness of liabilities — like underage drinking, fire safety, equipment rentals — have contributed to the decline.In some ways, the shows haven’t ended. Barn dances have become more folklore than fact in modern times, but they’ve been on something of a resurgence. The Current in Stowe, the Martha Canfield Library in Arlington and Bread & Butter Farm in Shelburne all hosted barn dances last fall. They have been the backdrop for benefits and fundraisers throughout the state. Singer Rik Palieri has put on the Great Vermont Barn Dance Show in Williston and Hinesburg for a number of years, which has found much success. Many families still host private parties in their barns. More commonly what’s survived has been the culture inside the historic events if not their venues. Contra-, square- and line-dancing clubs and events are still happening in various capacities throughout the state. In Montpelier, Contra Dancing is alive and well at the Capital City Grange, where dances are held on three Saturdays a month. Queen City Contra Dancing offers events about each Friday at the Shelburne Town Hall. In Guilford, the BroadBrook Community Center hosts a contra dance on the second Sunday of every month with live music and calling. Dance or not, those barns still exist, some better kept than others. And the stories inside them don’t disappear — even for the red one slanting into the river and peeling its paint.Read the story on VTDigger here:  When Vermont barn dances were all the rage.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/barn-dance-fsa.jpg,,,2025-05-27 17:06:44.944704

(Photo courtesy of Clark County Department of Aviation)After more than two decades of delays federal officials are starting an environmental review for Clark County’s long-anticipated second commercial airport.
Local and federal officials have long sought to build a new airport on 6,000 acres in the Ivanpah Valley north of Primm, arguing the Harry Reid International Airport will not be able to keep up with projected demand for air travel without the supplemental airport.
The Federal Aviation Administration and the Bureau of Land Management issued a notice of intent last week to prepare an environmental impact statement, starting the formal review for the proposed Southern Nevada Supplemental Airport (SNSA).
Rosemary Vassiliadis, the director of aviation for Clark County, called the announcement a major milestone for the region.
“This important step brings us closer to addressing the increasing demand for air travel in one of the nation’s fastest growing regions,” Vassiliadis said in a statement last week.
“As a second commercial airport, SNSA will add much-needed capacity, improve service reliability, and ensure Southern Nevada continues to thrive as a global destination for business and tourism,” she continued.
The Harry Reid International Airport will reach its full capacity of 63 million to 65 million passengers annually by 2030, according to the Clark County Department of Aviation estimates
The Clark County Department of Aviation said the Ivanpah airport would provide long-term aviation capacity for the Las Vegas metropolitan area and primarily serve charter, long-haul domestic and international flights.
The supplemental airport was first proposed in 2006 by the Clark County Department of Aviation, but local economic conditions following the Great Recession and other local budgetary constraints stalled the project for decades. In 2010 the Clark County Department of Aviation asked the FAA to suspend any work on the environmental review.
Earlier this year, county officials confirmed that the environmental review process would resume for the future airport, which would include two runways and a terminal building in the Ivanpah Valley.
Congress transferred public land to Clark County for the construction of the airport site in 2000 through the Ivanpah Valley Airport Public Lands Transfer Act.
The new airport site would cover an area of 6,000 acres, 2,000 acres for flood mitigation infrastructure, and an additional 17,000 acres of land that are set aside as a noise compatibility buffer, making the new airport site over 25,000 acres.
State officials have suggested the new airport could lead to further development in Clark County. In 2023, state lawmakers unanimously approved Senate Bill 19 which would allow Clark County to put aside at least 5,000 acres for a new commercial and residential development in the vicinity of the new airport.
Conservation groups have long opposed the development of the airport, saying its development could threaten two endangered species in the area, the desert tortoise and the white-margined penstemon – a small pink bell-shaped flower fixed on long hardy stems with waved oblong leaves.
The rare wildflower only grows in four counties across the Mojave Desert: Clark County, Nye County, San Bernardino County in California, and Mohave County in Arizona.
Patrick Donnelly, the Great Basin director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said the conservation group would follow the environmental review process “to ensure that sensitive biological resources are not unduly harmed by the airport, and that appropriate mitigation measures are implemented.”
“Just because Congress gave the land to Clark County, doesn’t mean the airport is pre-approved. Laws like the Endangered Species Act mandate the strictest of protections,” Donnelly said.
The Federal Aviation Administration and the Bureau of Land Management plan to hold three public scoping meetings this July to gather testimony about the environmental impact of a new airport, starting with a virtual meeting on July 29.
Two in-person meetings will be held in July, the first will be held on July 30 at the East Las Vegas Library, and the second will be on July 31 at Primm Valley Casino Resorts.

Ned Lamont to veto a bill that would give the legislature power over the hiring of SEEC's executive director.,"Jeffrey Garfield, who repeatedly fought to preserve the resources and independence of the State Elections Enforcement Commission over three decades as its leader, urged Gov. Ned Lamont on Tuesday to veto a bill that would give the legislature veto power over the hiring of its executive director. 
“Sadly, the commission’s independence is again under attack,” said Garfield, a featured speaker at an awkwardly timed celebration of the agency’s founding a half-century ago. “We must continue to fight for the agency’s independence, its funding and its future.”
Under a deal struck by the Democratic and Republican leaders of the Senate and House, the elections commission bill criticized by Garfield sped through the Senate and House with little debate last week, despite opposition from Common Cause, the League of Women Voters and the Connecticut Citizen Action Group.
[RELATED: CT bill limiting elections watchdog independence gets full passage]
Garfield and those groups objected to a section of Senate Bill 1405 that would make the five-member bipartisan commission’s selection of an executive director subject to three layers of legislative review and votes: By the legislature’s Executive and Legislative Nominations Committee, the House and Senate.
A ceremony at the state Capitol marked two anniversaries: SEEC was created 50 years ago as an elections watchdog after the Watergate scandal forced the resignation of Richard Nixon; and the Citizens’ Election Program, created after a Connecticut governor, John G. Rowland, went to prison, is turning 20.
Connecticut’s elections enforcement commission and the CEP, which has changed the political culture in the General Assembly by minimizing the ability of lobbyists and other interests to finance campaigns, are good government reforms emulated by other states, said Stephen Penny, the commission’s chair. 
“That said, based on what happened at the legislature last week, apparently not everyone has appreciated that success,” Penny said.
The Senate voted 34-1 for passage, but slightly more than half of the 91 House Democrats present last week voted against the measure, a noisy gesture heard in the governor’s office. The bill is now on the governor’s radar, and his signature is not assured.
“While we have some concerns around SB 1405, the governor hasn’t made a decision as to whether he will sign. We will review the bill more closely when it reaches his desk,” said Rob Blanchard, a spokesman.
The House vote was 92 to 46, with every Republican in favor. The opposition was generated by the provision ending the commission’s independence in hiring its leader, said Rep. Lucy Dathan, D-New Canaan, who presented the bill during the brief debate.
House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, and House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, were willing to strike the provision, but the Senate leaders were adamant it remain in the bill, according the House leaders.
The Citizens’ Election Program created a voluntary system of publicly financed campaigns for the General Assembly and six statewide constitutional offices: governor, lieutenant governor, secretary of the state, comptroller, treasurer and attorney general general.
At the ceremony, former House Speaker Chris Donovan, D-Meriden, said legislators overcame an initial wariness about taking away a major advantage of incumbency: The ability to raise money in Hartford, often relying on lobbyists to facilitate contributions from clients.
Thirty-two of the 36 senators and 143 of the 151 House members participated in the voluntary program, which enforced strict spending limits in return for public financing.
Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz, a former House member and secretary of the state, recalled being told during her first campaign she needed to have a fundraiser directed at lobbyists, preferably at the convenient venue of the Officers’ Club next to the Legislative Office Building.
“I found out that lobbyists contributed to everyone’s campaign — Democrats, Republicans — and business was done based on who gave to them,” Bysiewicz said. “And so that has all changed because of the Citizens’ Election Program, and this program has become a model for the rest of the country.”
A popular practice before it was outlawed at Garfield’s urging was to time fundraisers to the final meetings of legislative committees, when bills would die or get reported to the floors of the House or Senate.
In the audience Tuesday were the sons of two women instrumental to the passage of the CEP: Karen Hobert Flynn, the Common Cause leader who died in 2023, and former Gov. M. Jodi Rell, who died this year. Rell had called the legislature into special session in 2005 when it failed to pass a reform bill in regular session.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_7580-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-27 17:06:44.944704

(Screenshot/Capitol TV)Rhode Island’s three-pronged state utility panel is back to full power, with the Rhode Island Senate unanimously voting to confirm Karen Bradbury to the open seat on the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission.
The chamber’s 30-0 vote Tuesday fills the vacancy left by former commissioner John Revens, who resigned in December, midway through his six-year term. Supporters of Bradbury touted her experience in state and federal government and renewable energy as qualifications for her appointment. Bradbury most recently served as program administrator for Rhode Island’s Office of Energy Resources, overseeing the rollout of federally funded tax credits and incentives to help homeowners and small business owners pay for high-efficiency electric heat pumps, among other renewable energy programs. Much of her 20-year policy career was spent working under U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, where she left as projects director in December 2022.
“She is committed to finding solutions that provide Rhode Islanders with clean and affordable energy,” Sen. Robert Britto, an East Providence Democrat, chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, said of Bradbury. “Her track record makes her an excellent selection to serve on the PUC.”
Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski, a South Kingstown Democrat, also gave high praise to Bradbury.
“We are so fortunate to have someone with her expertise and her knowledge, and not only that, she’s great to work with,’ Sosnowski said.
Bradbury did not address the chamber, but waved in response to standing applause after the vote. She was accompanied by her husband, Patrick Crowley, the president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO.
McKee’s administration previously defended against inquiries about whether Bradbury’s appointment was related to her husband’s influential role with a major labor union, instead focusing on Bradbury’s own qualifications for the job.
Bradbury’s high-profile appointment to the regulatory body carries extra weight amid rising frustration over utility costs and profits reported by Rhode Island Energy. Addressing lawmakers during a May 20 panel hearing, Bradbury pledged to protect families and businesses grappling with soaring utility bills while also advancing the state’s renewable energy mandates, which are one of several costs contributing to monthly utility bills.
The utilities commission by law cannot reject the state utility provider’s proposed supply-side prices, as long as they do not include an extra markup beyond what it costs to purchase power directly from third-party suppliers. However, the commission has more authority over service-side charges and has scaled back Rhode Island Energy’s proposed investments in capital infrastructure projects in acknowledgement of the extra costs to customers.
Bradbury will serve out the rest of Revens’ term, which ends on March 1, 2027.

(Photo Courtesy of Becket)The U.S. Supreme Court denied a review of Apache Stronghold’s case aimed at blocking the U.S. government’s transfer of Oak Flat to a copper mining company, whose mine will transform the sacred site into a massive crater.
The decision comes after Apache Stronghold initially asked the U.S. District Court in Phoenix on May 7 to temporarily block the Trump administration from pushing ahead with the land swap that would hand over Oak Flat to Resolution Copper.
The Trump administration plans to reissue a final environmental impact statement regarding Oak Flat and transfer the land to Resolution Copper as early as June 16, according to court documents.



An Arizona federal judge granted a temporary injunction on May 9, delaying the land transfer as the case awaited review by the Supreme Court.
Apache Stronghold v. United States has been awaiting a hearing in the Supreme Court since the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2024 that the land transfer is not subject to federal laws protecting religious freedom.
The Supreme Court’s decision on May 27 removes any obstacles to halting the land transfer from occurring.
“Apache Stronghold asks us to review the Ninth Circuit’s extraordinary conclusion,” the dissent states. “But the Court today turns aside the group’s request.”
Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, wrote in the dissenting opinion that the court’s decision is a “grave mistake” because the case meets all of the standards the court typically applies when evaluating petitions for review.
“Before allowing the government to destroy the Apaches’ sacred site, this Court should at least have troubled itself to hear their case,” Gorsuch wrote.
He added that, while the court “enjoys the power to choose” which cases they will hear, the decision to shuffle this case off their docket is a mistake and “one with consequences that threaten to reverberate for generations.”
Gorsuch said that he has no doubt the court would find the case worth its time.
“Faced with the government’s plan to destroy an ancient site of tribal worship, we owe the Apaches no less,” he wrote. “They may live far from Washington, D.C., and their history and religious practices may be unfamiliar to many. But that should make no difference.”
Becket, a nonprofit institution that advocates for freedom of religion that is representing Apache Stronghold, said that the Supreme Court’s action means Oak Flat will be destroyed by a Chinese-owned mining giant. But, the group said, they will continue to fight in court to stop the government from transferring Oak Flat to Resolution Copper.
“We will never stop fighting—nothing will deter us from protecting Oak Flat from destruction,” Dr. Wendsler Nosie Sr. of Apache Stronghold said in a press release.
“While this decision is a heavy blow, our struggle is far from over,” he added. “We urge Congress to take decisive action to stop this injustice while we press forward in the courts.”
Resolution Copper General Manager Vickey Peacey said they are pleased at the ruling because the Resolution Copper mine is “vital to securing America’s energy future, infrastructure needs, and national defense with a domestic supply of copper and other critical minerals.”
“We are encouraged by the significant community support for the project,” she said, because the mine has the potential to become “one of the largest copper mines in America.”
Peacey said Resolution Copper has had more than a decade of “extensive consultation and collaboration” with Native American tribes and local communities, which has resulted in changes to their mining plan with the hope of preserving and reducing potential impacts.
The courtroom battle for Oak Flat, or Chi’chil Biłdagoteel as the Apache people know it, has been ongoing since 2021, with the grassroots group Apache Stronghold leading the effort.
Since time immemorial, Western Apaches and other Indigenous peoples in the Southwest have gathered at Oak Flat, near Superior, for sacred religious ceremonies that cannot occur anywhere else.
Oak Flat is listed in the National Register of Historic Places as a Western Apache Traditional Cultural Property and National Historic District.
Oak Flat has been protected from mining and other harmful practices for decades, according to Becket. However, those protections faced challenges in December 2014 when a last-minute provision was inserted into a must-pass defense bill, authorizing the transfer of Oak Flat to Resolution Copper.
Resolution Copper plans to turn the sacred site into a two-mile-wide and 1,100-foot-deep crater.
“It is hard to imagine a more brazen attack on faith than blasting the birthplace of Apache religion into a gaping crater,” Luke Goodrich, vice president and senior counsel at Becket, said in a written statement.
“The Court’s refusal to halt the destruction is a tragic departure from its strong record of defending religious freedom,” Goodrich said. “We will do everything in our power to ensure that the Apaches can continue worshiping at Oak Flat as they have for generations.”

SPRINGFIELD — Illinois police officers soon could be required to undergo trauma-informed sexual assault training if the governor signs a bill passed by Illinois lawmakers last week.
Senate Bill 1195, dubbed Anna’s Law, mandates police officers take part in trauma-informed programs, procedures and practices that are intended to “minimize traumatization of the victim” before being sworn in as an officer.
The bill passed the House and Senate unanimously and now awaits approval from the governor to become law.
Currently, Illinois law enforcement officials must undergo a variety of training programs before being sworn in – including training that provides education on “cultural perception and common myths of sexual assault and sexual abuse.”
Anna’s Law would mandate that training on the issue of sexual assault and abuse and teach officers how to identity and address conflicts of interest, such as when an officer knows the victims or the perpetrator.
Illinois police officers are also currently required to repeat some trainings every three years for recertification – including training on child abuse and neglect, autism-informed responses and cultural competency. Anna’s Law would also mandate police officers complete the same trauma-informed sexual assault training every three years.
“This wasn't about shaking or pointing fingers,” the bill sponsor, Sen. Mary Edly-Allen, D-Naperville, told Capitol News Illinois. “It was just, how can we do better?”
Anna’s Law is named after 22-year-old Illinois resident Anna Williams, who brought the issue of police insensitivity to victims of sexual assault to state lawmakers after her experience with law enforcement officials in 2021.
Williams said after she was sexually assaulted in 2021, she met with the police officer assigned to her case as she was being examined at the hospital. When Williams told the officer the name of her perpetrator, she said his response was, “Oh, I know him. He’s a great guy.”
Williams said she requested a different officer for her case multiple times, a request which was never granted, and that the officer repeatedly asked whether she was “sure” that the assault “wasn’t consensual” on multiple occasions.
“I gave him like a list of people who I told (about the assault),” Williams said. “When he called them, he asked everyone if I cried when I told them and was just being very invalidating and discrediting the whole time and asked them, like, if they believed what I said.”
Williams said after prosecutors repeatedly declined to bring charges against her perpetrator, she requested to see a record of the statements she made to the officer through the Freedom of Information Act. When reviewing the records, Williams said the officer’s record of her statements was incorrect.
“In my statements, it was written that I said that everything was consensual when I never said that,” she said. “And when I brought it up, it was just kind of brushed off. I was never expecting that it would be so challenging with law enforcement on the situation until it happened.”
After passing the Senate unanimously in early April, the bill was sponsored in the House by Republican lawmaker Rep. Jackie Haas, R- Kankakee.
“Personally, for myself, it’s helped me to find closure in everything,” Williams said of the bill’s passage. “It’s let me feel kind of like I still have a voice, I still have power and I can still use that to help people.”
Creation of Anna’s Law
The formation of Anna’s Law started as a school project for Williams, who said she never originally imagined the bill might one day become law.
After the assault, Williams joined the National Society of Leadership and Success at Northern Illinois University, where she was enrolled as an undergraduate student. To be inducted into the program, she said members were asked to complete a project that required them to take action on an issue they were passionate about.
“I was talking to my mom and I was explaining how, like, I can’t just make a law and she said ‘yes you can,’” Williams said. “And I said no, there’s no way, I’m just a normal little person. And she was like no, anyone can make a law, you can do that.”
After that conversation, Williams said she created a draft of potential bill language and compiled a list of all state laws regarding sexual assault that “didn’t sit right” with her. She then brought the information to state lawmakers during a town hall meeting held by then-Sen. Ann Gillespie, D-Arlington Heights, in 2023.
“I went to the meeting and kind of explained hey, this is what I want to do, is this something you can take and do whatever you have to do with it?” Williams said. “So that’s what started the law.”
In early April, Williams sat beside Sen. Edly-Allen during a hearing in the Senate Criminal Law Committee and testified to lawmakers. Williams said she did not expect the committee hearing to be as “scary” as it was, but that providing her testimony was empowering and solidified her belief that she was doing “the right thing.""
“It’s kind of unreal to me that it’s gone so far and the thing that I’m most excited about is how it’s going to help other people,” she said. “Hopefully, it helps them to come forward and actually report their assault to law enforcement without being afraid of being invalidated or blamed or just going through the whole re-traumatization.”
In late April, U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky filed House Resolution 3121, or Anna’s Law, in the U.S. House for the second year in a row. That version of the federal legislation has many more requirements for national law enforcement officials and currently awaits further action.

The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.
In Maine — where the typical home value jumped from $236,000 in April 2019 to$412,000 in April 2025 — less than a quarter of homes (22.8%) are affordable for middle income households, according to the report.

Balanced markets
Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
Help for teachers
Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

(Courtesy of IDOC)This story originally published May 27 on Idaho Reports. 
The Idaho Department of Correction has put a pause on all state executions as of May 23 to complete renovations of the death row facility at the Idaho State Maximum Security Institution.
The unit, known as F-Block, houses the existing facility for lethal injection executions. The pause is needed to allow renovation of the facility to make the firing squad the primary form of execution by July 1, 2026, according to an IDOC news release.
Idaho will be only state with firing squad as main execution method, after governor signs bill

The state had the firing squad as a secondary method until the Legislature passed House Bill 37 this year. Under the new law, Idaho would be the only state in the nation to use the firing squad as its primary method of execution.
“The current estimated time frame to complete this retrofit is approximately 6 to 9 months,” according to the news release. “Following completion of the remodel, the execution team will need time to conduct training to be ready to carry out an execution by firing squad beginning July 2026. The Department is confident it will meet the required timelines and will do so on budget.”
IDOC already would have had to pause lethal injection executions after U.S. District Judge Debora Grasham ordered the department in April to provide audio and visual access for media witnesses during any executions. That decision comes as a First Amendment lawsuit from a coalition of news organizations moves forward in court, according to the AP.
The Associated Press, The Idaho Statesman and East Idaho News sued the state’s prison director in December, arguing that key steps of the lethal injection process were being unconstitutionally hidden from public view.

“I will be the future governor of the great state of Alabama,” Tuberville said from Byron’s Smokehouse in Auburn. “I’ve still got 18 months to go with President Trump to make America great again. We’ve got a lot of work to do.”
The campaign website says Tuberville is running on “fighting back against woke ideology,” growing Alabama jobs, improving education and securing the border, among other platforms.

“We’re going to make education better again, and we’re going to do everything possible to make sure our kids, when they graduate in this great state, the yellow hammer state, that they stay in this state and work,” he said.
Tuberville, a first-term U.S. senator who owns a beach home in Walton County, Florida, has faced questions throughout the years about his residency in Alabama. Alabama Daily News reported in April that his Auburn home has had a homestead exemption since 2018. Until recently, the property was under his wife and son’s name, according to ADN.
“My wife and I, Suzanne, moved here over 25 years ago. As you know, I coached, and it was a great time. We made some great friends,” he said. “So a few years ago, I decided to give back to this great country.”
Tuberville announced his campaign after weeks of dodging the question from multiple outlets. He changed his social media to “Coach for Governor” prior to the appearance on Fox News. 
The first-term senator and former Auburn University football coach was endorsed by President Donald Trump in his 2020 campaign for U.S. senator. Tuberville defeated incumbent U.S. Sen. Doug Jones, a Democrat, after a general election campaign where he limited most interviews and appearances to friendly conservative media outlets.   
His campaign for governor leaves that seat open for the 2026 midterm elections.
Tuberville is the first declared Republican candidate in the contest. Current Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth was expected to run after Gov. Kay Ivey’s term ends, but he announced last week that he would not campaign for the state’s highest office to spend time with his family. Agriculture and Industries Commissioner Rick Pate told al.com that he abandoned thoughts of running for governor after the rumors of Tuberville’s candidacy began. 
Gov. Kay Ivey, who has served in the office since 2017, is term-limited. A message seeking comment from Ivey was sent Tuesday afternoon.
The primary is set for May 19, 2026, and the general election is set for Nov. 3, 2026.

Brattleboro Memorial Hospital wants to offset reductions in government payments before the end of its fiscal year Sept. 30.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Brattleboro hospital eyes $4M in cuts, new revenue to balance budget.","The Brattleboro Memorial Hospital campus on Belmont Avenue. Photo by Kevin O’Connor/VTDiggerBRATTLEBORO — Brattleboro Memorial Hospital is seeking $4 million in expense reductions and new revenue in the next four months to balance its $119 million annual budget.“Like rural hospitals here in Vermont and across the nation, BMH faces significant financial challenges that have been imposed on us in large measure by both the state and federal governments,” President Christopher Dougherty wrote to the hospital’s 150 community corporators in an email over the Memorial Day weekend.The hospital is exploring 40 “strategies” to save or earn money between now and the end of its fiscal year on Sept. 30, Dougherty said Tuesday. The list ranges from drawing more revenue through services such as a new MRI machine to reducing expenses through a hiring freeze that began April 1.Laying off some of the hospital’s 520 staffers would be a last resort, Dougherty said.“It is absolutely a possibility, but it is at the end of the line of things that we would pursue,” he said of personnel cuts at one of Brattleboro’s three largest employers.The hospital received budget approval from the state’s Green Mountain Care Board last fall, only to now see diminishing results from the $600,000 a month it pays in Vermont health care provider taxes to help finance Medicaid expenditures for people with limited incomes. “While part of that money comes back to us to help offset uncompensated care, the state recently reduced the percentage of annual return to less than 10 percent,” Dougherty wrote in his email.The hospital president said reimbursements for professional services from the 65-and-up Medicare insurance program have declined by almost 3% annually. He also noted the state rejected a request for a 4.7% increase in its commercial insurance rate.Last fall, the Green Mountain Care Board, a key statewide health care regulator, required 10 out of Vermont’s 14 hospitals to reduce their requested increases in commercial rates to 3.4% or less.READ MORE
In its decision on the Brattleboro request, the board wrote that “the commercial market in Vermont cannot afford the current cost of care,” saying “for commercial rate increases to slow, our statewide health system needs to curb spending.” The board repeated a similar argument in decisions for other hospitals. In particular, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, which covers roughly one-third of all Vermonters, is facing financial difficulties due to the increasing cost of care.The board added that Brattleboro’s low Medicare payment-to-cost ratio, clinical productivity data and higher-than-average wait times “indicate system inefficiencies.”“It is appropriate for the hospital to focus on managing expenses and reducing inefficiencies to obtain a positive margin,” the board’s decision read. The hospital is now working on a “robust combination of expense reductions and revenue generating tactics,” Dougherty wrote before ending his email with a link to “donate now.”Brattleboro is just one of many hospitals in Vermont wrestling with what the Green Mountain Care Board has called “a health care affordability crisis.”“It’s estimated that as many as 753 small rural hospitals like us are at risk of closing across the United States,” Dougherty said Tuesday. “I hate to say we’re one of those 753, but we’re not going to let that happen.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Brattleboro hospital eyes $4M in cuts, new revenue to balance budget.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/VTD-Bratt-hospital-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-27 17:06:44.944704

Correctionville Specialty Care, where a worker allegedly raped a resident in October 2023, has been added to the federal list of Special-Focus Facilities.
For most of the past 17 years, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has published the monthly, national list of nursing homes that have experienced a serious recurrence of major regulatory violations related to quality of care.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
At any given time, no more than two nursing homes per state appear on the list of federally designated “Special-Focus Facilities,” although the federal list also includes hundreds of other nursing homes whose quality-of-care violations have made them eligible for that status.
Once a home is designated a Special-Focus Facility, it receives additional oversight and assistance from the government that’s intended to improve resident care. The other homes that are deemed eligible do not receive that assistance, and many appear on the list and then drop off without ever receiving the federal help.
The two Iowa care facilities currently designated Special-Focus Facilities are Arbor Court in Mount Pleasant, which has been in the program for more than two full years, and Aspire of Gowrie, which has been in the program for a year and a half.
Because those facilities have failed to graduate from the program though improved care, the only changes to Iowa’s list of special-focus facilities during the past 19 months has been among the 10 facilities whose quality-of-care issues make them eligible for special-focus status.
This month, the Aspire of Perry home was replaced on the eligibility list with Correctionville Specialty Care, which had appeared on the eligibility list for a full year before it was dropped from the list in March 2025.










We are short-staffed, That’s the reason why baths aren’t being done.


– Correctionville Specialty Care worker to state inspector


Since January 2022, the Correctionville home has been cited for 93 state and federal regulatory violations, including resident abuse and insufficient nursing staff.
In October 2023, a female resident of the home who was not cognitively impaired alleged a worker at the home had raped her in his car and had sent her a video of himself masturbating. The woman provided authorities with a copy of the video.
After the woman reported the alleged rape, officials at Correctionville Specialty Care evicted the woman from the facility and dropped her off at a homeless shelter, according to state inspectors.
Although the accused worker was fired from the Correctionville home, state inspectors alleged the home’s parent company, Care Initiatives of West Des Moines, continued to provide work for him in other Iowa nursing homes that it operates.
No criminal charges were filed in the case, but the worker was later convicted of a sexual exploitation charge related to his employment in another Iowa nursing home.
During a February 2025 visit to the Correctionville home, state inspectors reported that multiple employees said the facility was so short-staffed residents’ call lights weren’t being answered in a timely fashion and the residents weren’t getting baths or showers.
Workers said the home typically scheduled only two nurse aides to work the overnight shift and provide care for 32 residents.
“We are short-staffed,” one aide reportedly told inspectors. “That’s the reason why baths aren’t being done. We do other grooming at the same time, like nails, so that doesn’t get done, either. With all the new residents, it has been impossible.”
One aide and one registered nurse each reported they would falsely write in medical records that residents had “refused” a bath when, in fact, the residents had never been offered one. They allegedly told inspectors they did so at the direction of the home’s former director of nursing.
The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing cited the home for violations related to staffing and quality of care, but no fines or penalties were imposed.
The nine Iowa homes that continue to be considered eligible for special-focus status are Accura Healthcare of Pleasantville; Clarion Wellness and Rehabilitation Center; Harvest Acres Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Keota; Garden View Care Center in Shenandoah; Greater Southside Health and Rehabilitation in Des Moines; Harmony West in West Des Moines; The Ivy in Davenport;  Pine Acres Rehabilitation and Care Center in West Des Moines; and Via of Des Moines.
Of those nine facilities, the home that have spent the most time on the eligibility list are Greater Southside Health and Rehabilitation at 33 months, and The Ivy at 19 months.

(Sophie Nieto-Muñoz | New Jersey Monitor)A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s effort to freeze federal funds to New York over its congestion pricing program Tuesday.
Judge Lewis Liman’s temporary restraining order prevents the federal government from withholding — until at least June 9 — federal transportation funds from New York because of the city’s congestion pricing tolls. The order also bars federal authorities from moving to rescind approvals for congestion pricing or otherwise terminate the program until that date.
U.S. Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy in February moved to rescind approvals awarded to congestion pricing, saying that the program had exceeded the authority granted under a congressionally created program and that its rates were set to meet Metropolitan Transportation Authority revenue targets rather than to reduce congestion in Manhattan.
The MTA promptly sued Duffy, his department, and other federal regulators, alleging the secretary lacks the authority to unilaterally rescind federal approvals for congestion pricing, which charges $9 for cars crossing into the tolling zone, with far steeper rates for heavier vehicles.
Congestion pricing tolls are set to rise to $12 per crossing in 2028 and $15 per crossing in 2031. They are charged on top of tolls levied by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. During peak hours, car drivers with an E-ZPass pay $16.06 to enter New York through one of the Port Authority’s crossings.
There is a separate federal lawsuit filed by New Jersey that is also seeking to end congestion pricing. It remains ongoing.

A May 12 notice from the library, located in Jamestown Township, indicated that it would close briefly as it worked to rehire new staff. The library has since posted a message to its website welcoming patrons back to the location and notifying the community that they were open.
A member of the library’s staff confirmed with Michigan Advance that they had closed temporarily due to the staff resignations but could not provide comment as to why they resigned. 
One of the staff members who resigned spoke with MLive and said staff had felt like they were being micro-managed by board members.
A message seeking comments from the library board’s president and vice president was not returned at the time of publication.
The library was defunded in 2022 after voters opted to erase the location’s millage funding, which activists viewed not only as an attack against LGBTQ+ library materials and books, but also an assault on personal liberties.
Voters, however, approved a new millage in 2023 to keep the library up and running.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Education Department hopes to once again ask lawmakers to remove a specific student learning requirement from the state’s teacher evaluation rules.
The legislative committee responsible for reviewing administrative rule changes rejected a similar attempt last year. The revision would remove a requirement that teacher performance evaluations include “student learning objectives,” which are student educational growth goals. The objectives are set by the teacher and school administration.
Department Secretary Joe Graves told the state Board of Education Standards at its Tuesday meeting that lawmakers rejected last year’s proposal because “they didn’t believe it was right to remove a portion of the overall evaluation that specifically addressed student growth.”
The evaluation as a whole still focuses on student growth, Graves added, and student growth is monitored outside of teacher evaluations, such as in standardized testing. The specific student growth piece of the evaluation has become “increasingly trite and meaningless,” Graves said.
“If I’m going to put a student learning objective in my evaluation, then I better find one that I’m pretty sure I can meet,” Graves said, adding that the standards weren’t “having the desired impact.”

The board voted to move ahead with a public hearing at its next meeting on July 7. Board President Steve Perkins, of Sioux Falls, was the sole vote against it, saying he’d like “to see another option presented” to the board and more time to study the issue.
If passed onto the legislative Interim Rules Review Committee and approved, school districts would still be able to implement student learning objectives in teacher evaluations if they want. It just won’t be a state requirement.
Tea Area School District Superintendent Jennifer Lowrey, who will serve the Harrisburg School District starting in July, told the board that setting and tracking student learning objectives was “time consuming” and “very rigorous” for teachers in her district.
When first implemented over a decade ago, teachers feared they’d lose their jobs if students didn’t meet their growth needs, Lowery said. Many factors influencing a child’s ability to learn are outside a teacher’s control, she added.
Board member Phyllis Heineman said however the board moves forward, evaluations should retain “a strong student growth component.”
“I think we just need to be convinced,” Heineman said, “and help legislators be convinced that it’s still within that teacher evaluation – that there is some way that we’re connecting it to student growth.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/591A1405e-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-27 17:06:44.944704

Michael Rodrigues, was unavailable for an interview Tuesday. Fitzgerald said those additional funding requests remain in play.“Today Senate Ways and Means reported out an in-part supplemental budget that only includes critical deficiency funding for EEC childcare financial assistance programs,” Fitzgerald said in a statement. “These two items have imminent runout dates, and we felt it best to expedite this portion of the supplemental budget to ensure that childcare providers experience no interruption in funding. The Senate looks forward to considering remaining items in the House’s supplemental budget at a later date.”Pressed to specify when the child care programs will run out of money, Fitzgerald deferred to the Executive Office for Administration and Finance. A spokesperson for that office did not immediately provide an answer.Early Education and Care Commissioner Amy Kershaw warned providers two weeks ago that, because of legislative inaction on the supplemental budget, the reimbursements they regularly receive from the state to run the programs might be delayed.She said the department would be able to make payments to providers through the end of May, but that reimbursements in June would run up against inadequate funding.“We are serving more children than we ever have in our Child Care Financial Assistance Program, as you all are aware,” Kershaw said during a board meeting earlier this month.Gov. Maura Healey filed a $756 million supplemental budget at the beginning of April. The Legislature and governor already peeled off and passed one piece of that bill — $240 million to rescue the budget of the Group Insurance Commission, which administers health insurance for state employees and retirees.The House approved the remainder of Healey’s package 149-1 during a formal session Wednesday after dispensing with 65 amendments, in the process adding another $7 million in spending as well as language codifying protections for English language learners and students with disabilities.Reps. Alice Peisch and Frank Moran, who filed the amendment, described it as a precaution against potential federal changes.The Senate gave its scaled-back bill initial approval in a lightly attended informal session Tuesday, then adjourned without taking the engrossment vote that would return it to the House. The Senate could hold that vote as soon as Thursday, when they will meet in another informal session.Two members of the Senate Ways and Means Committee, Republican Sens. Kelly Dooner of Taunton and Ryan Fattman of Sutton, did not take an up or down position on the bill. Sixteen other members voted in favor of advancing it.Lawmakers have devoted most of their attention in the first five months of the term to spending. The supplemental budget is the fifth spending bill to receive votes so far, following measures to replenish the underfunded emergency shelter system, spend available surtax revenues on transportation and education measures, bail out state employee and retiree health insurance accounts, plus the annual state budget.House and Senate budget chiefs on Thursday will simultaneously convene conference committee talks on the standalone surtax spending package and the fiscal 2026 budget.The post Senate advances scaled-back version of House spending bill appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Senate-budget-chief-Michael-Rodrigues-smiles-while-chatting-with-reporters-on-May-19-2025-one-day-before-his-chamber-begins-debate-on-a-61.3-billion-fiscal-year-2026-budget-proposal.webp?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-27 17:06:44.944704

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota immigrants voiced outrage Tuesday about a planned rollback of a law that allowed undocumented adults to access low-cost health insurance. 
Dozens of immigrant rights activists chanted in English and Spanish outside the governor’s reception room in the Capitol Tuesday afternoon, slamming Gov. Tim Walz and his fellow Democrats for making a deal with Republicans to end undocumented adults’ eligibility in MinnesotaCare, the state-subsidized health insurance program for the working poor.
The Democratic-Farmer-Labor-controlled 2023 Legislature opened up MinnesotaCare to undocumented Minnesotans. Undocumented people could start enrolling in MinnesotaCare on Jan. 1; roughly 20,000 are now on the rolls. If the deal goes through as expected, however, their coverage would expire at the end of the year.
Walz and DFL legislative leaders Rep. Melissa Hortman and Senate Majority Leader Erin Murphy need Republican support to craft a two-year state budget because Republicans share control of the House, 67-67. 
If lawmakers don’t pass a budget by the end of June, state government will shut down. Budget bills — many of them still outstanding — will require Republican support to pass the House, and Republicans have made kicking undocumented immigrants off of MinnesotaCare a top priority in negotiations. 
Walz and DFL leaders joined Republican House Speaker Lisa Demuth at a press conference on May 15 announcing a budget deal that included removing undocumented adults, but not children, from MinnesotaCare. 
“Why should immigrants continue to vote for the Democratic party?” immigrant rights activist and Minneapolis City Council candidate Emilio Rodríguez said to the crowd on Tuesday. He also criticized “pro-life” Republican politicians who support the revocation of health care for immigrants.

“DFL, shame on you. Immigrants are people too,” protesters chanted. They also repeated a slogan long used in Latin America to protest tyrannical governments: “El pueblo unido jamás será vencido,” which means “the people united will never be defeated.”
Walz wasn’t in the reception room during the protest; he was receiving a briefing from the National Guard at the time, a spokesperson said. 
José Méndez, a Mexico-born mechanic and immigrant rights activist, said he’s thankful to have health insurance through his job, but he has several friends who were only able to access health insurance when MinnesotaCare expanded eligibility in January. 
For Méndez, the rollback of health insurance for undocumented adults is just one of the many abuses immigrants have suffered in the United States: low pay, racism, discrimination by law enforcement officers. Republicans who control the federal government are ramping up deportations and revoking other benefits from immigrants. Méndez is also opposed to a proposed tax on remittances — money that immigrants send to their family in their home country — included in the U.S. House Republican tax bill. 
“Now they want to take away our health care,” Méndez said in Spanish. “Instead of helping us, they want to screw us over even more.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/NN250527_0260-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-05-27 17:06:44.944704

Johnson Hospital in Houston. For years, states have taxed hospitals and other health care providers to draw down federal matching funds and help finance their Medicaid programs. Now, states may lose their ability to raise or implement new taxes. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)The tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week targets a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government. The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.
Children’s health services could see trims even under scaled-back Medicaid cuts

Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.
States that enshrined Medicaid expansion in their constitutions could be in a bind

But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.

Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Santa Ono, immediate past president of the University of Michigan, won approval from UF trustees Tuesday to lead the University of Florida.
Diversity, equity, and inclusion dominated much of the final vetting discussion between UF trustees and Ono. 
UF named Ono as a sole finalist earlier this month. His approval must be confirmed by the Board of Governors of the State University System. 
“When I asked the search committee to find someone who can take this great university to the next level, I presented them with a challenging task. However, I am happy to say that I firmly believe they delivered,” Trustees Chair Mori Hosseini said.
Although approved unanimously, Ono faced numerous questions about conflicting statements he’s made on contentious political topics, particularly diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as how he has and will deal with antisemitism on college campuses. 
“I understand and support what Florida’s vision for higher education represents, a decisive move away from ideological bias and activist-driven culture that has come to define too many colleges and universities in this country and abroad,” Ono told trustees Tuesday in Gainesville. 
Ono said he supports Florida’s ban on state expenditures on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and the overall vehement opposition to anything “woke.” Although that has not always been his stance. Ono, starting in 2022, oversaw a university that since 2016 spent nearly $250 million on DEI, according to The New York Times.

Ono supported diversity efforts at Michigan at a time when, he said, it was a universal concept in higher education. As University of Michigan president, he supported the institution’s “DEI 2.0” initiative and said the university should “strive to nurture thoughtful and understanding citizens” and that “racism is one of America’s original sins.”
“For many of us here, conviction matters as much as clarity. I’d like to ask you very directly: How can we be confident that the views that you have articulated today are firmly held and that you will not shift your position over time, particularly in the face of pressure” and changing politics, search committee chair and trustee Rahul Patel asked. 
Ono said it took him time to understand the effects of DEI policies. His conviction against DEI now comes from his experience as an administrator and “hundreds of hours” of conversations with students and faculty, he said, something that’s developed over the last approximately 18 months. Before those experiences, he said, he was not an expert on the topic. Now, his conviction is “rock solid,” Ono said.
Ono told trustees Tuesday that his “personal views” have “evolved” and past remarks do not reflect what he believes today.
Despite overseeing the “DEI 2.0” initiative, it stopped two months ago under his tenure, along with UM’s DEI office. The decision, he said, the university shut it down before the outcome of the 2024 presidential election was determined and “before anyone approached me about the University of Florida presidential search.”
“DEI will not return to the University of Florida during my presidency. I fully support the reform signed into law by Gov. DeSantis and the steps already taken by this board, the board of governors, and this institution,” Ono said.

‘Does not comport’ with Florida values
Some Republicans, including U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds, a Republican candidate for governor, have contested the candidate. Ono “does not comport with the values of the state of Florida,” Donalds said in an interview with Fox Business earlier this month. Donalds called for Ono’s candidacy to be blocked and for the search to start over. 
Christopher Rufo, a conservative activist and trustee at New College, said on X that UF trustees should ask Ono “hard questions about his recent support for DEI and climate radicalism.” 
“I understand why some past statements have raised questions. In hindsight, I see those moments differently now, too,” Ono said. 
U.S. Rep. Greg Steube posted to X Tuesday that he’s “not sold” by Ono “walking back his woke past” and called for the Board of Governors to reject the selection. Last week, Steube sent a letter to UF trustees asking them to reject Ono. 
Former Gov. Rick Scott said Steube “raises important points” and called for an investigation.  
DeSantis said earlier this month that he does not know Ono and was not involved in making him a finalist. 
The governor said he would let the search play out and “I don’t think that anyone would want to come the University of Florida if your goal was to pursue a woke agenda. You’re going to run into a brick wall here in the state of Florida.”
DeSantis’ office has played a role in guiding several university presidents to their jobs, including Ono’s predecessor, Ben Sasse. DeSantis has made clear his intentions to make universities more conservative. 
Ono pledged “institutional neutrality.”
“I will not use my role to promote personal beliefs on politically or socially contested issues, including climate change,” Ono said. 
The recommended total compensation for the president is $3 million, including potential bonuses according to trustee minutes, although his contract remains to be negotiated. Sasse’s annual presidential salary was, and still is as a professor, $1 million. He could earn up to $150,000 in performance bonuses, too.

(Ralph Chapoco/ Alabama Reflector)The Alabama Library Association said in a May 16 letter that it was “concerned but also confused” by new Alabama Public Library Service policies on sexually explicit content and what it called ill-treatment of directors and staff of local libraries at a meeting earlier this month.
The organization said it was notably concerned by “the lack of discussion about how the board will codify this new definition into the APLS administrative state code,” referring to a letter that APLS Board Chair John Wahl sent to local libraries to further clarify definitions related to sexually explicit materials after the board approved the update during a meeting on May 8.
“That is just one of many questions we have about this memo, and we hope to learn the answers in the coming days,” the letter said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Wahl said in an interview Tuesday that several local libraries approached the APLS asking for additional clarification regarding the definition.
“We wanted to be very clear with what we felt our definition was so local libraries would have the information they needed to comply with state code,” he said. “I can’t imagine why anyone would be upset with having more information.”
The organization also criticized how some members of the APLS board responded to statements made by local library staff, characterizing the comments that were made to library directors, librarians and supporters of libraries as “discourteous and dismissive.”
A part of ALLA’s statement referred to a letter that Wahl sent May 12 to inform local libraries that board members approved an update to its policies that further defines “sexually explicit” content.
These include books or materials that include descriptions of sexual activity, from sexual excitement and nudity to masturbation and sadistic or masochistic abuse.
“This definition is based on existing state and federal guidelines and is intended to serve as a clear and practical reference as you address this matter in your libraries,” Wahl stated in his letter to local library directors.
The correspondence stemmed from actions that board members took at the May 8 meeting to further explain the meaning of sexually explicit materials after the board fielded comments about how vaguely the term was defined in the policies.
The ALLA executive council also recommended that APLS withdraw Wahl’s memo.
“If the APLS is to pursue further policy requirements of Alabama libraries, follow established legal procedure for amending the Administrative Code, with appropriate public comment opportunities and thorough consideration of the constitutionality of both memos,” ALLA said in its statement.
The organization also wants APLS to issue an apology to local library staff and directors as well as host a session to field comments from public librarians.
Wahl said that board members were respectful to speakers and said multiple times how much he and the other board members cared about local libraries, going so far as to secure funding that the state stands to lose from the federal government.
“There has to be dialogue, and if someone presents information that is factually incorrect, that leaves out entirely, one side of the narrative, it is entirely appropriate for the Board to address that immediately,” Wahl said.
Wahl proposed an update to the policy based on a different section of state statute that also includes adult bookstores. The policy update was authorized more than a year after members of the APLS board issued directives to local libraries to adopt regulations to further restrict minors from having access to some library materials.
A May 2024 update of the code required libraries to relocate materials within their circulation that have obscenity, are sexually explicit, or ones deemed inappropriate for minors.
Obscenity is a legal term and is further defined in state statute. Wahl and other board members said they believe the term “sexually explicit” needed additional clarification. The APLS board did not update what the term “inappropriate” during the May 8 meeting.
Legislators sponsored bills and Gov. Kay Ivey sent several letters to the APLS aimed at further limiting access to materials for minors. Several bills that would have affected library operations failed to pass the Legislature this year.

The fire damaged three historical structures at Fort Stanton, according to the latest updates, along with one outbuilding. But firefighters said Tuesday they were holding firelines and had fought back a blaze that “nearly destroyed” the site,”according to the Pecos River Team fighting the fire.
The federal Bureau of Land Management and state of New Mexico manage the historic locale, established in 1855. With 88 buildings on a 240-acre plot, Fort Stanton remains one of the largest historical sites in the state, and once housed tuberculosis patients during the epidemic and became an internment camp for German sailors and Japanese-Americans during World War II.
The fort is now hosting firefighters as they beat back the blaze, which appears to have come within 1,000 feet of some of the main buildings, according to a Source New Mexico analysis of the fire perimeter map last updated late Monday evening. 
There was no fire spread overnight, according to the Pecos River Team. The fire is 4% contained. Its cause is still under investigation.
Throughout the day Tuesday, fire crews expect to continue securing the fire perimeter by removing material near control lines, and they’ll continue to map the burned area. As a result, acreage may change, according to a news release.
The south edge of the fire, which is the closest edge to the historic site, will be the primary focus for the roughly 150 firefighters who have responded to the blaze. The south edge of the fire perimeter appears to roughly follow Fort Stanton Trail, according to a map of the fire perimeter. 
Fort Stanton is closed to the public, as is Rob Jaggers Campground and the Rio Bonito and West Mesa Road dispersed camping areas. Highway 220 is also closed in the Fort Stanton Area. 
Various local and federal governments have imposed fire restrictions in the area, including the BLM Roswell District, Lincoln County and the New Mexico Forestry Division.

Our commander in chief said the United States would be stupid to reject the donation — a present he hopes to use as a temporary replacement for Air Force One. The key word there: a temporary replacement.
Controversy clouds this gift for a couple of reasons. And Iowa’s public gift law — which deals with freebies much less ostentatious than the Qatari jet — provides important context on the controversy.
First, the Boeing 747 is far from being free. The United States government will need to spend upwards of $1 billion, according to Business Insider magazine, before the president can climb aboard what has been described as a sky palace considering its opulent use of marble and polished wood.
U.S. experts first must inspect the jet to confirm Qatar did not hide any devices that might jeopardize the president’s safety or security. Then the Pentagon needs to retrofit the aircraft with advanced, military-grade communications, security and defensive gear so the new version of Air Force One can serve as an aerial command post during a time of war.
At the conclusion of Donald Trump’s presidency in January 2029, the White House and Pentagon leaders said ownership of the jet will pass to his presidential library foundation — where the plane could become a museum relic or remain in service for Citizen Trump’s personal travel.
Iowa law imposes no-nonsense gift restrictions
That arrangement leaves some of my Iowa government friends incredulous. Even those who are retired can still quote chapter and verse from Iowa’s state government ethics laws that impose no-nonsense restrictions on the acceptance of gifts by public officials and employees.
For example, state government cannot accept a donated $75,000 Chevy Suburban for use by Gov. Kim Reynolds while she is in office and then hand her its keys when her term ends in January 2027.
The fact is, officials in Iowa can accept gifts worth only $3 or less. You read that correctly — $3, not $3 million, and certainly not $300 million.
When The Des Moines Register employed me, I would lunch periodically with state employees. They always paid their tab and I paid mine. They feared even an appearance that they might owe me or my employer a favor in the future if I bought their meal.
With state employees so concerned about such an appearance involving a ham on rye, it is logical to worry about a conflict of interests with Qatar for the rest of the Trump presidency and beyond.
There’s more to this Qatar gift that should raise the eyebrows of Jane and Joe Taxpayer, good-government advocates and Iowans serving in Congress — especially when White House representatives are running chainsaws through the federal budget.
‘Gift’ will cost taxpayers
The cost to U.S. taxpayers to prepare the Qatar 747 for the president should cause political heartburn for Republicans in Congress. The optics are terrible. Two similar 747s — adorned with “United States of America” across their fuselages — are fueled and ready to fly the president anywhere, anytime.
The president and the Republican majorities in Congress talk about out-of-control federal spending. They want to pare government safety net programs for the poor, like SNAP and Medicaid. They want to reign in FEMA, the federal disaster recovery agency, and reduce the National Weather Service budget. They want to cut funding for national parks, medical research, food safety inspections and the arts.
But little comment has arisen about the eye-popping price of retrofitting the Qatar jet for the president’s use for the next 36 months and then to remove the secret weaponry and communications gear before the plane sets course for the departing president’s library or personal airstrip.
The federal government already is spending $4 billion for two new Air Force One 747s that now are in production. The Qatar jet will not save a nickel on that contract.
The House last week approved a budget proposal from the White House and Republican leaders that the Congressional Budget Office says will add $2 trillion, with a “t,” to the $36 trillion national debt over the next 10 years. At the same time, the White House and Pentagon are getting ready for a huge military parade in Washington next month costing an estimated $45 million.
There is one more reason the optics of the Qatar gift are so embarrassing.
President Trump’s tariffs on imported products are expected to raise U.S. consumer prices. The president has lectured Americans on their need to make do with less in the near term for the good of the U.S. economy. You know, two dolls instead of 30, five pencils, not 250.
Members of Iowa’s delegation in Congress ought to use one of their pencils to scratch a note to the president and attach a copy of Iowa’s government gift law. The Iowa Code provisions limiting gifts to $3 or less could provide him good airplane reading the next time Air Force One flies over our state.
Plus, a little prairie common sense would teach him that for the good of the federal budget, even presidents can make do with less — specifically, a Qatar 747. Two, not three planes, will work just fine.

State employment records indicate Charline Johnson worked as a “certified medical assistant” for The Gardens at Luther Park Assisted Living in Des Moines, until she was fired in March 2025 after a resident wandered away from one of the company’s facilities.
The records show that On March 23, 2025, Johnson was working a 16-hour shift at The Gardens beginning at 2 p.m. and ending at 6 a.m. the following day. During that period, Johnson was tasked with assisting residents on the first two floors of the facility and was expected to be working alone on those floors during the final eight hours of her shift.

As part of her duties, she also was required to check on one male resident and one female resident at 10 p.m., midnight, 2 a.m., and 4 a.m. She allegedly failed to perform the 10 p.m. checks until 11:17 p.m., after which she went to the third floor, leaving the first two floors unstaffed until 2:20 a.m.
When she returned to the first floor, Johnson heard a door alarm sounding and discovered the male resident she was required to check on was missing. She notified police and sometime between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. the man was found a block and a half away from the building, suffering from mild hypothermia and slight bruising from a fall.
A subsequent review of video footage indicated the man had left his room at 1:12 a.m. and attempted to exit the building through four different doors before successfully exiting near the dining room. The video also showed that sometime between 10 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., a resident switched on their call light, Johnson didn’t respond to it, and eventually a relative of the resident could be seen searching the two floors trying to find a worker to provide assistance in obtaining medication.
The state records indicate that as part of the facility’s investigation, the electronic alarm log was analyzed and it was discovered that data from 8:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. was deleted, and that the alarm system and call-light system were not working properly. Other facility records indicated that Johnson falsely documented having checked on the two residents as scheduled throughout her shift – even during the time that the man was missing from the building.
Johnson was fired for the resident’s undetected exit and for the falsification of records. She was subsequently denied unemployment benefits with Administrative Law Judge Carly Smith citing the fact that The Gardens was “subject to automatic investigation by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing” and the fact that the state agency could impose fines and sanctions against the facility.
State records show state inspectors haven’t cited The Gardens for any violations, or imposed any penalties against the facility, since July 2023. The inspectors’ last reported visit to the facility was in April 2024.
Other Iowans whose unemployment cases recently went before a judge include:
— Jennifer Kraklio, who worked as a licensed practical nurse for the Solon Nursing Care Center from October 2024 through March 13, 2025, when she was fired for what the home considered to be significant work performance issues. The final incident that led to her termination occurred on March 13, when she failed to complete an assessment on a resident who was ill, according to state records. She allegedly had numerous other issues with failing to complete her duties during the months leading up to her firing, with the home claiming she failed to chart a resident’s eye infection, repeatedly failed to complete assessments and progress notes on residents, and repeatedly had issues with the administration of medication, documenting residents’ condition changes, and compliance with work rules.
After her dismissal, Kraklio applied for and collected $2,018 in unemployment benefits.  On April 25, 2025, a hearing on her eligibility for benefits was held before Administrative Law Judge Elizabeth A. Johnson, who concluded Kraklio’s poor work performance “goes beyond mere negligence” and disqualified her from collecting benefits or keeping the $2,018 already paid out.
Johnson noted that Director of Nursing Angela Miller credibly testified Kraklio “did not have a lack of ability to perform her job, but rather she willfully disregarded her job duties and believed she could get away with doing so.”
Kraklio, Johnson ruled, “acted in deliberate disregard of the patient-residents in her care” and in deliberate disregard to her nursing license. Iowa Board of Nursing records indicate Kraklio’s license is in good standing with no public record of any disciplinary action.
— Nida Flombo, who worked as a certified nursing assistant in the dementia unit for Luther Park Communities in Des Moines from December 2003 until March 2025, when she was fired. As part of her duties, she was tasked with caring for 20 residents in 20 different rooms and performing rounds at least once every two hours during the overnight shift that began at 10 p.m. and ended the following day at 6 a.m.
As part of its regular practice of using cameras to monitor the staff, the home conducted a camera audit of Flombo’s overnight shift that began the evening of March 4, 2025. She was subsequently fired, with the home claiming the video showed Flombo failed to make her rounds or supervise residents as instructed and that she had falsified records to indicate she had performed the tasks. She was denied unemployment benefits.
— Tamara Bordenaro, who worked as a direct support professional for Community Care of Iowa, a company that operates several group homes for dependent adults. The company fired Bordenaro in March 2025 after alleging that she had documented giving a resident their scheduled medication although the pills were later found still stored in the resident’s medication cassette.
In June 2024, she received a written warning for the same offense of falsely documenting the administration of a resident’s medication, and in January 2025 she received a written warning regarding her treatment of residents. After she was fired, Bordenaro collected $2,408 in unemployment benefits before an administrative law judge ruled she had committed “a substantial act of job-related misconduct” that disqualified her from receiving such benefits. Bordenaro was ordered to repay the $2,408 already collected.

Mariannette Miller-Meeks. Krause, the president of the Veterans National Recovery Center and a former state legislator, has run for federal office in previous elections.

(Photo courtesy of Krause)Iowa Democrat Bob Krause announced he will run for Iowa’s 1st Congressional District in 2026, a seat currently held by Republican U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks.
Krause, the president of the Veterans National Recovery Center and a former state legislator, has run for federal office in previous elections. He ran for U.S. Senate in 2010 and 2022 for the seat held by U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, though other Democratic candidates went on to become the nominee both years. He also previously served as regional representative for the U.S. secretary of Transportation in former President Jimmy Carter’s administration.
The Burlington Democrat, in a video announcing his run late Monday night, urged Iowans to support his campaign to “Flip the House with Krause.”
“Did you ever see an acrobat do a back flip?” Krause said in the video. “I’ll do that in Iowa’s 1st District.”
Miller-Meeks’ seat in the 1st District, which covers much of southeast Iowa including Iowa City, Davenport, Burlington and Indianola, has been highlighted as spot for Democrats to pick up a seat in the 2026 election, alongside Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District currently represented by U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, a Republican. Miller-Meeks has been in office since 2021, winning a tight reelection race against Democratic challenger Christina Bohannan in the 2024 election.
Another Democrat, Travis Terrell, is also running to become the party’s 1st District candidate in the 2026 election. Terrell, a patient access specialist at University of Iowa Health Care, announced his campaign in April, presenting himself as a progressive that would work to improve access to health care in Iowa, protect Social Security and support legislation on workers’ and immigrant rights if elected.
In a Facebook post Tuesday, Terrell wrote “with all due respect to Bob Krause, who I’m sure means well, the last thing Congress needs is another 80-year-old man telling us how to fix a future he won’t be around to face.”
“My generation has been handed a broken economy, unaffordable healthcare, and a climate crisis, and told, ‘Just fix it,'” Terrell said in the social media post. “Meanwhile, the Democratic Party keeps doing the same thing it has done for decades. It prays that anti-Trump sentiment will be enough to win elections, without doing the hard work of actually earning people’s votes through bold change.”
Krause said in his announcement video that he would focus on issues Iowans care about, while Miller-Meeks was focusing on the Republican Party’s goals.
“I will lead by fighting for issues that you care about — not like Miller-Meeks, she votes like Trump’s rubber stamp,” Krause said. “But flipping the First can flip all of Congress. It’s that close. We can make history when we build a future for all Iowans.”
Emily Tuttle, a spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee, House Republicans’ campaign arm, released a statement criticizing Krause’s campaign.
“Iowans rejected Bob Krause half a century ago when disco was cool and Jimmy Carter was in the White House,” Tuttle said. “If he’s the best Democrats can dredge up, it’s clear they’ve hit rock bottom in their pathetic attempt to unseat Mariannette Miller-Meeks.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bob-Krause-mug-contributed-945x1024.jpg,,,2025-05-27 16:06:36.139055

(From lawsuit documents)LINCOLN —  The Nebraska Legislature started the week by upholding another gubernatorial veto — this time related to a bill lawmakers previously passed to help fix a persistent bedbug problem in Omaha’s public housing.
State Sen. Terrell McKinney, chair of the Urban Affairs Committee, had moved to override Gov. Jim Pillen’s veto of Legislative Bill 287, which in part sought potential remedies to a pest infestation in Omaha Housing Authority towers occupied by low-income residents.

“This is about human dignity,” said McKinney. “It’s about standing up for the values of the people we were sworn to represent.”
The motion to override needed 33 supporters but failed on a 24-24 vote, after the legislation had been adopted 34-15 on May 14. The 10 senators who flipped included State Sen. Rita Sanders of Bellevue, whose own bill was part of the package put forth by the Urban Affairs Committee and championed by McKinney.
“I am going to stand with the governor,” said Sanders.
 Unrelated to bedbugs

Others who switched: State Sens. Stan Clouse of Kearney, Barry DeKay of Niobrara, Myron Dorn of Adams, Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, Jana Hughes of Seward, Teresa Ibach of Sumner, Glen Meyer of Pender, Mike Moser of Columbus and Jared Storm of David City. All are Republicans in the officially nonpartisan Legislature.

While mechanisms aimed at OHA accountability dominated previous discussions, Tuesday’s deliberations amplified an unrelated argument that was not a focus of earlier rounds of debate.
Hallstrom said his objection was related to the Sanders component  — which relates to sanitary improvement districts and was LB 321 before it was folded into LB 287.
The sticking point for him, said Hallstrom, who said he researched more over the weekend, amounted to taxation without representation, or an SID being empowered to tax outside its boundaries. 
“My bad if I was asleep at the switch,” he said. “But now I have this newly discovered evidence.”
Sanders, in explaining her change, said her bill was added to the package without her knowledge — though McKinney disputed that, saying he could produce correspondence that showed her staff was aware.
Sanders called the addition an “unfriendly amendment,” which provoked McKinney to say: “Not one time did you ever tell me it was an unfriendly amendment.”
Sanders said she believed her portion about SIDs could use more work and reiterated that she would side with the governor. 
State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln questioned the SID portion of LB 287 during earlier debate, but her concern at the time did not gain traction.
 New Omaha mayor 

Pillen, responding to the Legislature’s action, said he was not elected “to simply sign every bill that reaches my desk into law.”

“Nebraska does not need redundant solutions and bureaucracy in search of problems — and it’s essential that we protect foundational American principles, including fair governance and avoiding taxation without representation,” he said in a statement.
He added, “That’s some pretty basic, good governance stuff.”

In his earlier letter outlining reasons for the veto, Pillen said that LB 287 created “needless duplicative government mandates” and lamented also that the SID-related component would grant some regulatory and taxing authority over people living beyond the SID boundaries.
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, upon questioning Sanders, said it was unfortunate the Bellevue lawmaker did not voice her stance earlier, as it was now too late to separate out the SID element.

Clouse said he changed course for a different reason. He noted that he was not afraid of reprisal from Pillen. What has changed, Clouse said, is who will be leading the City of Omaha as mayor.
Now that John Ewing Jr. has toppled the three-term Mayor Jean Stothert, Clouse said he would like to give the new administration the “opportunity to weigh in” and take on the pesty matter “head on.”
State Sens. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln and Megan Hunt and Ashlei Spivey of Omaha were among those who questioned the newly elevated objections. 
“For this to be a reason now to not support the override is a bit concerning to me,” said Spivey, who noted there were three full rounds of debate.
 Bigger than bedbugs

McKinney called the “newfound opposition” perplexing and frustrating. “But even so, it’s bigger than that issue.”
He acknowledged that the OHA has stepped up an attack on bedbugs. A class-action lawsuit was filed earlier this year. But McKinney said he lacks faith the agency, on its own, would rid dwellings of the hard-to-eliminate bugs.
He took issue with Pillen’s rationale, saying he did not see LB 287 as overstepping or duplicating powers or processes. He said the legislation had been modified to give the City of Omaha the option, not a mandate, to do more to push the OHA to eliminate pests from public housing dwellings. OHA’s major funder is the U.S. Housing and Urban Development.

State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha said the bedbug issue is not new, and that a roadblock to a resolution has been City of Omaha leaders asserting that the city is “not responsible for this problem because they don’t have the power to do it.”
He said LB 287 proposed to create a “permissive structure” — telling the city that it “may” step in to regulate OHA in areas such as providing for pest control, inspections, penalties for code violations and requiring monthly updates to the city council.
City Attorney Matthew Kuhse has said that even though the Omaha mayor appoints and the City Council confirms OHA board members, the housing authority is a separate legal entity. He argued that any additional oversight or regulations should be by the Legislature and not the city.
The Legislature’s decision to uphold Pillen’s veto, dousing LB 287, comes a week after upholding another Pillen veto. In that case, State Sen. Victor Rountree of Bellevue had proposed legislation to expand SNAP or food aid benefits to people with certain drug pasts.
McKinney, following the vote, told social media followers that “the fight isn’t over.”
He said he would do all possible to push for “accountability, dignity and a basic level of humanity” from the Legislature, City Hall and Washington D.C.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Many Tennesseans, elected officials and regular people alike, used the Memorial Day holiday as it was intended: to honor the men and women who died in military service to the U.S.
So it’s not unusual to see a lawmaker holding forth on the solemn federal holiday. Among those Monday was U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles, Republican of Tennessee’s 5th District, who held a press conference at the Tennessee Capitol. 
But Ogles and his fellow speakers didn’t dwell on military service or the significance of the day, beyond a couple of throwaway comments to acknowledge that yes, it was Memorial Day.
No, Ogles — who rarely makes public appearances in Nashville — opted to harangue the small group of reporters present about the perceived “immigrant invasion” of Nashville and to denigrate Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell. 
There’s much to take apart here, including that “public” part of public appearance is doing a lot of work. The group included about 10 members of the media, all of whom had to RSVP after receiving an announcement about the event at 3:15 p.m. Friday. 
Not allowed in the Capital? Members of the media who didn’t make it onto the list, protesters and even a visiting couple who just wanted to check out the digs. 
Whose Nashville?
The congressman railed about “his home,” presumably referring to Nashville. But Ogles grew up in Williamson County, lives in Maury County and was flanked at his press conference by three Williamson County lawmakers, one Lawrence County representative and one “Nashville mother and victim of illegal alien gang violence.”
Dr. Deborah Newitz, the latter, was the victim of a Williamson County home break-in by four men, who, she said, she later learned were “part of an extensive organized nationwide group of South American illegal immigrants.”
“Among jewelry and cash, these men stole several family heirlooms and a box of inexpensive but irreplaceable Mother’s Day gifts from my children made for me when they were young,” said Newitz.
I don’t condone break-ins, and I was the victim of one when I was home: it’s terrifying and you lose your feeling of security. So I don’t make light of Newitz’s fear. But if the only crime victim Ogles could come up with was a resident of Tennessee’s wealthiest county who kept talking about “our mayor” — referring to O’Connell, when her mayor is Brentwood’s Nelson Andrews — he’s got weak sauce.
The beef with Nashville’s mayor
Then, there’s Ogles’ weeks-long beef with O’Connell — not even news at this point — which stems from a recent two-week period during which U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement teamed up with the Tennessee Highway Patrol to conduct traffic stops in predominantly immigrant areas of Nashville. The agencies detained 196 immigrants who are allegedly in the country without permanent legal status.
But are they really? We don’t know, and neither does O’Connell, who has fired off letters to ICE demanding to get the names of those detained and what they have been charged with.
Tensions run high among officials, community organizations after ICE enforcement in Nashville

Bless O’Connell’s heart. Even as Nashvillians on the left cry he’s not done enough to push back on the feds, here’s Ogles announcing the U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security — which is chaired by Tennessee 7th District Rep. Mark Green, who did not attend the presser  — and the U.S. House Judiciary Committee will investigate O’Connell’s actions on the immigrant raids.
Investigate O’Connell for what? Does the Judiciary Committee not have better things to do than spend resources to delve into the nefarious intentions of a strongly worded letter?

The role of immigrants in defending the U.S. 
Ogles made a mockery of Memorial Day by choosing to hold a xenophobic stunt and branding it as patriotic. 
More than 750 immigrants are recipients of the Medal of Honor — the highest award in the country recognizing military service members for acts of bravery and heroism above and beyond the call of duty. A calculation shows that over 21% of the 3,528 total recipients of the Medal of Honor have been immigrants. 
Many, though not all, Medal recipients receive the award posthumously, having died in service, and not all of the immigrants who received the award became naturalized citizens. And that’s to say nothing of the 760,000 immigrants who, according to the Immigrant Learning Center, have served in the military over the last 100 years. 
U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services reports having naturalized more than 187,000 members of the military since 2002, with 52,000 of those coming in the 2020-2024 period.
It’s incredibly unpatriotic of Ogles to hijack a revered federal holiday and spit in the faces of immigrants who have served this country for his political stunt.
The rule of law
Ogles and his other guests, which included Metro Nashville Councilmember David Benton, Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson and Reps. Lee Reeves and Gina Bulso, all Williamson County Republicans, talked about immigration in terms of “the rule of law.” 
I asked Ogles, during the brief question and answer session, about his own issues with the rule of law — he’s been the subject of a federal investigation over allegations he violated federal campaign finance laws — but he quickly cut me off. 
Spectacles have become Ogles’ thing. Days after President Donald Trump assumed his second term in office, Ogles proposed amending the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to permit Trump a third term in office. He proposed a bill to strip the District of Columbia of home rule. 
These stunts may be his way of distracting from his finance irregularities and stories about his tendency to inflate his resume. 
Elected in 2022 in a gerrymandered district, he managed to beat back both a primary and general election challenger in 2024, but he’s sure to have another strong primary opponent in 2026 and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has made Ogles a political target. 
He may find his stunts, disrespect of lawmakers in the district and attacks on immigrants turn out the 2026 vote — but not in a way that will favor him.

(Photo by Barbara Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A legal challenge is expected after Gov. Kevin signed a measure that puts more restrictions on the process voters use to get issues on the ballot.
Critics said Senate Bill 1027, by Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant, is an unconstitutional effort to limit Oklahomans’ ability to utilize the state’s initiative petition process, while supporters said it is necessary to ensure more input from rural counties and to prevent fraud.
“SB 1027 is bad policy,” said Margaret Kobos, founder and CEO of Oklahoma United. “It suppresses voter input, makes it harder for Oklahomans to hold their elected officials accountable, and sends the message that those in power don’t trust the people who put them there. SB 1027 does nothing but prove that Oklahomans’ long held distrust of state government is well-earned.”
Oklahoma United is a nonpartisan group backing State Question 836 seeking to open Oklahoma primaries.
Robert McCampbell, an attorney representing the three petitioners for State Question 836, has said he did an analysis of the bill and found it unconstitutional on a number of fronts. Those include banning out-of-state circulators, per-signature pay, and out-of-state political contributions. He also found that it gives judicial powers to the Secretary of State, which violates the constitution.
Oklahoma United said it is preparing for a legal challenge to Senate Bill 1027, but it was not immediately clear who would file a legal challenge and no lawsuit had been filed as of Tuesday afternoon.
Currently, there are no limits on where signatures can be collected.
The new law, which takes effect immediately, says that to place a measure on the ballot that would change a state statute, no more than 11.5% of the votes cast in the most recent gubernatorial election could come from a single single county. The threshold increases to 20.8% for a constitutional amendment.
Those seeking to place items on the ballot would be  prohibited from paying petition circulators based on the number of signatures collected. The measure requires sources of payment to circulators to be disclosed and bars out-of-state interests from donating.
Petition circulators would have to be registered voters.
Finally, the measure would require a political appointee, the Secretary of State, to approve the gist, the brief summary of the ballot measure that voters see at the top of the signature sheet.
Bullard did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
It is already extremely difficult for citizens to place measures on the ballot, but voters have successfully used the initiative petition process to circumvent legislators and expand Medicaid, legalize medical marijuana and make reforms to the state’s criminal justice system.

Santiago/Getty Images)Murphy Smith says he was unemployed for four years because of medical issues before becoming a rideshare driver in Eugene, Oregon.
Driving allows him to work without triggering his severe asthma, Smith, 47, says. But without a set minimum wage, he says he works 12 to 16 hours a day to support himself.
Smith, who’s part of the rideshare drivers advocacy group Drivers Union Oregon, hopes pending legislation will help bring drivers like him a livable wage.
“There are a lot of people here in the Eugene area that don’t own a car, and once the buses or the public transportation shuts down, we’re who they call,” Smith said. “So we are an essential part of the workforce here.”
Advocates across several states say they’ve increased their activism recently because Uber and Lyft are pushing back harder than ever, as more cities and states pass laws requiring minimum pay and benefit requirements.
The rideshare industry is not as heavily regulated as independent taxi drivers or taxi companies, which are subject to rules on permitting, background checks, vehicle inspections and more, depending on the state or locality.
Rideshare drivers and labor advocates across the country are urging state and local leaders to require rideshare companies to provide benefits for drivers, including paid sick leave, minimum wages and workers’ compensation.
The companies have argued that establishing minimum wages for rideshare drivers would raise the price of rides for customers. Uber and Lyft are working to prevent some states from passing rideshare legislation through public campaigns and lobbying.
Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama, who sponsored the bill pending in his state, said drivers told him last summer that their accounts were being deactivated without notice. Even drivers who were highly rated were locked out of their accounts, unable to earn any money, he said.
“A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don’t drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig,” Jama said. “This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families. So, they brought the issue to my attention.”
Their stories inspired Jama to introduce legislation that would set a minimum wage for Oregon drivers, require a “just cause” for deactivation — or “lockouts” — of driver accounts, establish sick leave accrual, increase fare transparency, and create a new driver resource center. Neighboring Washington has a similar model, which was enacted in 2022.
Uber has opposed the Oregon bill, saying that the company needs more time to work with the state on drafting the measure. Uber spokesperson Zahid Arab, testifying against the bill, said the legislation would make rideshare “dramatically more expensive for Oregon riders, reduce access to affordable transportation options, and lead to fewer flexible earning opportunities for drivers.”
Jama said that he and his team have been negotiating with Uber and Lyft since the beginning of the legislative session, but there’s more work to do.
“At the end of the day, we want a bill that’s equitable to both the parties but also ensures that the drivers are getting the relief that they desperately need,” Jama said.
Lockouts are not exclusive to drivers in Oregon. Drivers in New York City first reported last summer periods of time when they could not access Uber or Lyft. The companies were limiting the number of active drivers in response to the city’s minimum wage rules.
Uber came to an agreement with New York City last July to reduce the lockouts, but drivers using Lyft were still seeing account deactivations months later.
Uber and Lyft did not respond to Stateline requests for comment.
 New laws proliferate

Generally, rideshare drivers are paid a base fare for each trip, with additional money for the time and distance traveled. In some cities, drivers can also see the amount of money they’ll earn before accepting a ride. Passengers can choose to tip drivers, too.
But every location has different rates. For instance, the minimum pay rates for drivers in Washington state have increased to $1.34 per mile and $0.39 per minute, with a trip minimum of $3.45 per trip, according to the state’s labor department. In Seattle, the pay rates are even higher.
In places without set rules, drivers are subject to rates that depend on the location and availability of rides. These earnings are reduced by driver expenses, including gas, car maintenance and more.
In 2019, the nation’s first minimum wage pay rate for rideshare drivers went into effect in New York City. The minimum pay rates for time and mileage amount to drivers earning $17.22 an hour after expenses. It was a significant win for advocates in the city who had campaigned for better pay for years. New York later established minimum pay rates for drivers across the state.
Seattle in 2020 became the second city to require minimum wages for rideshare drivers.
In 2023, Minneapolis city leaders were also considering an ordinance that would increase driver pay, but Uber and Lyft threatened to leave the city entirely if it were to pass.
As part of a 2024 statewide deal after a long battle between Minnesota lawmakers and the rideshare companies, the pay rates for drivers rose to $1.28 per mile and 31 cents per minute on average for time spent driving passengers. As part of the deal, cities were banned from passing their own regulations on wages.
California, Massachusetts and Washington also have passed legislation to set minimum wages and rates for rideshare drivers over the past five years.
Massachusetts reached an agreement with Uber last year that guaranteed minimum earnings of $32.50 per hour to start, a portable health insurance benefit fund established last month and multilingual chat support coming later this year.
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Washington also require rideshare companies to give drivers paid sick leave, workers’ compensation, paid family and medical leave, and other benefits.
In contrast, a California appeals court ruled in 2023 that transportation network companies could treat drivers as independent contractors, meaning they are not entitled to benefits in the state. The ruling upheld a voter-approved law.
Lawmakers in Connecticut and Wisconsin introduced legislation this year that would give rideshare drivers better pay transparency, as well as accident and sickness insurance coverage.
Earlier this year, Uber also sued Colorado over a law that requires the company to provide pay disclosures for drivers, arguing that the law violates Uber’s free speech rights. The law requires transportation network companies to disclose to drivers the total amount a passenger paid for a trip, how much is given to the driver and how much the passenger tipped.
 Washington state compromises

For more than eight years, Ahmed Mahamud has been driving for Uber and Lyft to support his family in Seattle.
Driving for the rideshare companies is his full-time job, he said, and business in Seattle is good.
“I love it,” said Mahamud, 51. “You’re helping people when they have a need. So, this isn’t just a job. It’s a ‘win-win’ job. You’re helping your community, and at the same time you are paying the bills.”
But he lacks the same benefits as a salaried job. So he joined Drivers Union and is pushing for better pay, benefits and protections for drivers.
“We are not yet finished fighting against these companies because there are still things missing,” he said. “So, every single day, we are still fighting.”
In the absence of state and federal regulations, rideshare companies have too much power over the drivers they employ, said Drivers Union spokesperson Anna Minard. Drivers in Washington began to organize when they realized Uber and Lyft were changing how much money drivers would earn without letting them know, she said.
“To drivers, this seemed like an avenue for a lot of exploitation,” Minard said. “So, drivers organized from the get-go and tried various ways to get some rights enshrined in the law [in Washington]. Even though it’s contract work, people felt like they should be able to join together and fight for better pay and benefits and safety.”
In 2023, a year after rideshare drivers won minimum wage and other benefits, Washington lawmakers passed legislation that made it the first state to give drivers paid family and medical leave. Uber and Lyft supported the new benefits.
“These coordinated pieces of legislation reflect a true compromise between state lawmakers, labor leaders and transportation network companies to afford drivers historic new benefits while protecting the independence and flexibility they say they want,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement to GeekWire at the time.
And last year, after Massachusetts drivers won new benefits that are rolling out over 2025, Tony West, Uber’s chief legal officer, said in a statement, “We hope to engage other policymakers, drivers, advocates and stakeholders around the world to forge similar solutions.”
Advocates with Drivers Union helped pass a law this year in Washington that requires rideshare companies to be more transparent about which cars are eligible for special ride options, which are offered to passengers for higher fees.
In addition to the standard UberX ride, the app offers UberXL for larger groups, Uber Comfort for newer cars with extra legroom and other options that generally cost more.
The legislation, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this month, came after hundreds of drivers saw advertisements from Uber telling them to buy more expensive cars to get more pay on rides, Mahamud said. But in a year, many of those cars would become ineligible once newer cars are introduced to the market, leaving drivers with expensive car notes without the benefit of higher rates to cover it.
“The drivers really came together and said, ‘This is just unfair,’” Mahamud said. “Yesterday we’re told to buy these cars, and then before we can pay the car off, we’re taken out of the product class which was supposed to pay for it.”
The law also requires rideshare companies to provide drivers with a record of their trip receipts.
Drivers and advocates are going to keep fighting for their rights, said Nicole Moore, the president of Rideshare Drivers United, a driver-run organization of more than 20,000 drivers in California. Moore is a part-time driver in the Los Angeles area, and she usually works Fridays and Saturdays.
“They [rideshare companies] think that to be an employee in America means you have to work full time, and it has to be a scheduled five-day workweek,” Moore said. “Now, we as Americans have all these misconceptions about what employment rights and labor rights could actually mean for everyone.”

Members expected to return to work Wednesday.
Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) went on strike May 5 demanding improved job security and better wages, retirement benefits and health care coverage.
The group represents about 3,000 machinists in Connecticut. Union leadership hailed the four-year agreement, which came following a 74% approval vote.
“Our committee worked tirelessly to ensure our members’ priorities were heard, and this agreement is a direct result of that determination,” IAM Union District 26 Directing Business Representative Jeff Santini said in a statement. “We are proud of what was achieved at the table and even prouder of the solidarity shown by our membership throughout this process.”
The agreement addresses concerns surrounding wage growth, retirement security and job stability, the union said in a statement.
The agreement guarantees continued operations in East Hartford and Middletown through 2029. The deal also includes a 6% wage increase in 2025 with additional increases over the next three years. Workers will also see contribution boosts to pension and savings plans and more flexible workweek options for employees, according to IAM.
Elected officials across the state applauded the contract developments.
“Connecticut’s skilled machinists have a long history of making the most advanced and reliable engines in the world at Pratt & Whitney, right here in East Hartford and Middletown,” said U.S. Rep. John Larson, a Connecticut Democrat, in a statement.
“I am glad to see an agreement for better wages and benefits that honors their work, as well as a firm commitment from RTX to grow its workforce in Connecticut,” Larson said.
Pratt, a subsidiary of Arlington, Virginia-based RTX Corp., had called its earlier wage and retirement proposal competitive, and said its workforce is among the most highly compensated in the region and industry.
Union members began picketing at Pratt’s manufacturing locations in East Hartford and Middletown after about 77% of nearly 2,100 union members voted to approve their first strike since 2001.
Pratt & Whitney makes engines for commercial and military jets, including the GTF line for Airbus commercial jets and the F135 for the military’s F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft fleet.

Jane Raybould of Lincoln and Tony Sorrentino of the Elkhorn area. May 22, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — State lawmakers who want to slow Nebraska’s voter-approved minimum wage increases could attach it this session as an amendment to a bill weakening voter-approved paid sick leave protections. 
Lincoln’s State Sen. Jane Raybould’s decision to file her once-defeated minimum wage proposal as an amendment to Lincoln State Sen. Beau Ballard’s Legislative Bill 415 comes after Speaker John Arch decided not to reschedule her stand-alone bill due to time constraints. Nebraska lawmakers voted to reconsider the vote where her measure fell to a filibuster after the rest of the Legislature’s Democrats and one nonpartisan progressive forced a faster vote while one GOP senator was off the floor.
Changing dynamics
Raybould said her reason for not waiting has to do with the political dynamics facing her bill if the lawmakers don’t act right away. 
Under the voter-approved law, workers would see larger wage increases. Currently, the state minimum wage is $13.50 an hour. If lawmakers do nothing, voters will increase that to $15 next year, except those workers earning tips. Then the base wage would increase each year based on a cost of living measurement based on a calculation of inflation for the Midwest region from the previous August.

March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Raybould’s revived proposal, in its current form, would shrink the wage increases by setting the annual increase at 1.75%. It also would create a youth minimum wage and amend a separate state training wage to limit it to workers aged 16 to 19 at 75% of the state minimum wage later this year, rather than at 75% of the federal wage. Training workers can earn that wage for up to the employee’s first 90 days on the job. 
If Raybould’s proposal waits to pass until next year, it would claw back some of the increases that young people would have gotten under the law voters enacted. 
“It becomes a little bit more challenging, and the optics look a little bit different,” Raybould told the Nebraska Examiner. 
Combining the measures could make it easier and cheaper for opponents of both legislative attempts who have promised a possible petition-led repeal effort at the ballot box. Voters would only need to sign and vote on a single petition and ballot measure seeking repeal instead of two.
Small business help or cheaper labor?
Raybould and supporters of her measure said her changes would protect small businesses that could not afford to pay more. Democratic-aligned lawmakers against the legislative effort to slow wage growth have said they are defending the “will of the people.” 
“It’s a tremendous incentive to businesses if they can hire 14 and 15-year-olds at $13.50,” Raybould said. “[Some] might disagree with that, but years of experience know, having done something similar to that in Washington, D.C. with the trade association, it really motivates businesses to give 14 and 15 year olds that opportunity.” 
Over the past few weeks, Ballard and Raybould both said they were open to amending her proposal into Ballard’s paid sick leave bill. His bill, LB 415, would remove the current law’s blanket sick leave requirements, letting employers offer no paid sick leave to young teens, ages 14 and 15, to temporary, seasonal agricultural workers, and to workers at the state’s smallest businesses, those with 10 or fewer employees. 
Ballard previously said he would prefer to keep his bill clean, but he said he doesn’t consider Raybould’s amendment unfriendly and would support it. Ballard said the issue is whether the amendment can be brought within the two-hour time frame Arch has set aside for his bill. Several motions had already been filed as Democratic-aligned lawmakers prepared to filibuster Ballard’s original proposal. 
“All the other [motions and amendments] that are filed, there’s no doubt it’s going to be challenging,” Raybould said.

The lawsuit was the first legal challenge to the board since the Legislature created it in 2023 to set minimum pay and working standards for nursing home workers across the state.
The board — comprising three worker representatives, three state government officials and three industry leaders — voted last year to guarantee workers 11 paid holidays starting this year, as well as minimum wages starting Jan. 1. The three nursing home representatives abstained from voting for or against the minimum wage and holiday rules.
The nursing home associations — LeadingAge Minnesota and Care Providers of Minnesota — argued in their lawsuit that the holiday pay rule is illegal because it forces nursing homes to violate workers’ rights to collectively bargain under the National Labor Relations Act.
The argument was curious coming from associations representing employers. Federal District Court Judge Laura Provinzino wrote in her opinion on Friday that it wasn’t even clear that the two associations could assert rights on behalf of employees when they represent the employers.
Moreover, SEIU Healthcare Minnesota & Iowa, a union representing thousands of nursing home workers, fully supported the board’s rules. The union was a driving force behind the board’s creation in order to raise standards for union and non-union workers alike, and its president, Jamie Gulley, serves on the board.
LeadingAge and Care Providers also argued that the holiday pay mandate hurt nursing homes by costing them hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in some cases.
“The fact that the industry had money to fund this failed lawsuit but continues to tell their workers ‘no’ so often when they ask for better pay and benefits showcases how much change is still needed,” Rasha Ahmad Sharif, executive vice president of SEIU Healthcare Minnesota & Iowa, said in a statement celebrating the judge’s decision.
The associations’ arguments centered on a provision in the rule that allows nursing homes to swap out four of the holidays specified in the rule for alternative dates if approved by the majority of employees.
The nursing home groups argued this violated employees rights by forcing them to engage in collective bargaining and because the process would allow nursing home managers to “dominate” the voting process.
The judge rejected those arguments, ruling that voting on paid holidays doesn’t constitute collective bargaining.
“The rule does nothing more than create a new minimum labor standard,” the judge wrote.
In a statement, the groups said they were disappointed in the judge’s ruling and considering an appeal.
“This ruling creates even more regulatory challenges for Minnesota’s senior care centers at a time when the need for our services is growing,” the statement said.
The minimum wages set by the Nursing Home Workforce Standards Board are on track to take effect next year, as the Legislature appears ready to approve additional funding to underwrite the raises. Republicans have looked to eliminate the board and give nursing home leaders more power in setting rules, but those efforts failed to gain traction in the divided Legislature.
Labor leaders and their DFL allies sought to set up the board as a model for employer-worker relations in an industry that survives on government funding via Medicaid.



Nursing home workers are entitled to time-and-a-half pay for working during the following holidays:

      New Year’s Day
      ​Martin Luther King Jr. Day
      ​Presidents’ Day
      ​Memorial Day
      ​Juneteenth
      ​Independence Day
      ​Labor Day
      ​Indigenous Peoples Day
      ​Veterans Day
      ​Thanksgiving
      ​Christmas

Nursing home workers will be guaranteed the following minimum hourly wages in 2026: 
Certified nursing assistants: $22.50
Trained medication aides: $23.50
Licensed practical nurses: $27
All other workers: $19

The lawsuit, Hallman v. Reeds, was filed in April in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. Aside from increased public engagement, a win for the plaintiffs could also serve as a way to hold judges accountable when they are accused of courtroom errors or misconduct. That last aspect could be beneficial to voters when it comes time to select local and statewide judicial candidates in election years.
Several Michigan courts made live streams of proceedings available to the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Michigan Supreme Court routinely streams its proceedings and for a time encouraged local courts statewide to continue live streams even after the pandemic, but each court had discretion on the matter. Some courts have since completely retreated from the virtual sphere and no longer live stream their proceedings. Other courts have continued on, but with the caveat of producing a live stream without archiving the proceeding.
Philip Mayor, an attorney with the ACLU of Michigan and the plaintiff’s counsel in the Hallman case, told Michigan Advance that streaming proceedings is now technologically feasible, so the courts should be making their recordings available. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The named defendants in the case are Oakland District Court judges Travis Reeds and Lisa Asadoorian, as well as Oakland Chief Circuit Judge Jeffery Matis. A message seeking comment from Oakland County was not immediately returned.
Aside from courts that do make their proceedings public, the court sued in Hallman only provides a transcript when asked.
Mayor said a transcript is inadequate compared to an audio or video recording in capturing the tone, tenor and demeanor of a given judge, especially when an attorney or a party is seeking to highlight a judicial error upon appeal.
“Judges know this, because our appellate courts defer to trial judges when they make credibility findings, or when they talk about a witness’s demeanor, because they say that judge was there to see that and experience that in person,” Mayor said. “We recognize that that’s meaningful. The Michigan Judicial Tenure Commission recognizes this when it evaluates judges accused of misconduct because it looks at the videos and it discusses not just the words that were said, but the demeanor with which it was said, and the way people are treated by judicial officials.”
Mayor said that from a democracy standpoint, the public had a right to be informed about what goes on in Michigan’s courthouses.
“It’s just not realistic that [members of] the public are going to read a 40-page transcript, but it is realistic that the public, in informing themselves before an election, may watch a five minute clip of something that happens in the courthouses,” he added.
The lawsuit’s complaint also details that paradigm as a taxpayer return-on-investment issue.
“Taxpayer dollars are used throughout Michigan to create recordings of courtroom proceedings, but those same taxpayers are routinely denied access to the very recordings their hard-earned funds pay to create,” the complaint said. “This lack of transparency violates the First Amendment by denying the public the right to access and disseminate records of critical judicial proceedings, many of which constitute the bedrock upon which a functioning democracy is built.”
The Hallman lawsuit centers around one such instance where a recording of the court’s proceedings was suppressed, implicating access and First Amendment issues.
The lead plaintiff, Dr. Samantha Hallman, said her brother was subjected to alleged abusive conduct from an Oakland District Court judge. A lawsuit in the Oakland Circuit Court followed to ferret out issues of the district judge’s demeanor and the fact that her brother was denied an audio recording of the proceeding.
A local administrative order ultimately denied dissemination of that recording.
Hallman then attempted to get a copy to inform voters about the judge’s courtroom conduct and demeanor, but she was denied under the same policy. She was later allowed to view a recording of the proceeding but was denied permission to disseminate the copy to the public, legislators and other policy makers.
Her lawsuit in the federal district court notes that a transparent and open court was one of the hallmarks of American democracy, and that civic engagement and government accountability depended upon open access.
“It was once a civic expectation that the public would attend trials and directly engage with democratic governance by doing so,” the complaint said. “That is not possible in the modern world, but providing the public with access to existing recordings of what happens in our courts is the closest modern analog to this historical practice.”
The case is awaiting an answer from the defendants and possibly a motion to dismiss, Mayor said.
He noted that the issue wasn’t specific to Oakland County. Mayor said there was a similar recent instance in Hamtramck where a judge had allegedly berated a cancer patient who had been sued on a civil offense for not keeping his lawn mowed.

(Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished without a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma retailers will no longer be required to mark-up products after Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill amending the Unfair Sales Act. 
The law strikes language that required retailers to include a 6% mark-up on products to cover the cost of doing business.
Stitt, who recently said he would only sign bills he thought would “move Oklahoma forward,” approved the new law, which takes effect Nov. 1, for all retailers. It covers purchases of groceries, gasoline, some medicines, cleaning products and other merchandise. 
Senate Bill 638, authored by Sen. Julie Daniels, R-Bartlesville, and Rep. Steve Bashore, R-Miami, passed through the House and Senate with nearly unanimous approval. 
Daniels said she’s pleased her bill was signed as it repeals a law that has “outlived its usefulness.” Following last year’s elimination of the state’s portion of the grocery tax, it’s another step toward eliminating mandates that drive up costs for Oklahomans. 
“For 76 years, state government has imposed a 6% mandatory mark up on the price of essential goods like gasoline, groceries, diapers and over-the-counter medicines,” she said in a statement. “Oklahoma was one of only seven states with such a mandate, but today Oklahoma businesses can set their own prices without government interference.”
Proponents of the bill have said it will create relief for low-income Oklahomans making everyday purchases. 
Other “costs to the retailer” still in place from the 1949 Unfair Sales Act include various shipping costs as well as federal and state taxes. 
The law also creates a misdemeanor crime for selling motor fuel below the cost to the wholesaler, punishable by a fine of up to $1,000.

The measure provides resources and relief for communities impacted by extreme weather. (Photo courtesy of Office of Gov. Mills)Maine lawmakers have been busy voting on bills that will eventually make their way to the governor’s desk. 
Each week, the clerk of the House of Representatives publishes a report of the bills that Gov. Janet Mills has signed into law and those that she has allowed to become law without the endorsement of her signature. 
Those reports have become more robust as work has picked up in the chambers with dozens of bills receiving passage and enactment votes each session in recent weeks. 
On May 16, Mills signed 10 bills into law, according to the most recent report published Friday. The new statutes add reporting requirements for how the state spends opioid settlement funds and allow law enforcement to share information with school officials about a juvenile when there is credible evidence regarding the use of a firearm or dangerous weapon. 
While most of the new laws won’t take effect until 90 days after the Legislature adjourns for the session, one bill (LD 448) included specific language to take effect upon the governor’s signature. That statute reinstates caps for dental provider licensing and permit fees. 
The newly enacted laws include:

LD 448: An Act Regarding the Establishment of Fees and Fee Caps for Dental Provider Licensing and Permits 
LD 379: An Act Regarding Confidential Information Gathered for Forest Fire Emergency Response and Planning
LD 386: An Act Regarding Information That May Be Shared by Law Enforcement Entities with a School Superintendent or a Principal
LD 404: An Act Regarding the Confidentiality of Certain Lottery Winner Identities
LD 650: An Act to Support Municipal Public Health
LD 1545: An Act to Clarify the Maximum Value That a Small Estate May Be Under the Maine Uniform Probate Code to Permit Collection of Personal Property by Affidavit
LD 224: An Act to Expand the Definition of “Terrorism” in the Laws Governing the Maine Emergency Management Agency
LD 31: An Act Regarding School Enrollment for Military-connected Students
LD 110: An Act to Require Reporting on the Expenditure of Opioid Settlement Funds by Certain Municipalities and County Governments
LD 141: An Act to Provide Limited Immunity to Maine Human Rights Commission Mediators

A few days later, LD 321, which made May Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Month, became law without Mills’ signature. 
The governor also chose not to endorse LD 472. That legislation directs multiple agencies to examine restoring passenger rail from Boston to Montreal.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)A proposal to let Nevada voters decide whether the taxable value of a property should be reset when a home is sold has died, one of nine victims of a legislative deadline last week.
Assembly Joint Resolution 1, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Natha Anderson of Sparks, would essentially have established a reset button on property taxes whenever a property was sold. Currently, the benefits of a depreciation factor and abatements used when calculating property tax stays with a home after it is sold to a new owner.
Legislature resurrects proposal to reset property tax valuation when home is sold

Because it proposed a constitutional amendment, AJR1 would have to pass in two consecutive sessions and then be approved by voters.
The change would have resulted in significantly more money for local governments and school districts, who rely on property tax for funding, without changing the state’s tax rate or the beloved tax cap that limits the increase of homeowners’ tax bills to no more than 3% a year regardless of how large the increase in property valuation. It would also have created tax parity between a new build and a resold home.
Supporters saw it as a reasonable reform to Nevada’s complex and cumbersome property tax structure, which has led to underfunding of education and municipal services.
Other notable bills that died included:

Senate Bill 395, sponsored by Democratic state Sen. James Ohrenschall, would have required a human operator to be present in autonomous commercial vehicles weighing over 26,000 pounds, such as semi-trucks. The bill was being pushed by Teamsters, who raised concerns about autonomous vehicles eliminating middle-class jobs and creating unsafe roads.
Assembly Joint Resolution 10, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Sandra Jauregui, which urged the federal government to release federally managed land in Nevada for housing.
Assembly Bill 391, sponsored by Democratic Assemblymember Brittney Miller, would have required schools to compile a report on the academic achievement of chronically absent students.

(Courtesy Mayday Health)A plane towing a banner that read ‘Abortion pills by mail’ flew over the heads of hundreds of thousands of racegoers at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway during Memorial Day weekend. 
Mayday Health, an abortion education nonprofit, flew the aerial campaign on Friday’s Carb Day, over the Saturday parade and during the race on Sunday. The three-day blitz aimed to inform Hoosiers that despite Indiana’s near-total abortion ban, FDA-approved abortion pills remain accessible by mail nationwide. 
“Mayday spreads a simple message with many people – abortion pills are available by mail in all 50 states,” Mayday Health Founder and Executive Director Liv Raisner said. 
Mayday worked with All-Options, a Bloomington-based reproductive organization, to fly the banner and to support their Hoosier Abortion Fund. 
Indiana’s near-total abortion ban that took effect in August 2023 outlaws abortion except in cases of fatal fetal anomalies and serious health risks to the mother. Victims of rape or incest are also allowed to access abortion care up to 10 weeks post-fertilization. The law mandates that hospitals perform all abortions. While performing an illegal abortion is a felony for doctors in Indiana, women seeking abortions face no criminal penalties. 
Raisner said Mayday does not ship the abortion pills but lists providers and connects people with several different resources depending on their needs. From there, individuals who seek help can consult with a physician who can send the pill through the mail. 
The Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Indy 500 had no affiliation with the banner. Under FAA regulations, the agency does not regulate messaging on advertisement banners towed by aircraft. Raisner said the only restriction they had was to stop flying the banner when the cars started their engines shortly after noon.
Reaction
Some posting on social media didn’t approve of the message. One poster on X said “Somebody explain to me why there is a plane waving a banner reading “Abortion pills by mail” that is hovering over my head above the infield at the Indy 500 of all places.”
Other posters called it “disgusting” and “ridiculous.”
But another X post said, “The Indy 500 was surprising pretty progressive. Trump was persona non grata, a non American sang God Bless America and there was an abortion pills by mail banner flying over the track!”
Trump was invited to come to the race but declined with no explanation.
This is not the first abortion campaign to fly over the Indy 500. In 2019, All-Options flew a banner that read “Abortion is OK!” over the Indy 500. 
Raisner said the organization takes a “bold-guerilla” approach with their campaigns. Since 2022, Mayday has driven digital billboard trucks to Taylor Swift concerts, sent flyers to rape crisis centers in Tennessee, flown airplanes, driven boats and hosted an abortion pop-up store. 
Raisner said Mayday will return to Indy 500 next year and maybe sooner for a future campaign. 
“We want to spread the message because there is so much misinformation about abortion pills” they said. “Most people in restricted abortion states don’t even know what the laws are for abortion.” 
Indiana’s first full year under the ban shows a total of 146 abortions were performed in Indiana, a 96% decrease from 2022. More than half were performed by using an abortion pill or intracardiac injections. 
In June, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously decided to preserve access to medication, Mifepristone, one of the two drugs used in nearly two-thirds of all abortions in the U.S.

The District 26 Republicans on Saturday picked Kelby Timmons of Watford City to replace Olson.  
Timmons served with Olson in the 2023 legislative session after winning a two-year seat in the 2022 election. 
He lost by 13 votes in the 2024 Republican primary to Roger Maki of Watford City. Olson was the top vote-getter for the two District 26 House seats.  
Timmons will serve alongside Maki in the 2027 session. The District 26 seats will be up for election again in 2028. 
Patsy Levang, chair of the District 26 Republicans, said Timmons has a strong track record from his first legislative term. 
“He believes in local control and has a strong conservative view,” Levang said. Olson, of Arnegard, resigned May 5. A harassment complaint had been filed against Olson but it was withdrawn after he resigned.

Mike Kehoe announces Monday that he will call a special legislative session to consider disaster relief, stadium funding and spending items. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent)Disaster recovery, sports stadiums and major capital improvement projects will be on the agenda for a special legislative session that will begin June 2, Gov. Mike Kehoe said Tuesday.
At a news conference, Kehoe said he has spoken to legislative leaders in hopes they can act quickly on all three items and set aside hard feelings from the regular session that ended May 15.
“There are some raw nerves out there and some wounded feelings, and I’m asking them to consider that these initiatives that we will put before them are very time sensitive and very needy, especially when it comes to the disaster relief” funding, Kehoe said.
A litany of other projects across Missouri that were depending on state funding will not be considered, Kehoe said, including at least two hospitals facing potential closure.
Under the Missouri Constitution, lawmakers have 60 days to complete work on items in a special session and Kehoe said he won’t try to impose an artificial deadline. But the items on his list all need quick action, he said, especially help for people who lost homes and suffered injuries in the May 16 St. Louis tornado.
 “I’m also asking them to consider the tragedy that some of these families have faced in these disasters,” Kehoe said.
To help people recovering from tornadoes, flooding and other storms this spring, Kehoe is asking lawmakers to put $25 million into the Missouri Housing Trust Fund and increase the income eligibility threshold for emergency grants. He also wants to enact a tax deduction of up to $5,000 to cover insurance deductibles for people trying to rebuild.
Other items on the agenda are:

State support for a new Kansas City Royals baseball stadium and major upgrades to Arrowhead Stadium, home of the Kansas City Chiefs. The plan is the same one he unveiled during the final week of the regular legislative session, where it won a strong vote in the Missouri House before dying in the Senate amid bitterness on other bills.
Extend the deadline for tax credits related to major amateur sporting events. 
Allocate $25 million of general revenue funding for the University of MIssouri’s research reactor project and $185 million in funding from other sources for capital improvement projects that include a new mental health hospital in Kansas City and new livestock show barn at the Missouri State Fair.

Senate Majority Leader Tony Luetkemeyer, a Parkville Republican, said the items in the call for a special session are all things lawmakers should cooperate on.
Because of the acrimony in the Senate, all legislation for the special session will start in the upper chamber, Kehoe said, with the House debating whatever bills can make it through.
“The governor’s call focuses on providing disaster relief to families devastated by recent storms, funding cancer research at our state’s flagship university, and keeping Missouri’s beloved professional sports teams in our state,” Luetkemeyer said. “I’m hopeful the Senate will rise to the occasion.”
Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck, a Democrat from Affton, could not be reached for comment.
Missouri is still waiting for federal action on a request for disaster assistance through FEMA for the May 16 tornado.
On Friday, President Donald Trump approved Missouri’s request to declare disasters for southeast Missouri counties hit March 14 and again during the first week of April.
The tornado cut a 23-mile-long path, touching down in the affluent suburb of Clayton before ripping through the north side of the city of St. Louis then across the Mississippi River through communities in western Illinois. At least five people were killed, 38 more were injured, and about 5,000 structures were damaged with property losses estimated at more than $1.6 billion.
“I’ve been on the phone, and Adam Gresham in our office and others have been on the phone with the White House constantly on these events,” Kehoe said, explaining his efforts to secure federal aid.
Federal disaster response nationwide has slowed under Trump, causing lawmakers from many states to urge the president to release funding for their states.
“I’m very happy that we got what we got, because you saw some other states not get approved,” Kehoe said.
 Stadium funding plan

The plan for the Chiefs and Royals would take tax money already generated from activities at the stadiums — $28.8 million annually as estimated by the Chiefs and $15 million annually by an estimate from the Royals — and commit it to bond payments for 30 years for the new or upgraded facilities.
The economic activity associated with the Chiefs supports 4,500 jobs, Kehoe contends, and a new stadium for the Royals would generate about 8,400 jobs. Missouri should treat the teams like any other major employer, he said.
“This is the same amount of revenue the state stands to lose if either team relocates to any other state,” Kehoe said. “But local support is still critical in this effort, and this plan will require local contributions, so I’m asking legislators to work with us to keep these businesses in the state where they belong, the state of Missouri.”
Both the Chiefs and Royals have publicly expressed interest in moving from Missouri to Kansas after Jackson County voters rejected a proposal last year to extend a 3/8-cent sales tax to help finance a downtown Kansas City baseball stadium and upgrades to Arrowhead.
Kansas lawmakers responded by expanding a tax incentive program in the hopes of convincing one or both teams to relocate. The leases for both teams’ Jackson County stadiums run through the end of the 2030 season.
Kansas expects an answer by the end of June, creating the pressure for a special session.
The limited funding Kehoe proposed for construction spending means several projects he championed during the legislative session — and more than 60 added by lawmakers — won’t be funded.
The only general revenue project remaining in the bill under Kehoe’s plan is $25 million to support construction of a new research reactor at MU. That is half of what he sought originally and was cut to allow spending on disaster aid.
The more than 60 projects added by lawmakers ranged from $60,000 for a county maintenance shed in Dallas County to $20 million for redeveloping an historic business district in Cape Girardeau and $20 million to support a new convention center complex in Jefferson City.
Kehoe said he thinks he can limit the message to lawmakers outlining the special session agenda to just $50 million in general revenue spending and the projects funded from other sources, including the mental hospital and the livestock barn.
The limited funding will dash hopes from many agencies and communities that their project would get a second look. There are at least two hospitals facing potential closure if their funding is not included and a sheltered workshop in Salem that is operating at limited capacity following a devastating fire.
Kehoe said he understands the requests but wants to be careful with general revenue spending.
“The state budget years ahead are going to be challenging,” Kehoe said, “and the amount of general revenue that we have is something that I’m taking very seriously as a businessman, and what it’s going to take in future years.”

(Photo: Loren Elliott for CalMatters)Advocates for speeding the nation’s transition to electric vehicles have joined the list of groups and individuals criticizing the massive budget reconciliation bill that was narrowly approved by U.S. House Republicans last week. In a news release distributed Tuesday, Ben Prochazka, the executive director of the nonprofit Electrification Coalition said the bill “takes a sledgehammer” to North Carolina’s electric vehicle (EV) industry and would undo EV tax credits that have led to 16,300 jobs and $20.4 billion in investments in the state.
Among the provisions in current law that would be eliminated by the legislation:

a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an eligible new EV
a 30% tax credit up to $100,000 per single item or $1,000 for eligible home refueling infrastructure
a credit that supports a portion of the cost of producing certain technologies
a credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of eligible commercial EVs under 14,000 pounds and up to $40,000 for those over 14,000 pounds
a credit of up to $4,000 for the purchase of an eligible used EV.

The bill “would eliminate critical tax credits that are spurring private-sector investments, supporting critical mineral supply chain development, creating American jobs and ensuring the United States remains competitive in the global automotive market,” Prochazka said in the statement. “Removing these credits would pull the rug out from under the auto and aligned battery industries at a critical time, immediately putting North Carolina jobs at risk. Industry needs policy certainty and consistency to build domestic and allied supply chains.”
The bill now heads to the Senate, where Prochazka said he hopes North Carolina Republican Sens. Thom Tillis and Ted Budd fight to preserve the EV credits.
The legislation also would implement a new car tax, which would levy an annual tax of $250 on owners of electric vehicles and $100 for owners of hybrid vehicles.
“While all drivers should pay their fair share, this proposal is nearly three times what the average driver pays in federal gas taxes, which have not covered the cost of infrastructure for nearly 20 years,” Prochazka said. “Rather than imposing a punitive tax on a subset of Americans, Congress should identify a fuel-neutral solution to the Highway Trust Fund’s structural insolvency.”

Dan McKee's administration. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Lawsuits, federal funding cuts, organizational chaos and a workload that could “grind government to a halt” are among the dire predictions given by state agencies, including the governor’s office, in response to proposed reform to Rhode Island’s public records law.
Advocates expected the administration to come out in force against the Access to Public Records Act reform bill this year, which is nearly identical to the iteration that died in committee in 2024. They were not wrong.
A dozen state agencies, including Gov. Dan McKee’s office, flooded the Senate Committee on Judiciary with letters of opposition ahead of a May 22 hearing on legislation by Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat. 
McKee isn’t budging on changes to public records law. Neither are reform advocates.

To Steven Brown, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union and part of the ACCESS/RI coalition championing records reform, the administration’s protest exposes not-so-pure intentions.
“I don’t think we can give them any longer the benefit of the doubt that these objections are in good faith,” Brown said in an interview Tuesday. “So many of them are bogus. It’s a misreading of the bill that’s incredibly disingenuous.”
The legislation at its core aims to clarify and update the 1978 law, which was last revised in 2012. The 15-page omnibus bill encompasses 48 changes, from minor language tweaks to major updates meant to protect and expand access to affordable public information. The legislation also integrates new data sources like traffic accidents, police body-worn camera footage and text messages between officials, into what’s subject to public scrutiny.
Among the chief concerns by McKee’s administration is a proposed requirement that public bodies “shall” waive fees to retrieve and hand over public records when a requester can prove the records are in the public interest. The existing law says the records “may” be provided for free if they benefit the public.
State agencies defended fees as a way to recoup a portion of the substantial time and effort it takes state workers to find and collect data. The prospect of waiving fees, while simultaneously requiring state officials to document the specific legal explanation for redacted portions of documents in a “privilege log,” threatens to “grind government to a halt,” Jonathan Womer, Rhode Island Department of Administration director, wrote in a May 22 letter to lawmakers.
Claire Richards, executive counsel for McKee’s office, also took issue with this provision.
“Since every request made by a member of the public could be considered ‘in the public interest’ the provision could result in a fee waiver for every request,” Richards wrote in her May 22 letter. “The ability to impose fees for the search, retrieval and redaction of documents searches is an important function in the APRA process.”
Brown countered that the bill, as well as federal law under the Freedom of Information Act, offers a specific definition for what meets the public interest standard. He also debunked state agencies claims that expanding public records could violate attorney-client privilege, and expose confidential personal information for residents served through state health and human service programs. Similar privacy concerns accompanied proposed reforms meant to hold law enforcement accountable, specifying that internal investigations be subject to public disclosure, though identifying information can be redacted.
Public safety officials remained vehemently opposed. 
“Often, these are minor infractions for violations of policy,” Sid Wordell, executive director of the Rhode Island Police Chiefs’ Association, told lawmakers during the May 22 hearing. “If we make every single one of those available, that’s going to be the next big thing on social media.”
Wordell continued, “discipline is meant to correct the behavior of the individuals we still feel are an asset to the agency.”

Compromise elusive 
But opponents have not offered an alternative way to incorporate internal police investigations into the state’s public records law.
“All we heard when we met with them last year was ‘no no no,’” said DiPalma, sponsor of the Senate bill. The House companion is led by Rep. Patricia Serpa, a West Warwick Democrat.
Only two of the 16 groups representing state agencies, educational institutions, and cities and towns pitched solutions to their concerns.
Jennifer Harrington, general counsel and legislative liaison for the Narragansett Bay Commission, the quasi-public agency that oversees wastewater collection and treatment for 350,000 state residents, suggested striking two pieces of contention related to posting meeting documents online ahead of time and requiring a requestor agree to extending a records fulfilment beyond the standard 20-days. 
Randy Rossi, executive director of the Rhode Island League of Cities and Towns, offered amendments for each of the 10 sections of concern to local municipal officials in his May 22 letter.
While John Marion, executive director for Common Cause Rhode Island, acknowledged concessions might need to be made for some type of reform to advance, he was not willing to concede all of the provisions under scrutiny. 
“We’re not going to disembowel the bill,” Marion said in an interview Tuesday. “We’re not going to water the bill down so much that it’s meaningless just to find compromise.”
Womer’s letter identifies opposition to 15 individual clauses of concern, while Richards’ six-page letter attacks seven provisions, some of which constitute entire sections of the 15-page piece of legislation.
DiPalma said he was disappointed by the continued opposition from McKee’s office, which he blamed for leading the administration-wide criticism.

An ‘orchestrated’ takedown?
“I have no facts and data to support this, but it seems like it was completely orchestrated by the governor’s office,” DiPalma said in an interview Tuesday. 
Brown shared DiPalma’s suspicions.
“I don’t think it’s an unreasonable assumption,” he said.
Laura Hart, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, acknowledged requests for comment but did not immediately provide a response Tuesday.
DiPalma was also disheartened that a new section meant to assuage municipal government concerns about “vexatious requests” — those submitted by bad actors solely to disrupt government operations — was seemingly dismissed by the governor’s office, acknowledged only in a footnote of Richards’ letter.
The newly added section of the bill, the only change made to this year’s version compared with last year, lays out a court process for chief executives of public bodies to challenge and, potentially not fulfill or be reimbursed for the cost of fulfilling, disruptive requests as determined by a Superior Court judge.
But Richards wrote that forcing public bodies to initiate legal action to get out of fulfilling vexatious requests was an “unworkable solution” requiring more time and resources than available. 
“I was a little taken aback by that,” DiPalma said. “It almost seemed like it was dismissive.”
DiPalma’s usual optimism and ever-insistent promise of getting his legislative priorities “over the goal line” was noticeably absent when asked about public records reform.
“We have to be realistic about what’s possible and what’s probable,” DiPalma said. “It’s a tough hill to climb.”
DiPalma held a kernel of hope that forthcoming meetings with Senate President Valarie Lawson and Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone, both of whom are cosponsors on the legislation, might yield progress.
However, a hearing on Serpa’s companion bill in the House State Elections and Government Committee has not yet been scheduled and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi has remained noncommittal.

(Photo by Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)Richmond officials issued a new boil water advisory Tuesday for large swaths of the city, less than six months after a catastrophic water crisis left much of the region without safe drinking water for days.
The latest advisory, announced by the city of Richmond in coordination with the Virginia Department of Health, affects residents served by the Ginter Park Tank, including neighborhoods such as Byrd Park, Brookland Park, Carver, Carytown, Chamberlayne, the Fan, Jackson Ward, Oregon Hill, Randolph and the VCU Monroe Park campus.
Some customers may experience total service loss or low pressure. Others may not notice a change, but officials urged all residents to conserve water immediately and to boil water before consuming it.
“This advisory comes after the city’s water treatment plant experienced an operational issue in the early morning hours on Tuesday, May 27, and after the water system had been restored to full production,” the city said in a statement. “The filters re-clogged after running at full production for over an hour.”
The pressure drop has impacted the Ginter Park tank, and while the city says it is monitoring efforts to restore full pressure, no timeline has been given. The city warned that the list of affected areas could grow if usage continues to outpace supply.
“As a cautionary measure, all residents are asked to conserve water to ensure all needs are met during this time,” the statement said. “We will continue to monitor the situation closely and provide updates to our customers as new information becomes available.”
Officials urged residents to avoid drinking tap water, making ice, brushing teeth, cooking, or washing food or dishes with unboiled tap water. Full water safety guidelines and neighborhood maps are available at rva.gov.
The advisory is likely to draw renewed scrutiny to Richmond’s water system, which remains under investigation following the massive January breakdown that left thousands without water or usable water pressure for nearly a week.

In April, the Virginia Department of Health released a scathing 314-page report on the January event, calling it “completely avoidable” and the result of “a long chain of preventable failures” at the city’s century-old Water Treatment Plant.
“This crisis could have been prevented with better operational decisions,” State Health Commissioner Dr. Karen Shelton said at the time. “Our goal now is to ensure corrective actions are taken swiftly and effectively, so Richmond-area families can trust their water supply.”
The report, based on an independent probe by the engineering firm Short Elliott Hendrickson, detailed a cascade of failures, such as untested batteries, broken valves and neglected emergency protocols. When a winter storm knocked out overhead power lines on Jan. 6, the plant’s backup systems failed, flooding underground equipment rooms and halting production.
The city’s response was slow and, in many cases, ineffective. By the time Richmond issued a boil advisory that afternoon, pressure had already dropped dangerously low. Water systems in Henrico, Hanover and Goochland counties, which connect to Richmond’s, were also impacted. Full restoration didn’t come until Jan. 9, and the boil order wasn’t lifted until Jan. 11.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin called the disruption “unacceptable” and said, “It should never happen again.”
As a result of the January failure, the city received a second formal notice of violation and is now under a mandate to develop and implement a corrective action plan. The SEH report identified over $63 million in additional needed improvements, on top of $60 million already proposed in the city’s capital plan. 
Those upgrades include modernizing electrical systems, automating emergency operations, and redesigning the clearwell overflow system to prevent future floods.
While Mayor Danny Avula said he was “incredibly proud” of the work done so far by the Department of Public Utilities, the VDH’s findings painted a picture of what one official called a “culture of complacency,” where temporary workarounds were the norm and long-standing vulnerabilities went unresolved.
Now, just weeks later, the system has suffered another setback.
The city said it will continue to post updates on its website and social media platforms. Residents are encouraged to check those resources regularly and to follow all water safety precautions until the advisory is lifted.

CAVE CITY, Ark. — When a severe tornado tore through Cave City, Arkansas, in March, retiree Debra Lindsey was in her trailer home with her husband.
“I didn’t even know there was a tornado on the ground until the sirens went off, and then in 45 seconds it was here,” Lindsey said. “It was very scary. If it would’ve been 100 to 150 feet closer to here, it would’ve taken the front of our trailer off.”
Even without a direct hit, she estimated that the damage to their home and property was between $30,000 and $40,000. Their storage buildings were destroyed, along with their two vehicles. And the insurance company won’t cover everything.
Across the street, Robert and Kymberlie Watson rode out the tornadoes with their seven children in the nearest storm shelter. When they returned, they found roughly $60,000 worth of damage to their property.
About one month after the tornadoes, the Trump administration denied Arkansas’ request for a major disaster declaration. The declaration would have brought federal funds into the state to help with recovery. Both families thought they’d have to pay out-of-pocket for repairs.
The power to grant a disaster declaration and access to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s assistance programs lies solely in the hands of the president, and President Donald Trump’s administration is looking to significantly scale back FEMA and pass disaster recovery costs onto states.
Lindsey, a disabled retired nurse, feared that the lack of federal assistance for their home repairs would force her back into the workforce.

Another round of severe weather walloped the Lower Mississippi River Basin in early April, causing extensive flooding and more tornado damage in parts of Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi.
Then, some good news: The Trump administration reversed course on May 13 after an appeal and a personal plea from Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The president granted a major disaster declaration, allowing individuals like Lindsey and the Watsons to apply for aid.
“If we get some help out of it, that’s absolutely amazing. We could really use it,” Kymberlie Watson said. “We’re surprised, a little bit … because the government actually stepped up and helped its citizens.”
Cave City may not be so lucky. Trump has yet to approve recovery assistance to public entities, which may leave local governments — including the town of less than 2,000 residents — with big bills. On May 3, Sanders submitted another disaster declaration application asking for extensive public assistance. Requests for FEMA aid from Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee also remain outstanding, though the Trump administration did grant Kentucky’s request.
“President Trump and his administration will continue working to further empower state and local governments to build their own resilience before disaster strikes and to execute rapid, smart response when supplemental federal assistance is required to truly protect citizens and aid a return to normalcy,” a White House official wrote the Desk by email.

Cave City pushes forward

Cave City Mayor Jonas Anderson was at a ribbon-cutting event for the city’s ambulance service when he learned of the initial rejection from the Trump administration. His first thought?
“You have got to be kidding me,” he said.
  Cave City, Ark., Mayor Jonas Anderson motions toward a storm-damaged home. Cave City could be on the hook for roughly $300,000 in damages. (Lucas Dufalla/Arkansas Democrat-Gazette)
Anderson estimated that some 50 Cave City homes were damaged in the March tornado, and 25 of those were completely destroyed. He said underinsurance was likely a huge issue in the community, and the costs for the city to remove all the debris might run over $300,000 for a municipality that only has an annual budget of around $1.4 million. Cave City also lost its only grocery store, forcing residents to drive 20 to 30 minutes to nearby towns for necessities.
A disaster declaration opens up potential programs for state and local governments to recoup some money spent on removing debris and repairing infrastructure. It can also unlock assistance programs for individuals, including post-disaster support services and financial aid for people who are uninsured or underinsured. Not all programs are offered for every disaster.
After a disaster, government personnel assess the cost of damage. Sanders’ requests for federal disaster aid for dozens of counties mostly in the Arkansas Delta estimated public damages at over $21 million from both the March and April storms, including more than $3 million in Sharp County, home to part of Cave City.
FEMA uses cost per capita to gauge whether local and state governments can handle recovery themselves, or if they’ll need federal help. Those thresholds currently stand at $4.72 per capita for counties and $1.89 per capita for states. Per capita damages for Sharp County, where Cave City is located, are estimated at $179.
But meeting those thresholds does not guarantee that the president will approve a disaster declaration. A president is not required to justify their decision, and documentation of the reasons for denial is considered privileged — not public record.
Sanders released a statement thanking the Trump administration for finally delivering individual assistance, but did not mention her second, outstanding request for public assistance and additional funds. She also expressed support for Trump’s efforts to reform FEMA.
“Our entire state is grateful for President Trump’s leadership and assistance as we recover from the devastating storms that struck Arkansas earlier this spring,” Sanders said. “I had a productive conversation with the President in which he expressed his support for our state and I offered my full endorsement of his plans to reform FEMA to save money and provide greater direct assistance to disaster victims.”

FEMA politics

Over the past two years, the Biden administration provided more than $101 million in public disaster recovery funding to Arkansas, according to FEMA data. And before that, the first Trump administration gave Arkansas more than $101 million in federal disaster recovery assistance between 2017 and 2020.
States in the Lower Mississippi River Basin have received more than $31.3 billion in federal public recovery assistance following natural disasters since 1998, according to FEMA data. Hurricane response has consistently required the most federal assistance.
In recent years, there have been more requests for disaster declarations and more of them have been approved than denied. Between 1953 and 1999, Lower Mississippi River Basin states saw two approvals for every one denial. Within the last 25 years, the approval ratio rose to 5-1.
John Gasper, an associate professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, found in a 2015 analysis of county-level FEMA data from 1992 through 2005 that the chance of a denial is lower when the president and governor belong to the same political party. In “non-election years or non-opportune times,” denials typically follow FEMA’s unofficial guidelines, he said in a May interview.

There are two reasons for FEMA aid’s president-centric policy design, Gasper said: The federal government wants the ability to grant aid in “marginal cases that don’t make the threshold but still are clear disasters,” and politicians realize the benefits of giving aid to constituents.
“In an election year, it’s a great opportunity for a campaigning official to come in, do photo-ops, roll up their sleeves, etcetera,” he said. “In non-election years, they have less concern there, so the probability of denial goes up substantially.”
The denial of Arkansas’ initial request for help was “shocking,” said Anderson. Sanders, who worked as press secretary for Trump for part of his first term, credited her access to the president for her appeal’s eventual success.
Changes at FEMA have further muddied the process of requesting and obtaining disaster assistance. Since January, the Trump administration has dismissed hundreds of FEMA employees and scrapped an agency program funding disaster prevention efforts in states and municipalities. The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program had made $5 billion in grant money available since 2020, awarding over $12 million to Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee through 2023.
Federal officials have also discussed making it harder to secure funds after a disaster. In an internal memo obtained by CNN, former acting FEMA Administrator Cameron Hamilton proposed various reforms to curb the agency’s disaster spending, including quadrupling the financial burden states must sustain to qualify for public aid. Hamilton was fired weeks later, and state officials say they have received no word regarding changes to FEMA’s public assistance threshold.
While the higher benchmark proposed by Hamilton has not been adopted publicly, the low number of disaster declarations approved so far this year suggests the White House is following new standards for public aid eligibility, one emergency management expert explained.
“We don’t have to wait for an official guidance on this. We know that the bar has shifted,” said Bryan Koon, who led Florida’s Division of Emergency Management from 2011 to 2017 and is CEO of IEM, a disaster management consulting firm. “What got you a declaration in 2024 and earlier is not going to get you a disaster declaration in 2025.”
Hamilton’s replacement at FEMA, David Richardson, reportedly held a meeting with staff where he said a large part of the response and recovery would be put on states under his leadership, according to Drop Site News.

Bipartisan support for disaster aid reform does exist, but Trump’s FEMA overhaul has sparked concern among state emergency management officials, who say they aren’t prepared to take over disaster funding responsibilities from the agency.
Such a transition would require extensive guidance from the administration and planning from state and local governments, said Lynn Budd, president of the National Emergency Management Association and director of Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security. Reducing FEMA assistance with little clarity or advance notice risks leaving communities unprepared for disasters moving forward, she added.
Even with clearer messaging from the administration, scaling back FEMA support would require states to make tough choices on how to cover disaster costs and budget for future emergencies, Koon explained. Reallocating funds toward disaster management would mean cuts to other services, and states would have to lean heavily on volunteer organizations to fill financial and staffing gaps.
“States are going to have to adapt,” Koon said. “It’s going to be a lot more of a patchwork of support to make up for what would have come from the federal government.”
Koon emphasized that shifting disaster expenses to states would also mean higher costs for residents. Households will have to purchase broader insurance coverage in the absence of FEMA assistance, he explained, and families will have to pay for damage previously covered by the agency.
In Mississippi, where residents are still recovering from the same storms and tornadoes that struck Arkansas in mid-March, emergency management officials said they will continue looking to FEMA for disaster assistance until they are instructed otherwise. The state is awaiting a decision from the White House on its own disaster declaration request, and officials said they won’t adjust operations or request additional funding from the legislature without more guidance from the administration.
“We have received no indication from FEMA about any proposed changes to formulas that determine federal disaster assistance,” said Scott Simmons, director of external affairs at the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. “Until the rules of the game change, we’re going to continue playing by the rules.”
Others are looking ahead at how states could respond if FEMA steps back.
States already play active roles in recovery but they “need to become a little bit more proficient and get help in coordinating and answering disasters together,” Colin Wellenkamp, executive director of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, a coalition of more than 100 mayors of river basin cities, said in early April following severe flooding along the river.
  Cave City’s welcome sign rests against a building. It was damaged along with much of the town after a twister ripped through Northeast Arkansas in March. (Lucas Dufalla, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette)
Flooding on the Mississippi River typically impacts all of its 10 bordering states, he said, so if states do take on more responsibility, they would need to work “in tandem” to coordinate recovery efforts.
“That isn’t necessarily something that happens through the FEMA process,” Wellenkamp said.
A new round of storms and tornadoes swept through the basin in mid-May, leaving major damage in St. Louis. And hurricane season begins June 1. Researchers are predicting above average activity this year.
With the Trump administration’s new approach to FEMA aid, Anderson worries that recovery for small places like Cave City may become even harder.
“There’s just things the Federal government has been or should be doing … they’re just a lot more equipped to handle that than a city or a state,”Anderson said. It’s an imperfect process and he added that “numbers on a spreadsheet don’t always tell the human story.”

The measles case involved an “age-appropriately vaccinated child” in Sheridan County is the state’s first since 2017, according to the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. The child had no history of out-of-state travel. 
“We are grateful the child’s symptoms have been mild, and they are recovering,” said Jessica Davies, health director of the Panhandle Public Health District that covers 12 western counties.  “Those with known exposure have already been notified.”
The state health agency said people may have been exposed to measles in two cities in the panhandle and advised them to visit and complete the state DHHS risk assessment survey.


Nebraska locations where people might have been exposed to measles
DHHS says people visiting the following locations may have been exposed to measles and are advised to visit and complete the state DHHS’s risk assessment survey.

Gordon Memorial Hospital Clinic in Gordon on May 21 from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.


Measles is a highly contagious airborne disease that spreads when an infected person breathes, coughs, or sneezes. It spreads easily when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. It can cause severe disease, complications and even death. Symptoms include a high fever, cough, runny nose and a rash over the body. Being vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with measles or spreading it to other people. 
Measles can affect anyone, but it is most common in children. 
The state health agency emphasizes that if an individual thinks they have symptoms of measles, they should isolate themselves and call a healthcare facility in advance to get tested. State health officials also said anyone with known measles exposure and no confirmed immunity needs to stay at home and away from others for 21 days from the last date of exposure.
Vaccines have made measles rare in the U.S., leading to its elimination in 2000, but the politicization of vaccinations has played a part in the resurgence of measles in the U.S. 
Many nearby states have had a handful of measles cases. Kansas currently has 58 cases. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen held a press conference in April with state health officials urging Nebraskans to get vaccinated against a disease that can cause serious health complications, especially for children under age five.
At the time, Pillen said, “It’s not if it’s going to come to Nebraska, but when.”

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Shawnee County District Court judge directed the state to pay $115,700 in attorney fees to a Kansas law firm representing clients who received subpoenas amid a state investigation targeting Republican-affiliated political organizations and individuals.
The Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission engaged for several years in an inquiry centered on whether campaign violations occurred through coordination of election spending among individuals, political parties and political action committees. Specifically, KGEC asserted cash had been “earmarked” for certain recipients in violation of state law during the 2020 election cycle.
Senate President Ty Masterson, a Republican, responded to the KGEC’s distribution of subpoenas by accusing the KGEC’s now-departed executive director of operating a “weaponized” state agency. During the 2025 legislative session, lawmakers revised the definition of making a “contribution in the name of another” to affirm legality of certain campaign transactions common to Republican and Democratic operatives.
In August 2024, a Shawnee County Judge Teresa Watson found the previous statute on “giving in the name of another” was unconstitutionally applied to David Matthew Billingsley, who served as treasurer for the Lift Up Kansas PAC. Billingsley became formally embroiled in the investigation after receiving a subpoena in 2022. He was represented by the Kriegshauser Ney law firm in Kansas.
The district court judge in Topeka also blocked KGEC’s ability to enforce its subpoenas in this investigation, but the commission appealed that decision.
Watson ordered KGEC to pay $85,000 in attorney fees assessed through October 2024, but negotiations led the KGEC to seek voluntary dismissal of its appeal.
“In an effort to maximize judicial economy and minimize additional briefing related to a supplemental motion for attorney fees in this matter,” Watson’s order says, “parties have requested the court award defendant an additional $30,000 in attorney fees.”
The new order, which took into account appellate work on the case, raised attorney fees to be paid by the state in this case to $115,000. The state must make payment within 30 days.
 
Fresh Vision case
Meanwhile, a federal judge last week approved an order affirming the state owed $98,500 in attorney fees in response to a separate case in which Johnson County activists James Muir and Chengny Thao were directed to register their Fresh Vision OP as a PAC after spending money to endorse a mayoral candidate.
KGEC initiated the regulatory action against Fresh Vision, the Overland Park group working to influence the 2021 mayor’s race and development policy at City Hall.
Fresh Vision responded with a June 2024 lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court against KGEC. The plaintiffs, represented by the Institute for Free Speech in Washington, D.C., and the Kriegshauser Ney firm, received a temporary restraining order against the commission. The federal court amended that to a permanent injunction in January.
The 2025 Legislature passed and Gov. Laura Kelly signed a bill blocking the ethics commission from taking the regulatory approach with other advocacy groups as it did with Fresh Vision. New Kansas law made a distinction between “a” purpose of political organizations and “the” major purpose of such groups. The change meant grassroots organizations in Kansas, such as Fresh Vision, could occasionally engage in campaign speech without being regulated as a PAC.
U.S. District Court Judge Daniel Crabtree signed the order accepting the negotiated amount of $98,500 in attorney fees. The Institute for Free Speech and the Kansas law firm had sought $170,000 for their role in the federal case.
“This outcome serves as a reminder that the First Amendment mandates that groups like Fresh Vision be permitted to speak freely without being subject to onerous government regulations,” said Charles Miller, senior attorney with Institute for Free Speech.

The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.
Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.

A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.
But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.
Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-27 16:26:44+00:00,CT Mirror,Avelo Airlines begins flights from Arizona to Guatemala,Dereen Shirnekhi | New Haven Independent,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/27/avelo-airlines-guatemala-flights/,"Avelo Airlines, which has come under fire for running deportation flights, has begun flying from Arizona to an airport in Guatemala.","Avelo Airlines announced this week new nonstop service from New Haven to Maine. What it didn’t announce were new flights from Arizona to Guatemala, to facilitate the Trump administration’s removal of migrants.
Avelo Airlines first sparked outrage in early April when the airline announced a new position for a full-time flight attendant, to be based out of Mesa, Arizona. The posting came with a disclaimer that the job ​“is for a charter program for the Department of Homeland Security. Flights will be both domestic and international trips to support DHS’s deportation efforts.” ICE Air Operations is headquartered in Mesa, Ariz.
Avelo CEO Andrew Levy has defended the decision to partner with the federal Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as a way to offset financial troubles stemming from stiffer passenger-travel competition at Tweed.
Avelo launched its first flight as part of DHS’s deportation efforts on May 12: Avelo Airlines flight XP48 took off from Phoenix-Mesa Gateway and landed at Alexandria International Airport in Alexandria, Louisiana. That Louisiana airport is the site of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention and removal staging facility.
As the Yale Daily News first reported earlier this week, Avelo flew to Guatemala’s La Aurora International Airport on XP48 on Monday, according to the flight-tracking site FlightAware. The aircraft, a Boeing 737 – 800, took off from Mesa, Ariz., at 5:34 a.m. MST. It stopped at El Paso International Airport in El Paso, Texas, and took off again at 9:09 a.m. MDT. The plane landed in Guatemala at 12:26 p.m. CST.
That same Avelo plane followed the same route to Guatemala again on Thursday. It took off from Mesa at 5:09 a.m. MST, stopped in El Paso, and landed in Guatemala at 11:36 a.m. CST.
XP48 has also seen destinations like Dallas Love Field Airport, Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport, and — on Friday — Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville, Calif.
Avelo Airlines directed all requests for comment to DHS and CSI Aviation, which provides air charter services and is the contractor for ICE. CSI Aviation did not respond to a request for comment by the publication time of this article. 
In response to questions about these flights and whether Monday’s flight to Guatemala carried deported migrants, an ICE spokesperson stated, ​“Due to operational security considerations, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement does not release information about future removal flights or schedules in advance. However, the removal of illegal aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States is a core responsibility of ICE and is regularly carried out by ICE Air Operations.”
The spokesperson said that ICE field offices coordinate with ICE Air Operations ​“to arrange removal travel and domestic transfers, which are conducted using both commercial airlines and ICE Air charter aircraft.” ICE Air Operations has five main locations: Mesa, Arizona; Miami, Florida; Alexandria, Louisiana; and San Antonio and Brownsville, Texas.
“Each location supports daily domestic transfer and removal missions,” according to ICE, and flights are modified as necessary to meet ​“operational requirements.” 
“Removal missions are regularly conducted to countries in Central America, including Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, as well as to destinations in the Caribbean, South America, and, when necessary, to Europe, Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world for special high-risk missions.”
XP48 isn’t the only Avelo flight aiding in DHS’s removal efforts. Avelo Airlines Flight XP47, also a Boeing 737 – 800, has had daily flights out of Mesa, Ariz., since launching on May 13. Flights are largely on the western side of the country and include destinations such as the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, Calif.; Yakima Air Terminal in Yakima, Wash.; Denver International Airport; and Harry Reid International Airport in Paradise, Nev. So far, no international flights are listed for XP47.
In its email response to request for comment for this article, ICE included its restraint policy for deportation flights. Adults transported by ICE Air aircraft are fully restrained by the use of handcuffs, waist chains, and leg irons — both during flights within and outside the continental U.S. Children are restrained while ICE transfers them on flights. 
Children under 18 years old are not handcuffed or restrained unless ​“an individual juvenile has demonstrated or threatened violent behavior, has a history of criminal activity, or demonstrates a likelihood of escape,” according to the ICE Air policy handbook. Anyone under 12 should never be in “full restraints.”
Meanwhile, in the press release that Avelo Airlines did send out this week, airline spokesperson Courtney Goff wrote that, on Wednesday, Avelo flew its first direct flight from Tweed New Haven Airport to Maine’s Portland International Jetport. It plans to operate this route twice weekly on Thursdays and Sundays, using Boeing Next-Generation 737 aircraft.
“We’re excited to launch our 30th route at Tweed-New Haven as we take flight to scenic Portland, Maine,” Avelo CEO Andrew Levy is quoted as saying in that press release. ​“We continue to offer Connecticut travelers convenient, affordable and industry-leading reliable air travel to their favorite destinations. This service also makes visiting Southern Connecticut, and everything the greater New England and New York regions have to offer, easier than ever.”

HED says more than 5,000 additional students are attending higher education institutions across the state, growth officials attribute to the state’s Opportunity and Lottery scholarships.
According to the state, close to 30 two-year and four-year higher education institutions participate in the Opportunity Scholarship program, which covers fees and program costs for certificate and degree programs for New Mexico residents who plan to enroll in at least six credit hours at one of the state’s public college or universities. The Legislature approved the Opportunity Scholarship, which Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham championed, in 2022.

Eligible residents for the state’s Lottery Scholarship must be enrolled full time in a New Mexico public college or university within 16 months of graduation and maintain a 2.5 grade point average. The state in 2021 restored the Lottery Scholarship to provide 100% of tuition, following reduced coverage implemented in 2016. Last year, the governor signed Senate Bill 159, which created a close to $1 billion trust fund and scholarship program fund for the state’s tuition-free programs.


According to NMHED, more than 34,000 students are receiving financial assistance through the Opportunity Scholarship and close to 10,000 students received Lottery scholarships during the spring semester.


“The Opportunity and Lottery scholarships are fulfilling their goal of empowering tens of thousands of New Mexicans to pursue a college education at no cost for tuition and create a more prosperous future for themselves and their families,” Higher Education Secretary Stephanie M. Rodriguez said in a statement. “As we always say, there is no wrong door to higher education in New Mexico, and we are dedicated to supporting programs that broaden opportunities for our state.”

In a recent interview with Source NM, Lujan Grisham cited the state’s investment in both early childhood and higher education as accomplishments from her tenure as governor. “No state in the nation has our cradle to career system,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/unm-1024x776.jpeg,,,2025-05-27 13:16:33.523195

Ole Miss junior golfer Michael La Sasso recovered from two double bogeys on his first nine holes to shoot a final round 72 to win the NCAA Golf Tournament’s individual championship Monday at Carlsbad, California.
La Sasso, from Raleigh, North Carolina, carded a 72-hole total of 11-under par 277 for a two-shot victory over Phichaksn Maichon of Texas A&M. What’s more, La Sasso’s par 4 on the 72nd and final hole of the stroke play tournament put Ole Miss in the eight-team match play finals for the NCAA Team Championship. It marked the first time in school history the Rebels have made the match play finals.
La Sasso, who transferred to Ole Miss after a freshman season at North Carolina State, becomes the second Ole Miss player to win an NCAA title, following Braden Thornberry who won in 2017 and now plays on the PGA TOUR. Ole Miss, which has never won the team championship, was slated to play Arizona State in a quarterfinal match Tuesday morning.
Sasso, ranked No. 11 in the world among amateur golfers, shot rounds of 68, 67, 70 and 72 to win the championship. The two double bogeys and a bogey on the front nine left him two shots behind Malchon after nine holes. He steadied himself over the last nine holes, playing bogey-less golf.
Afterward, Sasso said he was most proud of the way he won, coming back from so much adversity early in the round, telling reporters: “I’ve personally fought a s— ton of stuff these last two years since I’ve been at Ole Miss. I feel like I’m a pretty gritty guy.”
While La Sasso earned individual honors with his resiliency, Tom Fischer, a a junior from Birmingham, was the Rebels’ star on Sunday. After shooting a 77 on Saturday, Fischer rebounded with a 68 on Sunday, tied with Malchon for low round of the day. Fischer’s final round included six birdies and only two bogeys.
Fischer tied with Rebel Cohen Trolio of West Point to tie for 44th in the individual standings with 293 totals. Cameron Tankersley was next at 302, followed by Key Meeks at 309.
The Ole Miss golf program has made steady progress under 11th year coach Chris Malloy, a former Rebel golfer himself. This was the eighth consecutive year the Rebels have achieved an NCAA Regional appearance.
La Sasso, a first team All American, won his third and by far the biggest title of the season on the North course at Omni La Costa at Carlsbad, near San Diego. The victory qualifies him for the U.S. Open in two weeks and for The Masters next April. He is expected to turn pro later this spring and becoming immediately eligible for the PGA’s Korn Ferry Tour.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/27110647/Ole-Miss-Golf.jpg,,,2025-05-27 13:16:33.523195

John James (R-Shelby Twp.) are the early favorites for Michigan governor in 2026 in a poll released Tuesday.  Photos by Ken Coleman and Kyle Davidson As the August 2026 primary election inches ever closer and the fields of candidates vying to be Michigan’s new governor and its next U.S. Senator continue to take shape, a new poll from the Chicago-based Glengariff group offers some early insights into who could be representing their party in the general election, with a party outsider holding the potential to shake up the field.
The poll, commissioned by the Detroit Regional Chamber on the opening day of its annual Mackinac Policy Conference, surveyed 600 registered voters, and examined the name identification for both declared candidates and figures considering jumping into the governor’s race or the election for U.S. Senate. 
The early favorites
With a heavy disclaimer that the survey’s population consists of general election voters not primary election voters, with crucial differences between the two groups of voters, the poll asked about the preferred candidate from each party in each race 
Among Democrats, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson was the favorite for governor, with 59.3% support among registered Democratic voters and 65% support from definite voters. U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham) was the preferred nominee for U.S. Senate with support from 34% of registered Democratic voters and definite voters. 
U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Twp.) was Republicans’ preferred candidate for governor, although he gathered just 42% support from registered voters and 44% among Republicans who said they’d definitely vote in 2026. Former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-White Lake) was the preferred Senate nominee, with 61% support from registered Republican voters and 64% for definite voters. 
What’s in a name?
When polling on candidates for governor, Republican Tudor Dixon, who unsuccessfully ran against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in 2022, carried the highest name recognition among voters at 70%. While Dixon has not announced another campaign for governor, she previously released a statement to social media where she said she was considering the possibility alongside a potential Senate campaign. 
Benson, who announced her campaign in January, carried recognition with 66% of voters polled, while James was recognized by 65% of voters. James announced his campaign last month.
Breaking down the 70% of voters who recognized Dixon, 18% of voters polled held favorable views towards her, while 24% held an unfavorable view and 28% had no opinion. Benson on the other hand polled favorably with 28% of voters and unfavorably with 16% while 23% had no opinion. James gathered favorable responses from 26% of voters, unfavorable responses from 19% and no opinion from 20%. 
Among Democrats specifically, Benson carried the highest name ID when compared to Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson, with 74% name recognition. Gilchrist, who announced his candidacy in March, was recognized by 51% of voters polled while 28% ID’d Swanson, who joined the race in February.
While Dixon had the largest name ID amongst Republicans at 76%, James wasn’t far behind at 74%. James also held a larger share of favorable recognition at 50%, while 34% held a favorable view of Dixon. Former attorney general Mike Cox, who launched his campaign in April was recognized by 58% of voters while 29% identified Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), who was among the first to announce back in January.
The poll also examined Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a longtime Democrat who opted instead to run as an independent. According to the breakdown of the results, Duggan’s polling numbers were deeply unusual for two reasons. 
First, Duggan’s name recognition was deeply split between metro Detroit and out-state Michigan, with 86% of residents in the metro area recognizing Duggan, while only 31% of out-state residents had heard of him.

Second, Duggan was the only candidate in the survey to receive a favorable rating from voters of all political persuasions, with 30% of strong Democrats identifying Duggan favorably compared to 7% who view him unfavorably. 28% of independents view Duggan favorably while 8% viewed him unfavorably. 24% of strong Republicans who recognized Duggan view him favorably while 4% were unfavorable. 
Rogers carries most name recognition in second bid for Senate
When looking at candidates for U.S. Senate, Rogers was most familiar to Michigan voters, carrying a 75% name ID among those polled having just ran, and narrowly lost, the race for U.S. Senate in 2024, opposing then-U.S. Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) who won by a little more than 19,000 votes. 
Among the voters polled, Rogers carried a favorable ID among 23% of voters and an unfavorable ID among 22% of voters, while 31% had no opinion on him. 
U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens ( D-Birmingham) was the second most familiar candidate to voters, garnering recognition among 41% of voters, with 14% carrying a favorable opinion, 7% carrying an unfavorable opinion and 20% having no opinion. 
When looking specifically at Democratic voters, former Wayne County Health Director Abdul El-Sayed, who ran for governor in 2018, carried the largest name ID at 44%, with 17% of voters offering a favorable view. While Stevens carried a similar name ID among Democrats, 43%, she received a favorable assessment from a larger share of voters at 25%. State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) was identified by 30% of voters with 15% of Democrats offering a favorable opinion. 
Among Republicans, Rogers by far carried the highest name recognition at 77.3%, with 41% viewing him favorably. Comparatively, U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland), who told reporters at the end of April he was “leaning towards” a run for Senate, carried a 33% name ID, with 13% of Republican voters carrying a positive opinion of him. 
Testing the waters
Alongside name ID, the Glengariff group also polled voters on several combinations of candidates, testing every Republican candidate against Benson and Duggan, and every Democrat against Duggan and James. 
While both Gilchrist and Swanson were both shut out by James, Benson beat James by .5% among registered voters and 3.7% among voters who said they would definitely vote in the next election. 
Benson also beat out Dixon, Cox and Nesbitt. While Dixon gathered more support than Cox and Nesbitt, she still lagged Benson by 4%. 
The Glengariff group once again called attention to Duggan’s polling numbers, noting that he regularly wins the Metro Detroit region, gathering between 35.8% to 40.4% support. However, he only gathers 9% to 13.9% support among out-state voters. 
The poll also notes that Duggan equally draws votes away from James and Benson, following a similar trend to his favorability rating. 
When examining the six head-to-head matchups for Senate, Rogers triumphed over El-Sayed with 6% of the vote, and achieved a less-certain victory over McMorrow. While polling among registered voters has Rogers leading by 4%, the numbers among definite voters have McMorrow up 1.4%. 
Stevens defeats Rogers by 1.4% among registered voters and 6% among definite voters. 
While Huizenga led El-Sayed by .5% among registered voters, El-Sayed prevailed by 2.5% among definite voters. Both Stevens and McMorrow prevailed in a match up against Huizenga. 
When examining each Democrat’s matchup against Mike Rogers, the Glengariff group notes that Stevens polled better with independents than McMorrow and El-Sayed, winning 33% against Rogers compared to El-Sayed’s 21% and McMorrow’s 23%.

The Indian River School District is set to hold a current expense referendum on Thursday, June 5, seeking voter approval for a $22.5 million increase in local funding to offset rising operational costs and preserve educational services.
Its first crack at a referendum failed in late March after 53% of voters rejected a proposal that would result in a nearly $300 annual hike to local taxes for the average homeowner.
Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. at eight locations across the district.
Two new polling places—Long Neck Methodist Church and Selbyville Fire Hall—have been added this year to improve voter accessibility.
RELATED: Indian River referendum fails with 53% voting against tax hike to support district growth
Superintendent Dr. Jay Owens said the referendum is crucial to avoid further cuts to academic, athletic, and extracurricular programs.
“This is an extremely important referendum for the future of the Indian River School District,” Owens said. “Without additional local revenue, we will face difficult staffing decisions and potential impacts to our academic, athletic and extra-curricular programs. Our operating expenses are increasing at a rate that is simply not sustainable if we are to continue to provide quality educational services to our students.”
The district has been operating with budget deficits since the 2023 fiscal year, ranging from $4.2 million to $7.3 million annually.
Contributing factors include rising costs in utilities, transportation, substitute staffing, mental health services, and mandated payments to charter and choice schools.
Officials say reserve funds built up after the last successful referendum in 2017 have now been spent down.
If approved, the measure would increase school taxes by $0.0559 per $100 of assessed property value.
For the average district taxpayer, that would translate to an estimated $22.40 monthly increase—or roughly $268.88 per year.
In recent years, the district has already implemented staffing reductions and discretionary budget cuts. Officials stress that further funding is needed to maintain competitive salaries and attract high-quality educators.
“We understand the uncertainty our residents face in regards to property reassessment and rising energy bills and we sincerely appreciate the support of those who voted for our previous referendum,” Owens said. “We hope our public will understand the need for this initiative and lend its support to our students on June 5.”
To vote, residents must be U.S. and Delaware citizens, at least 18 years old, and live within the Indian River School District.
Voter registration is not required, but identification or proof of residency is.
Absentee ballots can be requested by mail until noon on May 30, or in person at the Department of Elections Sussex County Office until noon on June 4.
District officials are also offering community presentations to explain the referendum.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/5ed0895ba8dbe.image_.jpg,,,2025-05-27 13:16:33.523195

(Photo: Greg Childress)As a U.S. Navy veteran, I am honored to manage a team that serves other veterans who find themselves without a home in North Carolina. In my role as director of outreach for Veterans Services of The Carolinas (VSC), our team collaborates daily with the faith-based community, mental health and substance use providers, LME/MCOs, law enforcement, housing providers, and others across all 100 counties of North Carolina.
That experience has provided us with deep insight into what works and what doesn’t. Two pending bills in the North Carolina General Assembly will have a direct impact on our communities, service providers, law enforcement, and those we serve. Both are promoted—as they were in other targeted states —by an interest group out of Austin, Texas, called Cicero Action. Joe Lonsdale, its founder, is a venture capitalist with ties to those in private prison contracting, including technology for the newer field of e-carceration.
One bill – House Bill 437 – would criminalize nonprofits like ours by threatening felony charges if drug activity occurs within 100 feet of our facilities — an extreme and unworkable standard that punishes service providers for circumstances beyond their control. The other — House Bill 781 — establishes new requirements on cities and counties to set up state-sanctioned homeless encampments for up to a year without additional funding.
Going after nonprofits and supporting unfunded mandates is not on-brand for the state of North Carolina, but neither is disrespecting our faith-based and veteran leaders who the Cicero lobbyists characterize as unserious activists. Representatives for four bishops overseeing 1200 North Carolina Episcopal and United Methodist churches joined VSC and other veterans in sharing concerns about these bills and the impacts they will have at multiple House committee podiums. And yet, the bill passed out of the House and now awaits a round of committee hearings in the Senate.
Under the guise of a self-described think tank, the Cicero Institute—in the absence of data—blames the Housing First model for the increase of homelessness. From Texas, it declares there is no lack of affordable housing in North Carolina and glosses over how two out of three of its residents experiencing homelessness in recent years are experiencing it for the first time.
Prioritizing housing with wrap-around services—the housing first model—has been the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs approach since 2012. More than 133,000 veterans were housed and provided with supportive services to help them retain housing over the last three years. The practice was first introduced by the George W. Bush Administration and has enjoyed subsequent bipartisan support because of data showing its effectiveness.
The average number of returns to homelessness across the state utilizing Housing First is less than 13%. The City of Raleigh estimates it costs $96,000 a year in emergency services, law enforcement and health care for a homeless person living outside.
As Raleigh’s News & Observer reported recently, putting someone in a home and making services available costs $20,000 — saving taxpayers’ $76,000 per person.
In contrast, another local government projected the cost of installing just one Greenflow unit to provide the bill’s requirement of running water and restrooms at up to $200,000 alone. Will local governments have to add this cost and others in their capital improvement or their regular budgets to meet the state’s approval? Will property tax increases be required to move the state-sanctioned encampments around each year? Additionally, legal counsels from local governments have raised concerns about increased liability and incarceration along with decreased local control–as reported by their colleagues in states where the Cicero bills have passed into law.
Cicero offers no data to indicate its proposal will do anything to end homelessness—just make it less visible. A month after the Florida encampment law went into effect last year, the first lawsuit was filed, resulting in a hasty sweep of an encampment without a plan for where people would go. Ongoing treatment for substance use and medications for mental illness are interrupted or lost when caseworkers and peer support specialists cannot find those they serve.
State-sanctioned, compulsive homeless encampments will drive unsheltered veterans further from the resources needed and further away from sustainable recovery, while putting the onus on our local law enforcement.
Especially in the context of yesterday’s annual observance of Memorial Day, it makes no sense for our leaders to pass laws that criminalize those who have given up so much for the freedoms we enjoy. Our General Assembly members would serve their communities more effectively by investing in solutions that have been proven to work and are cost effective.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3502-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-05-27 13:16:33.523195

Twice incarcerated in Connecticut prisons, Garcia witnessed firsthand the profound failures of the prison system—not only in its inability to provide adequate healthcare but also in its neglect of human dignity. 
Her story is not one of mere survival but of defiance against a system that dehumanizes individuals and reduces them to their inmate numbers. Through her advocacy work and her organization, Prison 2 Public Policy, Garcia has become a fierce voice for those often silenced, challenging stereotypes and dismantling barriers to full citizenship for formerly incarcerated individuals.

Noah Killeen
Garcia’s time in prison deeply shaped her perspective on the prison system, particularly through her experience as a hospice volunteer. She recalls the inadequate healthcare available to inmates, describing an overburdened and underfunded system. 
“There is not even a community standard level of care,” she explains, sharing the tragic story of a friend who died from COVID-19 complications in 2022. Bedridden and isolated, her friend contracted the virus three times, underscoring the systemic failures. For Garcia, this is unacceptable. “Prison didn’t take away our humanity,” she asserts. “I don’t understand why people think when we get our inmate number atthe door, we somehow check out our humanity.”
Beyond healthcare, Garcia emphasizes the mental toll that incarceration exacts. Shedistinguishes between diagnosable mental health conditions and what she calls “mental hygiene”—the pervasive trauma of incarceration that impedes reentry into society. “We come home one of two ways, either in a body bag or in pieces,” she says. “And when I say pieces, it’s because we never come out of prison whole.” 
This trauma is particularly acute for young people who grow up in prison, experiencing what Garcia calls “carceral arrested development.” These individuals, she explains, emerge as adults but with lingering adolescent tendencies, unprepared for life outside. “You just hit them at their most vulnerable developmental stage,” she says, underscoring the need for tailored support during reentry. 
Prison 2 Public Policy, founded just a year ago, seeks to address these challenges. Garcia’s advocacy focuses on restoring full citizenship, which she defines as not just the legal right to vote but the holistic reintegration of individuals into society. This involves mental health resources, education, housing, and other essential services. “When people are incarcerated, we don’t come home as full citizens,” she explains. “We don’t ever fully come home.” 
Her mission was inspired by James Jeter of the Full Citizen Coalition, whose vision deeply resonated with her.
Garcia’s work extends to advocating for marginalized groups within the incarceratedpopulation, including those accused of sexual offenses. As a survivor of sexual assault and domestic violence herself, Garcia approaches this issue with empathy. She is particularly concerned about young people caught up in the system for minor offenses that derail their lives.
“At least provide the ability to return to some semblance of a normal life,” she says. For Garcia, the goal is clear: “Making sure people have that fair chance to have a life.”
This advocacy has not been without challenges. She confronts societal attitudes thatmarginalize formerly incarcerated individuals, often reducing them to token figures in advocacy spaces. “There’s this idea in society: be grateful you’re free,” she explains. “What you’re really indirectly saying is, be grateful for whatever scraps I give you.” She criticizes the systemic barriers that keep formerly incarcerated people on the fringe of society, limiting their ability to effect meaningful change. Yet, she remains undeterred. 
“I constantly see people will talk for us, but we really don’t have an equal voice at the table,” she says, emphasizing the importance of empowering justice-impacted individuals to lead the conversation.
Garcia’s own story defies the tokenism she critiques. Since her release in 2019, she hasachieved an associate’s degree, a bachelor’s degree from Trinity College, and a master’s degree. She is currently pursuing dual degrees in law and policy at Vermont Law School. But she resists the narrative that her success should be the benchmark for others. “Unfortunately, that’s not the story of every person who’s been formerly incarcerated,” she acknowledges. Her focus is not on creating exceptional cases but on ensuring systemic support for all.
Through Prison 2 Public Policy, Garcia is challenging stereotypes and advocating forsystemic change, rooted in the belief that incarceration should not strip individuals of their humanity or their right to a meaningful life. By addressing the mental, emotional, and practical barriers to reentry, she is paving the way for a more inclusive society. 
As she puts it, “Prison didn’t take away your humanity. It’s time society stopped acting like it did.”

For years, states have taxed hospitals and other health care providers to draw down federal matching funds and help finance their Medicaid programs. Now, states may lose their ability to raise or implement new taxes. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)The tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week targets a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government. The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.
Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.
But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.










Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them.


– Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals



Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

(Jason Rosenbaum/St. Louis Public Radio).Barry Croft and Adam Fox, the men convicted of plotting to kidnap Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in the summer of 2020, could be on a list for potential presidential pardons, according to the U.S. Department of Justice’s new pardon attorney.
The comments came from Ed Martin Jr., a conservative activist who had been nominated as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia before having his nomination withdrawn earlier this year. Martin is now a pardon attorney with the U.S. Department of Justice.
Appearing on a conservative podcast last week, Martin said that the administration of President Donald Trump “can’t leave” Croft and Fox “behind.”
Martin also called Croft and Fox “victims” and likened their cases to the criminal charges that were brought against the January 6 Capitol insurrectionists, the Associated Press reported. Trump pardoned more than 1,500 defendants charged in the Capitol attack on his first day back in office.
A message seeking comment from Whitmer’s office was not immediately returned.
Conservative activists and conspiracy theorists have long alluded to the plot against Whitmer as a federal government-led operation to entrap the participants, but numerous pieces of evidence shown in court detailed the breadth of Croft and Fox’s involvement in spearheading the plan and recruiting others to join in the plot – including eventually an informant working with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Appeals court upholds convictions of 2 men in plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer

Martin appears to be among those who viewed the prosecution of Croft and Fox as the weaponization of the federal government, a running theme in the Trump White House. Martin on the podcast vowed to take a hard look at their cases in his new role. Both Croft and Fox are serving nearly 20-year prison terms in a high security federal prison located in Colorado.
Several other men were charged with conspiracy to kidnap Whitmer but were either acquitted of or pleaded guilty to the crimes.
Croft and Fox attempted to appeal their convictions, but the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the federal district court’s decision.

The case has been assigned to Judge Randolph D. Moss, who was nominated by then-President Barack Obama.White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields wrote in a statement that the “Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) is creating media to support a particular political party on the taxpayers’ dime.“Therefore, the President is exercising his lawful authority to limit funding to NPR and PBS. The President was elected with a mandate to ensure efficient use of taxpayer dollars, and he will continue to use his lawful authority to achieve that objective.”The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which is funded by Congress and in turn provides grants to more than 1,500 public radio and television stations throughout the United States, was established as a private “nonprofit corporation” and is not “an agency or establishment of the United States Government,” according to the lawsuit.Power of the purseCongress has consistently approved funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting on a bipartisan basis, including its current $535 million appropriation.The lawsuit contends that the “loss of all direct funding from CPB and the loss (or significant decline) of revenue from local stations would be catastrophic for NPR.”It also states the president “has no authority under the Constitution to"" interfere in funding decisions made by lawmakers.” “On the contrary, the power of the purse is reserved to Congress, and the President has no inherent authority to override Congress’s will on domestic spending decisions,” the lawsuits says. “By unilaterally imposing restrictions and conditions on funds in contravention of Congress, the Order violates the Separation of Powers and the Spending Clause of the Constitution.”",,,,2025-05-27 13:16:33.523195

(Provided by Republican Party of Kentucky)Zach Jordan, a former Arizona deputy state director for President Donald Trump’s campaign, has been named as the next executive director of the Republican Party of Kentucky ahead of 2026 elections. 
In a Tuesday press release, RPK said Jordan “brings a background in grassroots leadership and organizational strategy to the role” with his experience in Arizona. In November, Trump won the state’s 11 electoral votes over former Vice President Kamala Harris by winning the popular vote by more than five percentage points. 
Jordan takes over the Kentucky role from Adam Feldman, who was serving as interim executive director after Sarah Van Wallaghen’s departure earlier this year. Jordan, who is an alumnus of Western Kentucky University, officially began as executive director on Tuesday. He will oversee daily party operations and assist with strategic planning and fundraising efforts ahead of the 2026 election cycle, when Kentucky will have elections for U.S. Senate and U.S. House seats as well as races in the state legislature. 
Robert J. Benvenuti III, RPK chairman, praised Jordan’s work experience in a statement. 
“He clearly possesses the intellect, skill and thoughtfulness required to successfully carry out this critical and difficult job,” Benvenuti said. “Zach brings a unique blend of experience in grassroots operations, leadership, fundraising and data strategy. He has a wealth of knowledge and is ready to hit the ground running.”

(Screenshot of Nebraska Public Media livestream)LINCOLN — A legislative committee on Tuesday reconsidered and favorably advanced a second Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission appointee who had tied in a 4-4 vote last week.
In a quick meeting Tuesday, State Sen. Stan Clouse of Kearney flipped his opposition to Lorelle Mueting of Gretna, the prevention director at Heartland Family Service in Omaha. Clouse said he supported advancing Mueting’s nomination so the full Legislature could consider her appointment instead of keeping the nomination in the General Affairs Committee.
Had the committee not advanced Mueting by the end of the legislative session, scheduled to end June 9, she would have been added to the commission without a vote of the full Legislature.
Committee advances Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission appointees

The voter-approved Medical Cannabis Commission is charged with crafting rules and regulations by July 1 so licensing of medical cannabis dispensaries can begin by Oct. 1.
Clouse said his original reservations came because Mueting didn’t have a “great” confirmation hearing Thursday. After she spoke, long-time medical cannabis supporters voiced concerns over Mueting.
That was contrasted with Dr. Monica Oldenburg of Lincoln, an anesthesiologist, whom Clouse supported in part because he wants someone with a medical background on the regulatory commission.
Both nominees eventually advanced 5-3, in a party-line vote between Republicans and Democrats.
Oldenburg stayed for the three-hour hearing. Mueting left after three invited witnesses spoke in favor of her appointment.
The appointees would need at least 25 votes in the Legislature to be confirmed. They would join the three members of the Nebraska Liquor Control Commission to comprise the new regulatory commission for medical cannabis.
Clouse said he wants to keep an open mind before deciding how he’ll vote on the appointments.

He looked at me, astonished, and maybe a little outraged, and said, “You have to mail a piece of paper to change an address.”
I nodded, looking down at my coffee. 
Anyone who has worked in human services braces themselves for these stories. They range from headache-inducing bureaucratic annoyances all the way to horror stories of people so caught up in red tape nightmares that they can’t access life-saving care or treatment.
Why is this? Why are human services so complicated?
The answer starts with us — the attitudes of the American people — and is reinforced through all other levels of the policy process, from budgeting to service delivery. 
America’s attitude toward poverty is shaped by 16th century English Poor Laws, particularly the idea of “deserving” and “undeserving” poor.  
This manifests itself in our nation’s reliance on means-tested programs. Means-testing means only low-income people qualify for a service. Other rich democracies rely more on services that are available to everyone.   
Means-tested programs rely on complex eligibility processes — both for initial application and to prove continued eligibility. Sometimes, people must report various information on a monthly basis to remain eligible for benefits or services. 
It’s a continuous requirement to prove that you really need help.
While some process is necessary, the number of rules and the degree of complexity to follow them reflects the public ambivalence toward these services. 
These values can get muddled in the largest U.S. means-tested program, Medicaid (called Medical Assistance in Minnesota). 
Medicaid is largely thought of as a health care program for low-income families. It is means-tested. At times over the past two decades, Republicans have referred to Medicaid as “welfare health care” to justify budget cuts. 
At the same time, Medicaid provides health care and long-term care for low-income seniors and people with disabilities. Health care for seniors and people with disabilities has broad public support, and many believe this basic dignity is a right, not a privilege.   
Yet the process of getting grandma into the nursing home or helping a person with disabilities live and work in the community is complicated by the fact that these services are paid for by Medicaid, a means-tested program. As a result, families trying to help a grandparent or another relative often find themselves caught in a morass of rules and red tape. 
All because the best our nation could do for vulnerable people needing long-term care was to cobble some services onto Medicaid. 
This ambivalence about helping poor people also plays into another facet of the policy process: budget cutting. 
Human services are some of the largest and fastest growing programs: Medicaid and SNAP are two of the larger programs in the federal budget, and Medicaid is the largest program in many states’ budgets. 
Whether reductions are made for political reasons or to address budget deficits doesn’t matter: Human services programs will be at the center, because that’s where the money is. 
But few politicians really want to cut low-income people off benefits, especially not health care for people in their districts, and especially not elderly people in nursing homes or people with disabilities.
So, instead of simple changes that would reduce benefits or coverage, the budget cutting solutions are often more complex policy changes wrapped in messaging about “work” or “fraud and abuse.”
We see this happening right now at the federal level with Medicaid and SNAP. A skittish Congress has backed off from direct cuts to Medicaid, opting instead for work requirements and other eligibility changes — under the guise of weeding out the people who don’t deserve health care. 
In other words, Congress is intentionally creating complex hoops designed to cause people to lose health care, all in order to cut the budget to pay for tax cuts.  
Once these policies are passed by Congress, federal agencies create regulations to further detail how policies must be implemented by states. At the state level, additional legislation may be required to sort out any areas of state discretion under the new federal laws. And then state agencies develop rules or guidance for counties, tribes or private entities that deliver the services. 
Each step adds more specificity — and more complexity. 
And the constant changes in policy from year to year compounds the problem. 
It all lands on people trying to get necessities like health care and groceries — and the frontline workers who are just trying to help their clients obtain these simple human needs. 
I’ve focused on eligibility policies, but this complexity has infected other policies as well. The decisions regarding who gets into a nursing home or what services a person with disabilities can get in the community had, in the past, relied partly on discretion by a local social worker. Now these decision factors are fixed in law and supported by structured, mandatory assessment tools. 
This ensures consistency, but when people are denied services, it can feel like the decision was made in a black box. 
I’m not sure it is possible to undo this cycle. There are never enough resources to meet all the needs. Combine that with our ambivalence about who deserves help, and it’s a self-perpetuating mess. 
The best hope for fixing this problem — to make it simpler for people to get the services they need — is at the point of service delivery. 
Of course, as I wrote here in 2023, that requires us to overcome another challenge: We focus a lot on public policy and not enough on the the operational mechanics of programs and how they work (or don’t) for the person who needs it.  
Yet I have some optimism for this solution for two reasons: It is in the control of state and local officials who care about human services, and digital tools offer real opportunities for simplifying the consumer experience. 
But we need the will to do it — to put the needed focus on efforts to improve service delivery, while still managing the unstoppable policy machine.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota lawmakers are considering giving some of the country’s most profitable tech companies tax breaks on their data centers up to the year 2102 — when most of the legislators and lobbyists furiously negotiating the deal will be dead.
Minnesota currently has 42 data centers, with the majority spread across the metro. Nationwide, tech companies are rapidly building data centers — large warehouses with computer servers used to power the internet — to store and process data. The massive computing power required to develop nascent artificial intelligence breakthroughs are leading companies to seek more data centers.
Minnesota offers sales tax breaks for qualified data centers on purchases of computers, servers, software and cooling and energy equipment. This tax break, which comes in the form of a refund, is set to expire in 2042.
But lawmakers are considering extending the break, perhaps as an olive branch since they’re also going to revoke the sales tax exemption on the electricity that data centers consume. This is expected to generate around $140 million in revenue over the next four years.
Minnesota is facing a multi-billion dollar budget deficit in the next few years, and lawmakers are currently looking to cut programs and services — and a few tax subsidies — to balance the budget.
But since the decision by legislative leaders to revoke the sales tax exemption on electricity will sour the state’s relationship with companies that own data centers, some lawmakers hope expanding current tax breaks far into the future will incentivize companies to keep building their warehouses full of servers in Minnesota.
Amazon recently announced that it’s suspending plans for a large data center in Becker “due to uncertainty” — one week after lawmakers announced they were eliminating the sales tax exemption on electricity.
Gov. Tim Walz on MPR News Friday said that Amazon’s decision to suspend its Becker data center was “pretty bad lobbying” because lawmakers are still negotiating data center provisions.
“We also have one of the most generous tax credits as it stands, but we have to balance our budget. I think a lot of Minnesotans are saying, ‘Well, you couldn’t do a tax cut to my sales tax, but you could do a tax cut to Jeff Bezos.’ I think that was one where it’s right-sized.”
Minnesota law currently allows qualified data centers a sales tax exemption on technology equipment for 20 years, up to the year 2042. But a proposal from Senate Democrats would extend the tax break to 40 years and sunset it at 2062. This means that a data center that makes its first purchase in 2062 could continue claiming the exemption until 2102.
Members of the taxes working group — an unofficial meeting of Senate and House members who are negotiating a budget agreement before Walz calls a special legislative session — are debating the data center tax exemptions.
Sen. Grant Hauschild, DFL-Hermantown, said during a meeting Friday that Minnesota needs to remain competitive with other states.
“We are getting investments from these companies to Minnesota,” Hauschild said. “Other states … have other exemptions that will build these data centers. So we have to understand, do we want investments in Minnesota or do we not want investments?”
Proponents of sales tax exemptions for data centers tout property tax revenue and job creation. But data centers operate with few workers. Like a bridge or highway, once the project is complete, most of the jobs are gone.
And since the number of data centers is growing, the tax breaks will become even more expensive over time.
In Washington State, the tax breaks intended to create jobs have cost more than $474 million since 2018, ProPublica reported. Most of the benefits through the tax breaks went to Microsoft, not local communities.
Minnesota Rep. Aisha Gomez, DFL-Minneapolis, on Friday said that when Minnesota first enacted the sales tax break for data centers in 2011, the state estimated it would forgo $5 million annually in revenue.
But a recent estimate from the Department of Revenue found that even with the elimination of the sales tax break on electricity, the software and other equipment exemption will still cost Minnesota around $100 million annually — and $219 million in fiscal year 2029.
“This is a sales tax exemption that is being asked for by the largest, most profitable corporations that have ever existed on the face of the earth,” Gomez said. “I think it’s really important that we actually look at what this really is, and we look at the powers that are lining up to try to force us to make this decision. And we think long and hard… (about) whether it’s appropriate that this kind of money should be going from the public coffers into the hands of billionaires.”
Data centers are huge consumers of both electricity, and water needed to cool down the equipment.
The Department of Revenue estimated that the 42 data centers in the state consumed 1.6 billion kWh of electricity in 2023.

(Submitted)TOPEKA — Kansas farmers and ranchers are paying close attention to tariffs and whether other countries will show up for negotiations, and they need a Farm Bill to pass in Washington, two agricultural experts said. 
Alan Featherstone, head of the Agricultural Economics department at Kansas State University, and Hal Luthi, president of the Kansas Cattlemen’s Association and a third-generation rancher in Madison, both spend part of their days studying what’s happening in Washington. 


Everything there has an effect on Kansas agriculture, Featherstone said, rattling off a quick list: trade policy, energy policy, interest rates, passage of a Farm Bill, crop and livestock insurance and tax policies.
“There’s just so much uncertainty in the air until Congress and the president begin to resolve some of those policy differences,” he said.
“You compound that with the fact that most of Kansas agriculture did not have good years in 2023, 2024 — most of the income, at least on crop operations, came through government payments,” he said. “I would suspect once the Kansas Farm Management numbers are released that roughly 50% or more of income came from” government payments.
“Probably the only thing that is going well right now is the cow-calf operations; even the feeder operations are struggling,” Featherstone said.
 
Farm Bill passage
Uncertainty is difficult but Luthi is focused more on whether or not a Farm Bill will move on. 
“The ineptitude of our federal government to pass a new Farm Bill is certainly adding to all this because, well, we’re heavy users of the livestock risk insurance, and we don’t know what the future of that program is,” he said. “So if we’d had the Farm Bill enacted when it should have been, well, that would certainly have alleviated a lot of the concerns people have.”
But uncertainty in general, Luthi added, is something farmers are used to.
“We kind of operate on an almost daily basis of uncertainty out here in the countryside anyway, because we don’t know if it’s going to rain,” he said. “We don’t know what world events are going to affect our markets.”

Trade and Kansas
International trade is an important part of the Kansas agricultural economy, Luthi said. 
“China has been a big purchaser of our soybeans and corn,” he said. “But also I think that that’s a two-handed approach. I feel like maybe they need us as bad as we need them, and at some point in time we’re going to come together and come to an agreement.”
Featherstone, whose work is often focused on international markets, said China imported about $1.5 billion of U.S. beef.
“To give an indication of that, the U.S. exported $8.5 billion, and so if you take 1.5 divided by 8.5 that’s a pretty big percentage in terms of where that market is,” he said. “Certainly the ability to export into the China markets is very, very important. If you look at pork it’s probably less of an issue now, but two or three years ago, it was substantially different when they were fighting their Asian swine flu.”
Featherstone said Luthi’s point about China needing U.S. agriculture products is important. 
“A lot of times we look at this from the U.S. perspective, but you also have to look at it from the Chinese perspective,” he said. “For example, on the soybean market, they cannot import all of their soybeans without coming to the U.S. They take about 60% of the world’s market.”
Chinese consumers expect to have soybeans and pork available and that will put pressure on the country’s government to keep trade flowing, Featherstone said. 
It’s not all about tariffs, either, he said. Economists often will look at a “naive” view of trade as in a free market, which assumes no taxes or tariffs.
“That’s not the world we live in,” he said. “I think it’s very important to realize that you’re in a negotiation here where we’re not going from zero tariffs to a 10% tariff. We’re in a situation where tariffs are already affecting the ability to trade. But in other cases, some of the non-tariff barriers are even bigger.”
Those barriers include whether other countries will accept the use of technology the United States uses or if it could cause product bans, Featherstone said. 
He pointed to an announcement two weeks ago between the U.S. and Great Britain that lowered tariffs. 
“My guess is that the Trump administration will back off the tariffs if they’re not getting the negotiations,” Featherstone said. “One is a hard-line view that you’re just going to tariff, and that’s going to be the situation as we move forward. The other is can we use these tariffs to bring countries to the table?”
 
‘Crystal-ball economist’
U.S. agricultural products did see a long-term impact from tariffs put in place by Trump during his first term, Featherstone said. 
“China became more reliant on Brazil, and so certainly some of those markets are lost, but a lot of times they will shift,” he said. “Probably the big thing that I think will occur, and you hear a little bit of discussion of it with the first trade war with China, there was the market facilitation program that essentially tried to provide the difference in price back to the producers.”
While disagreements occur about subsidizing agriculture and farmers prefer to get their income from the markets, Featherstone said another program like that could help Kansas agriculture. 
Farmers received $23 billion to subsidize lost business because of tariffs during Trump’s first administration. 
“My guess, and I’m not a crystal ball economist, but politicians, if there’s something that worked in the past, they may try it again if it’s needed in the future,” he said.
Luthi said tariffs can bring other countries to the negotiating table. He appreciates the fact that discussions are happening.
“We’re pretty resilient,” he said. “People are saying, ‘Well, you know, we may get hurt a little bit, but if it’s for the good of the country in the long term, we’re willing to take that punch in the face.’ And that’s my feeling as well.”
Luthi said the country’s current path of adding to the national debt is not sustainable, and that he hears more people in the rural areas talking about that issue than about tariffs and how they might be affected. 
“A lot of these tariffs aren’t even in effect yet, right? Some of them don’t go into effect ’til July,” he said. “In reality, we hope maybe some of them don’t ever go in place, that we have a new trade agreement or a more fair trade agreement before these tariffs are actually placed on the actual products.”
The rapid-fire changes happening nationally and internationally do make it challenging to plan, Luthi said. That’s especially true because spending has dropped and a recession may loom. 
“We’re gonna probably cut spending in several areas, and wait and see, you know, just what our actual opportunities are,” Luthi said. “If we need a new piece of equipment, we may delay that a year. We’ll certainly budget everything out and probably stand a little more conservative than we did this year.”
The cattle business has been profitable recently, but the two previous years were tight, he said. 
“I guess my biggest concern, maybe, is the country as whole would go into a recession because everybody’s cutting back on their spending and that would affect the beef market, probably in a hurry, because that’s one expense that people would probably tend to cut back on first,” he said. 
 
Looking to the future
Featherstone said he thinks people need to be watchful because so much depends on whether negotiations are successful in getting other countries to the table. 
“Farmers are resilient,” he said. “I think there are things to be resolved, but again, elections have consequences.”
For Luthi, uncertainty is part of his world.
“I don’t know if we’re ever in certain times, you know,” he said. “You know, God has a plan for this world, and we’re just here to utilize and enjoy it as long as we can.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Hal-Luthi-IMG2-1024x703.jpg,,,2025-05-27 11:14:55.706904

The Delaware Department of Justice’s Investor Protection Unit is urging investors to proceed with caution when using financial data aggregators and third-party financial platforms.
Officials warn that while these tools can offer convenience and a comprehensive view of one’s finances, they also pose significant privacy and security risks.
Financial data aggregators—digital services that compile a user’s financial data from various institutions—are increasingly being used by financial professionals to provide clients with a centralized dashboard of their investments, bank accounts, insurance, and even mortgage details.
Some platforms also offer budgeting tools, financial planning, and tax advice.
But officials say users must be vigilant about how their data is accessed, stored, and used.
READ: Delaware hunters set records for deer and turkey harvests
Before sharing sensitive financial information, it’s important for investors to understand the terms and risks involved, officials state.
These services may require access to bank credentials and could facilitate trades or withdrawals on a person’s behalf.
The department highlights two common methods aggregators use to access financial data: “screen scraping,” where the aggregator logs into a user’s account using their credentials, and APIs (application programming interfaces), which allow data to be shared without sharing login information.
The agency advises consumers to:

Read all user agreements carefully to understand what rights are being granted.
Ask what security and privacy measures are in place.
Be cautious about granting access that could enable transactions or withdrawals.
Investigate the platform’s history, including complaints or lawsuits.
Understand the liability and dispute resolution processes in the event of a data breach.

Users are also encouraged to verify whether the aggregator stores login credentials, whether secondary users can access funds, and what happens if financial losses occur as a result of unauthorized access.
The department reminds investors to revoke access and delete accounts with aggregators once they are no longer in use.

Jeff Landry (John Ballance/The Advocate, Pool)It’s in our nature as Louisiana residents to be easy-going, whether you’re a native Cajun like me or someone who’s been drawn to relocate here because of our lifestyle. That’s why we’re always ready for a good time, we prioritize family, friends and fun, and try not to fret about the things we can’t control.
But it’s also a coping mechanism – and probably not a healthy one. How else can you explain our contentment with constantly being on the lower end for quality-of-life ratings for health care, education and poverty? 
This might be what Gov. Jeff Landry was talking about – although in a rather awkward way – in his disappointed reaction to the resounding failure of all four amendments he supported in the March 29 election. 
“We realize how hard positive change can be to implement in a state that is conditioned for failure,” Landry said on election night.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
What the governor doesn’t realize is the part he plays in “conditioning” residents to accept low standards, and why the substantial changes he wants to make to state ethics laws only reinforces the negative perception of Louisiana, both from within and outside the state.
Keep in mind that ethics laws in Louisiana are weak as they currently exist, with minimal consequences for offenders. While some provisions can and should be updated to keep up with the times, the governor has instead set on a path to undermine what little credibility the system has.
Landry’s ethics law retooling has rightfully caught the attention of the Public Affairs Research Council of Louisiana, the state’s pre-eminent good government organization. The nonpartisan group’s leadership made clear where they stand on the legislative package in a recent commentary.  
“That’s the wrong message to send in a state riddled with Louisiana’s long and sordid political history, particularly when polls show public trust in government is at historic lows,” PAR President Steven Procopio and Research Director Melinda Deslatte wrote.
The updates Landry supports include House Bill 674, a complex proposal with dozens of changes in how ethics investigations are conducted. They would give elected officials and government employees questionable leverage to discourage state ethics investigations. 
Authored by Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, the measure would require the ethics administration to turn over witness statements and other documents obtained early in the investigative process to the subject, even if the ethics board decides not to pursue charges.  
Beaullieu has said lawmakers from both parties have complained about the ethics board, arguing it needs to be more transparent. That was evident last year when one of his Democratic colleagues in the Louisiana House, Rep. Steven Jackson of Shreveport, gained decisive approval for two ethics law changes. One reduced how often elected officials have to file their personal financial disclosure forms with the state, and the second dramatically cut the fines lobbyists have to pay if they file paperwork late.
Jackson’s actions followed years of angry exchanges between himself and ethics administration staff over more than $10,000 in fines he was assessed for failure to file campaign finance and personal disclosure reports.   
Do you see a pattern here? Instead of public officials choosing to change the behavior that put them in the crosshairs of ethics investigators, they’ve pushed to change the laws meant to discourage such conduct.
The trend is poised to continue this year. State Ethics Administrator David Bordelon described the new investigative process under Beaullieu’s measure as “skewed” in favor of a public servant accused of wrongdoing. “It presents some sort of questionable standards,” he told ethics board members at a meeting last month. 
The origin story of Beaullieu’s legislation speeds past “questionable” and steers directly toward dubious.   
It was written with the help of Stephen Gelé, an attorney who has represented the governor in front of the ethics board. When he was attorney general, Landry failed to disclose he took free flights on a donor’s private plane for a conference in Hawaii in 2021. Though House Bill 674 wouldn’t affect the outcome of charges that have been pending against Landry for two years and counting, it would hinder comparable investigations in the future.
More proposed ethics law changes, all with Landry’s blessing, would further discourage accountability for elected officials and government workers. 
House Bill 160 from Rep. Kellee Dickerson, R-Denham Springs, would end the public’s ability to confidentially or anonymously report illegal activity. The ethics board has warned lawmakers it would have a “chilling effect” on people coming forward to report wrongdoing by public employees and leaders.
Another Beaullieu proposal, House Bill 674, would end a prohibition in state law on government employees and elected officials from receiving gifts under most circumstances. Between “seasonal or holiday food” and regular gifts, the largesse could reach up to $400 in value  annually. 
When you think of the potential to grease the skids of bureaucracy with a $100 gift card here or $100 worth of festive fare there, you should get an idea of why Beaullieu’s bill might be cause for concern. If not, you don’t have to look very far back to find out why – at both the state and local level.  
There’s been minimal resistance to Landry’s offensive against state ethics law, which started last year when he got lawmakers to approve giving him more direct control of the ethics board’s makeup. And while this year’s legislation appears to pack a significant punch, it might just be the first in a years-long assault on the minimal virtues left in Louisiana government.

(Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)The tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week targets a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government. The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.
Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.
But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.
Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

She credited growing up a single child for her passion for cinema, reading, music, and art. Her eyes lit up when she told stories of going to double features with her mother, visiting the Morgan Library, or seeing Glenn Miller and Frank Sinatra with her college friends.Bright and curious, editor of her high school paper, after graduating from Finch College and Packard Business School, she was proud to have worked at the Research Institute of America with Leo Cherne, leader of the International Rescue Committee and advocate for liberation and sanctuary for some of the world’s most persecuted people. Later, as a real estate agent she was applauded for her commitment to Fair Housing and as a Census lead assured people from all walks of life were counted, memorably bringing a pocket copy of the constitution to one reluctant person to show that counting everyone was enshrined in our founding document.Pat married Roland Marx in 1952 at the Eglise de la Madeleine in Paris, where many of Roland’s extended family lives and where he was stationed after the war. They returned to live in Paris where she learned the French language and culture and traveled throughout Europe and beyond. Her artistic sensibility shone in her style, quilting, restoration, and more.Mom/Mama was greatly loved by and loving to her four children, twelve grandchildren, and six great grandchildren (so far). “La famille avant tout,” she devoted herself to supporting their many dreams and aspirations. A fabulous cook, delicious food was the center of many large family gatherings, for the past decades in and around Belmont, Vermont.Wherever she lived, Pat formed enduring friendships. Her stories about those friends were hilarious, heartbreaking, and imbued with warmth. You could count on Pat to be kind and helpful, then turn your head with her quick dry wit. Too many to mention, thank you all for making her life more meaningful, engaged, and fun.Pat was an active community member and leader. As a girl she knitted sweaters for WWII navy sailors. Later she launched a chapter of the League of Women Voters, helped preserve Turkey Mountain in Yorktown NY where she served on the Conservation Advisory Council, supported three Friends of the Library, and much more. Into her nineties she was writing postcards to get progressive democratic candidates elected to office.Pat/Mom/Mama is celebrated by her husband Roland Marx; her children Robert Marx (Nancy Pendleton), Audrey Alonis (née Marx, Joe Alonis), Brendan Marx (formerly Sandi née Handelman and Renee née Laverdiere DiLauro), and Elisabeth Marx (John Marco); her twelve grandchildren Hayden Marx, William Marx, Andrew Alonis (Jane Fairchild), Patrick Alonis, Amelia Alonis, Kira Marx (bientôt James Seidman), Lindsey Marx (Michael Rappaport), Ryan Marx (Lauren Wiener), Colette DiLauro (Tony Cennamo), Celeste DiLauro, Linus Marco (Kayla Feldman), Nina Marco; and her great-grandchildren Walter Alonis, Jack and Jordon Rappaport, and Joel, Luke, and Connor Marco.Pat had a natural burial surrounded by family at the Vermont Forest Cemetery.

Missouri imposes provider taxes on hospitals, nursing homes, ambulances and pharmacies. In fiscal 2018, provider taxes provided just over 17% of the $10.3 billion spent on Medicaid services and administration.
For the coming budget year, state lawmakers appropriated $1.1 billion from the taxes to support Missouri Medicaid services, drawing approximately $2.2 billion in federal support. Overall, the Medicaid program is expected to cost just under $16 billion in the coming year.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation.

To do her part in making sure that doesn’t happen, Caín-Yuqilema kept her Kichwa language alive in the classrooms of Michigan State University by sharing it with community members.
“Kichwa is an endangered language, and if it ever disappears, it will be because of us: from the language not being passed down by parents to the change in traditional clothing. I believe that in Ecuador, we lack appreciation for ourselves, we Kichwa speakers,” she said.

Caín-Yuqilema, 32, arrived at MSU from Ecuador a year ago, as part of a cultural and academic exchange through the Fulbright Program. Elsita, as her friends affectionately call her, embarked on this adventure once again outside her country, but this time not just as an exchange student, but also as a teacher of her culture.
Through engaging classes and cultural events, Caín-Yuqilema taught Kichwa, her first language and the native tongue of the Andean peoples in South America, to undergraduate students. At the same time, alongside Indigenous student organizations, she organized cultural events for community members, never missing an opportunity to showcase a piece of the Indigenous traditions of Ecuador that she grew up with and lived with.
Caín-Yuqilema has a soft and calm voice. Filling her voice with warm emotion, she shared how the MSU community has appreciated and admired every part of her culture. Every Kichwa word spoken in class, every song shared at a cultural event, is a thread she wove, connecting the two worlds: the Indigenous traditions of Ecuador and the American society.
Among her students, words of excitement and gratitude are expressed at having learned about a new culture through language. They appreciated that these types of classes are offered at the university, where cultural exchange and the expansion of perspectives are encouraged through native-speaking professors from other countries.
“I looked through the MSU catalog and saw that Kichwa was being taught in person, so I was really excited to see that and kind of jumped at the opportunity to start learning. I’m so, so happy that I did. I didn’t have much of a connection with Ecuador or any other South American country. I do now.”, said Drake Howard, a linguistics student.
“We’re really lucky at MSU to be able to take courses in a language that doesn’t have very many resources online,” Howard highlighted.

This process of cultural exchange made her feel much more confident about her own culture. Caín-Yuqilema belongs to the Kichwa Puruhá ethnic group, from the region of Riobamba, in the province of Chimborazo, Ecuador. She learned Kichwa from her family, passed down by her parents and grandparents, while Spanish, her second language, was taught at school and in the community. Later, as a young woman, she learned English at university.
Although English and Spanish are the dominant languages in Ecuador, Kichwa has remained within her as her own. Caín-Yuqilema explained that it is common to see young people who no longer know the native language or wear traditional clothing. For many Kichwa speakers, not speaking Spanish “properly,” as a second language, makes them subject to uncomfortable stares and corrections, even in their own country.
“After several decades of struggle by our fathers and mothers, fortunately in Ecuador, Kichwa has been more accepted by society in recent years; however, there is still much work to do,” Caín-Yuqilema said.

According to UNESCO, in Andean countries with a Kichwa majority, such as Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador, there is an accelerated loss of the language, primarily due to migration and the death of speakers. Furthermore, the low appreciation for culture and language means it is not passed down from generation to generation, driven by social and cultural integration in places where Spanish is the dominant language.
Despite being a vulnerable language, Kichwa, more than just a language, has become a cultural bridge that connects Indigenous roots with international academic spaces, including in Michigan. Caín-Yuqilema built and maintained that bridge by bringing with her her words, her clothing, her stories, and her worldview to the MSU community members who may have never heard about the lives of Andean peoples in South America.
“Kichwa education brought me here, and this experience has been a learning experience. I’m taking the best of education and culture from here, and I hope I’ve left the best of mine,” Caín-Yuqilema stated.

Perfect timing to inspire the hope and connection that is at the show’s heart, cast members say.
New Stage Theatre is among the first regional theaters, and first in the Southeast, to mount a production of the hit Broadway musical, which ended its North American tour just weeks ago. Performances are May 27-June 8.
The musical is based on actual events in the immediate aftermath of the shocking tragedy of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when the shut down of U.S. airspace forced hundreds of planes to divert to Canada. Thirty-eight flights were forced to land in Gander in Newfoundland, a small town facing the sudden influx of about 7,000 people stranded far from home. Their hospitality and volunteer efforts are at the core of a joyous musical.
“Come From Away” unfolds in storyteller fashion, as an ensemble cast of 12 morphs into some 50 characters in dozens of scenes over the fast-paced musical’s 90-minute run time. The Celtic-inspired folk rock score links to Newfoundland’s musical heritage, and scrims hand-painted by Scenic Designer Braden Graves evoke the province’s landscape. A dozen chairs and a few tables are about the only props, as the actors, through costume bits, accents, physicality and sheer skill, sweep audiences along.
The custom motorized and programmable turntable on stage, newly engineered and built from scratch by the theater’s production team, keeps the story in motion. At 24 feet in diameter at its max, the turntable also adds a significant asset to New Stage’s drama toolkit, available for future productions and possible rental. “The stars aligned for me this season” and for this show, Technical Director Richard Lawrence said, with a crew that included three welders and an engineer. He chuckled, recalling nightly worries whether it would work. Once they mounted it, he rounded up a dozen crew members to stand on it, to test. “We turned it. And it worked. And I cried,” he said, laughing in relief.

About a week before opening night, actors had just finished a run-through, but had yet to experience their first “ride-through” on the turntable set. “This is magic!” veteran actor Ray McFarland (here in his 51st New Stage show) gushed as he eyed the stage’s new feature. “I’ve never seen this except on, like, Broadway — this big of a turntable. Hats off to the tech crew.”
With the emotional peaks and valleys of “Come From Away,” fresh in mind, actors reflected on memories and feelings its stories call up, from the anguish and scary confusion of the 9/11 attacks to the way this fleshes out a historical event some were too young to understand in the moment.
Actor John Howell saw the Broadway production, the same day he visited the 9/11 Memorial & Museum in 2018. “It really brought it to life in a way that a museum can’t do, because it was the personal stories of these people who actually experienced this — all these different points of view … and all of them have different reactions and needs and losses. Very powerful.”
Actor Hosea Griffith, a French Elementary first-grader in 2001, said the news arrived just after students finished their Pledge of Allegiance and “You’re a Grand Old Flag” morning routine. The principal told teachers to turn on their TVs. He saw the adults slump, their energy evaporate. “The whole mood of class and of that day — the life was sucked out of it.”

For Lauren Parkinson, 2 at the time with no firsthand memory of 9/!!, “This show has revealed a lot to me about that day that I could never learn from watching videos on YouTube. … This is making it real for me in a brand new way.”
McFarland, who had returned to Jackson after a 15-year stint in New York, thought of people he knew who worked in the Word Trade Center and had the searing thought, “We’re at war.” 
“If you’re old enough to remember, it will grab you in a very personal moment,” he said of the show. “You will remember things that happened that day, as clear as a bell. It will also help you remember all of the good that came out of it, because, as we watched on the TV, the world came to take care of us. We took care of each other, and that’s what this show is about.”
The show is more about the aftermath of 9/11, and how people banded together and coped. Many times, people cope with humor, “and there’s some stuff in this show that’s just downright funny,” McFarland noted.

“You have all these people from all these cultures from all around the world stuck here in this teeny tiny Canadian town, and it’s hilarious what happens because of that,” Parkinson said.
The musical lands in Jackson at a time when President Trump’s musing about Canada as a 51st state, tariff talks and more in recent months has eroded relations between the two nations. It delivers real-life historical perspective and a reminder of the healing power of strong bonds that can last years.
“It could not be at a better time,” McFarland said. “We need to take care of each other and come together more than we have in decades right now.”
“I think this show might be a tonic to audiences,” Howell said. “It might be something that they need right now.”
Said McFarland: “It’s not just about taking care of each other, personally. It’s about taking care of America. We took care of America back then.”
“And Canada helped us,” Howell was quick to add. 
“On the individual level, people care about each other,” he said. “Whatever their political leanings may be and where that takes them, when it comes down to the wire and people are in a crisis, they will come to each other’s aid, regardless of where they live, regardless of who they’re having to assist.”
Griffith said, “People just see humanity on that stage, just humanity, and realize that there is humanity in all of us. And though we are different, we’re not too much different.”

Phil Scott says he’d veto S.131, but his reasons to do so make no sense.Scott says he opposes S.131 because Burlington bar owners could enforce it and Burlington would be the only community in the state having such a ban, and because S.131 wouldn’t fix Burlington’s violence problem. First, police would enforce the new law, just as they enforce any law — e.g., speed limits, stop signs, drunk driving, etc. Bar owners can’t afford metal detectors and don’t want those machines anyway because they send the wrong message to patrons (that violence is so bad in Burlington that metal detectors are needed).Second, Burlington wants and needs S.131: the voters, the mayor and police chief, and bar owners, for good reasons, especially with Burlington’s disturbing uptick in violence. S.131 isn’t designed to fix Burlington’s citywide violence, just the potential for violence around sensitive places such as bars and restaurants serving alcohol. The homicide on Church Street last August just outside the Red Square Bar shows how important S.131 is. READ MORE
Furthermore, laws don’t eliminate crime: they set reasonable limits with clear consequences and hold scofflaws accountable. S.131 would make Burlington safer.Third, Scott opposes S.131 because it’s only Burlington focused and no other town or city in Vermont would ban guns in bars, BUT he’d oppose a statewide ban, too. He’s trying to have his cake and eat it, too, with senseless logic, as if to say, “I don’t support S.131 because it doesn’t go far enough, but even if it did, I’d oppose it, too.”Again, his view makes no sense. “The good is the enemy of the perfect, but I oppose both.”I’d like to ask the governor to imagine he’s in a bar relaxing after a stressful day & disturbance erupts. Fists fly, pool cues are snapped over the billiard table and glass scatters across the floor. How would he feel being in there knowing guns were okay in the bar?Stupid things can happen in bars and, as the tragedy last August shows, they can be fatal when guns are involved. Guns and alcohol are a bad mix.Scott is wrong to oppose S.131 and his reasons fail to show he cares enough for the safety of Burlington’s citizens, period.Sincerely,Bob Williamson (founding member of Gun Sense Vermont)South WoodstockRead the story on VTDigger here:  Bob Williamson: Gov.

[…]","A payday advance neon sign is seen in this undated photo. (Photo by EHStock/Getty Images)On the 120th and last day of Alaska’s annual legislative session, the state House passed a bill that would curb high interest rates and fees for payday loans of $25,000 or less. 
The Senate passed Senate Bill 35 in late April, and the House passed the bill Tuesday by a vote of 24 to 16. The bill now is set to be transmitted to Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s desk.
If the bill becomes law, it would remove payday lenders from an exemption in state lending laws and cap interest rates and fees at an annual percentage rate, or APR, of 36% for loans of $25,000 or less. 
Anchorage Democrats Sen. Forrest Dunbar and Rep. Ted Eischeid sponsored the legislation in the Senate and House. 
“This bill closes a harmful special exemption that has allowed lenders to charge outrageous interest rates on small loans,” Dunbar said in a statement after the vote. “With this change, Alaskans will have the same consumer protections that apply to other loans, reducing the risk of debt traps and keeping more money in our communities.”
An estimated 15,000 Alaskans take out a payday loan each year, according to research by the nonprofit Alaska Public Interest Research Group. Payday loans are short-term, high-cost loans, often for small amounts that are meant to be paid back on the borrower’s next pay day. Interest rates can range from 194% to 521%, and advocates of the bill said it’s a consumer protection measure that could help borrowers avoid becoming trapped in a cycle of debt and repayment of more payday loans. 
“Instead of fixing a problem, this exception to the Small Loans Act has been more like giving a thirsty person a glass of salt water,” Eischeid said on the House floor ahead of the vote. “It doesn’t help in the long term.”
Eischeid pointed to the Military Lending Act, which already established a cap at 36% total annual percentage rate for loans to military service personnel. 
“Veterans, on the other hand, do not have similar protections and are targeted by payday lenders and are vulnerable to these excessive fees and interests,” Eischeid said. “We should provide safeguards in the marketplace, so Alaskans aren’t the victims. It’s time to remove the loophole to payday loans and protect Alaskan families from predatory lending practices.” 
Rep. Jamie Allard, R-Eagle River, opposed the bill. 
“This is government overreach. Individuals should be able to take loans as they wish, at whatever percentage rate. And frankly, there’s credit cards that have a higher interest rate than what we’re doing right now, today, and I don’t see that in this bill,” she said. 
High interest loans can present dilemmas regarding governance and oversight. One day after the Legislature passed the bill, the Anchorage Daily News and ProPublica published an investigation spotlighting a tribal lending business, Minto Money, based in the small community of Minto outside Fairbanks. The story details how online lending at high interest rates is highly lucrative, but highlights ethical concerns, community divisions and questions around who benefits. 
While the company does not lend to people in Alaska, the investigation found, there is an effort to attract other Alaska villages to the lending industry. 
“Tribes in America are in demand as business partners because they can claim that, as sovereign entities, their operations are exempt from state interest rate caps,” the authors wrote. “Critics of such lending partnerships have called them ‘rent-a-tribe.’”
Dunbar said the legislation was developed before he became aware of the lender. He responded to the story’s findings in an email on Friday. “I applaud the investigative coverage of the ADN/ProPublica on a particular payday lender who appears to have engaged in the kind of practices that highlight why reform was necessary. Without clear limits, too many Alaskans have faced a lack of safe borrowing options and have often been left with only predatory choices.”
He said it’s notable that every registered payday lending company that operates in Alaska is based outside of the state, and the vast majority of these transactions are done online. The bill includes a provision to prevent companies from evading state interest-rate caps.
“I am glad that the bill included an anti-evasion clause and provisions to limit ‘rent-a-bank’ practices,” Dunbar said. 
Once transmitted to Dunleavy, he has 20 days excluding Sundays to sign the bill, veto it or allow it to become law without his signature.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Three years after lawmakers put $1 million toward advocacy efforts for children in the court system statewide, two revived nonprofits are starting to support children again.
Volunteers with local Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) programs advocate for children who’ve been removed from their families and placed in state care due to suspected abuse and neglect. The volunteers meet with the children and other contacts, such as teachers, therapists and caseworkers. They also write reports to judges about the children’s needs, strengths and interests.
“This process is crucial as it gives the child a voice in the legal proceedings concerning their welfare,” said CASA state director Sara Kelly in an emailed statement. 
Over 330 CASA volunteers worked with 658 children in 37 counties last year, according to the state Unified Judicial System. Most of the state’s 1,049 active cases involving CASA last year — with or without a volunteer — were in the Sioux Falls and Rapid City areas.
This is the first time in 16 years that the state has operated CASA organizations in all of its circuit courts. The Sixth Circuit, in central South Dakota, and the Fifth Circuit, representing northeastern South Dakota, closed in 2009.
Federal cut to children’s advocacy funding ‘abandons American children,’ says SD nonprofit leader

Gloria Hutson, in Aberdeen, was hired to lead the reestablished Fifth Circuit CASA in November last year. She told the state CASA Commission at its Wednesday meeting that three counties within her 10-county jurisdiction have a high case volume: Brown, Walworth and Spink counties.
“The focus these last six months has been on building a solid, sustainable structure while building deep community roots,” Hutson said.
Walworth County has a “disproportionate” number of cases for its population, and many involve the Indian Child Welfare Act, Hutson said. The federal Indian Child Welfare Act sets minimum standards for efforts to reunite tribal children in the state’s custody with their families. Walworth county is adjacent to the Standing Rock and Cheyenne River reservations.
As of the end of April, Walworth County had 25 pending cases involving 52 children. Brown County had 32 cases involving 58 children and Spink County had three cases involving three children.
Fifty-seven cases were active in the Fifth Circuit last year, and none of the children had CASA representation, according to UJS. Through April this year, the circuit had 61 pending cases involving 117 children, Hutson said.
Most of those children still do not have CASA volunteers advocating for them. Fifth Circuit CASA has eight volunteers so far, two of whom are advocating for three children. All the children are younger than 2 years old.
Laurie Gill, a former state Department of Social Services secretary who now works with Maxwell Strategy Group, leads CASA for the Sixth Circuit. Gill’s firm was hired to lead the nonprofit, and Gill said the contract was renewed recently by the nonprofit’s board of directors.
Sixth Circuit CASA, which represents 14 counties in central South Dakota, including Hughes County and the state capital city of Pierre, intends to train 10 volunteers this year. The first will be sworn in and assigned cases by June, Gill said.
Thirty-nine cases were active in the Sixth Circuit last year. There were 45 pending cases involving 94 children at the end of April, Gill said. Most are in the Pierre/Fort Pierre area.
The 2022 funding from the Legislature was a result of lawmakers learning about the holes in South Dakota’s CASA coverage, after loosening a requirement to appoint advocates for abused and neglected children in the court system. Lawmakers on the state budget committee approved funding to help restart the two shuttered programs and help existing CASA programs expand.
The Fifth and Sixth Circuit organizations have each received $120,000 so far.
Another $143,715was awarded to most other CASA programs. 
The need for volunteers remains one of the biggest challenges for CASA nonprofits across the state, leaders told the commission. Since last year’s report, the number of volunteers has dropped from 330 statewide to 318.
National CASA guidelines require one staff member to supervise a maximum of 30 volunteers. Each volunteer is assigned one case at a time, typically staying with a case until it’s resolved.
The Sioux Falls CASA reports 333 children currently on the waiting list to be represented by a volunteer. The Seventh Circuit CASA in Rapid City reports 455 children on its waiting list.



The 2022 Legislature appropriated $1 million to the Unified Judicial System to award South Dakota CASA nonprofits with grants to rebuild or expand. About $384,000 – less than 40% of the funds – have been spent so far:

$120,000 to the Fifth Circuit CASA in Aberdeen
$120,000 to the Sixth Circuit CASA in Pierre
$58,400 to the Southeast CASA in Yankton
$40,835 to the First Circuit CASA in Mitchell
$25,000 to the East Central CASA in Brookings
$15,000 to the Sioux Falls Area CASA
$2,000 to the Seventh Circuit CASA in Rapid City

State legislators on Friday halted hundreds of bills with new spending attached from advancing. Why? The Legislature again underwent its relatively opaque process known as the “suspense file.” Hanging over lawmakers’ heads is the expected $12 billion state budget deficit that is projected to worsen due to federal tariffs and increased state health care spending.
The Assembly and Senate’s appropriations committees hold these proceedings twice a year. As CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang and Yue Stella Yu explain, 32% of 1,098 measures were held in the committees on Friday — meaning those proposals are essentially dead or shelved for the year. 

Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat and chairperson of the Assembly appropriations committee: “Many good bills are going to fall by the wayside today. We are not in a year where we can be expanding programs, developing new offices, new agencies, new departments and expanding our footprints.”

The Assembly trimmed about the same number of bills compared to last May, while the Senate squashed a slightly higher percentage of bills (29% compared to 25.5% in 2024), according to longtime lobbyist Chris Micheli.
Some notable bills that didn’t advance included ones that would have expanded health care services, such as a proposal to seek federal approval to cover some housing services under Medi-Cal, an insurance program for low-income residents, and another to allow more Medi-Cal patients to receive home-based care.
Two crime bills, both introduced by Republicans, were also spiked. One would have barred some prisoners from being released early through the state’s elderly parole program, and the other would have increased penalties for giving fentanyl to minors.
But the committees did pass 742 other bills, including a proposal by Assemblymember Rick Zbur and backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom to expand tax credits for the state’s film industry. Though language to increase the state’s film tax credit to $750 million annually was struck from the bill, the specific amount is expected to be ironed out during budget negotiations, said Zbur, a Los Angeles Democrat.
The bills that survived on Friday will face another hurdle next week, when they must advance out of the chamber — Assembly or Senate — where they were introduced.

Big state deficits through 2029

The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office agrees with the Newsom administration that the state is “likely to face persistent future deficits” which are expected to range from $10 billion to $20 billion through the next four years.The latest number-crunching by the analyst’s office dropped Saturday, a typical occurrence that follows the governor’s unveiling earlier this month of his updated state budget plan, which also projected years of operating deficits in the tens of billions.
One of Newsom’s key proposals to help reduce spending and plug the budget hole is to limit new Medi-Cal recipients, particularly freezing enrollment for adult immigrants who do not have permanent legal status. The office recommends that the Legislature should “maintain at least the level of ongoing solutions” as proposed by the governor, but could adopt “additional solutions” in anticipation of future deficits.
Some bit of good news: Because of slightly higher revenue estimates, the analyst’s office projects that this year’s budget condition will improve by nearly $2 billion compared to the administration’s assessment. But uncertain “federal budget changes” are likely to add more financial pressures on the state, according to the office.All this info will shape the discussions between lawmakers and Newsom as they craft a budget deal for the next year by late June. 



How federal budget bill could impact Medi-Cal

Speaking of “federal budget changes” the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives last week advanced a budget package that could have major effects on millions of low-income Californians enrolled in Medicaid. 
Nationally, the bill guts Medicaid spending by $700 billion, which could lead to California losing as much as $20 billion a year and 217,000 jobs, according to an April analysis by the UC Berkeley Labor Center. 
To reduce costs, the bill proposes cutting funding for states that provide coverage to immigrants without legal status, which would affect California. It would also limit the number of new enrollees by imposing proof of work hours. 
About 15 million Californians are on Medi-Cal, the state’s implementation of Medicaid. But roughly 29% of Medi-Cal recipients are unable to work due to caregiving responsibilities, school, having a disability or other reasons. The new work requirements could jeopardize coverage for as many as 3.5 million Californians according to a Center on Budget and Policy Priorities analysis.
The House advanced the bill with all 43 California Democrats voting against it and all nine GOP members — who represent a total of 2.5 million Medi-Cal enrollees — voting for it. At least one right-leaning group in California says the cuts are warranted to curb federal spending.
The U.S. Senate has to approve the bill, but some GOP senators say the bill doesn’t cut enough to address the national debt.

The net effect of this bill would disenfranchise Vermont property taxpayers, shifting their Town Meeting Day power at the ballot box to future Legislatures in Montpelier.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sen. Thomas Chittenden: Freedom and Unity in our education system.","This commentary is by Sen. Thomas Chittenden, D-Chittenden Southeast.This session of the Legislature has been intensely focused on education reform. Our current education financing system, implemented in the ‘90s, drew inspiration from the Vermont Supreme Court decision often referred to as “Brigham.”Brigham has loomed large in this current debate and is fundamentally grounded in Section 68 of our state constitution, which states that “a competent number of schools ought to be maintained in each town unless the general assembly permits other provisions for the convenient instruction of youth.”Our constitution clearly recognizes the distinct roles of towns and the state in delivering public education. It does not lay the direct responsibility to educate our kids on the state; rather, it recognizes each town’s responsibility to maintain “a competent number of schools” and leaves it to those towns to determine what constitutes competency.Simultaneously, it empowers the General Assembly to make “provisions for the convenient instruction of youth.” This recognizes a need for balance between local control (freedom) and centralized state oversight (unity).As the Brigham decision concluded, “Equal opportunity does not necessarily require precisely equal per capita expenditures, nor does it necessarily prohibit cities and towns from spending more on education if they choose, but it does not allow a system in which educational opportunity is necessarily a function of district wealth.”An education foundation formula is a common mechanism used in other states to ensure a baseline of educational quality while allowing districts to spend above that. However, the current education transformation bill passed by the House does not align with this principle. It establishes a “foundation” equal to or exceeding current spending levels, essentially becoming the “whole house” rather than a “foundation.”READ MORE
I am not convinced that what this bill contemplates is what Vermont wants. I am not convinced that Vermont wants Montpelier dictating education spending throughout Vermont with a uniform property tax rate for the whole state to fund a Montpelier-defined level of spending.This would represent far too much unity and not enough freedom, concentrating power in Montpelier, and putting in place a system where future Legislatures, rather than local property owners and parents, would set spending and tax levels for our schools. I do not support this degree of power consolidation to the Statehouse — not this year nor in future years.This proposed legislation drastically tips the balance from local control (freedom) towards state control (unity) in ways I do not support. As Ethan Allen noted, “The Gods of the Valley are Not the Gods of the Hills,” highlighting Vermont’s diverse values and priorities.Our lived experiences in Canaan differ from those in Colchester, and these differences are naturally reflected in how we educate our kids (among other things). Our approaches and priorities will diverge, and our systems must respect this diversity to the greatest extent possible — which our state constitution clearly does.What I do support is consolidating the number of our school districts (119) to reduce administrative overhead, achieve economies of scale, enhance curricular depth and increase consistency for our kids across Vermont. And I support the timeline for this work outlined in the House bill, with a clear understanding that elementary schools, vital community centers, should not be closed.Kindergarten through fifth grade students need nearby schools with short bus rides. However, we can improve middle and high school delivery through more rational design and district consolidation, offering greater curricular depth with 21st-century facilities.And what I do support is to reinstate strong spending controls using the currently dormant  allowable growth spending caps on local districts starting with fiscal year 2027. Coupled with lowering our excess spending threshold penalty to be below the allowable cap, this would be a much less invasive mechanism than what is contemplated in H.454 to drive down education spending without silencing the community voice.Our current system, despite its imperfections, maintains a balance between freedom and unity. We simply need to apply more unity using existing tools and more rational school district governance to reduce spending, achieve efficiencies and improve curricular depth and consistency. We are paying too much in property taxes, and I believe we are overspending on education for a continually declining student population. To lower property taxes, we must calibrate our school offerings and reduce spending to match our shrinking student numbers. I do not believe the high foundation formula in H.454 will achieve this, either next year or in five years.The net effect of this bill would disenfranchise Vermont property taxpayers, shifting their Town Meeting Day power at the ballot box to future Legislatures in Montpelier. These future legislatures would then determine education funding levels, rather than allowing each town to define what constitutes “competent” education. The gods of the hills are not the gods of the valley, so towns need to be deeming that — not Montpelier.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Sen.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)After nearly a month, the Eaton and Palisades wildfires that ravaged California have been contained. But for Southern California and state agencies, another challenge lies ahead: Helping people find homes.
The wildfires levied significant long-term damage, with thousands of homes destroyed, billions in damages and a worsening of the state’s housing and homelessness crises. Even before the fires, California already had a shortage of 1.2 million affordable homes, with Los Angeles County alone facing a deficit of 500,000 units.
“This tragic loss will certainly make the housing crisis more acute in multiple ways,” said Ryan Finnigan, an associate research director at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley. “L.A. continues to need vastly more affordable housing, and people displaced from lost affordable units might need the most support to become stably housed again.”
Even those displaced from market-rate or high-end housing will face challenges in an already tight market, with thousands searching for housing at once — likely driving prices even higher for everyone.
Natural disasters are worsening the U.S. housing crisis, upending the home insurance market, and reducing housing options — particularly for lower-income residents. And that trend will likely grow as disasters become more frequent and severe.
 

Climate change, experts warn, is the world’s fastest-growing driver of homelessness, displacing millions of people annually. In 2022 alone, disasters forced 32.6 million people worldwide from their homes, according to a 2023 report by the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre.
If trends continue, 1.2 billion people globally could be displaced due to disasters by 2050, according to the international think tank Institute for Economics & Peace.
The consequences are already playing out.
After the 2023 Maui wildfires, homelessness in Hawaii rose by 87%. With Los Angeles’ fires destroying about six times as many homes, experts predict that California’s homeless population will surge dramatically in 2025.
“Natural disasters cause a massive spike in homelessness,” said Jeremy Ney, a macroeconomics policy strategist who studies American inequality. “The primary goal of relief organizations like the Red Cross is to prevent people from becoming permanently unhoused — but for many, it can take a decade or more to recover.”
  A long path to recovery 

According to the Migration Policy Institute, 3.2 million U.S. adults were displaced or evacuated because of natural disasters in 2022, with more than 500,000 still unable to return home by the end of the year.
The recovery timeline can be grueling. In North Carolina, state officials managing Hurricane Helene’s recovery warned that key federal funding for home reconstruction could be delayed for months — possibly into next fall, according to NC Newsline.
In the event of a disaster, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, known as FEMA, focuses on shorter-term relief, offering emergency shelters, disaster unemployment assistance and grants for rebuilding. State agencies, though, are tasked with the long-term projects, such as making infrastructure repairs and developing housing initiatives, said Samantha Batko, a senior fellow in the Housing and Communities Division at the Urban Institute.
“Disaster relief programs like FEMA focus on short-term recovery, whereas homelessness response systems struggle with long-term systemic challenges,” said Batko. “People who live in unsheltered places during disasters, like on street corners or in cars, have higher exposure to ash [from fires] and debris, which leads to more health issues and emergency room visits.”
 

At the time of the Eaton fire, Los Angeles’ Skid Row was home to roughly 2,200 unsheltered people, experiencing some of the worst air quality effects, according to Batko, who co-authored a report on the issue for the institute.
Los Angeles’ homelessness crisis was already dire: Last year, Los Angeles County had just 27,000 shelter beds for 75,000 unhoused residents. The fires have now left thousands more without homes, further straining an already overwhelmed system.
“The relevant governments — state and federal agencies, L.A. County and its 88 cities — must be on the same page to mount an organized and effective response,” said Finnigan, of the Terner Center for Housing Innovation.
There may be another twist coming.
When President Donald Trump visited western North Carolina last month, he floated the idea of eliminating FEMA and leaving disaster response to the states, with federal reimbursement of some costs. He has since signed an executive order calling for a full assessment of FEMA and recommendations for “improvements or structural changes.” State emergency managers quickly responded that they need FEMA’s involvement.
  Insurance challenges 

Disaster recovery is not equal: Homeowners with insurance typically rebound the fastest, as policies cover much of the rebuilding costs. But as climate disasters intensify, the insurance market has begun to unravel. In 2023, insurers lost money on homeowners’ coverage in 18 states — more than a third of the country — according to a New York Times analysis.
It’s led to an insurance crisis — rising premiums, reduced coverage or insurers pulling out altogether — a trend that began in California, Florida and Louisiana but that has spread across the country.
Even before this winter’s fires, these insurance issues would have been a defining legislative issue for California, predicted Alexandra Alvarado, director of education and marketing at the American Apartment Owners Association, an industry lobbying group.
“There’s a great anxiety from … property owners on whether they will be insured or covered when another wildfire or a similar event costs them their home, and whether it’s worth it to rebuild and start over,” Alvarado told Stateline in December. “I think it’s going to be on the radar of lawmakers not just in our state, because we’re seeing this play out in other states as well.”
 

During the fires, California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara reminded insurers of their legal duty to cover mudslide damage caused by recent wildfires, as colder, wetter weather raises risks, particularly for Los Angeles County wildfire survivors.
Already, State Farm, the largest home insurer in California, has asked the state to approve “emergency” rate hikes because of the fires, seeking an average 22% increase for homeowners and 15% for renters.
  Barriers for lower-income residents 

The long-term recovery process is filled with hurdles — especially for low-income and marginalized communities.
Lower-income households are disproportionately vulnerable to climate disasters; they’re also disproportionately harmed. Residents may reside in older, high-risk homes that are more susceptible to destruction. In some places, lower-income neighborhoods were built in low-lying flood plains because land was cheaper or red-lining kept families of color from living elsewhere.
Many households cannot afford homeowners or flood insurance, and strict eligibility criteria may prevent them from qualifying for disaster relief loans, said Katie Arrington, a disaster recovery expert for Boulder County, Colorado.




Natural disasters cause a massive spike in homelessness.

Renters, mobile home residents and uninsured households often can’t afford homes comparable to the ones lost to disaster. Without financial safety nets, many displaced residents face an impossible choice: endure months or years of instability, or leave their community altogether.
“People with insurance have an easier time recovering than people without it. Homeowners, in general, recover more easily than renters,” Arrington said. “There’s a spectrum, from homeowners with full insurance to renters without insurance, and each group faces very different recovery timelines.”
One major barrier to recovery for renters is the post-disaster surge in housing costs. A Brookings Institution report published in October 2023 shows that effective rents typically rise 4% after a disaster and remain elevated for at least five years.
In the past few weeks in Los Angeles, fire-affected neighborhoods such as Venice and Santa Monica saw rents surge by 60-100% within days, fueling calls for stronger enforcement of California’s anti-price gouging laws.
California lawmakers in January allocated billions in funding to state and federal government relief efforts and put an immediate moratorium on evictions. The governor’s office also has issued an executive order prohibiting Los Angeles-area landlords from evicting tenants who provide shelter to survivors of the Los Angeles-area firestorms.
  Experience and luck 

For many municipalities, past experience is the only real preparation for disaster recovery. And sometimes, a bit of luck helps, too.
In 2021, the Marshall Fire in Colorado forced the evacuation of 35,000 residents in Boulder County and destroyed nearly 1,000 buildings. County officials say their response benefited from both preparation and circumstance.
“Some of our success was due to experience, but some of it was luck. We had a vacant county-owned building available to house the disaster assistance center, which allowed us to act quickly,” said Arrington, the disaster response manager for Boulder County. “If we had needed to rent or find a less-central location, the response would have been slower.”
 

Across the U.S., states are grappling with similar challenges.
In North Carolina, state-led efforts such as the Back@Home program helped rapidly rehouse approximately 100 displaced households after Hurricane Florence in 2018, and later helped nearly 800 households find more permanent homes. The program has since become a model for addressing disaster-fueled displacement.
Similarly, after Tropical Storm Helene last fall, Asheville, North Carolina, allocated $1 million in rental assistance to prevent displacement. While Red Cross and state-run shelters were scheduled to close by Nov. 10, the city coordinated with the WNC Rescue Mission to keep one shelter open longer for the remaining displaced residents.
By Dec. 31, 2024, all nine remaining shelter participants had secured exit plans — ensuring no one was left without a place to go, according to the city’s spokesperson, Kim Miller.
Hawaii also has launched large-scale relief initiatives. In response to the 2023 Maui fire, HomeAid Hawaii, in partnership with the state, developed interim housing solutions for 1,500 displaced residents for up to five years.
“Disaster-driven homelessness requires targeted programs that meet the needs of people at risk,” said Batko, of the Urban Institute. “States must integrate housing policy into emergency preparedness, or they’ll find themselves overwhelmed when the next disaster strikes.”
In Colorado, Boulder County has managed to rebuild or begin construction on about two-thirds of the homes that were lost.
Boulder County is aiming for an ambitious 90% recovery rate, meaning 9 of 10 displaced households will find a new homes in the area. But even that success comes with a twinge of mourning for what was lost.
“We started this recovery with a goal to get close to 90%, so we’re proud,” Arrington said. “But we also recognize that some parts of the community have changed forever.”

The state can help but its resources are limited.,"Guest Commentary written by

Mary Benson
Mary Benson is a Lake County real estate broker who operated a small water system at Clear Lake with her husband


We all know of mom-and-pop shops run by couples who share the workload and, if lucky, become integral to the communities they serve. 
Until recently my husband, Norm Benson, and I were mom-and-pop operators of a water treatment and distribution system at Clear Lake, an idyllic, nutrient-rich version of a green Lake Tahoe, about 110 miles north of San Francisco. 
We love our community and didn’t mind pitching in.
Over the years our mutual water system, the Crescent Bay Improvement Co., has become unsustainable. Our treated lake water could not meet state or federal drinking standards. 
We could boil it for cooking and use it in bathrooms and for laundry. But the 24 households and businesses hooked up to our system had to rely on bottled water for drinking. 
The state and a much larger water company in recent years threw us a lifeline, for which we are grateful. By the time we got help, our water hadn’t been drinkable for years.
We were hardly alone. More than 400 water systems, serving 885,000 Californians, are failing across the state, the State Water Resources Control Board reports.  More than half those failing systems are in disadvantaged communities, and two-thirds serve mostly people of color. 
The reasons for these failures range from poor water quality or limited water availability, to a lack of affordability for consumers or technical management issues. 
It’s also deeply concerning that more than 1,000 additional water systems, serving more than 3 million Californians, are also at risk or are potentially at risk of failure.
California was the first state to declare that clean drinking water is a human right in 2012. As with so much in life, however, rights don’t necessarily come with guarantees.
Norm and I shouldered enormous responsibilities to keep water flowing to our customers.
As the daily treatment plant operator, Norm lugged heavy bags of diatomaceous earth — used to remove unwanted material from drinking water —  up and down 152 steps, between the road and our lakeside plant. 
California does have far-sighted policies in place to help and is keeping watch over the needs of small struggling systems like ours was. Mary Benson
When he entered his 70s we tried to hire help, but there were no takers. Applicants took one look at those 152 steps and shook their heads.
Although my profession is real estate, I got a water treatment license to manage our system. I volunteered, since our community’s $30,000 budget didn’t include my salary.  
Work weeks were endless. Day trips were cut short by broken pipes or other emergencies in our aging system, dating back to 1935. Infrastructure upgrades were out of reach. 
State-mandated fire hydrants and water meters were nonexistent and unattainable for our system. Hydrants require 6-inch pipes; our system has 2-inch pipes. 
As bleak as this sounds, it turned out there was hope. In 2019, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law that would channel hundreds of millions of dollars yearly into improving failing water systems, including through consolidations with larger systems, as would happen for us. 
This “Safe and Affordable Funding for Equity and Resilience” (SAFER) program helped facilitate the acquisition of our system in July 2023 by the Golden State Water Co., which operates 40 water systems across California. 
Now Golden State is doing what we could not — making investments to ensure a safe, clean, reliable drinking water infrastructure. 
Since SAFER, the state’s Water Resources Control Board has distributed more than $800 million to disadvantaged areas. More than 250 systems are no longer failing. About 100,000 Californians are benefiting from state-facilitated consolidations like ours.
As hopeful as these numbers are, the needs still dwarf the resources. 
Costs to upgrade failing wells and water systems are high — an estimated $11.5 billion over five years. The board anticipates a worrisome shortfall of $5 billion in grant funding. 
Even so, we know California does have far-sighted policies in place to help and is keeping watch over the needs of small struggling systems like ours was.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/090424_Water-Quality-LV_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-05-27 09:02:19.066457

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
SC homebuyers can get up to $10K in state aid for a down payment

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford.
That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them.
This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range.
But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

 Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
 Help for teachers

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
Fast-building states get more babies

“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year.
Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019.
Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

(Photo: Clark County Department of Aviation)After more than two decades of delays federal officials are starting an environmental review for Clark County’s long-anticipated second commercial airport.
Local and federal officials have long sought to build a new airport on 6,000 acres in the Ivanpah Valley north of Primm, arguing the Harry Reid International Airport will not be able to keep up with projected demand for air travel without the supplemental airport.
The Federal Aviation Administration and the Bureau of Land Management issued a notice of intent last week to prepare an environmental impact statement, starting the formal review for the proposed Southern Nevada Supplemental Airport (SNSA).
Rosemary Vassiliadis, the director of aviation for Clark County, called the announcement a major milestone for the region.
“This important step brings us closer to addressing the increasing demand for air travel in one of the nation’s fastest growing regions,” Vassiliadis said in a statement last week.
“As a second commercial airport, SNSA will add much-needed capacity, improve service reliability, and ensure Southern Nevada continues to thrive as a global destination for business and tourism,” she continued.
The Harry Reid International Airport will reach its full capacity of 63 million to 65 million passengers annually by 2030, according to the Clark County Department of Aviation estimates
The Clark County Department of Aviation said the Ivanpah airport would provide long-term aviation capacity for the Las Vegas metropolitan area and primarily serve charter, long-haul domestic and international flights.
The supplemental airport was first proposed in 2006 by the Clark County Department of Aviation, but local economic conditions following the Great Recession and other local budgetary constraints stalled the project for decades. In 2010 the Clark County Department of Aviation asked the FAA to suspend any work on the environmental review.
Earlier this year, county officials confirmed that the environmental review process would resume for the future airport, which would include two runways and a terminal building in the Ivanpah Valley.
Congress transferred public land to Clark County for the construction of the airport site in 2000 through the Ivanpah Valley Airport Public Lands Transfer Act.
The new airport site would cover an area of 6,000 acres, 2,000 acres for flood mitigation infrastructure, and an additional 17,000 acres of land that are set aside as a noise compatibility buffer, making the new airport site over 25,000 acres.
State officials have suggested the new airport could lead to further development in Clark County. In 2023, state lawmakers unanimously approved Senate Bill 19 which would allow Clark County to put aside at least 5,000 acres for a new commercial and residential development in the vicinity of the new airport.
Conservation groups have long opposed the development of the airport, saying its development could threaten two endangered species in the area, the desert tortoise and the white-margined penstemon – a small pink bell-shaped flower fixed on long hardy stems with waved oblong leaves.
The rare wildflower only grows in four counties across the Mojave Desert: Clark County, Nye County, San Bernardino County in California, and Mohave County in Arizona.
Patrick Donnelly, the Great Basin director for the Center for Biological Diversity, said the conservation group would follow the environmental review process “to ensure that sensitive biological resources are not unduly harmed by the airport, and that appropriate mitigation measures are implemented.”
“Just because Congress gave the land to Clark County, doesn’t mean the airport is pre-approved. Laws like the Endangered Species Act mandate the strictest of protections,” Donnelly said.
The Federal Aviation Administration and the Bureau of Land Management plan to hold three public scoping meetings this July to gather testimony about the environmental impact of a new airport, starting with a virtual meeting on July 29.
Two in-person meetings will be held in July, the first will be held on July 30 at the East Las Vegas Library, and the second will be on July 31 at Primm Valley Casino Resorts.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/101138-01-FAA_Tower_Strip_View-1744218200-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-27 09:02:19.066457

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)Shane Smeed’s first day as president of Utah Tech University came after a more than year-long search for a new leader. The role he’s stepping into has been filled with change and controversy, with many public higher education institutions experiencing high turnover in leadership positions, and bracing for state-demanded cuts. 
After 25 years in higher education, including his latest job as president of Park University in Missouri, Smeed moved back to his native Utah, bought a house in St. George and has the intention of making it his family’s forever home.
“I spent a lot of time along the Wasatch Front, but I had spent zero time, with the exception of the last three weeks in the southern part of Utah,” Smeed said in an interview with Utah News Dispatch, “and my wife and I have truly fallen in love with it.”

While some universities have been scrambling to find balanced budget reallocations, Smeed is looking forward to a future Utah Tech catering the highest enrollment it has seen with more full-time faculty, a new classroom building and another residence hall.
This year, the university is expecting its largest fall class ever with over 13,000 students. Five years into his tenure he expects to see more “quality growth,” he said.
“I would envision the university is going to be at 16,000 students in a few years, and then it’s going to go to 20,000 students, perhaps a little after five years,” he said. “And so in order to do that, we actually (need to) have a campus and an infrastructure that can accommodate that growth.”
During the tenure of Smeed’s predecessor, Richard Williams, the school underwent significant changes, including adopting a polytechnic designation with a focus on hands-on experiences, and notably, a name change from Dixie State University approved by the Utah Legislature in 2021. 
But, change isn’t over for the school. With more policy coming from the state Capitol, restricting diversity, equity and inclusion programs, and most recently requiring public universities to cut 10% of their courses’ budgets to reallocate the funds to programs in high demand, Smeed wants to highlight the role of Utah Tech as a polytechnic institution. 
“We have some great investments that are taking place in health sciences as well as investments in engineering and in other programs. And one of the things we’re very proud of is that the priority programs were aligning with the priorities of the state of Utah as well,” Smeed said.
When asked his thoughts on recent legislative action impacting higher education in Utah, he said that as a newcomer to this space in Utah, he sees education actions from the Utah Legislature as “a tremendous breath of fresh air.”



Let us know what you think...


 


“I’ve seen that we have tremendous partners in the legislature, and tremendous support with the House of Representatives and with the Senate and with the governor,” he said.
And, while DEI initiatives are deeply restricted in public entities in the state, he believes Utah Tech is well positioned to encourage diversity in higher education, mostly because of the open enrollment nature of the university.
“We are proud of the fact that more than 50% of the students are from Washington County and between 70% and 80% are from the state of Utah, but we also have more than 40 other states represented here at Utah Tech, we have nearly 40 countries that are represented as well at Utah Tech,” he said. “So our goal is really to create equal opportunity and equal access to education for all students.”
His thoughts on reinvestment bill
While the first 48 hours of his tenure revolved around loud cheers and the much awaited celebrations of 3,500 students graduating this spring, now Smeed has started to work with the university’s faculty and staff to catch up on what needs to go and what should be boosted after the passage of HB265, the reallocations bill. 
With tight deadline, Utah universities scramble to cut 10% of budget for courses

Some softwares the school contracted weren’t used enough. There were also inefficiencies on the administrative side, Smeed said. The committee tasked with reviewing the school’s reinvestment efforts also targeted programs that had a decline in enrollment.
“We also wanted to make sure that as we propose new investment in future programs that there were not only investments where we saw that there was interest in the program,” Smeed said, “but they would be programs where students would have the greatest potential to persist and to retain and ultimately graduate.”
The idea, he said, is that students graduate prepared to enter the workforce from day one while keeping their loans low. 
But also, one of his goals is to witness students enjoying a good time during their college years, supporting the school’s Trailblazers, and joining other student clubs to create lasting friendships.

At least 12 local law enforcement agencies in Alabama have signed or are awaiting approval on agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to enforce immigration laws.  (Andi Rice for Alabama Reflector)Local law enforcement agencies across Alabama are entering into agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a move that is drawing concern from immigrant communities and civil rights advocates.
At least nine such agreements with sheriff’s offices are active in six Alabama counties, with three more pending — two with county sheriff’s departments and one with a local police department. These agreements, known as 287(g) programs, deputize local officers to enforce federal immigration laws.
“(These) agreements basically give police the capability to do ICE’s job, ICE’s work, and the way the community sees it is police are now immigration officers. That’s the way it translates over to the community,” said Celsa Stallworth, a community organizer in Randolph County with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Alabama.

Colbert, Crenshaw, Elmore, Etowah, Franklin and Henry counties have at least one agreement with ICE. The Houston County Sheriff’s Office and Level Plains Police Department in Dale County have pending agreements.
The 287(g) program, rooted in federal law, allows local law enforcement agencies to partner with ICE, granting designated state and local officers the authority to perform certain immigration enforcement functions. These agreements have existed for years but are seeing renewed interest and implementation, partly due to executive orders incentivizing states to cooperate with federal immigration efforts.
There are different models of 287(g) agreements. The “jail enforcement” model primarily allows local authorities to check the immigration status of individuals booked into county jails and place “ICE holds” on those found to be undocumented, typically for 48 hours, allowing ICE to take them into custody. 
The “warrant service model” gives local law enforcement officers legal authority to execute civil immigration warrants for the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) office. 
The “task force model” trains officers to act as immigration officers in the community, potentially extending enforcement beyond jails to community detentions. ICE describes it as a “force multiplier for law enforcement agencies.”
While a proponent said these partnerships are crucial for public safety and addressing immigration concerns, critics warn of potential civil rights violations, increased fear within immigrant communities, and a strain on community-police relations.
John Summers, chief of the Level Plains Police Department, a community with a population of about 1,800 in Dale County, is awaiting final approval of a “task force” agreement after an ERO official suggested it would be “a good alternative” to addressing immigration concerns on a local level. He said Level Plains has had a steady Latino population over the years, which he claims were mostly in the country without authorization, though it’s not possible to make that determination without the judicial system.
Level Plains has a Hispanic or Latino population of about 10.3%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey 2023 5-year average estimate. While the foreign-born population in Level Plains is unavailable, Dale County’s foreign-born population is 3.4%, under Alabama’s average of 3.8%.
“(It) gives us a little more give us a little more authority when it comes to dealing with illegals, and it gives us a better relationship with ICE directly,” Summers said.
But “foreign-born” doesn’t necessarily mean they are Latino or are living in the U.S. without authorization, said Allison Hamilton, executive director of the Alabama Coalition for Immigrant Justice. She said that poultry plants in the Enterprise and Dothan area employ migrants on work permits.
“We saw that people were coming into Alabama to work at those locations. In that area, for example, you’re going to have a lot of people who probably have a work permit, who could easily be detained due to outdated records or just a complete lack of knowledge,” Hamilton said.
Hamilton said these agreements, which give law enforcement “the responsibility of acting as immigration enforcement without the proper knowledge,” could have unintended consequences. She said that immigration law is complicated and that officers receiving basic training on immigration duties aren’t equipped to deal with complex immigration cases.
“If you have a very simplistic understanding, but you’re tasked with trying to enforce that (law), a lot of people who shouldn’t be detained are detained, and this often leads to civil rights violations, and can come back to the officers later as incorrectly enforcing the law,” Hamilton said.
Summers said the department will handle each case individually. He believes most immigrants in the community are “trying to do better for themselves,” but they “have to do it the right way,” saying that these agreements will help the department hold more people accountable.
“We treat everybody fair, and we want to help everybody we can help, legal or illegal, but I mean, at some point you’ve got to help yourself, and you’ve got to follow the rules that we have sworn to uphold,” Summers said.
When asked if immigrants, regardless of status, should feel less safe in communities with these agreements, Hamilton said that if government officials, presumably most trained in immigration law and federal enforcement, are currently detaining people with legal status, she expected that local police performing such duties would lead to even more mistakes.
“I think anybody who is an immigrant or who appears to be an immigrant needs to proceed with caution at this point when interacting with any law enforcement,” Hamilton said, adding that these agreements are damaging law enforcement’s ability to build relationships in immigrant communities.
Stallworth said the consequence of these agreements and increased ICE activity has been the fear created within immigrant communities, affecting both undocumented individuals and naturalized citizens with mixed-status families.
As a U.S.-born citizen who “looks Mexican,” she said, “I am fearful”. She fears for her naturalized mother, who speaks “broken English,” and for her husband, who may get caught up trying to “protect someone.” Stallworth said she had a conversation with a Latina woman in Shelby County who said she was concerned about everyday activities like picking up children from school or going grocery shopping.
“What we tell is that, make sure to follow the law when you’re driving. Make sure that your lights are working and things like that, because they have to continue living,” she said.

The progressive think tank released a state-by-state analysis of the tax provisions of the “Big Beautiful Bill Act” passed Thursday by House Republicans. They found that in Nevada, the richest 1% — households making $796,500 or more a year — would see an average tax benefit of $82,590 in 2026. That’s equivalent to 2.4% of their average annual income, which is $3.5 million.
Households just under them — the 4% of households making between $293,500 and $796,500 — would see a tax benefit of $14,150. That’s equivalent to 3.1% of their average annual income.
Meanwhile, Nevada households in the bottom 20% – those making less than $27,700 a year — would see a tax benefit of $130. That represents 0.8% of their average annual income.
The middle 20% of households — those making between $50,800 and $84,400 — would see a benefit of $1,390. That’s equivalent to 2.1% of that group’s average annual income.
Here’s the tax change across all income levels:

Altogether, ITEP estimates that in Nevada more than a quarter of the tax benefit would go to the top 1% of income earners, and more than two-thirds of the tax benefits would be felt by the top 20% of households.
Nationwide, the richest 1% would receive $121 billion in net tax cuts in 2026. The middle 20% — “a group that is 20 times the size of the richest 1%,” ITEP emphasizes — would receive half that much.
ITEP in its report noted that “high-income people in states with less robust tax systems overall do the best.” Nevada is one of 22 states where the richest 1% would receive an average net tax cut of more than $75,000.
The think tank also noted in the analysis that it expects the effects of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies to offset “most of the tax cuts” for the bottom 80% of Americans, and for the bottom 40% “the tariffs impose a cost that is greater than the tax cuts they would receive under this legislation.”
At the national level, for instance, the poorest 20% of households can expect to see their take-home pay increase by 1% as a result of the changes. But that’s more than offset by a roughly 2.4% decrease in spending power due to the effects of the Trump administration’s tariffs.
The law’s provisions are also relatively favorable toward wealthy overseas investors. “Foreign investors who own shares in U.S. companies would benefit more than the poorest fifth of Americans,” ITEP’s authors wrote. “These foreign investors would enjoy $23 billion in tax cuts in 2026 compared to just $4 billion for the bottom 20% of Americans.”
Because Republicans are using a procedural known as “reconciliation,” the bill cannot be filibustered in the Senate. Republicans control 53 Senate seats, meaning they can lose three votes and still pass the bill with a tie-breaking vote from Vice President JD Vance.

This is not how the Alabama Department of Corrections operates. Instead, we have prisons like Ventress in Clayton. Ventress is where inmates can get treatment for drug and alcohol addiction.
It’s also a place, according to the U.S. Department of Justice, where in 2018 a corrections officer beat a handcuffed inmate, yelling in earshot of four nurses, “I am the reaper of death, now say my name!” That same year, another Ventress corrections officer struck a restrained inmate so hard he broke his jaw in two places and left blood on a nearby wall.
There’s also Bullock Correctional Facility near Union Springs, where according to one lawsuit, officials placed a sexual assault victim in the same dorm as his attacker, leading to a second sexual assault.
Travis Sessions, a 28-year-old inmate, drowned in his own blood, according to yet another lawsuit, at Red Eagle Community Work Center north of Montgomery after officers ignored his requests for help. And let’s not forget Steven Davis, beaten to death by corrections officers at Donaldson Correctional Facility in 2019.
Blood Money: Alabama Department of Corrections pays to settle lawsuits alleging excessive force

Corrections chose to negotiate its way through dozens of cases like these instead of risking a court fight, as Beth Shelburne reported last week. The department has settled 94 lawsuits alleging that corrections officers used excessive force against inmates. It’s helped push the department’s legal bills over $57 million.
That’s a lot of money. If you worked at a company that had to settle dozens of lawsuits over the same pattern of behavior, you’d be trained to stop that behavior. Or your company would be out of business.
In ADOC’s case, we’re talking about patterns that have led to credible allegations that corrections officers left inmates with crippling injuries. Or brain damage. Or dead.
What does the state do?
It cuts a check.
The department leans on a state liability fund to pay settlements. Inmates or their survivors get a relative pittance. Private attorneys representing officers accused of wrongdoing get much more. Shelburne reported that lawyers representing officers got $12.9 million from the state between 2020 and 2024. Settlement payments to inmates and survivors amounted to $4.4 million.
State leaders, by and large, are fine with this.
Excessive force, you say? Here’s a check. Neglect? Talk to our attorneys. Physical trauma? PTSD? People coming out of prison worse than when they went in? Not our problem.
Alabama government values nothing more than its power to confine, to punish and, in some cases, to kill. State officials have fought a DOJ lawsuit over violence in men’s prisons for about four years. It is in court over failures to deliver proper medical and mental health care to inmates. Lawmakers smile benignly as the price of a new prison in Elmore soars far above initial estimates.
So Alabama will pay any price to keep that power and use it with little regard for constitutional restraints. Corrections’ budget grew from $544.1 million in 2021 to an expected $826.7 million next year, a 52% growth rate bigger than Medicaid (44%), which paid for the deliveries of most of the babies born in the state in 2022.
But the state will not or cannot correct the savage status quo in our prisons. Corrections officers can face multiple lawsuits alleging excessive force and not only hold onto their jobs, but win promotions.
Alabama has a lot of stubborn problems, like poverty and shrinking health care access. The prison crisis is something else: a deadly humanitarian disaster that our leaders deliberately built and continually tolerate while private individuals and companies profit off the chaos. People die in state prisons, or emerge with major physical and psychological injuries. The state treats each one of those lives as a sunk cost, a string of numbers to go onto a spreadsheet.
Which means we’re beyond reform. You can’t even tear Corrections down to the studs, because those are rotten, too. If we want prisons that maintain public safety, we need a whole new correctional agency. One that keeps order in its facilities. That treats violence as a failing that has to be fixed, not a monthly bill. Above all, we need a prison department built from a foundation of rehabilitation, not retribution.
At the moment, that project is a political impossibility. Alabama politicians think the price of fixing our prisons is far higher than the cost of ignoring it.
But maybe we can stop calling the agency supervising our prisons “Corrections.” It’s publicly subsidized mayhem that gets nothing right.

(Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)The battles over library content continue throughout Alabama. But two bills that could have affected how libraries operate failed to move in the Legislature’s 2025 session.
One measure, HB 4, would have applied state obscenity laws to public libraries and their employees if there were materials judged to be obscene in the children’s section. The other, SB 6, would have allowed cities and counties to terminate members of the library boards without cause.
The battles over library books began in Alabama in 2023, after a parent using the Autauga-Prattville Library complained about a book in the children’s section that had inclusive pronouns. Similar fights have erupted all over the state. Supporters of restrictions say they are trying to get obscene material out of children’s sections of the library. Critics say those restrictions target books with LGBTQ+ characters and themes and not necessarily obscene books.

“Our devoted and beleaguered librarians will not have to worry about being handcuffed and jailed for refusing to censor books under House Bill 4, the ‘Jail the Librarians bill,’ which never made it out of its House Committee,” said Read Freely Alabama, a group that opposes new library restrictions, in a statement shortly after the 2025 legislative session ended. “Furthermore, the bill which would have politicized our library boards even more (SB 6) once again died before making it to the Senate floor.”
Multiple messages seeking comment were left with Rep. Arnold Mooney, R-Indian Springs, the sponsor of HB 4, and Sen. Chris Elliott, R-Josephine, the sponsor of SB 6.
Amy Minton, a member of the Alabama Public Library Service (APLS) Board and an advocate of additional restrictions on library content, said in an interview that she was “a little surprised that people get so upset about the obscenity or sexually explicit materials.”
“If they don’t have it in the library, why do they get so upset about them being asked to be moved, whether through a law or policy?” she said.
HB 4 would have amended the state’s obscenity laws to make public libraries and librarians criminally liable for making materials that are sexually explicit or harmful to minors available.
The legislation would have allowed residents served by the library to file a notice with the staff that they believe there are sexually explicit or inappropriate materials found in sections of the library dedicated to minors.
Libraries would then have to relocate the materials to the adult section or remove them entirely. They can also notify the public that they have determined the item is in the appropriate section, which any resident can then challenge.
Noncompliance would have subjected librarians to prosecution under Alabama obscenity laws, which can be as severe as a Class B felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $30,000 fine.
SB 6 would have mandated that library board members be appointed to a four-year term and that members could be removed from the board with a two-thirds of the members of the governing body, either the city or county, agree by vote.
The House Judiciary Committee never considered HB 4. SB 6 got approval from the Senate County and Municipal Government Committee, which Elliott chairs, but did not come to a vote on the Senate floor.
Mooney’s obscenity bill was approved further along in the 2024 session, receiving approval from members of the House and even getting approved in the Senate Children and Youth Health Committee before it stalled in the Senate. Elliott’s legislation was approved in the Senate and the House County and Municipal Government Committee where it remained as the session ended.
Advocates of restrictions have succeeded in convincing the Alabama Public Library Service, the state agency that oversees local library funding, to impose policy changes that favor more restrictions.
In March, the APLS Board suspended funding to the Fairhope Public Library in Baldwin County while also voting to have Pack terminated after Minton made a motion. Supporters of the library raised money to replace the lost funding and defended the library at city council and APLS meetings.
Alabama GOP chair John Wahl, who currently serves as chair of the APLS Board, said at a meeting earlier this month that members are waiting for the Fairhope Public Library to complete its review of the books that parents challenged before resuming funding to the library.
“We know that the fight isn’t over. As we speak, a stacked and extreme Alabama Public Library Service board continues its assault on libraries, stripping funding from those who will not cave to their demands,” Read Freely Alabama said in the statement. “And even today, as this session closes, opposing forces are already crafting legislation for a chosen representative to prefile, and are regrouping to continue their assault on our freedoms and beloved public institutions at the next legislative session.”

(Courtesy of Great Plains Food Bank)Proposed cuts to the federal food assistance program are coming at a time when agencies addressing hunger in North Dakota are already facing lost revenue and increased need.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty right now,” said Darby Njos, spokeswoman for Great Plains Food Bank in Fargo. “We’re still urging lawmakers to support programs that help people get back on their feet while knowing that the needs of people continue to shift.”
The most recent hit to federal food assistance are proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Known as SNAP, this is a federally funded program that gives money for groceries to eligible low-income households – mostly older adults, people with disabilities, and families with children. A budget bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives last week would end federal nutrition benefits for millions and shift some costs to states, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
The bill still needs to be considered by the U.S. Senate.
More than 3 million people would lose SNAP benefits under GOP bill, nonpartisan report says

Great Plains Food Bank is the only food bank in North Dakota and distributes food to those in need throughout the state and Clay County, Minnesota.
Earlier this year it lost about $1.3 million in funding and food because of federal cuts, Njos said.
Some of those cuts were through a program that allowed the food bank to purchase meat and produce from local farmers. This year Great Plains Food Bank expected three rounds of funding, each around $1 million. The first round came through, the second round of funding was paused and then reinstated. 
The food bank has been informed it won’t receive the third round, Njos said.
“We worked directly with several farmers, and we had to have some tough conversations,” she said. “We don’t have the ability to make those purchases without that funding.”
In addition, the food bank will not receive summer deliveries of food through The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP). These deliveries equaled about $300,000 in food.
The nonprofit was able to raise about $250,000 in private funds to help offset those losses, but the cuts are still felt.
“Those cuts impact our day-to-day work,” Njos said. “We’re working hard to fill in those gaps.”
States on the hook for billions under U.S. House GOP bill making them help pay for SNAP

In 2024, the food bank served 151,000 people in North Dakota and Clay County. About one-third of those served are children; 16% are seniors, Njos said. 
“These are vulnerable populations that don’t have a lot of options if they’re hungry,” Njos said. “You don’t want them worrying about where to get their next meal.”
About 28% of Great Plains Food Bank’s food sourcing traditionally comes through government programs. While some funding and commodities are still being received, the loss of purchasing power strains resources. 
“We’ve had to adapt quickly,” Njos said. “These cuts are real, and they’re being felt at every level.”
Susie Boelter is executive director of North Country Food Bank, which serves part of Grand Forks County in North Dakota and 21 counties in northwestern and western Minnesota. This food bank has seen what Boelter calls “staggering increases” of use over the past three years.
Cutting federal food assistance would add to that need.
“If there are cuts to SNAP that would have a huge impact on us,” Boelter said. “For every meal we provide (through the food bank), SNAP provides nine.”
North Country Food Bank has seen some shifts in which federal contracts are funded but it hasn’t seen a loss in overall federal revenue. Boelter said it’s still time for additional help – not less.
“Any additional cuts will put a ton of pressure on our emergency food system,” she said. “Food banks are good at getting food into the hands of people who need it, but it’s time to sound the alarm.”
One bright spot in food assistance is that federal funding for summer food programs remains in place, according to Melissa Anderson, assistant director for Child Nutrition and Food Distribution Programs at the state Department of Public Instruction.
Two federal programs – Summer Food Service and the Summer EBT – provide nutrition for North Dakota students who have access to free and reduced-cost meals during the school year.  
This summer 42 schools and nonprofits are offering a free meal or snack at over 130 sites throughout North Dakota.
In addition, the state Department of Public Instruction works with the Department of Health and Human Services to distribute EBT cards worth $120 to eligible students. Households have 120 days to use those dollars to purchase groceries, Anderson said.
The state expects about 44,000 students will be eligible.
These summer programs are successful in getting food to those who need it, and Anderson is optimistic the funding will remain. She also acknowledges that policies and funding streams can change quickly.
“Every day there’s new information,” Anderson said. “We’re trying to stay positive but there are a lot of unknowns.”
Lawmakers earlier this year approved $5 million in grant funding for the Great Plains Food Bank through the state Department of Agriculture to support the construction of a new statewide distribution center. The state’s investment will be matched by private donations raised by the agency.
The food bank is preparing to break ground in 2027.
This investment reflects the region’s commitment to taking care of their neighbors, Njos said. 
“We’ve always thrived in times of crisis,” said Njos. “North Dakotans stand up when their neighbors are in need, and we’ll continue doing whatever it takes to ensure no one goes hungry.”

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)State health officials have made progress on conducting annual inspections for assisted living programs, as 55.6% of facilities received an annual inspection in 2024 — up from just 25.7% of facilities receiving an annual inspection in the previous year.
It’s good news, according to senior advocates and providers for assisted living programs. But that means that almost half of those facilities might still be behind on annual inspections used to ensure that seniors are receiving quality care in a safe environment.
“We’re encouraged by the improved number of inspections – going from about one-in-four to about half,” Hank Greenberg, state director for the AARP of Maryland, said in a recent interview. “That’s good, but not good enough.”
He hopes that the increased inspections will lead to greater attention towards assisted living facilities in the state, which he believes have been somewhat overlooked in recent years.
Maryland health officials have been trying to catch up on annual inspections for various programs and facilities that support Maryland’s aging population, such as the state’s nursing homes. Assisted living facilities are senior living options for residents who need additional supports for daily tasks but do not need the same intensive medical care provided in nursing homes.
Health officials cut inspection backlog of nursing homes, advocates demand more

Unlike nursing homes, assisted living facilities do not receive federal oversight meaning that regulations are left up to the state. In Maryland, information on recent inspections for assisted living facilities is not readily available to the public, making it challenging for advocates and families to determine if their aging loved ones are living in a facility that has recently received an annual inspection for safety and health.
“We all rely on these inspections to determine whether or not these facilities are providing a standard of care that is acceptable,” Greenberg said. “As more and more people are in need of facilities … they are looking for safe spaces for loved ones — in some cases, a spouse. In some cases, it’s a parent. They really need to know where they’re sending someone, or themselves — that it’s a safe environment.”
Annual inspections had been trending downward since 2021, according to a state audit released in April. For fiscal 2021, 59% of assisted living facilities received an annual survey. But the next year, that dropped to just 38% of all facilities across the state.
The trend continued for fiscal 2023, when only 444 out of 1,721 facilities received an annual inspection — just 25.7%, the lowest inspection rate in the last five years.
In the health department’s response to state auditors, the agency agreed with the need to improve annual survey rates, noting that its Office of Health Care Quality (OHCQ) was in the process of training more surveyors to keep up with annual inspection requirements.
The department said it anticipates “being in compliance with annual inspections” by November this year.
The agency’s efforts appear to be paying off. OHCQ reported in November that for fiscal 2024, 904 assisted living facilities in Maryland received an annual state inspection. While that’s just over half of the 1,625 facilities in the state — down from 1,721 the year before — it’s a stark improvement from previous years.
Allison Roenigk Ciborowski, president and CEO of LeadingAge Maryland, said that the state surveys are “an important piece of the puzzle” for ensuring that senior residents receive a high quality of care at their assisted living programs.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“The survey agency has been an important partner and plays an important role in ensuring quality and ensuring peace of mind for residents and families,” Ciborowski said.
She added that long-awaited updates to state regulations for assisted living facilities that recently went into effect will further ensure Marylanders receive quality care in those programs.
The new regulations have been 10 years in the making. The wide-ranging adjustments to state rules for assisted living facilities include new staffing requirements, additional training education, updated definitions and more.
Documents from the OHCQ describe the lengthy rule-making process as a “complex undertaking that started in 2015” involving hundreds of stakeholders and four public comment periods in 2016, 2021, 2023 and 2024.
While the regulations do not make major changes to the survey process specifically, Ciborowski said that the new rules make “really good improvements to the assisted living regulations that will further support ensuring that folks have access to high quality care and supports.”
“It’s important that regulations are looked at and revised and modernized as best practices change,” she said.
But Greenberg hopes that more attention is paid to assisted living facilities in general to protect seniors, some of Maryland’s most vulnerable populations.
“What were the result of those inspections? What percentage found violations? Were there follow-ups to ensure compliance? Those are some questions that we still have,” Greenberg said. “It’s imperative to have all of them inspected, unannounced, and done so on a consistent basis to ensure quality of care in those facilities.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024_dec3_mdh_statecenter_edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-27 08:02:09.864162

(Photo by Senior Airman Thomas Karol/U.S. Air Force)It takes most Americans an average of $270 and 13 hours to do their taxes. With Direct File, it takes less than 60 minutes to do it yourself and costs nothing. Direct File is the IRS’s new electronic option for taxpayers to file their income tax returns directly with the IRS for free.
This tax season, Direct File’s pilot expanded to 25 states, including Maryland. Our nonprofit organization, the CASH (Creating Assets, Savings and Hope) Campaign of Maryland (CASH), supported the development of the Maryland State Return add-on to IRS Direct File that directly linked taxpayers to a state return upon completion of their federal tax return.
Through targeted outreach and partnerships with local organizations, we helped raise awareness about Direct File and connected thousands of Marylanders with free, accessible tax filing options. This work builds on our long-standing commitment to financial stability and economic empowerment for working families: We promote economic advancement for low- to moderate-income individuals and families and lead a coalition of over 50 free tax preparation sites known as Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites across the state.

Like VITA, Direct File gives Marylanders a free, easy, and trustworthy option to meet their tax filing obligations. Unlike VITA, Direct File gives taxpayers an option that doesn’t require securing limited appointments and allows them to get their taxes done from home (or even cellphone!).
This flexibility is especially important for people with nontraditional work schedules, caregiving responsibilities or transportation barriers. By removing these obstacles, Direct File ensures that more people can meet their tax obligations on their own time, without sacrificing work hours or family commitments.
Direct File echoes the goals of VITA while expanding its capacity, giving more low- and moderate-income Americans the opportunity to file their taxes for free rather than paying for and using a third-party tax preparer or software. While VITA is reliant on trained and certified volunteers and nonprofits for capacity, Direct File can be accessed by millions.
The Trump administration and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) told reporters in April that Direct File would not continue next year, citing “hidden costs,” “taxpayer confusion” and the expense of administering the program.
There are no costs, hidden or otherwise, to use the program. Direct File is completely free to eligible taxpayers. Because the program allows taxpayers to file directly with the IRS and their states, users are never redirected to paid options.
The same cannot be said about Free File compliant software offered by traditional tax software developers like TaxAct and TaxSlayer. Notably, TurboTax by Intuit and H&R Block, two of the largest and most well-known paid tax preparation companies, withdrew from the Free File Alliance in 2021.
Filing your taxes can be confusing, but Direct File is simpler and more user-friendly than third-party tax software. Participants during the first year of the program said it themselves: 90% ranked their overall experience as Excellent or Above Average, 90% who used customer support rated that experience as Excellent or Above Average, and 86% of respondents said that their experience with Direct File increased their trust in the IRS. Plus, Direct File users have access to customer support from real people during the entire process.
Continuing to build Direct File is an investment that will save time and money for Americans far into the future. If Direct File continues, the taxpayer dollars already invested will not go to waste.
Progress has already been made to expand the program. Direct File can grow to serve more states and a wider range of tax situations. Future versions of the program can simplify the process by prefilling information the IRS already has (like the details of a W-2 form). If it is not preemptively shut down, Direct File will continue to be improved based on real feedback from its users.
Paying taxes allows our country to thrive, and Americans should not be burdened with extra costs and time-consuming processes to meet their filing obligations. Protecting the Direct File program is an investment in everyday Americans – making their government work for them.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/7055546-1024x659.jpg,,,2025-05-27 08:02:09.864162

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)A new state law lets South Carolina cities set their own rules for where and when golf carts can be driven but requires a new rule for passengers: Children under 12 must buckle up.
As initially proposed, the bill authorized any county to pass an ordinance allowing golf carts with headlights and rear lights to be driven at night. The purpose was to expand on permission that a 2016 law gave only to certain barrier islands.
But the Senate took it further — letting municipalities “stipulate the hours, methods, and locations” for daylight golf cart driving too and adding statewide the safety rule for children.
“I unfortunately have had the misfortune of seeing too many kids maimed and killed on golf carts,” said Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto. “It’s awful.”
The Orangeburg Democrat works as an attorney and has handled such cases as part of his law practice.
“When you see golf carts go by and there are kids sitting on the back of these golf carts that are not in a seat belt, you know good and well if they slam on the brakes those kids going right off the back and maybe right in front of the car that’s following them,” Hutto said during floor debate in the Senate earlier this month.
Sen. Ronnie Cromer agreed, telling his fellow senators he had seatbelts installed in his wife’s custom-built golf cart.
“I have seen kids at the beach that are riding on the back of those carts. How the parents were holding them in, I don’t know,” the Prosperity Republican said. “So I think that’s a pretty good idea to force people to put seat belts on.”
The seat belt rule came up as part of a larger debate about how South Carolina handles the recreational carts, which can be driven during daylight hours with a permit on any public road where the speed limit is 35 mph or less.
Drivers must be at least 16 years old and have a driver’s license.
State law previously limited their usage to within 4 miles from the address where they’re registered or within 4 miles of a gated community. However, local governments could reduce the allowed routes to 2 miles.
The new law leaves that distance entirely up to local governments. The 4-mile rule stays intact for anywhere without its own ordinance.
“In the past, we’ve created exceptions … and it became sort of this patchwork quilt of golf cart regulations,” said Sen. Greg Hembree.
Rather than continuing down that path, the Little River Republican instead urged legislators to overhaul the law, setting minimum standards but also giving all local governments the ability to enact tougher restrictions that go beyond what’s in state law.
“Every community is a little different,” he said. “Every community has its own unique dangers or areas that are safer. And it’s more appropriate for that local government to make those decisions.”
For example, towns might have certain areas where they don’t want to allow golf carts to be used at all, Hembree said.
“And quite frankly, under this bill, a local government could regulate them out of existence in a community,” he said.
The legislation passed both the House and Senate with almost no opposition. Gov. Henry McMaster signed it into law last Thursday. It took effect immediately.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_3663-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-27 08:02:09.864162

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Donald Trump’s victory in November had led the Democratic Party nationally to engage in some serious soul searching. In Florida, it was the second successive electoral blowout, and the conversations about how to cope with that reality are underway.
Take the discussion held last Thursday night, sponsored by the Hillsborough County Democratic LGBTQ+ Caucus in Tampa.
“Democrats are the best at losing, losing, losing,” said Mike Drapak of The Hillsborough Society, a political commitee formed in the aftermath of party infighting with the Hillsborough County Democratic Executive Committee. “And that’s really where we need to start, and we need to start being self-reflective.”
Party members need to stop “pointing fingers” and instead look at themselves in the mirror start “understanding exactly what it is we’re doing that’s making people dislike us,” Drapak said.
The descent of the party has been well documented at this point. After losing all statewide races by double-digit deficits in 2022 and 2024, the party saw two members of their already super-minority in the state House of Representatives flip to the GOP last December, followed up last month with their then state Senate leader, South Florida’s Jason Pizzo, dramatically announcing on the floor that he was leaving the party because it was “dead.”
Gov. Ron DeSantis couldn’t resist pouncing on the party’s problems last week,  declaring  that Pizzo’s announcement that he would run for governor as a political independent was necessary “because people know if you have a ‘D’ next to your name in this state, you are dead meat. Because this party is a disaster.”
Much of the discussion last week among the Tampa Democrats last week centered on messaging. Nick Clemente, who lost a state House race to Republican Traci Koster in November, said the Florida Democratic brand is “unequivocally broken.”
“How do we talk about regular folks who might listen to podcasts about UFC, who might listen to podcasts about NASCAR or speed metal and not about politics?” he asked the audience of around 50 people. “How do we connect with them on our values and the things that we have in common that maybe we can help fix the brand, so people aren’t ashamed to be Democrats?”
Logan Mueller, president of the University of Tampa Democrats, said a major problem in his opinion is that the Democrats were still campaigning “like it’s 1996.”
“They’ve won the information battle right now,” he said of the GOP. 
“With the internet and podcasts and videos, we do not have any boots on the ground. All the largest podcasts and these things that people are connected to are all very conservative. There is no means that we can push a message, and on top of that, we don’t have a unified message that we can share with everybody. We don’t have a positive economic message that everybody wants. The reason Trump was also partially successful was that he sold optimism. He sold making America great again.”
‘Too complicated’
Sabrina Bousbar agreed with Mueller.
The 28-year-old Pinellas native campaigned for Joe Biden in 2020 and later served as a senior adviser in his U.S. Department of Health & Human Services’ Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response. She ran for Congress last summer, finishing second behind fellow Democrat Whitney Fox in Florida’s 13th District. (Fox went on to lose to GOP incumbent Anna Paulina Luna).
“We’re a little too complicated,” she said. “We try to have messaging for every single silo, but we don’t have a cohesive message with everyone.”
Mueller said he encounters a lot of his fellow students at UT who prefer registering as non-party-affiliated rather than a Democrat.
“They don’t want to associate with a party that has kind of lost the messaging war,” Mueller added. “[The party] has a lot of negative strings attached to it. And by registering as an independent, it kind of avoids the mess that has kind of been created over a long period of time. And the way forward is actually running an economic positive message, because young people do care about the economy, just as much as anyone else does.”
The fourth member of the panel was Tamika Lyles, an Osceola County Democrat seeking the party’s’s nomination for U.S. Senate next year. She complained that Democratic candidates wait too long to connect with the electorate.
“They don’t see us until it’s primary time or general election time, when we’re knocking on a door and we’re trying to give them that message. They’re not hearing it,” she said.”Because the first thing they say is, ‘Where have you been the whole year? What have you been doing the whole year?’ What was the messaging like the whole year when all of this was going on? So we need someone who is continuously speaking that language.”
A common theme among Democrats in the aftermath of the 2024 election nationally and in Florida is “meeting voters where they are.”
As someone who has worked with organized labor around the country, Drapek said,  he’s found “a significant amount” of misogyny, homophobia, and racism in the American heartland.
“We need to understand that,” he said. “And we need to learn on how we can message in a way that doesn’t actually bring the most radical people of that end to the table, but some  of the people who want some of the same things that we do.”
While there was plenty of talk about messaging, or the lack thereof, there wasn’t as much dialogue about policy and how to adjust to an electorate that has shifted to the right over the past five years.
Latino vote
When it comes to the Latino vote, a key demographic in Florida that supported Trump by double-digits over Kamala Harris last fall, a member of the Pinellas Hispanic Caucus suggested a possible opening would be to reengage specifically with Venezuelans who are upset about a U.S. Supreme Court decision last week that immediately strips Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, from hundreds of thousands of themselves.
In a survey of 408 Venezuelan residents in Florida conducted last month by Florida International University’s Latino Public Opinion Forum, nearly half of those who reported voting for Donald Trump in 2024 now say they either regret their decision or have mixed feelings about it. More than 70% say they oppose Trump’s decision to end humanitarian parole for Venezuelans.
“We should use this as ammunition,” said Bousbar, who is of Moroccan and Columbian descent. The GOP has targeted Latinos in Florida since Barack Obama left the political scene more than a decade ago.
“Latinos started going more Republican each election cycle. And so now, though, that we’re seeing the actual impact of this anti-immigration — illegally sending people back to their countries, or also putting them in jails without notification or telling their families or any form of legal structured procedure that they should have in the state and in the U.S. — we have to take that and communicate to them,” she said.
“We should be putting Spanish radio ads, Spanish TV messaging around the laws that Donald Trump has done around the Latino communities, specifically Venezuelans and Cubans and within the state of Florida because maybe we can get that pendulum to come back our way.”

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
The number of new apartments is at a 50-year high, but states expect a slowdown

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.



Balanced markets
Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
Help for teachers
Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

It was a yearslong effort to get the law approved.

In 2021, the Federal Trade Commission reported that consumers with broken electronics don’t have much choice but to replace them because repairs require specialized tools, unique parts and inaccessible proprietary software. And those restrictions, the FTC found, disproportionately burden communities of color and low-income communities.
The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these issues as access to technology quickly became increasingly vital.
Apple has since made moves to improve the repairability of its products. 
Some companies engage in a practice called “parts pairing” that can make replacing parts of a device impossible. Washington’s new law would largely outlaw this tactic.
Starting Jan. 1, 2026, the law will require manufacturers to make tools, parts and documentation needed for diagnostics and maintenance available to independent repair businesses. The requirement applies to digital electronics, like computers, cellphones and appliances, that were first sold in Washington after July 1, 2021. 
Manufacturers won’t be able to use parts that inhibit repairs. 
The state attorney general’s office could enforce violations of the new law under the Consumer Protection Act.
Critics argued the bill could harm businesses’ reputations if repairs aren’t completed correctly, and potentially leave users’ personal information unsecured. But some tech giants backed the legislation. 
Google, for example, thanked the governor for signing it.
“This is a significant win for consumers, and will provide them more affordable ways to repair their devices while reducing waste,” a spokesperson said in an email.
Microsoft said its “Surface PCs are among the most repairable in their class — and we view this law as a meaningful step toward reducing waste, empowering consumers, and advancing a more circular economy.”
State lawmakers across the country have introduced similar legislation in recent years. Five states now have laws on the books: California, Colorado, Minnesota, New York and Oregon. Massachusetts and Maine have such laws focused on car repairs.
Southwest Washington U.S. Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a Democrat, has led the charge in Congress for national Right to Repair laws focused on cars, electronics and military equipment. Before joining Congress, Gluesenkamp Perez co-owned an auto repair shop.
Late last month, the U.S. Army, at the direction of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, announced it would seek “Right to Repair” provisions in all of its contracts. 
Ferguson also signed a similar repair bill focused on wheelchairs and mobility scooters. Both measures had strong bipartisan support.

This issue is critical to individuals and employers alike, and the IMA is encouraged that Indiana has seen a lot of improvement on this topic in recent legislative sessions. 
Senate Enrolled Act 140, however, takes a step in the wrong direction. By mandating  pharmacy dispensing fees, SEA 140 will ultimately burden employers and individuals with higher prescription drug expenses across the board. 
At the heart of our concern is the provision within SEA 140 that mandates insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, or other administrators of pharmacy benefits to reimburse pharmacies at a rate that includes “a fair and reasonable dispensing fee.” This mandated fee will raise prescription drug costs on consumers.  
Our estimates indicate that this bill will lead to at least $100 million in new health care  spending. 
It’s crucial to understand that these increased costs won’t simply be absorbed by insurers or employers. Instead, they will inevitably be passed down to consumers, further straining already tight family budgets. 
As businesses grapple with higher health care expenses, they may be forced to make difficult decisions, such as reducing benefits, raising employee deductibles, or increasing employee copays for prescription drugs. This ultimately translates to less money in the pockets of Hoosier families, making it harder to afford essential goods and services. 
Indiana employers, who provide health insurance benefits to their employees, will also bear a substantial burden. The increased cost of providing these benefits may very well negate any progress made this year in lowering health care costs. This is a serious concern for Indiana manufacturers, who already face a competitive disadvantage compared to companies in states with lower health care costs. The new spending mandated by SEA 140 will only exacerbate this problem. 
We are also troubled by the fact that SEA 140 exempts Medicaid and the state employee health plan. This exemption means that commercial payers, employers and individuals who purchase private health insurance will disproportionately shoulder the burden of  these increased costs, while the state itself avoids the financial impact.  
Simply put, legislators recognized the cost of this new fee and protected the budget they were writing but still raised the cost of prescription drugs on the private sector. 
Pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) reform is necessary, and SEA 140 does contain some positive provisions. However, these positive aspects are overshadowed by the misguided and unfair mandate on health care payers. 
The IMA is committed to addressing the rising cost of health care in Indiana because we recognize the burden it places on Hoosier employers, employees, and families. Moving forward, we encourage the legislature to pursue a more equitable approach to addressing  pharmacy reimbursement issues.

(Vicki Smith/Getty Images)Property tax tweaks and a new online portal were among this year’s legislative wins for Hoosier farmers. But a high-priority proposal to help retiring farmers transition land to a new generation of growers failed to cross the finish line in the final days of the session.
Rural-focused portions of Gov. Mike Braun’s first agenda pledged to “cut red tape,” strengthen the agricultural economy and protect Indiana farmland from encroaching development.
The Republican governor had two early successes: property tax relief and a new online farmer portal.
 Some legislative wins
Baked into Senate Enrolled Act 1, a hotly-debated property tax measure, were changes to how farmland is assessed for property taxes — increasing the capitalization rate in the farmland formula from 8% to 9%, and adding a new assessed value deduction.
Braun maintained those changes will bring at least some relief for farmers. Agricultural lobbying groups agreed, in part, but said more works need to be done on property taxes, specifically.

“While this will provide relief to Hoosier farmers on their real property taxes the next couple of years, taxes on other agricultural infrastructure like farm buildings and permanent structures are expected to increase due to shifts within the tax base,” said Andy Tauer, Indiana Farm Bureau’s executive director of public policy. “Our members have seen property tax bills go up 60% over the past three years, while net farm incomes have gone down. So, we need to return to the Statehouse in the coming years to craft a more comprehensive and sustainable solution for farmers.”
Another win came in House Enrolled Act 1149, the first bill signed into law by Braun.
The measure, authored by Rep. Kendell Culp, R-Rensselaer, creates an online “one-stop-shop” portal for farmers to access funding opportunities, regulatory information and state agency contacts.
“Hoosier farmers feed America and power our economy, and this bill makes their important job a little bit easier,” the governor told reporters at a Statehouse bill signing ceremony.
Braun’s plan additionally called for the creation of a farmland preservation task force, as well as upgrades in rural communities, including roads, broadband and water systems.
Members of Indiana Farm Bureau’s water task force in 2024 identified a “gap” in protections for agriculture and significant groundwater well users who utilize irrigation or need water for livestock, Tauer said. Under earlier state law, those users were responsible for proving any loss of water and were liable in court.
Farm bureau leadership said the lobbying group worked with Republican Sen. Sue Glick, of LaGrange, to craft Senate Enrolled Act 28, which establishes a reporting and investigation process managed by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources to fix those issues and ensure that agriculture is protected in cases when usable water is unavailable. Braun signed the legislation in mid-April.
“Although we were successful in getting our water policy signed, we did not get the property tax relief that Hoosier farmers really need,” said Indiana Farm Bureau President Randy Kron. “While we are appreciative of the change in the farmland formula, it’s incredibly important that we advocate for more tax relief for our members in the future and we vow to do just that.
Other agricultural sector bills that passed and were supported by Indiana Farm Bureau and other lobbying groups included:

Senate Enrolled Act 461: Clarifies the responsibilities of the Indiana Grain Buyers and Warehouse Licensing Agency, ensuring better compliance and support for struggling licensees.
House Enrolled Act 1012: Requires law enforcement to inform landowners of any damage to their property resulting from motor vehicle accidents.
House Enrolled Act 1461: Provides additional funding and tax options for local government infrastructure projects, benefiting rural communities.

Retired farmer credit fails amid budget shortfalls
Axed from the final draft of the state’s next two-year budget, however, was a tax credit to support land transitions.
The proposed “retiring farmers tax credit,” originally introduced by Culp, would have offered up to $67,000 in tax credits to landowners who sell or lease farmland or agricultural equipment to beginning farmers, helping ease barriers to land access and encouraging transitions to a younger generation of farmers.
Indiana Gov. Mike Braun signs first bill into law, creating new online portal for farmers

Claire Shipp, Midwest policy manager for the American Farmland Trust, said the policy was based on successful models in Minnesota, Iowa and other states.
With more than 34% of Hoosier farmers now over the age of 65, Indiana is facing “a major shift in farmland ownership,” Shipp said.
Many retiring farmers want to sell or lease to a beginning farmer but can’t afford to turn down higher offers from developers or institutional buyers, she added. The tax credit would have provided an incentive “to preserve Indiana’s agricultural legacy, support rural economies, and ensure farmland stays in productive use for future generations.”
Although the tax credit was included in Braun’s proposed budget in February, it was removed by GOP budget writers in the House.
A Senate version of the state budget later added a “beginning farmer tax credit,” modeled after a similar program in Ohio, but was ultimately dropped in final budget negotiations.
Caitlin Smith, Indiana Farm Bureau’s director of policy engagement, said that while her group supported the tax credit, budget pressures ultimately derailed the proposal.
She pointed to the state’s April fiscal forecast, which revealed $2 billion less in revenue that expected, prompting lawmakers to trim provisions late in the session.










Keeping farmland in the hands of farmers is not just a private benefit — it is a public good.


– Claire Shipp, Midwest policy manager for the American Farmland Trust


“Indiana Farm Bureau’s two main policy priorities this year were to provide tax relief and water protections,” Smith said. “While we supported the governor’s agenda initiative, as well as Rep. Culp’s bill as filed, ultimately those didn’t make it across the finish line due to budget constraints. After the April forecast was released, legislative leadership made tough decisions to close the budget gap and that was one of the items that fell off.”
Smith noted that the goal of the credit was to help encourage and foster young farmers buying land to start their businesses.
“We know land prices are skyrocketing while the farm economy is on a downward turn, so this credit would be a tool in the toolbox to foster the next generation taking over farms,” she said. “We’re supportive of those initiatives, but we were really focused on asking and advocating for tax relief this year.”
Shipp said the American Farmland Trust plans to advocate for similar legislation again and is working with Culp and other lawmakers to revisit the proposal in 2026.
“Keeping farmland in the hands of farmers is not just a private benefit — it is a public good,” she continued. “When young farmers have access to land, they contribute to local economies, bolster rural communities, and continue the agricultural heritage that sustains Indiana.”

Voting activist Stacey Abrams will be among the headliners at “Medgar Evers at 100: A Legacy of Justice, a Future of Change” at the Jackson Convention Center on June 27-29.
The event, sponsored by the Medgar & Myrlie Evers Institute and Mississippi Votes Action Fund, will focus on his lifelong fight for democracy, justice and youth leadership as a part of the 2nd Annual Democracy in Action.
“My father, Medgar Evers, dedicated his life to the fight for justice, believing that everyday people build true democracy,” said Reena Evers-Everette, executive director of the Medgar & Myrlie Evers Institute. “In the face of adverse political winds, much like those my father confronted, we will use his 100th birthday as a clarion call to the next generation to be voices of courage and justice and continue his mission for justice and equality for all.”
Other speakers include: former MSNBC host Joy-Ann Reid, who wrote a bestseller on Medgar and Myrlie Evers; Eddie S. Glaude Jr., author of the bestselling book, “Begin Again: James Baldwin’s America and Its Urgent Lessons for Our Own”; Nikole Hannah-Jones, Howard University’s Knight Chair in Race and Journalism who won the Pulitzer Prize for “The 1619 Project”; and W. Ralph Eubanks, an award-winning writer and professor of Southern Studies at the University of Mississippi.
“As we reflect on the legacy of Medgar Evers, we are reminded that democracy is not a spectator sport—it demands action, commitment, and courage,” said Arekia Bennett Scott, executive director of Mississippi Votes Action Fund. “This convening is an opportunity to equip the next generation with the tools to lead, organize, and continue the fight for justice in Mississippi and beyond.”
Panels will vary from conversations about ending mass incarceration to the power and dangers of AI. The entire schedule can be seen here.
Evers-Everette said June 29 will be Medgar Evers’ Sunday, an interfaith service that reflects on the life and legacy of the NAACP leader, who was assassinated in Jackson on June 12, 1963. His killer was finally convicted in 1994, thanks to the persistence of his widow, Myrlie Evers.
“One hundred years after Medgar Evers entered this world, the threats he faced—hatred, violence, and suppression—still haunt communities across this country. But Medgar showed us what to do. He helped build a movement from the ground up—one that challenged power, demanded equality, and changed history,” said veteran Democratic strategist Chris Fleming. “Now it’s up to us to continue the work by honoring the blueprint he gave us—applying it with renewed strength, clear purpose, and today’s tools to galvanize the next generation to carry the fight for justice forward.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/23115733/AP22168730223972.jpg,,,2025-05-27 08:02:09.864162

Brad Pollitt, a Sedalia Republican, presents a bill to the House Education Committee to require the reporting of grade-level equivalence data on statewide assessments (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri parents may soon have a better understanding of whether their child is performing at or above grade level on the state’s standardized test under a sweeping education bill awaiting the governor’s signature. 
The legislation contains a provision that would require the state’s education department to add a fifth category to Missouri Assessment Program results, reporting “grade level” in addition to the current levels of “below basic,” “basic,” “proficient” and “advanced.” The new provision would include students in grades 3 to 8.

State Rep. Brad Pollitt, a Sedalia Republican and former school superintendent, introduced the bill to make student performance more transparent to parents and lawmakers.
As an educator, he learned that students at grade level score at the upper end of “basic,” but many people incorrectly assume “proficient” means performing at grade level, he told The Independent.
“In order to have accurate conversations about where our students are at, we need to know what grade level is,” he said.
The Missouri Assessment Program, often referred to as the MAP test, began in the 1990s with five scoring thresholds. But in response to the federal No Child Left Behind Act, state lawmakers required the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education to align MAP with federal performance standards.
In December 2005, educators met to determine the new standards in line with the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP. They set thresholds based on the percentage of students scoring proficient on the NAEP so that the proportion of students deemed proficient on the state test would be close to the amount reported by the national test.
The National Center for Educational Statistics and the NAEP’s governing board have repeatedly clarified that proficiency reflects “solid academic performance” and “does not signify being on grade level.”
But policymakers, parents and other stakeholders speak about proficiency and grade level interchangeably. And candidates for public office, misinterpreting what proficient means, have used MAP data to push anti-public-education policies.
During former state Sen. Bill Eigel’s run for governor last year, he told ABC17 that “less than a third of our children are able to do reading, writing, arithmetic at grade level.” At the time, 33% of Missouri fourth graders scored proficient or advanced in reading on the NAEP, and math had higher performance levels.
Despite the test’s administrators explaining that this is not a measure of grade level performance, politicians and media reports still repeat the misrepresentation.
“Part of my frustration has been that people criticize public education pretty hard and say we’re failing our kids because 35% of our students in third grade or fifth grade are proficient or advanced in reading,” Pollitt said. “We may have 35% that are above grade level, but maybe 60% of our kids are at grade level. And I think that changes the conversation.”
In a House committee hearing in January, lobbyists for public-education groups spoke in favor of the bill.
Brandt Shields, director of governmental relations for the Missouri School Boards’ Association, said a fifth category would be more “informative” for stakeholders.
“Having only four categories is almost a crude way of trying to differentiate how those scores are interpreted,” he said.
No one spoke in opposition, but the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s lobbyist warned that the change would require work groups to set the new standards, which is estimated to cost just over $1 million.
The language passed by the legislature exempts the department from having to employ work groups, but Pollitt said it is up to administrators to decide.

The U.S. has had more reported tornadoes than normal — over 960 as of May 22, according to the National Weather Service’s preliminary count.
That’s well above the national average of around 660 tornadoes reported by that point over the past 15 years, and it’s similar to 2024 — the second-most active year over that same period.
I’m an atmospheric scientist who studies natural hazards. What stands out about 2025 so far isn’t just the number of tornadoes, but how Tornado Alley has encompassed just about everything east of the Rockies, and how tornado season is becoming all year.
 Why has 2025 been so active?

The high tornado count in 2025 has a lot to do with the weather in March, which broke records with 299 reported tornadoes — far exceeding the average of 80 for that month over the past three decades.
March’s numbers were driven by two large tornado outbreaks: about 115 tornadoes swept across more than a dozen states March 14-16, stretching from Arkansas to Pennsylvania; and 145 tornadoes hit March 31 to April 1, primarily in a swath from Arkansas to Iowa and eastward. The 2025 numbers are preliminary pending final analyses.
While meteorologists don’t know for sure why March was so active, there were a couple of ingredients that favor tornadoes:

First, in March the climate was in a weak La Niña pattern, which is associated with a wavier and stormier jet stream and, often, with more U.S. tornadoes.
Second, the waters of the Gulf were much warmer than normal, which feeds moister air inland to fuel severe thunderstorms.

By April and May, however, those ingredients had faded. The weak La Niña ended and the Gulf waters were closer to normal.
April and May also produced tornado outbreaks, but the preliminary count over most of this period, since the March 31-April 1 outbreak, has actually been close to the average, though things could still change.
What has stood out in April and May is persistence: The jet stream has remained wavy, bringing with it the normal ebb and flow of stormy low-pressure weather systems mixed with sunny high-pressure systems. In May alone, tornadoes were reported in Colorado, Minnesota, Delaware, Florida and just about every state in between.
Years with fewer tornadoes often have calm periods of a couple of weeks or longer when a sunny high-pressure system is parked over the central U.S. However, the U.S. didn’t really get one of those calm periods in spring 2025.
 Tornado Alley shifts eastward

The locations of these storms have also been notable: The 2025 tornadoes through May have been widespread but clustered near the lower and central Mississippi Valley, stretching from Illinois to Mississippi.
That’s well to the east of traditional Tornado Alley, typically seen as stretching from Texas through Nebraska, and farther east than normal. April through May is still peak season for the Mississippi Valley, though it is usually on the eastern edge of activity rather than at the epicenter. The normal seasonal cycle of tornadoes moves inland from near the Gulf Coast in winter to the upper Midwest and Great Plains by summer.
Over the past few decades, the U.S. has seen a broad shift in tornadoes in three ways: to the east, earlier in the year and clustered into larger outbreaks.
Winter tornadoes have become more frequent over the eastern U.S., from the southeast, dubbed Dixie Alley for its tornado activity in recent years, to the Midwest, particularly Kentucky, Illinois and Indiana.
Meanwhile, there has been a steady and stark decline in tornadoes in the “traditional” tornado season and region: spring and summer in general, especially across the Great Plains.
It may come as a surprise that the U.S. has actually seen a decrease in overall U.S. tornado activity over the past several decades, especially for intense tornadoes categorized as EF2 and above. There have been fewer days with a tornado. However, those tornado days have been producing more tornadoes. These trends may have stabilized over the past decade.
 Deadlier tornadoes

This eastward shift is likely making tornadoes deadlier.
Tornadoes in the Southeastern U.S. are more likely to strike overnight, when people are asleep and cannot quickly protect themselves, which makes these events dramatically more dangerous. The tornado that hit London, Kentucky, struck after 11 p.m. Many of the victims were over age 65.
The shift toward more winter tornadoes has also left people more vulnerable. Since they may not expect tornadoes at that time of year, they are likely to be less prepared. Tornado detection and forecasting is rapidly improving and has saved thousands of lives over the past 50-plus years, but forecasts can save lives only if people are able to receive them.

This shift in tornadoes to the east and earlier in the year is very similar to how scientists expect severe thunderstorms to change as the world warms. However, researchers don’t know whether the overall downward trend in tornadoes is driven by warming or will continue into the future. Field campaigns studying how tornadoes form may help us better answer this question
 Remember that it only takes one

For safety, it’s time to stop focusing on spring as tornado season and the Great Plains as Tornado Alley.
Tornado Alley is really all of the U.S. east of the Rockies and west of the Appalachians for most of the year. The farther south you live, the longer your tornado season lasts.
Forecasters say it every year for hurricanes, and we badly need to start saying it for tornadoes too: It only takes one to make it a bad season for you or your community. Just ask the residents of London, Kentucky; St. Louis; Plevna and Grinnell, Kansas; and McNairy County, Tennessee.
Listen to your local meteorologists so you will know when your region is facing a tornado risk. And if you hear sirens or are under a tornado warning, immediately go to your safe space. A tornado may already be on the ground, and you may have only seconds to protect yourself.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Republican lawmakers are seeking to implement a pair of bills that would prevent low-income Wisconsinites from buying “junk” food and ban certain ingredients in school meals, taking inspiration from U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy’s “Make America Healthy Again” agenda.
Rep. Clint Moses (R-Menomonie), the lead author on both of the bills, has said he wants to help ensure the food children and others are eating is healthy. 
AB 180 would bar participants in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) — or, as it’s known in Wisconsin, FoodShare — from purchasing soda and candy with their benefits. Under the bill, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) would need to submit a waiver to the federal government for approval to make the change to the program.
Kennedy wants a similar policy implemented nationwide, and so far several states, including Arkansas and Indiana, have asked the Trump administration for a waiver that would remove soda and candy from SNAP eligibility.
Moses said at a hearing on the proposal earlier this month that by allowing people to purchase those items with FoodShare, Wisconsin is “facilitating consumption of harmful, additive-filled foods” and that “instead, we should be supporting healthy, sustainable food choices for [people’s] overall health of individuals, the health of our society as a whole.”
Moses argued the restrictions wouldn’t be a novel idea, since people already can’t use their SNAP benefits to purchase alcohol, pet food and other items. SNAP currently also can’t be used for hot foods (such as a meal at a restaurant), supplements and vitamins and nonfood items. 
He also compared it to the Women, Infants & Children (WIC) program, the assistance program that provides free healthy foods, breastfeeding support, nutrition education and referrals to other services to income-eligible pregnant and postpartum women, breastfeeding moms and children under 5.
“Most government money has strings attached to what that money can be used for,” Moses told the Assembly Public Benefits Reform Committee. “Adding this provision is no different than the special supplemental nutrition program for the WIC program… WIC basically includes a list of good items or essentials that people can buy that does not include any of this other stuff.”
Expert: SNAP, WIC have different goals
UW-Madison food insecurity expert Judith Bartfeld says, however, that the programs are fundamentally different. WIC serves as a narrowly targeted nutrition program that provides specific foods for a defined group of nutritionally at-risk people. 
The SNAP program, meanwhile, is designed to serve as a “supplement to existing income” and “to fill the gap between a USDA estimate of what is needed to meet a household’s food needs and the amount a given household is assumed to be able to spend on food out of current income,” Bartfeld wrote in an email to the Examiner.
She said periodic state and federal attempts to restrict SNAP have been unsuccessful in the past, in part because of a “reluctance to upset the balance for a program that is a backbone of the safety net.” 
According to DHS, the SNAP program helps nearly 700,000 Wisconsinites put food on their tables annually. A USDA study from 2016, the most recent year, found that “there were no major differences in the expenditure patterns of SNAP and non-SNAP households, no matter how the data were categorized,” and that similar to other families, SNAP recipients spend about 20 cents of every dollar on sweetened drinks, desserts, salty snacks, candy and sugar. 
“It’s intended to provide extra resources to support buying food at the store — and its effectiveness in reducing food insecurity is well documented,” Bartfeld said. “There have long been concerns that restricting how benefits can be used would make things more complicated for retailers, more stigmatizing for participants, unlikely to translate into meaningful health improvements, and would risk reducing participation and jeopardizing the well-documented benefits of SNAP on food security.”
In addition, she said, “identifying specific foods that are healthy or unhealthy is much more complicated in practice than it sounds.” 
Bartfeld said SNAP combats food insecurity because it provides additional resources to low income people and has become “less stigmatizing and easier to use.” Restrictions, she said, could end up having a negative effect.  
“If putting restrictions on SNAP ends up making it stigmatizing for participants, more complicated for retailers or opens the door to an increasingly constrained program, there are real concerns it may become less effective as an anti-hunger program — which of course would have negative health outcomes; this is why the anti-hunger community has long opposed bans such as this, and considered food bans as a line better not crossed,” Bartfeld said.
FoodShare cuts would cost Wisconsin $314 million a year, state health department reports

Bartfeld said it’s also unclear if a ban would improve health. Despite attempts to model health effects of a SNAP soda ban, she said, there is no empirical evidence proposed bans would meaningfully change diets or improve health outcomes.
“In contrast, there is real-world evidence that incentivizing healthy food purchases can modestly impact food choices,” Bartfeld said. “And SNAP has a nutrition education program (SNAP-Ed, which goes by FoodWise in Wisconsin), that appears to increase healthy eating — even as, ironically, that funding is currently at risk.”
The GOP-bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday included “some of the largest cuts in the program’s history” the SNAP program, according to CNBC. 
The bill would expand work requirements to qualify for benefits, likely leading to reduced participation, cut federal funding and leave it up to states to fill in the gaps and it would entirely eliminate funding for the education program. According to Wisconsin DHS, the cuts would cost the state approximately $314 million every year and would put 90,000 people at risk of losing benefits. The bill now goes to the Senate.
Punishing low-income Wisconsinites?
Bartfeld said this is one of the challenges with some of the recent “health-focused” SNAP proposals across the county as the other proposed cuts and restrictions to the program are unrelated or “often run counter to health.” 
“That interest in benefit cuts is happening in tandem with increasing attention to food choices does mean that food programs are at the center of the action, and it can make it challenging to differentiate proposals that are really about health from those that are more fundamentally about regulating the low income [population] and paring back assistance,” Bartfeld said. 
Moses during his testimony described the proposal as part of a “national movement basically to really make our food supply healthier.” He said it shouldn’t be partisan and noted former First Lady Michelle Obama’s campaign to improve school meals. 
“I expect to receive full support from not just the Legislature but the governor as well,” Moses said. 
Democrats on the committee didn’t appear on board with the legislation. Rep. Ryan Clancy (D-Milwaukee) expressed concerns about the legislation focusing on low-income Wisconsinites and including unclear, arbitrary definitions.
Clancy asked Moses about low-income families using benefits to celebrate Halloween and special occasions. Moses replied that “if their kids really want candy, they can go into the neighbor’s house then they could trick or treat, and they’d probably get all the candy they want, but the benefit would be that the taxpayers wouldn’t be paying for it.”
“People that are on SNAP… they are taxpayers as well,” Clancy said, “so I don’t want to categorize folks who are experiencing, hopefully, temporary poverty from being taxpayers. They’re chipping in for, you know, health care benefits and everything else.” He added, “We’re, I think, just targeting low-income people with this.” 
Clancy demonstrated his point by pulling out a bottle of Snickers-flavored iced coffee, a seltzer water and, at one point, a cup of ice cream and a bottle of root beer. He poured the root beer into the ice cream, saying the milk in it would make it acceptable to purchase under the definitions in the bill. The definition for “soft drink” is “a beverage that contains less than 0.5 percent of alcohol and that contains natural or artificial sweeteners” and “does not include a beverage that contains milk or milk products; soy, rice, or similar milk substitutes; or more than 50 percent vegetable or fruit juice by volume.” 
“A root beer float is totally fine right? By taking this sugary thing, adding it to another sugary thing, this is now legal for somebody to use their FoodShare benefits,” Clancy said. 
Committee Chair Rep. Dan Knodl (R-Germantown) told Clancy to stop, saying that the hearing “isn’t a cooking show.” 
Banning additives in school meals
Another bill — AB 226 — would target “ultraprocessed” foods in schools by banning certain ingredients from meals, “Ultraprocessed foods” were one of the top concerns recently outlined by Kennedy and a report the Trump administration commissioned, and Kennedy has expressed interest in banning other additives as well.
Among the additives the bill identifies are brominated vegetable oil, potassium bromate, propylparaben, azodicarbonamide and red dye No. 3, which can be found in candy, fruit juices, cookies and other products.
Moses told lawmakers on the Assembly Education Committee that additives named in the bill are either in the process of being banned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or have been subject of peer-reviewed studies that found links to adverse side effects if consumed in significant enough amounts. For example, Red No. 3 and brominated vegetable oil are both no longer approved for use in food by the FDA. 
“Our school lunches should not be filled with substances that negatively affect our students’ health, even including their mental health,” Moses told the committee.
Moses said the bill would “bypass the need for federal action while not forcing schools to risk loss of federal funds to pay for existing school lunch programs.” He also noted that other states, including California, are also working to ban the ingredients.
The bill would go into effect on July 1, 2027.
An earlier version of the bill only included free- and reduced-price meals, but it was amended after concerns from the Department of Public Instruction and the School Nutrition Association of Wisconsin. Both now support the bill. 
The Department of Public Instruction said the legislation aligns with positive trends in nutrition. 
“With an increased focus on farm-to-school programs and the use of local food, school nutrition programs are helping to improve the nutritional value of meals,” Kim Vercauteren, policy initiatives advisor for the DPI Division for Finance and Management, said in testimony. “Many schools and school nutrition vendors are already committed to providing meals that utilize unprocessed foods, which can be enjoyed without harmful, nutritionally useless additives. These programs not only encourage the use of healthy food, but educate students on healthy lifelong choices.” 
Targeted additives not common in schools
Members of the Healthy School Meals For All Coalition told the Wisconsin Examiner that they support the proposal, but also they hope it isn’t the only thing that lawmakers do to help improve school meals. The coalition of school food stakeholders has been advocating for free school meals for all Wisconsin students and for improving the quality of food served to students.
“We appreciate the fact that they’re looking out for the well-being of our students and see the work that we do,” School Nutrition Association of Wisconsin President Kaitlin Tauriainen said in an interview. “We’re hoping that some of these steps will allow us to build more of a bridge so we can understand each other’s point of view — whether that means taking steps to grant more access to food for kids or jumping right into the full meals for all free meals for all, which is something you know we certainly want.”
Tauriainen said that school nutrition professionals are focused on feeding students the healthiest food possible, although the ingredients listed in the bill already aren’t common in school meals. 
“I would say the majority of our manufacturers that we’ve talked to don’t have those additives in their food,” Tauriainen, who is the child nutrition coordinator for the Ashwaubenon School District, said. “So it’s really kind of a non-issue.”
Allison Pfaff Harris, farm to school director with REAP Food Group, a Madison-based nonprofit, said she appreciates that the bill is trying to address the school food “supply side.” She said, however, that school nutrition programs need support in moving away from other processed ingredients not mentioned in the bill. 
Operating on limited budgets, school nutrition programs “turn to those quicker ingredients, which are going to be more processed foods,” Pfaff Harris said, adding that “not all processed foods have those food additive ingredients.”
Pfaff Harris suggested pairing Moses’ bill with other improvements. She said the “big ask” for the coalition is no-cost school meals, but smaller steps would also be significant. Guaranteeing that the breakfast reimbursement for schools is 15 cents per meal could improve the supply chain and nutrition programs, she said. DPI prorates payments because it lacks funding to pay the full cost; Pfaff Harris said the current reimbursement rate is about 7 cents. 
“This is one piece of the puzzle, but it’s a small piece in the giant puzzle,” Pfaff Harris said. 
Pfaff Harris said the discussion about healthy meals is also challenging because there have been recent federal decisions cutting resources that help schools serve fresh ingredients. Wisconsin was set to receive $11 million in funding for “Local Food for Schools” programs, but it was cut by the Trump administration. 
“You’re having these bills introduced, which is a good thing, but … from my perspective, if we really wanted to make a difference in school nutrition programs and help them to be able to do more scratch cooking and semi-scratch and fresh ingredients, it’s getting that funding back,”  Pfaff Harris said.
Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison) asked Moses about free school meals and other proposals, saying it could improve his bill. 
Moses said her suggestions seemed like a completely different bill altogether.
“It doesn’t matter to me if it’s reduced or people are paying for it. I want [the meals] to be safe …” Moses said. “Essentially, it’s not the intent of this bill.”

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey laws allow shopkeepers, librarians, harbormasters, casino security officers, public transit workers, and just about anyone else to make a citizen’s arrest if they spot a scofflaw they think should be brought to justice.
But a commission tasked with ensuring the Garden State’s statutes remain relevant wants legislators to revoke the authority of most citizens to detain suspected lawbreakers.
The “anachronistic” statutes that allow citizen’s arrests don’t spell out how much suspicion is necessary to warrant action, how much force a citizen can use to detain someone, how long a suspect can be held, and what liability a citizen has if they wrongly apprehend someone, the New Jersey Law Revision Commission said in a new report.
Without that clarity, citizen’s arrests could result in civil rights violations and threaten the safety of both the arrestee and arrester, given that ordinary citizens lack the training and experience to detain someone, said Barbara Brosnan Rivera, the commission’s counsel.
“Over the years, as organized police forces have developed, the need for citizen’s arrest has decreased,” Rivera said Thursday during the commission’s monthly meeting.
People have misinterpreted or abused citizen’s arrest laws with fatal consequences, Rivera said. She pointed to the 2020 death of Ahmaud Arbery, a jogger who was killed in Georgia by three men who said they chased and killed him because they suspected he was a burglar. The men were eventually convicted of hate crimes and imprisoned, and lawmakers subsequently repealed Georgia’s citizen’s arrest law.
Most states have citizen’s arrest statutes, but some, including New York and South Carolina, are now considering amending them because of similar concerns, Rivera said.
The commission first identified New Jersey citizen’s arrest statutes as ripe for review early in the pandemic, when questions arose about whether citizens could arrest people who ignored Gov. Phil Murphy’s mask mandate and other social distancing rules, Rivera said. At that time, Murphy discouraged citizen’s arrests, saying anyone wanting to bring a mask flouter to account should alert police.
New Jersey laws on citizen’s arrests date back to the 1800s, with at least one remaining “virtually unchanged” for over a century, the commission’s report says.
They empower citizens to detain someone they see commit disorderly conduct offenses, which are minor transgressions such as lewdness, harassment, fighting, and cursing in a public place. The laws also authorize shopkeepers to hold suspected shoplifters and librarians to detain people they suspect of stealing books and other borrowable materials, Rivera said.
They further grant arrest authority to “special officers” who suspect wrongdoing, including harbormasters, people working for stud farms and agricultural fairs and exhibitions, constables, and those working to capture prison escapees and parole absconders.
The commission’s report recommends that legislators disempower citizens and librarians from making citizen’s arrests and more explicitly define the authority and responsibilities of shopkeepers who want to detain suspected thieves.
The report also urges lawmakers to revoke arrest authority from “special officers” and revoke that term from statutes because it “appears to be a vestige of a bygone era.” Lawmakers already abolished constables in a law Gov. Phil Murphy signed last year, Rivera added.
Commissioners, though, noted that some agencies still might use special officers and need detention authority, such as harbormasters who discover illicit cargo or missing permits and licenses on boats they inspect.
So the commissioners directed staff to seek guidance from law enforcement on whether any special officers still operate in New Jersey and which among them should retain arrest authority.
Commissioner Edward Hartnett, a professor at Seton Hall University’s law school, also predicted the report could receive “policy pushback” from gun-rights advocates who might insist on a right to make citizen’s arrests.
“It seems to me that one strand of the gun-rights movement is that people need to be able to act, precisely because they can’t count on public authorities to act in time,” Hartnett said.
The report is tentative, and the commission is still accepting public comments it will consider before issuing a final report. Comments can be emailed to bbr@njlrc.org, faxed to (973) 648-3123, or mailed to 153 Halsey St., 7th floor, Box 47016, Newark, N.J. 07102.

(Photo courtesy of Scott and Julia Whitnall)Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.
Balanced markets
Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.
Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
Help for teachers
Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Frustrated with religious content and polarizing language added to Oklahoma academic standards, some parents say they plan to opt their children out of “ideologically charged” social studies lessons in public schools.
Families and liberal advocates across the state, relying on parental rights laws that Republicans championed, are drafting letters to exempt their children from new social studies content that conservative leaders enacted this year.
“Now that it’s being codified and now that it’s being brought more into the public eye, the liberals have realized that those are our rights too,” Tulsa parent Lauren Parker said.
The “biggest glaring red flag” in the new social studies standards, Parker said, is language that casts doubt on the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. President Donald Trump has refused to concede defeat to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 race, despite courts across the country dismissing Trump’s lawsuits claiming election fraud.
Under the new standards, Oklahoma high school U.S. history classes will be required to have students “identify discrepancies” in the 2020 election results, including the “sudden halting of ballot-counting in select cities in key battleground states, the security risks of mail-in balloting, sudden batch dumps, an unforeseen record number of voters, and the unprecedented contradiction of ‘bellwether county’ trends.”

State Superintendent Ryan Walters quietly added these claims without acknowledging them until after the standards passed a vote by the Oklahoma State Board of Education. Half of the board later said they were unaware of the new content when they voted on it.
A lawsuit in Oklahoma County District Court is challenging whether the Education Department and the board followed proper procedures when approving the standards.
Parker said she contacted her home district, Tulsa Public Schools, to opt her children out of being taught about “election fraud that never happened.”
She also objected to Walters’ new requirements that Oklahoma schools incorporate Bible stories and Jesus’ teachings into their curriculum — an effort she views as Christian nationalism and religious indoctrination.
“I​t literally was one of the most painful experiences of my life growing up in Christianity, and so it’s the last thing that I want my daughters to learn about in school,” Parker said. “Of course, we discuss things, but it’s just that this isn’t about history and facts. It’s about pushing their faith on us, and that’s unacceptable. It’s un-American.”
Walters said he implemented the biblical content not to convert students to Christianity, but to ensure they understand the beliefs that inspired America’s core principles and that influenced the country’s founding fathers.
It’s “concerning that parents would opt their kids out of understanding American history,” Walters said Thursday, but it’s a choice they have a right to make. 
“We want parents to have opt-outs,” Walters said. “We want parents to be able to make those decisions. I think that’s a bad decision on their part.”

Local organization We’re Oklahoma Education, or WOKE, is distributing sample opt-out letters through social media. Members of the group are known for regularly attending state Board of Education meetings and protesting Walters.
The organization has about 200 active volunteers in Oklahoma and 1,000 followers on its social media and email lists, director Erica Watkins said. 
Many of them are parents frustrated with Walters’ far-right brand of politics and the “ideologically charged” content he inserted into Oklahoma’s academic standards, said Watkins, a mother of two students in Jenks Public Schools. 
WOKE, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the label Republicans apply to left-leaning opponents, formed as a liberal counter to Moms for Liberty, a conservative national group also focused on education policy.
“If you believe parents know best, then that applies to all parents,” Watkins said. “And so that’s why we went ahead and used the channels that they put in place to push back against some of their more indoctrinating things that they’re putting into our schools.”
Watkins said her family isn’t religious, so she intends to exempt her children from new standards teaching the Bible. 
She said the 2020 election language is also out of the question.
“I don’t want my kids hearing that,” Watkins said. “That’s propaganda, and I don’t think it’s appropriate to be taught in school.”
Stillwater Public Schools parent Saralynn Boren, a WOKE member, said the group first started drafting opt-out letters after Walters invited public schools to use “pro-America kids content” from the conservative media entity PragerU.
The letters also invite parents to opt out of conservative content from Hillsdale College, Turning Point USA and even from “any interaction” with Walters himself. 
The group extended the letter template to add social studies standards on Judeo-Christian values, God, the Bible, the 2020 election and other topics. Watkins said they did so after the Republican majority in the state Legislature declined to take action on the academic standards.
A GOP-led attempt to disapprove the standards emerged in the state Senate, but the chamber’s Republican caucus decided to allow the new content to pass after having a closed-door meeting with Walters.
The Senate’s leader, President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, said he is supportive of parents who are now choosing to opt out of the standards.
“I think we give parents the ability to opt out of lots of things,” Paxton said. “If that’s what they want to opt out of, I would certainly support them being able to do that.”

Oklahoma law guarantees parents the right to direct their minor children’s education and moral or religious training. Parents are allowed to withdraw their children from any learning material or activity on moral or religious grounds. 
Boren, of Stillwater, said her past opt-out requests over PragerU were “well received” by her children’s district.
Stillwater district spokesperson Barry Fuxa said families always have had the right to choose an alternative assignment or learning material. He told Oklahoma Voice the district has not yet received any opt-out requests over new social studies standards.
“At this time, our response to families with concerns would be to ask them to give us time to learn more about the standards and to allow our admin and teacher teams time to develop plans of how the standards will be implemented in our curriculum,” he said.
Tulsa Public Schools also upholds parents’ rights to review instructional materials, both under state law and school board policy, the district said in a statement through its spokesperson, Luke Chitwood. 
Tulsa will spend the 2025-26 school year selecting instructional materials that align with the new social studies standards and will implement the new content in 2026-27, Chitwood said. That selection process will involve teachers, parents and community members, he said.
More parental engagement in education is a positive thing, said Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City. 
But Kirt said she’s concerned political divisions are becoming wider. The new academic standards, as well as other efforts supporting state-funded religious education, could be a wedge driving Oklahomans further apart.
“If we have separate schools for everybody who has different beliefs, we’re going to have some real challenges about living together and working together and having an economy together,” Kirt said. “So, I’m worried about how that’s going to turn out. But do I want my child learning inaccurate information in their classroom? No, I don’t.”

Brad Little said he had thoughts on the “big, beautiful bill” advancing through Congress.
To extend 2017 tax cuts, the bill would deeply cut federal spending for programs, including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
Speaking to reporters, Little said he wondered how it would impact Idaho.
“I don’t want to be in a position to where the big, beautiful bill passes, and myself and all my fellow governors are going to be back there whining and crying,” he said on May 12.

But he soon added that Idaho would be better prepared than other states — because of the state’s stockpiled rainy day fund, and investments in facilities, schools and roads.
“I’ve said this many times: With what we’ve done in the past, where we are, almost anything that happens at the federal level is going to impact the other 49 states more than it is Idaho,” Little said. “And I feel that about the big, beautiful bill.”
Last week, he threw his support behind the bill — also backed by President Donald Trump. The bill passed the U.S. House and now heads to the U.S. Senate.
It could shift millions of dollars in SNAP costs onto Idaho.

 ‘We’re doing a good job … why would you penalize us?’ Idaho Gov. Little says

SNAP is a federal program that states run. The federal government pays for benefits. But states already chip in somewhat, by splitting administrative costs with the federal government. 
“States have really very little flexibility or options in how to administer it,” the Idaho governor’s budget chief, Lori Wolff, told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview.
But where states do have flexibility, Idaho opts toward oversight, she explained — like limiting exemptions for SNAP work requirements, prosecuting fraud cases, and ensuring payments are made accurately. Idaho has been among the top three states for payment accuracies for years, Wolff said. 
In Little’s remarks a couple weeks ago, he leaned on Idaho’s metrics, too.

Idaho is one of the most efficient states at running the federal SNAP program, he said, citing a recent report that showed Idaho had a range of extra program accountability measures than other states. 
“That’s one of the things I’m worried about, is they categorically tell all the states, ‘We’re going to cut your program by such and such,’” Idaho’s governor said. “And I says, ‘We’re doing a good job. We’ve got the highest compliance rate, the least amount of fraud. Why would you penalize us?’”
Last week, Little and 19 other Republican governors endorsed the bill, two days before it passed the U.S. House with only support from congressional Republicans. 
Changes are expected in the U.S. Senate. But as it stands now, the bill would benefit wealthy taxpayers more while decreasing resources for low-income families, an analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found.  
 Bill could increase Idaho’s SNAP costs by at least $18M, state health official says

Idaho has the second lowest SNAP payment error rate in the nation, which is only behind South Dakota, according to the most recent data from the United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA. That figure measures “the accuracy of each state’s eligibility and benefit determinations,” USDA says.

The Gem State is among only seven states that would qualify for the lowest state cost-sharing for SNAP under the bill being considered in Congress, States Newsroom reported. The bill would require those states to pay for 5% of SNAP benefits, and require states with higher SNAP error rates to pay even more.
It could raise Idaho’s costs for SNAP by at least $18 million, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare spokesperson AJ McWhorter told the Sun. 
That requirement wouldn’t start until 2028. So that gives Idaho officials time to plan, he said. 
Idaho already pitches in some money for SNAP. Last year, Idaho spent more than $8 million to run the program, McWhorter said. 
But that is only a small fraction of what the program costs. Last year, Idaho’s SNAP program gave out $271 million in benefits to low-income families last year, he said. 
Less than 3.5% of Idaho’s SNAP payments were in error, USDA data shows. That’s around three times lower than the national average payment error rate, which was 11.7%.
“Idaho is often seen as a model for successful SNAP administration,” McWhorter said. “Federal policymakers can use us as an example for other states.”



 Idaho asks feds to ban candy, soda from SNAP 

The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare on May 16 asked the federal government for permission to ban candy and soda from being covered by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
This year, the Legislature required Health and Welfare to submit that waiver through House Bill 109.
Last week, Nebraska became the first state to receive approval for that type of waiver from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Nebraska Examiner reported. 
More than 3 million people would lose SNAP benefits under GOP bill, nonpartisan report says

In a news release, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare cited USDA data to claim that about 20% of SNAP purchases nationally are for “sugary beverages and snacks.” 
The agency couldn’t immediately share the source for that claim. A USDA spokesperson directed the Idaho Capital Sun to a 2016 study that found “About 20 cents out of every dollar was spent on sweetened beverages, desserts, salty snacks, candy and sugar.”
The study has many limitations, and “should not be considered nationally representative,” the USDA spokesperson added. 
The American Heart Association says it supports Idaho’s move and is asking the USDA to quickly approve the waiver.
“The American Heart Association is committed to removing sugary drinks from SNAP, and we are proud to stand in support of Idaho’s efforts to do so over the soda industry’s unconscionable opposition,” American Heart Association CEO Nancy Brown said in a written statement.

(Photo courtesy of Scott and Julia Whitnall)Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

 Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.
Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
 Help for teachers

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Cow hunting could soon cease in six Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem herds, experts predict. Meanwhile, nearly half of hunter-killed bulls could be headed for the dumpster if disease rates reach projected levels. 
The post Golden era of northwest Wyoming elk hunting slides toward expected but undesirable end appeared first on WyoFile .","Droves of Wyoming residents will click over to Game and Fish’s website on June 19 to review their draw results for elk hunting tags. Thousands will be looking to see if they’ll have a shot at a cow or calf in the vast complex of mostly public land stretching across the southern Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. 
The opportunities there are great, and have been for a long time. The long-studied Jackson Elk Herd, although experiencing a stretch of relative scarcity, has been one of the largest elk herds in the American West for generations — a population held in check by targeting the females.
On the south end of Jackson Hole, the Fall Creek Herd has similarly thrived. This year, Wyoming’s offering 750 limited-quota tags that will give hunters a chance to put a cow or calf in the freezer in the two hunt areas, split by the Snake River, where the herd dwells.
The abundance continues farther south and east in the Afton, Piney, Pinedale and Upper Green River herds. Many hundreds more Wyoming residents will hand over $43 to vie for a chance at bagging a cow or calf elk during late-season hunts, when animals are down at lower elevations and easier to kill. 
It’s no secret that wapiti are thriving statewide. They’re doing so well, especially in places with lots of private land, it’s even problematic. Wildlife managers are going to great lengths to kill more female elk — the reproducers that drive the size of any ungulate herd.

But such abundance isn’t expected to last for six northwestern Wyoming herds. By around a decade from now, cow elk hunting might no longer be necessary, and, in fact, prohibited. Instead, a new force of nature would fill the herd-shrinking role that human hunters now play. 
That factor is chronic wasting disease. It’s an incurable, transmissible neurological condition that shrinks the lifespan of its wapiti hosts from 15 or so years down to just a few. Spread by always-lethal prions that can live in the environment for decades, it’s not always devastating for elk. Herds, even overpopulated ones like those in the Laramie Mountains, have lived with CWD at lower prevalence rates for decades.

But there’s a differentiating factor for the six herds where experts expect that cow hunting could soon end. For months at a time during the winter, thousands of these animals are parked on feedgrounds, eating hay and alfalfa in small spaces where scientists have learned that feeding drives up contact rates between animals and accelerates the spread of diseases. Chronic wasting disease is just now reaching the region, and the response so far, guided by a management plan, is to maintain the status quo. 
Many northwestern Wyoming elk hunters appear to be greeting the looming calamity with a shrug, said Hank Edwards, a retired wildlife health laboratory supervisor for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department.
“I have tried in so many of my presentations to get the message across that this is dire,” Edwards told WyoFile. “Yet, people just don’t get it. They say, ‘F*** it, I’ll get to hunt another 10 years, then I’ll be too old to hunt. Who cares?’” 
Hunter receptions
With the worst effects of CWD on feedground elk still years away, concerns among rank-and-file hunters are out there. But it hasn’t yet been cause for alarm. When the Game and Fish Commission solicited comments in response to its proposed elk hunting seasons for 2025, the public submitted several hundred remarks. But only a few comment writers encouraged precautionary steps to avert the likely worst outcomes of a disease that experts expect will decimate six elk herds within a decade, or two at most.
“I recommend lowering the objective. We need to kill some elk,” former Game and Fish Commissioner Mark Anselmi wrote about hunting seasons in Jackson Hole. “CWD has raised its head and [at] some point in [the] future, I would guess the refuge will quit feeding. Knock the population down by harvest while you can.”

Green River resident Bill Ames made a similar request. He called for reducing densities of feedground-dependent, overpopulated elk along the Wyoming Range’s Piney Front.
“I would like to see herd objectives reviewed with possible CWD impacts and reducing feedground dependency,” wrote Ames, who also asked for a late-season hunt on the footprint of a 33-acre feedground in the Bondurant area where an epidemic is incubating. “What can we do to put elk of the Dell Creek feedground in people’s freezers and avoid the slaughter of a high prevalence of CWD?” 
A Pinedale resident also sent in an unconventional idea to address feedground elk. Otherwise, there was little encouragement to tackle a disease threat that could upend Northwest Wyoming elk hunting as it is known today. 
Pavillion outfitter B.J. Hill, who runs hunts in the Jackson Hole area, denies that there’s a problem. 
“The CWD narrative is being driven by some of the Jackson managers and staff as well the [National Elk Refuge] employees,” Hill wrote in his comment letter. “It’s basically in-house activism unchecked.”

Outfitters like Hill have largely voiced support for keeping elk feeding going, regardless of CWD. He’s insisted in the past that expert projections are wrong. Other outfitters have said they’re open to closing feedgrounds, so long as state wildlife managers don’t lower their targeted herd sizes.
Lee Livingston, a past president of the Wyoming Outfitters and Guides Association, said he doesn’t see any easy answers to state and federal wildlife managers’ predicament. The feedground system is over a century old. It has separated elk herds from domestic cattle, propped up populations, insulated herds from the effects of bad winters and allowed them to cope with the loss of habitat from private land development.
“Unless you just did a wholesale slaughter of elk, I don’t see how you could shut down feedgrounds,” Livingston said at last week’s Wyoming Sportsperson Conservation Forum in Dubois. “If you’re going to shut down feedgrounds, then you need to come up with an alternative.” 
There have been small-scale efforts to do just that, like paying ranchers to host elk. 
Another alternative that’s being assessed is having fewer elk on the landscape in order to forgo feeding. Right-sizing herds to fit the natural winter range that’s available isn’t a popular idea — outfitters have signaled they’ll oppose it — but it’s the path that wildlife officials who understand disease dynamics predict will lead to the best outcomes for populations and elk hunting. 
Path of most destruction
Wildlife disease experts have gamed out what they expect is about to take place in the Jackson Elk Herd and other five feedground-region herds. The scientific inquiries were published by the U.S. Geological Survey in 2023 and 2024 in anticipation of changes to elk feeding sites on federal land. 
Elk populations and hunting opportunities decline under all scenarios analyzed, including the end of all cow hunting. The reason for the latter, USGS disease ecologist Paul Cross explained, is that the analysis assumed Wyoming would maintain its current elk herd size objectives, but that, by around year 10, the actual populations would tumble more than 20% below the goal. When that happens, wildlife managers’ standard response is to scale back or end cow hunting to allow the herds to grow.
While declines are expected regardless of management choices, the keep-feeding option shakes out the worst. 
“Our predictions are a 55% reduction in population size across the five herd units, excluding Jackson,” Cross told WyoFile.

Within 20 years, CWD prevalence in those still-fed herds is expected to reach 42%, he said. 
Those animals, for many hunters, will be headed for the trash instead of the freezer. There’s never been evidence of CWD crossing over to humans. But studies suggest there’s not an absolute barrier, and Game and Fish promotes Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization guidance to not consume CWD-positive animals.
Expected rates of CWD among feedground elk are four times greater than the highest rates detected in Wyoming elk today. The Iron Mountain Herd, with just 10% prevalence, currently tops the charts in elk, according to the state’s latest assessment. 
Filmmaker Shane Moore, an avid elk hunter who grew up on a ranch in the Gros Ventre Range, understands the skepticism about the expert projections. 
“They are really admittedly nothing more than guesses,” said Moore, who sat on the working group that shaped Wyoming’s CWD plan. “But they’re guesses from very bright people — the most knowledgeable people.”

The eight wildlife disease experts who contributed to the USGS study include: Emily Almberg, Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks; Justin Binfet, Wyoming Game and Fish Department; Hank Edwards, Wyoming Game and Fish (now retired); Nathan Galloway, National Park Service; Glen Sargeant, U.S. Geological Survey; Brant Schumaker, University of Wyoming; Daniel Walsh, U.S. Geological Survey; and Ben Wise, Wyoming Game and Fish.
Moore is one of the few hunters who has vocally advocated for Wyoming to heed the scientific predictions. 
“Right now, we have only bad choices,” Moore said. “When you’re faced with two bad choices, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t take the best of the bad choices. We haven’t, in my opinion.”

Political realities constrain Wyoming Game and Fish from making any sharp turns on elk feeding. The Wyoming Legislature passed a law in 2021 requiring feedground closures be vetted by the Wyoming Livestock Board and leaving the decisionmaking authority to the governor. And the agency’s feedground plan relies on developing tertiary herd-specific plans that require building consensus with pro-feeding parties. 
Moore laments that an issue that could jeopardize elk hunting’s future has become so politicized. 
“I think the sad reality is we’re not listening to the biologists in the community,” he said, “we’re listening to the politicians.” 
‘Real life test case’
Meanwhile, CWD is spreading steadily into the feedground region. Dead elk that tested positive were found last winter at four of the 21 sites, and there’s no knowing how many additional live infected elk were shedding the prions that spread the disease. 
“This is going to be a real life test case of model predictions and CWD dynamics in elk feedgrounds,” said Game and Fish’s Binfet — one of the experts who contributed to the USGS’ modeling. 
There’s no knowing what’s about to happen, he said. 
“CWD may not be the demise of elk in the GYE, as some folks fear,” Binfet said. “The other thing that would not surprise me is if feedgrounds contribute to a situation whereby we see CWD prevalence in elk skyrocket.”

Game and Fish retiree Edwards, the wildlife health laboratory supervisor who also contributed to the projections, is pessimistic. Over his decades on the job, he consistently saw how the feedgrounds spread disease. During one bad winter in the early 2000s, he said, brucellosis rates at the Alpine feedground spiked from 30% to 80% in one year. 
You could easily make the case, Edwards said, that CWD is going to be spread more effectively than brucellosis, which doesn’t flare up until fetuses are aborted in the spring. 
“As the snow melts, all those feces that have been buried and trampled become available,” he said. “The likelihood of transmission is going to increase.”
Edwards worries that elk hunters don’t grasp what’s about to hit them. 
“It may take a big increase in prevalence at Dell Creek or whatever feedground before the public really starts to take notice,” Edwards said. “Unfortunately by then, it’s going to be too late.” 
By too late, he means CWD will have already started the process of destroying the herds. The eye-opening changes it can inflict upon an ungulate population will likely be “permanent,” he said.  
“From all that we know about prion diseases,” Edwards said, “the populations are not going to recover.”

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)The tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week targets a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government. The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.
Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.
But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.

Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

While the federal government protects animals listed under the Endangered Species Act, states are tasked with keeping the vast majority of other species out of the “emergency room.” Habitat loss, pollution and climate change are making that job much more difficult.
At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.

In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.
 Reconsidering wildlife agencies’ funding model across the U.S.

Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.
Idaho Fish and Game must evolve for the future of wildlife conservation

Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.
 Should wildlife agencies include non-game species in their mission?

In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.

Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”
 Should wildlife, conservation commissions be overhauled?

Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

Nebraska judges have routinely gotten salary bumps since 2005, with annual July 1 increases in all but 2018. Even then, to make up for it, judges got two raises in 2019: Jan. 1 and July 1.
This year, Legislative Bill 513, from State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln, as chair of the Legislature’s Judiciary Committee, seeks to offer 1.5% salary raises in each of the next two fiscal years — on July 1 and again July 1, 2026. Under LB 513, which is one vote away from passing, the seven justices on the Nebraska Supreme Court would be paid $228,431.18 on July 1. This would rise to $231,857.65 on July 1, 2026.

Recent history of Nebraska judicial salaries
History of judicial, executive, legislative salaries


The increases would cost taxpayers about $1.5 million and leave the state with about $1.1 million in wiggle room for any other budget priorities for the next two years.
Remaining judges are paid a percentage of what Supreme Court justices are paid:

Court of Appeals (six judges): 95%, currently $213,802.58.
District Courts (58 judges): 92.5%, currently $208,176.20.
Separate Juvenile Courts (12 judges, Douglas, Lancaster and Sarpy Counties): 92.5%, currently $208,176.20.
Workers’ Compensation Court (seven judges): 92.5%, currently $208,176.20.
County Courts (58 judges): 90%, currently $202,549.82.




Under state law, members of the Nebraska Tax Equalization and Review Commission also get salary and benefit increases when state judges do.
While largely a consensus issue, LB 513 has drawn pushback from mostly left-leaning senators who question the increases amid the state’s ongoing budget woes and ask whether the funds should be diverted to other priorities. 
The governor’s staff, too, has noted judicial salaries are already nationally competitive. His line-item vetoes of other judicial branch spending remain unresolved.
State senators last got a salary increase, from $4,800 to $12,000, in January 1989, which is baked into the Nebraska Constitution and harder to change. Constitutional officers, such as the governor, attorney general and secretary of state, last got raises in 1991, 2003 and 2007. Legislative efforts to increase lawmaker or constitutional officer pay have likely stalled for the year.

Value of a diverse judiciary
Bosn, a former prosecutor, described the “modest increase” in LB 513 as appropriate for the hardworking judiciary. She said that 1.5% raises are less than half what other state employees are getting in the next two-year state budget and about 1.2% of inflation for the Midwest for the past year. 
Part of the importance, Bosn said, is in encouraging applications for a diverse judicial branch, as salaries for private attorneys can eclipse those of public servants. As a result, many applicants come from local county attorneys offices or the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office.
“When you have a diverse group of individuals who are the judges, they can work together, they can have those conversations and try and come to the best solutions that benefit all of us,” Bosn said during debate on LB 513 earlier this month.
‘More robust process’
Tim Hruza, on behalf of the Nebraska State Bar Association, citing a State Bar Association study in 2022, told the Appropriations Committee in March that an average partner at a law firm makes about $250,000 for the experience he said one would hope to see in judicial applicants.
“We have great judges. We have quality candidates coming through,” Hruza told the Appropriations Committee. “We want to see a more robust process where [more] people are applying for these and that we’re getting great candidates.”

Nebraska Supreme Court Chief Justice Jeffrey Funke, who previously served as a county and district judge, told lawmakers this year that “very rarely” will private attorneys apply because it is more “financially lucrative” to remain a private attorney. He said LB 513 could help attract and retain good lawyers for the Nebraska judiciary.
Nebraska judges are retained every six years by a vote of the people divided in distinct judicial districts. Since the system was implemented in 1962, eight judges have been removed, including one justice. The last judge removed was in 2008. This means that, barring the very rare power of impeachment, judicial appointments can largely be for life, or until retirement.
Hruza and Funke were among a handful of supporters of the original LB 513 seeking 4% raises each of the next two years before it was pared back in April to annual 1.5% increases.
In 2023, lawmakers approved salary bumps of 6% on July 1, 2023, and 7% on July 1, 2024. Those raises brought Nebraska Supreme Court justices and judges on the Nebraska Court of Appeals above $200,000 in 2023, a feat that the remaining 135 judges surpassed in 2024.
Other investments?
While the consecutive pay bumps are noteworthy on their own, LB 513 is making waves by generating some of the most pushback similar bills have gotten in more than a decade. It’s common for one or two senators to oppose the raises, but six senators opposed the salary increase in 2013, in a 41-6 vote. No senators voted against the 2023 raises, passing 40-0.
State Sens. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, Terrell McKinney of Omaha and Ashlei Spivey of Omaha are among those who argue that, given the state’s structural budget concerns, judicial pay raises aren’t a top priority.
“I think it sends the wrong message to use taxpayer dollars to have more significant raises for judges, who are fair-minded and work hard, but who are already making more than their peers in many instances,” Conrad, a civil rights attorney, said earlier this month.
  State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln speaks at a news conference related to reviewing state rules and regulations. Jan. 16, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Conrad noted that Nebraska judges’ salaries are in the top 20 nationwide, and district judges are in the top 10. Funke shared those figures himself when he supported LB 513.
A spokesperson for Gov. Jim Pillen also noted the national rankings. Under questioning from Conrad, Bosn said she anticipates the governor would sign the pared-back version of LB 513. Pillen’s office has declined to say publicly whether Pillen would sign or veto LB 513.
Passing LB 513 would follow Pillen’s intended line-item veto of $12 million to the judicial branch. The vetoes are being ignored after legislative leaders last week said Pillen’s office may have run afoul of the Nebraska Constitution and not have properly delivered the line-item vetoed bills in time to the Legislature. The matter could come under scrutiny in Nebraska courts.
“Every branch of government must contribute to balancing our state budget,” Pillen said last week in announcing his targeted budget vetoes.
‘Just not the right time’
Of LB 513, McKinney said he had a hard time justifying the increases while other court services, such as juvenile probation, were at risk without more funding.
  State Sen.-elect Ashlei Spivey of Omaha talks with State Sen. Rick Holdcroft of Bellevue at a legislative retreat in Kearney on Thursday, Dec. 12, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Spivey said some state agencies under the governor have struggled to attract talent and while some requested budget increases to try to do so, the Appropriations Committee didn’t fulfill every request. Similar to McKinney, she said it would be wiser to prioritize and invest in actual court services at this time.
“It doesn’t mean that the judges are not important or that we can’t look at competitive salaries,” Spivey said. “It’s just not the right time.”
Cavanaugh, who serves on the budget-writing Appropriations Committee with Spivey, said it was maybe the year to “hit pause” amid the consecutive increases.
“We got to tighten our belts and suspenders or whatever article of clothing you want to quote,” Cavanaugh said during debate.
‘Reasonable request’
State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse, an attorney, defended the increases. He said it’s sometimes overlooked how much time judges put in, often away from their courthouses, “pouring” over court files and weighing decisions that they know will affect peoples’ lives.
State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Appropriations Committee, also supported the pared-back pay increases as a “reasonable request.”

As lawmakers worked toward a balanced budget for the next two years, Clements sought to leave enough wiggle room with LB 513 in mind. He also helped protect salary and health insurance increases for other state employees across the three branches of government. Clements has said he expects LB 513 will pass.
Hallstrom, a freshman member of the Judiciary Committee, also cited those pay raises, up to 3.5% in some cases, as a reason LB 513 is needed.
“If it was my preference, I would prefer to treat judges in the same fashion,” Hallstrom said.
A need for ‘good judges’
The increases to judges’ salaries are considered annual appropriations bills, but unlike the mainline bills that the Appropriations Committee considers, the Judiciary Committee chair routinely introduces pay increases to be considered by their committee. That’s a process left in place from the days of former State Sen. Ernie Chambers of Omaha.

State law requires that the governor have at least two candidates to choose from when filling a judicial vacancy. However, Funke and Bosn noted that sometimes there are only two qualified lawyers. In those cases, if one candidate is not forwarded on, the search process restarts.
Such a scenario happened around the Norfolk area in March for a district court judge who retired in January. Pillen named a successor May 14 after the delay.
Other government officials’ pay
Retired Lancaster County District Judge Rob Otte, past chair of the Nebraska State Bar Association’s House of Delegates and current president of the Nebraska Lawyers Foundation, told the Judiciary Committee in February he took a pay cut when he became a judge.
Otte, who retired in 2022, said he thought a robust crop of candidates would vie for his seat. However, only three applicants came and none from private practice.
“Despite my personal calls and having coffee and lunch with more than two dozen private practicing lawyers, I could get not one to put their name in the hat to be a district court judge,” Otte said.



Otte said he often hears that judges’ salaries should be compared to other government employees. He said that while he tends to agree, senators should “decouple” that thinking and look at what’s best for judges.
“You want the best, not the cheapest,” Otte said in February.
‘No better investment’
Lancaster County Judge Holly Parsley, president of the Nebraska County Judges Association, said county judges review arrest and search warrants at any time of the day and must handle the “awesome responsibilities” of the position they have been entrusted with.
She looked to the guidance of former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer that “the integrity, wisdom and independence of judges are the cornerstones of a just society.”
“Without good judges, the rule of law is but an empty promise,” Parsley said.
In a similar vein, Funke said, “judges solve legal problems and disputes, both large and small, and do so with patience and grace.”
“Every case is important to someone, and every case is important to our judges,” he testified in February. “There is no better investment you can make in the future of state government than investing in competitive salaries for the judiciary.”

(Photo: John Partipilo)Modeling for infectious disease research, vaccine education programs, a rural mental health program, disinformation research and a project developing evacuation route technology for active shooter scenarios are among the federally funded grants at Tennessee universities terminated by the Trump administration.
The University of Tennessee system reported losing $37.7 million in funding for 42 grants earlier this month, the majority of which came from grants for the UT Institute of Agriculture. Six grants remain “pending.” 
Nine partial stop work orders are in effect, preventing portions of projects from being completed but not impacting the total award, according to University of Tennessee spokesperson Melissa Tindell. The university released a full list of its federal grants on Wednesday.
Middle Tennessee State University reported losing roughly $640,000 due to 10 grant terminations, encompassing grants from the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences and the Tennessee Department of Health.
Vanderbilt University, Tennessee State University, East Tennessee State University and the University of Memphis did not respond to requests for a list of terminated grants. Records maintained by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) list millions more in grant cuts at those schools, but data posted to the DOGE website is imperfect. 
UT system loses $37.7M in federal grants; Institute of Agriculture is hardest hit

For example, DOGE’s website lists only one terminated grant at MTSU: a roughly $305,000 National Science Foundation grant for the development of a “Framework for Integrating Technology for Equity.” While this is among MTSU’s terminated grants, several others are not listed in DOGE’s data, including a program that supported students with disabilities in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), archeological research at Fort Negley and research on COVID-19 health disparities.
One of the grant recipients — The Alliance of Students with Disabilities for Inclusion, Networking, and Transition Opportunities in STEM – stated on its website that its NSF funding terminated on May 2, “due to the alignment of our work with the agency’s evolving priorities.”
“This decision does not reflect the quality or importance of the work we’ve done together — work that has empowered students with disabilities and advanced equity in STEM across the country,” the website states.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the selection process for terminated grants. 
Broadly, President Donald Trump’s executive orders have included orders to terminate “‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ discrimination in the federal workforce, and in federal contracting and spending.” Trump’s administration has also taken aim at Biden-era climate policies. 
Of the 42 grants terminated across the University of Tennessee system, nearly 40% referenced diversity, inclusion, minorities, race, underserved or marginalized groups, sexuality or gender in their titles. Five terminated grants mentioned infectious disease or immunization in their titles, and COVID-19 disparities or prevention efforts were specifically mentioned in three.
Impact not limited to college campuses
Cuts to collegiate research can have impacts far beyond their fields. 
Most basic, foundational research is done in the academic sphere, according to Alexandra Graddy-Reed, an associate professor at the University of Southern California’s Sol Price School of Public Policy. It’s more difficult to tell if this type of research will be profitable, so about 60% of this type of research is funded by the federal government rather than industries or nonprofits, she said.
“Without the federal government funding academic research, it would drastically decrease what we can accomplish,” Graddy-Reed said.
A portion of the University of Tennessee’s terminated grants deal with COVID-19 disparities. Graddy-Reed used this as an example of potential long-term implications.
“If you look at COVID in particular, Vanderbilt was one of the first organizations leading to a vaccine through their research, but that research wasn’t just started in 2020, right?” she said. It was decades in the making.
“When you stop that basic research, when you stop understanding how pandemics spread, how they impact our populations, when the next pandemic hits, we are not as prepared to address the issue,” Graddy-Reed said.
Federal judge extends order blocking ‘devastating’ NIH cap on research payments

Terrell Morton, an assistant professor of identity and justice in STEM education at the University of Illinois Chicago’s School of Education, had similar concerns.
“One of the things that people talk about is this concept of brain drain, or the idea that as a country, we’re going to lose a lot of the rich innovation, because colleges and universities are sort of the main driving sites for research-based innovation,” Morton said.
Researchers at MTSU and University of Tennessee declined interviews.
Regarding the termination of multiple grants that included a focus on minorities, Morton said science has shown that “the experiences, the needs and the outcomes of people differ based off of not only things like their race, but also their gender, their socioeconomic status, whether or not they live in an urban or rural or suburban neighborhood.”
Morton highlighted the National Science Foundation’s authority to engage in “broader impacts work,” which can include increasing participation of women, people with disabilities and underrepresented minorities in STEM, according to NSF’s website. Morton said that also includes veterans and people from rural communities.
“If you remove federal funding from grants that explore things like the implications of rurality on mental health, then there’s not going to be any knowledge or resources generated to help people in rural spaces that don’t have access to high-quality health care or don’t have access to high-quality mental health services,” he said.
Further implications stretch to the economy — less funding means less support for graduate students, research technicians, and publication editors. Less funding also means fewer researchers attending professional conferences, booking hotels and meeting space and supporting the service industry in conference locations, Morton said.










One of the things that people talk about is this concept of brain drain, or the idea that as a country, we’re going to lose a lot of the rich innovation, because colleges and universities are sort of the main driving sites for research-based innovation.


– Terrell Morton, University of  Illinois Chicago


Graddy-Reed said less research funding can erode an institution’s ability to provide the infrastructure and equipment needed to do research.
“Science is America’s competitive advantage, and we rely heavily on government funding for that,” she said. “If that gets cut, we’re in decline as a society, but so is our competitive advantage in the global economy.”
While grant funding cuts were catalyzed by politics, Morton said these cuts impact everyone, regardless of their political affiliation. He said he’s hopeful that people will see the results not from a political perspective but from a practical one: what benefits the nation and its communities.
“In my opinion, what truly benefits our nation and our communities are research and scientific explorations that can help develop new innovations and outcomes that elevate the life, the liberty, and the pursuit of happiness of our people,” he said.

They also play music to “drown out the harassment and create a calmer atmosphere,” Pueblo ProChoice President Jacquelyn Bernal said. 
If those deescalation tactics don’t work and situations escalate beyond what her organization can control, they contact law enforcement, Bernal said. 
“Our first priority is getting the patient inside safely so they can make it to their appointment without interference,” Bernal said in a statement. “The bubble law is part of Colorado’s criminal code, and it’s there to protect patients and providers. We just need it to be enforced.”

Colorado’s “bubble law” prohibits anyone from approaching people within 100 feet of a health care facility, including abortion clinics. It was crafted to curb the practice of protesters trying to dissuade patients from seeking abortions.
Most Colorado abortion providers who participated in research by the National Abortion Federation said they experienced trespassing and protests outside their clinics in 2023 and 2024, according to a recent report.
Of the 17 Colorado abortion providers that participated, 65% experienced at least one incident of trespassing, 53% reported protestors outside, 24% experienced an incident of obstruction, and 18% received threats.
A spokesperson for the National Abortion Federation said Colorado providers received 216 suspicious, harassing or threatening calls, mail, emails or social media posts, compared with 150 in the previous report covering 2020-2022. A similar number of providers participated in the both reports but not the exact same group. 
Providers reported 27 instances of trespassing in the most recent report compared with 17 in the previous, 10 instances of vandalism compared with eight, eight instances of obstruction compared with seven, and five threats of death or harm compared with three. 
Bernal said while Colorado’s bubble law exists to prevent “exactly this kind of intimidation,” law enforcement needs to better enforce it. 
“Law enforcement must do their part to protect patients,” Bernal said. “When federal protections fall short, it’s up to our communities and our state to step up. We need to protect each other and uphold the right to seek health care safely.”
Providers in Colorado have consistently seen higher numbers of people seeking abortion care and have adapted to meet the new demand after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Every state except New Mexico that borders Colorado has some abortion restrictions. Nearby Texas does, too.
About 62% of Colorado voters in November approved Amendment 79, which enshrined access to abortion as a right in the Colorado Constitution. The Colorado Legislature approved a measure implementing the amendment, and also passed several shield laws to protect providers and out-of-state patients. 
Christie Burkhardt, director of facilities and infrastructure operations at the Boulder Valley Health Center, joined the center’s team shortly after the 2022 Supreme Court decision upending national abortion rights to help with the uptick in demand and oversee security. 
Between Burkhardt’s start with the center in July 2022 and October 2024, she said she only reached out to local law enforcement over disruptions twice. Since October 2024, as the presidential election approached and rhetoric on abortion rights grew, she has called law enforcement 17 times for assistance with disruptions at the clinic. She said she has gotten to know the local police department “very well” in the last six months.
The center, which offers the full spectrum of reproductive health care, sees protesters at the public sidewalk next to its parking lot two to three times per week as of fall 2024, Burkhardt said. Small groups of people will try to talk to patients and clinic staff for anywhere from half an hour to full days, she said. Burkhardt said protesters are “very emboldened” after the Trump administration pardoned protesters convicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act and halted its enforcement. 
“That can get very frightening for folks that have never been approached and have never had to deal with someone protesting what they do and at their work place, so our team has definitely had to learn a little bit on the fly,” Burkhardt said. 
She said harassing and threatening phone calls also increased at the center, particularly after the Boulder Abortion Clinic — one of the few clinics in the country that offered late-term abortions — shut its doors at the end of April. The center also receives about 10-15 pieces of threatening mail a month.
Staff canceled a sex ed summer camp planned for 5th grade to 8th grade students out of safety concerns after the center garnered national attention online from right-wing media and other abortion opponents. Burkhardt said she has weekly conversations with clinic staff about safety, and they’ve developed new policies to ensure the safety of staff and patients. 
Karen Middleton, president of Cobalt, which advocates for access to reproductive health care and runs an abortion fund in Colorado, said her organization remains in contact with its partner clinics to gather feedback on their concerns and needs around clinic safety.
“Reports like these really emphasize why states like Colorado must take action on their own to ensure patients and providers are protected now that federal protection is not guaranteed,” Middleton said in a statement. 
Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains, which operates about a dozen clinics across the state, declined to comment for this article.

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.
Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
Help for teachers
Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Murphy Smith says he was unemployed for four years because of medical issues before becoming a rideshare driver in Eugene, Oregon.
Driving allows him to work without triggering his severe asthma, Smith, 47, says. But without a set minimum wage, he says he works 12 to 16 hours a day to support himself.
Smith, who’s part of the rideshare drivers advocacy group Drivers Union Oregon, hopes pending legislation will help bring drivers like him a livable wage.
“There are a lot of people here in the Eugene area that don’t own a car, and once the buses or the public transportation shuts down, we’re who they call,” Smith said. “So we are an essential part of the workforce here.”
Advocates across several states say they’ve increased their activism recently because Uber and Lyft are pushing back harder than ever, as more cities and states pass laws requiring minimum pay and benefit requirements.

The rideshare industry is not as heavily regulated as independent taxi drivers or taxi companies, which are subject to rules on permitting, background checks, vehicle inspections and more, depending on the state or locality.
Rideshare drivers and labor advocates across the country are urging state and local leaders to require rideshare companies to provide benefits for drivers, including paid sick leave, minimum wages and workers’ compensation.
The companies have argued that establishing minimum wages for rideshare drivers would raise the price of rides for customers. Uber and Lyft are working to prevent some states from passing rideshare legislation through public campaigns and lobbying.
Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama, who sponsored the bill pending in his state, said drivers told him last summer that their accounts were being deactivated without notice. Even drivers who were highly rated were locked out of their accounts, unable to earn any money, he said.
“A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don’t drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig,” Jama said. “This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families. So, they brought the issue to my attention.”
Their stories inspired Jama to introduce legislation that would set a minimum wage for Oregon drivers, require a “just cause” for deactivation — or “lockouts” — of driver accounts, establish sick leave accrual, increase fare transparency, and create a new driver resource center. Neighboring Washington has a similar model, which was enacted in 2022.
Uber has opposed the Oregon bill, saying that the company needs more time to work with the state on drafting the measure. Uber spokesperson Zahid Arab, testifying against the bill, said the legislation would make rideshare “dramatically more expensive for Oregon riders, reduce access to affordable transportation options, and lead to fewer flexible earning opportunities for drivers.”










A lot of those folks are mainly immigrants and refugees, so they don't drive Uber as a side hustle or side gig. This is their livelihood. This is how they feed their families.


– Oregon Democratic state Sen. Kayse Jama


Jama said that he and his team have been negotiating with Uber and Lyft since the beginning of the legislative session, but there’s more work to do.
“At the end of the day, we want a bill that’s equitable to both the parties but also ensures that the drivers are getting the relief that they desperately need,” Jama said.
Lockouts are not exclusive to drivers in Oregon. Drivers in New York City first reported last summer periods of time when they could not access Uber or Lyft. The companies were limiting the number of active drivers in response to the city’s minimum wage rules.
Uber came to an agreement with New York City last July to reduce the lockouts, but drivers using Lyft were still seeing account deactivations months later.
Uber and Lyft did not respond to Stateline requests for comment.
 New laws proliferate

Generally, rideshare drivers are paid a base fare for each trip, with additional money for the time and distance traveled. In some cities, drivers can also see the amount of money they’ll earn before accepting a ride. Passengers can choose to tip drivers, too.
But every location has different rates. For instance, the minimum pay rates for drivers in Washington state have increased to $1.34 per mile and $0.39 per minute, with a trip minimum of $3.45 per trip, according to the state’s labor department. In Seattle, the pay rates are even higher.
Colorado Senate approves ride-sharing safety bill with substantial amendments

In places without set rules, drivers are subject to rates that depend on the location and availability of rides. These earnings are reduced by driver expenses, including gas, car maintenance and more.
In 2019, the nation’s first minimum wage pay rate for rideshare drivers went into effect in New York City. The minimum pay rates for time and mileage amount to drivers earning $17.22 an hour after expenses. It was a significant win for advocates in the city who had campaigned for better pay for years. New York later established minimum pay rates for drivers across the state.
Seattle in 2020 became the second city to require minimum wages for rideshare drivers.
In 2023, Minneapolis city leaders were also considering an ordinance that would increase driver pay, but Uber and Lyft threatened to leave the city entirely if it were to pass.
As part of a 2024 statewide deal after a long battle between Minnesota lawmakers and the rideshare companies, the pay rates for drivers rose to $1.28 per mile and 31 cents per minute on average for time spent driving passengers. As part of the deal, cities were banned from passing their own regulations on wages.
California, Massachusetts and Washington also have passed legislation to set minimum wages and rates for rideshare drivers over the past five years.
Massachusetts reached an agreement with Uber last year that guaranteed minimum earnings of $32.50 per hour to start, a portable health insurance benefit fund established last month and multilingual chat support coming later this year.
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and Washington also require rideshare companies to give drivers paid sick leave, workers’ compensation, paid family and medical leave, and other benefits.
In contrast, a California appeals court ruled in 2023 that transportation network companies could treat drivers as independent contractors, meaning they are not entitled to benefits in the state. The ruling upheld a voter-approved law.
Lawmakers in Connecticut and Wisconsin introduced legislation this year that would give rideshare drivers better pay transparency, as well as accident and sickness insurance coverage.
Earlier this year, Uber also sued Colorado over a law, Senate Bill 24-75, that requires the company to provide pay disclosures for drivers, arguing that the law violates Uber’s free speech rights. The law requires transportation network companies to disclose to drivers the total amount a passenger paid for a trip, how much is given to the driver and how much the passenger tipped.
 Washington state compromises

For more than eight years, Ahmed Mahamud has been driving for Uber and Lyft to support his family in Seattle.
Driving for the rideshare companies is his full-time job, he said, and business in Seattle is good.
“I love it,” said Mahamud, 51. “You’re helping people when they have a need. So, this isn’t just a job. It’s a ‘win-win’ job. You’re helping your community, and at the same time you are paying the bills.”
But he lacks the same benefits as a salaried job. So he joined Drivers Union and is pushing for better pay, benefits and protections for drivers.
“We are not yet finished fighting against these companies because there are still things missing,” he said. “So, every single day, we are still fighting.”
In the absence of state and federal regulations, rideshare companies have too much power over the drivers they employ, said Drivers Union spokesperson Anna Minard. Drivers in Washington began to organize when they realized Uber and Lyft were changing how much money drivers would earn without letting them know, she said.
“To drivers, this seemed like an avenue for a lot of exploitation,” Minard said. “So, drivers organized from the get-go and tried various ways to get some rights enshrined in the law [in Washington]. Even though it’s contract work, people felt like they should be able to join together and fight for better pay and benefits and safety.”
In 2023, a year after rideshare drivers won minimum wage and other benefits, Washington lawmakers passed legislation that made it the first state to give drivers paid family and medical leave. Uber and Lyft supported the new benefits.
“These coordinated pieces of legislation reflect a true compromise between state lawmakers, labor leaders and transportation network companies to afford drivers historic new benefits while protecting the independence and flexibility they say they want,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement to GeekWire at the time.
And last year, after Massachusetts drivers won new benefits that are rolling out over 2025, Tony West, Uber’s chief legal officer, said in a statement, “We hope to engage other policymakers, drivers, advocates and stakeholders around the world to forge similar solutions.”
Advocates with Drivers Union helped pass a law this year in Washington that requires rideshare companies to be more transparent about which cars are eligible for special ride options, which are offered to passengers for higher fees.
In addition to the standard UberX ride, the app offers UberXL for larger groups, Uber Comfort for newer cars with extra legroom and other options that generally cost more.
The legislation, which was signed into law by Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson earlier this month, came after hundreds of drivers saw advertisements from Uber telling them to buy more expensive cars to get more pay on rides, Mahamud said. But in a year, many of those cars would become ineligible once newer cars are introduced to the market, leaving drivers with expensive car notes without the benefit of higher rates to cover it.
“The drivers really came together and said, ‘This is just unfair,’” Mahamud said. “Yesterday we’re told to buy these cars, and then before we can pay the car off, we’re taken out of the product class which was supposed to pay for it.”
The law also requires rideshare companies to provide drivers with a record of their trip receipts.
Drivers and advocates are going to keep fighting for their rights, said Nicole Moore, the president of Rideshare Drivers United, a driver-run organization of more than 20,000 drivers in California. Moore is a part-time driver in the Los Angeles area, and she usually works Fridays and Saturdays.
“They (rideshare companies) think that to be an employee in America means you have to work full time, and it has to be a scheduled five-day workweek,” Moore said. “Now, we as Americans have all these misconceptions about what employment rights and labor rights could actually mean for everyone.”

(Getty Images) Ever since the Statue of Liberty raised her torch in New York Harbor, America has welcomed the “homeless, tempest-tossed” masses from foreign shores. Those seeking safety and opportunity in the United States have played a central role in making this country the leading world power it has been and the moral beacon it was. Unfortunately, our current government has decided to turn the page by pulling up the welcome mat and relinquishing its role as moral leader of the planet.
Just after being sworn in, Trump signed an executive order suspending refugee resettlement in the United States, which threw refugees waiting at foreign airports into limbo. He also suspended America’s asylum system, causing chaos amongst asylum seekers who faced danger in their home countries. Both programs were highly regarded around the world, reflecting great credit upon America. Now, both suspensions are being challenged in court actions.
They had tickets. A flight number. An arrival time. Then Trump’s executive order changed everything.

In just over a hundred days in office, Donald Trump has empowered a substantial army of federal agents to track down and speedily deport any foreign-looking U.S. residents. Most Americans support the removal of dangerous foreigners, so long as they receive a fair hearing. But most of us believe it is counterproductive to toss out farm, construction and home care workers who are long-time residents that abide by the law and contribute to society.
Trump announced in February that Temporary Protected Status would soon be revoked for about 530,000 Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans and Haitians. That means they would no longer be able to legally work in the U.S. and could be deported. Foreigners can be legally admitted with Temporary Protected Status when their home country suffers natural disaster or political upheaval. 
Trump has never been too keen on Haitians. During his first term he famously questioned why we should allow people from Haiti and African “sh_hole countries” to come to America. Presumably, his revocation of Temporary Protected Status would include the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, who he falsely accused of eating the town’s cats and dogs. The Haitians were merely doing tough jobs that locals refused to do. Thankfully, a federal judge temporarily blocked the revocation order on April 14. 
Inexplicably, Trump announced the cancellation of Temporary Protected Statys for about 11,700 Afghans in the country, effective July 12. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem made the ludicrous claim that, “Afghanistan has had an improved security situation, and its stabilizing economy no longer prevent them from returning to their home country.” 
However, a military veteran who heads an organization dedicated to saving the lives of Afghans who put their necks on the line to help and protect American troops, gave the Military Times an informed assessment: “Afghanistan remains under the control of the Taliban. There is no functioning asylum system. There are still assassinations, arbitrary arrests, and ongoing human rights abuses, especially against women and ethnic minorities.” We owe those folks big time, and the administration should be ashamed for trying to send them back to almost certain death.
Rather than throwing our Afghan partners to the wolves, America should be using its best efforts to bring many more of those good friends to safety in the United States. We could take a page from the book of Idaho’s former Gov. and Sen. Dirk Kempthorne. He teamed up with two Army officers and a young Afghan American, Nawid Mousa, to raise $1 million to rescue 395 Afghan helpers and their families from Taliban clutches in 2021. 
Special treatment for some: Most refugee families in Idaho wait years to reunite with loved ones

What kind of nation could live with the infamy of abandoning its allies to the savage retribution of an enemy? Of all people, Trump should be helping these beleaguered Afghans, because his so-called peacemaking effort contributed greatly to the Taliban victory. By excluding the Afghan government from the negotiations and giving a definite U.S. withdrawal date, while obtaining no enforceable commitments from the Taliban, Trump created the problem that caused these helpers to have to flee their country.
Despite all of Trump’s efforts to prevent refugees, asylees and other immigrants from reaching America’s protective shores, Trump has bypassed all of the time-tested vetting procedures to grant unfettered entry to nearly 60 white South Africans. The decision was apparently made without the many months of vetting that previous refugees have had to undergo. Trump claimed these folks were fleeing genocide in their country but there is absolutely no credible evidence to support that claim.
Regardless of Trump’s reasons for greenlighting the South African “refugees,” Idaho’s nationally-recognized refugee settlement program will give those coming to Idaho a warm reception, as should we all. Two families with a total of 9 members are settling in Twin Falls. I wish them a warm welcome to the Gem State.

Gov. Kelly Armstrong signed bills that added age-verification requirements for websites publishing explicit content. He also signed a bill that added civil penalties for the creation and distribution of deepfake, or computer-generated, pornographic material without a subject’s consent. Both laws will go into effect Aug. 1.
 Age verification

Senate Bill 2380 and House Bill 1561 both will require age verification for websites containing a substantial portion of pornographic material that could be considered harmful to minors.
Rep. Steve Swiontek, R-Fargo, chief sponsor of House Bill 1561, said children are being exposed to pornography in significant numbers by age 12 and even more by age 17, which is one of the main reasons he sponsored the bill.
“The thought was there should be some requirement and expectations that these adult entertainment sites who are getting paid for this … that they should be mandated and required to verify age,” Swiontek said. “I think we have a moral obligation for these kids.”
Those websites under the new law would need to implement a verification system to confirm the user is over 18.
Swiontek said the age-verification bill was modeled after a similar bill was implemented in Utah in 2023. Critics of that bill pointed to ways it could be circumvented, The Associated Press reported.
Swiontek said there isn’t a “fool proof” way to stop minors from accessing pornographic websites.
States race to restrict deepfake porn as it becomes easier to create

“If we can prevent 90% of these things from happening, then it’s been a success,” Swiontek said. “And then, it can be tweaked two years from now as well.”
None of the information obtained while conducting age verification may be retained.
Websites that fail to comply with the age-verification requirements may be held liable for damages by a parent or guardian of a minor who accessed the explicit content or a person whose information was retained after the verification process.
The new law exempts internet service providers, search engines, cloud services and application stores from liability for facilitating connection between users and websites.
Cody Schuler, advocacy manager for the American Civil Liberties Union of North Dakota, said pornography is protected under the First Amendment. He added the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments over a similar age-verification law implemented in Texas and the court is expected to issue its decision in June or July.
“We are not opposed to protecting children,” Schuler said. “The concern becomes when … we put undue burden upon those individuals who are legal to access pornography.”
Schuler added that data collection by third-party age-verification hosts can also bring up potential privacy concerns.
“It is really important for us to hear what comes next from the Supreme Court and then look at where things go from there as far as what laws or corrections might need to be made,” he said.
 Deepfakes, computer-generated explicit images

House Bill 1351 makes it a misdemeanor to create, possess and distribute sexually expressive images, including real, altered or computer-generated deepfakes, that show nude or partially denuded figures without consent. 
The new law also provides an avenue for victims of those images to file civil lawsuits to recover up to $10,000 in statutory damages caused by the distribution. Plaintiffs would also be able to recover any money gained by a defendant through the distribution of the image.
Swiontek said he voted in support of the bill because it becomes difficult to get rid of manufactured, false content once it enters the internet.
“There has to be an obligation and a penalty for people who do that,” Swiontek said. 
U.S. House Republicans aim to ban state-level AI laws for 10 years

North Dakota lawmakers also passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 4017, which asks the Legislative Management Committee to consider studying the “detrimental impacts of pornography.” 
The goal of the study is to examine education, prevention and research of the societal consequences stemming from pornography. The resolution text alleges the porn industry “produces media that objectifies women and children, and depicts rape and abuse, perpetuating the demand for sex trafficking, prostitution, child pornography and sexual abuse images.”
The Legislative Management Committee received requests for 66 different studies to be completed during the interim, 19 of which are mandatory studies. Previously, John Bjornson, director of Legislative Council, said the committee could realistically complete about 45 studies during the 18-month interim.
The committee will meet for the first time during the interim Tuesday in Fargo.
President Donald Trump signed the Take It Down Act last week, which requires platforms to take down nonconsensual intimate depictions of individuals, real or deepfake images, within 48 hours of being notified or they may face criminal or civil penalties.

(John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)On Wednesday Arkansas’ Oil and Gas Commission will for the third time in 18 months consider what lithium extractors should pay mineral rights holders in royalties.
On the agenda tomorrow is an application filed by SWA Lithium, a joint venture between Canada-based Standard Lithium and Norwegian energy giant Equinor, known for its Empire Wind offshore wind farm off the coast of New York.
Standard Lithium has already gone before the commission twice for a royalty determination — first in December 2023 and then again in November 2024. Both times, questions were raised as to whether Standard Lithium and its co-applicants — in 2023, Lanxess; in 2024, Lanxess, Albemarle, Tetra Tech and ExxonMobil-subsidiary Saltwerx — had provided enough data to justify the proposed royalty rates. 


Neither time resulted in a royalty being set.
The commission will have to decide if Standard Lithium’s new proposed 2.5% royalty rate and royalty structure are fair and equitable.
You can read more about the application itself here.
  What’s the deal with lithium, anyway? 

Multiple companies — from oil and gas behemoths like ExxonMobil, to major chemical companies like Lanxess and Albemarle, to relative-newcomers like Standard Lithium — are trying to get in on the valuable lithium reserves trapped in South Arkansas’ subterranean brine, thousands of feet below the earth.
Arkansas state officials have touted the economic benefits such industrial investments could bring to the state while passing legislation to incentivize it. 


  Who are the players in this lithium stuff? 


Standard Lithium: The Vancouver, B.C.-based company was one of the first movers on the lithium scene in Arkansas. It established a test plant in El Dorado in 2018 to test DLE processes using debrominated brine from the Lanxess South plant, which already draws up brine to extract bromine. The so-called Lanxess project hasn’t seen much movement, but Standard Lithium’s joint venture with Equinor, known as SWA Lithium or Smackover Lithium, is at the center of this third royalty application. Standard Lithium is also set to receive $225 million in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Energy to help fund the first phase of the SWA Project.
Equinor: A Norwegian energy company, already known in the U.S. for its Empire Wind project off the coast of New York. It bought a stake in the SWA Project last year.
Albemarle: A Fortune 500 chemical company that is already a major world player in the global lithium production industry. Its lithium evaporation ponds in Chile have garnered criticism for alleged impacts to water quality and the environment in the area. Currently, Albemarle operates bromine extraction plants in South Arkansas, around Magnolia. Last year the company sought and received permission from the AOGC to operate its own DLE test facility in South Arkansas. Albemarle was also a party to the royalty application that was heard in November. 
Lanxess: Formerly known as Great Lakes Chemical Company, and Chemtura before that, Lanxess operates three bromine production facilities in Union County. Standard Lithium’s test facility is located at the Lanxess South plant. Lanxess was party to both the 2023 and 2024 lithium royalty applications.
Tetra Technologies: A Texas-based company in the energy, chemical and critical minerals sectors. It has operated a plant in West Memphis to create bromine fluids for oil and gas wells since the 1990s. Tetra possesses the Evergreen Unit in South Arkansas, which it plans to develop for lithium extraction with Saltwerx.
Saltwerx: A subsidiary of oil and gas giant ExxonMobil, Saltwerx was party to the November application, and recently received AOGC approval for its Pine Unit, a crucial step to get a future royalty determination of its own after the commission ruled last year that having an established brine unit was a prerequisite for establishing a royalty. 
South Arkansas Minerals Association: Headed by Robert Reynolds — a former member of the state Pollution Control and Ecology Commission and one of the masterminds behind the initiative to replenish the Sparta Aquifer in Union County — the association represents the interests of South Arkansas mineral rights owners. SAMA objected to both previous royalty applications on a number of grounds, but has not formally objected to the Standard Lithium-Equinor royalty application.
Mineral Rights Owners: These people and companies own tracts of mineral rights — and no, that doesn’t mean that they own the land itself. Due to court rulings and property law, oftentimes the person or group that owns the mineral rights in a particular area is entirely different from the owner of the land. Under state law, if a substance, like lithium, is profitably extracted from the brine they own, then they are entitled to a royalty.
Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission: Both a regulatory agency and an adjudicatory body, the AOGC is charged with overseeing Arkansas’ oil and gas industry, along with certain other extractive industries that draw from underground resources. That includes lithium extraction from brine.



Albemarle, Lanxess and their predecessors have extracted this brine for decades, as bromine is also abundant in the fluid. Brine is also extracted as a byproduct of the region’s century-old oil and gas industry.
Companies have cited Arkansas’ extensive and unique regulatory structures as one of the points that makes the state attractive for developing a U.S. lithium industry. Now-retired AOGC director and current AOGC Commissioner Larry Bengal previously told the Advocate he believed Arkansas is the only state in the U.S. with a brine statute. 
A widely reported study from the U.S. Geological Survey last year estimated that the brines in the parts of the Smackover formation under South Arkansas held enough lithium to meet U.S. demand for decades. The study used machine learning to predict lithium quantities for the region using existing well data. However, one of the authors of the study told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that the report said nothing on whether that much lithium could feasibly be extracted from the formation, saying the study was meant to provide a birds-eye view of the potential of the region as a whole.
Geologists have known about the high lithium content of South Arkansas’ brine for decades, but until recently, the technology to extract it profitably wasn’t there. Companies said they’ve already spent millions in pursuit of lithium in the state, even though those companies haven’t yet given the final green light for large-scale extraction projects.
Standard Lithium and Equinor’s SWA Lithium project has already been awarded hundreds of millions in federal funding to build up a lithium extraction operation in South Arkansas as part of federal investments into critical minerals and other supply chains that have increasingly become concentrated in China. Lithium is a key component of rechargeable batteries, including those used in electric vehicles.
  That’s great and all, but how are they going to get lithium out of water? 

In short, it’s a process called “direct lithium extraction,” or DLE. It’s similar to the process used to treat hard water, just on a much larger scale. It hasn’t been used at commercial scale to extract lithium in the U.S. before, but some companies in China already use it. It’s different from other lithium mining methods, such as hard-rock mining and evaporation pond methods.
  Why does the royalty matter? 

There are a few reasons. The first is that none of the companies that have expressed interest in growing a lithium extraction industry in South Arkansas can actually begin extracting lithium from brine for profit before the AOGC approves a royalty. They have said previously that having a set royalty is crucial in order to know how much a full-scale extraction project will cost.
The royalty is required by the Arkansas Brine Conservation Act (ABCA), which first passed in the 1970s as a result of court cases that saw mineral rights owners demanding compensation from big chemical companies for diminishing the value of their owned mineral rights through the companies’ bromine operations, which would sometimes push spent brine towards their owned tracts and unextracted brine away from them. An amendment was added in the 1990s establishing the “other substances” provision, which sets the framework to determine royalties for substances extracted from brine other than bromine, such as lithium. 
The second reason is that some, like former AOGC commissioner Mike Davis, believe the only real economic benefit many ordinary Arkansans will get from lithium extraction will come from royalty payments. 
“When the drilling rigs are gone, when the completion process is complete, you’ve got two things left. You have the maintenance and you have the royalty income,” Davis said at the November hearing. “For the majority of the citizens and for the state of Arkansas itself, the real benefit to the mineral owners and royalty owners and citizens of the state of Arkansas will be the royalty that you gentlemen determine.”
  Other issues affecting the 2024 royalty decision

The commission agreed with the opinion of Administrative Law Judge Charles Moulton that a royalty could be applied only to existing brine units — geographic areas approved by the commission for mineral extraction. However, the November applicants wished to apply their proposed royalty to “existing units … and proposed future units” within certain counties — but only after amending their application. Originally, they asked for a royalty determination for the entire Smackover Formation within specific counties. 
Since then, both Standard Lithium and Saltwerx have applied for and received permission to create new brine units. You can read more about the brine units here.
  Why wasn’t a royalty determined in the last two hearings? 

The AOGC unanimously rejected the application it heard in November for a few reasons.
The state brine law says a royalty must be “fair and equitable,” and that a substance must be “profitably extracted” in order for a royalty to be paid. The commission must determine if a company’s proposed royalty meets that bar. 
One of the key hang-ups last year was that many people, the AOGC commissioners included, felt the royalty proposed by the so-called “Big 5” — Albemarle, Lanxess, Tetra Tech, Standard Lithium and Saltwerx — was not fair and equitable. The companies, for the most part, refused to provide any project data to justify the proposed royalty, citing antitrust concerns.
Multiple commissioners cited that refusal as the key reason they voted to reject the application in November, even as they said they believed the proposed royalty at the time, 1.82%, was not fair and equitable in the first place.
Similarly, the 2023 application filed by Standard Lithium and Lanxess ran into justification issues, with commissioners requesting the companies return with further documentation to support the proposal before they made a decision. Instead, the two companies withdrew the application and eventually signed onto the second application last summer.
  Are all of the same companies involved in the royalty the commission is hearing this week? 

No. Only Standard Lithium and Equinor, its partner in the SWA Project, are party to this royalty hearing. That means that if the commission decides to approve the proposed royalty, it would apply only to Standard Lithium’s and Equinor’s Reynolds Unit, which encompasses parts of Columbia, Lafayette and Miller Counties. It would not apply to Saltwerx’s Pine Unit, Tetra Tech’s Evergreen Unit, or any of Lanxess’ long-established brine units in Union County.
If the joint venture decides it wants to expand the royalty’s applicability to other units it establishes in the future, it would need to go back before the commission for another royalty determination.
  What else should we know about the November 2024 royalty hearing? 

The run-up to tomorrow’s hearing has been much quieter than last year’s hearing. Dozens of people objected to the 1.82% royalty proposed in the Big Five application last year. 
The South Arkansas Minerals Association, a group representing mineral-rights holders, objected to the first proposed royalty in December 2023, and their objection led to the hearing being delayed from September to November so that the administrative law judge could hold a hearing on certain legal matters. Moulton’s recommendations to the commission after that hearing were largely adopted and played a role in why the Big Five application was rejected.
As of Friday, only one person had filed an objection to the Standard Lithium-Equinor royalty application. Robert Reynolds, the president of SAMA, has not filed an objection, but told the Advocate he would be watching carefully to see if the applicants brought forward sufficient evidence to support their royalty proposal this time around. Until they did, he said, he had no way of knowing if 2.5% is “fair and equitable.”

(Office of the Attorney General J.B. McCuskey photo)Attorney General J.B. McCuskey didn’t join 40 other state attorneys general calling on Congress to reject what they call an “irresponsible” federal measure that would block states from setting their own regulations on the use of artificial intelligence for the next 10 years.
Right now, states have the authority to set their own AI rules. The West Virginia Legislature recently passed a bill prohibiting the creation, distribution or possession of AI-generated child pornography.
A letter from the National Association of Attorneys General issued earlier this month said the “broad” AI moratorium measure, which is tucked into President Donald Trump’s tax cut bill, would be “sweeping and wholly destructive of reasonable state efforts to prevent known harms associated with AI.” 
McCuskey’s office didn’t respond to questions about why he didn’t sign onto the letter, which included Republicans from Ohio, Tennessee and Virginia. 
“This bill does not propose any regulatory scheme to replace or supplement the laws enacted or currently under consideration by the states, leaving Americans entirely unprotected from the potential harms of AI,” the letter read. “Moreover, this bill purports to wipe away any state-level frameworks already in place. Imposing a broad moratorium on all state action while Congress fails to act in this area is irresponsible and deprives consumers of reasonable protections.”
According to an analysis by the National Conference of State Legislatures, 26 states adopted or enacted at least 75 new AI measures. Some of those measures have sought to ban the creation of deepfakes for political campaigns or ban the use of AI to send spam calls or texts. 
Republicans in Washington behind the proposed state-level ban say there’s an urgent need to pass a unified, federal set of guidelines after more than 1,000 pieces of legislation relating to AI have been introduced just this year. A 10-year moratorium on state’s enacting AI laws could give Congress the time to pass those guidelines, they say, and the language banning states from setting their own AI regulations was rolled into the 1,100 page controversial budget bill. 
  Sen. Ryan Weld, R-Brooke
Congress would prohibit enforcement of any existing laws on AI and decision-making systems. But Sen. Ryan Weld, R-Brooke, doesn’t think that West Virginia’s new law banning the use of AI in child pornography would be struck down should the federal measure pass because of how it’s written. 
The measure, Senate Bill 198, made it a felony offense in West Virginia to use or entice a minor to assist in creating computer-generated images for child pornography or create a visual portrayal of a minor engaging in any sexually explicit conduct. It also bans the distribution of AI-generated child pornography. Weld, an attorney, said it addressed a loophole in the state’s current laws prohibiting child pornography as AI is a growing industry. 
“The federal provisions would allow for SB 198 to go into effect because it doesn’t affect laws of general applicability …  because [the bill] affects AI, but also it doesn’t discriminate between using artificial intelligence to manipulate an image or create a visual portrayal of a minor … using Adobe Photoshop or something like that,” he explained.
Weld said he was “reluctant” about states potentially losing their ability to regulate AI.
“I don’t like to see states being able to legislate on their own in areas that they generally have the authority to,” he said. “States are the laboratories of democracy for a reason.”
There are limited AI laws in West Virginia, but lawmakers have begun introducing legislation on the topic and exploring how it might work in government. In 2023, the Legislature passed a bill that launched a pilot program to explore how AI could be used to assess road quality and predict maintenance projects. 
Last year the House of Delegates created the AI Select Committee that advanced four AI-related bills. Three of those measures died in the Senate, and one resolution, which created an AI Task Force, passed the full Legislature. The AI Task Force was asked to determine the state agency or agencies that would develop AI policies, consider public interest use cases for AI and more. The task force is supposed to submit a report by July. 
The National Conference of State Legislatures also opposes the proposed moratorium on states’ ability to regulate AI, saying in a letter to U.S. House members that it “is an infringement on states’ authority to effectively legislate in this rapidly evolving and consequential policy domain, and in our view, is a violation of the Byrd Rule.” The rule — named for late Democratic Senator Robert C. Byrd — governs the budget reconciliation process and provisions deemed “extraneous” are prohibited. 
The AI law moratorium measure was packaged with $500 million to modernize federal IT programs with commercial AI systems through 2035.
The U.S. House narrowly approved the GOP-backed massive tax and spending bill with the AI measure on Thursday. Both West Virginia Reps. Riley Moore and Carol Miller, R-W.Va., voted in support of the bill, and it now heads to the U.S. Senate.
In Washington D.C., a House subcommittee earlier this week took its first major step in discussing widespread regulations for AI legislation at the federal level. 
Support for federal guidelines or regulation around AI technologies received bipartisan support in the last Congress, States Newsroom reports. 
On May 22, McCuskey sent a letter on behalf of 15 attorneys general to the Department of Energy and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission outlining the need “for federal officials to establish a Strategic Electricity Reserve to protect our nation’s energy grid.” It would be used in cases of power shortages or emergencies.
In a news release, McCuskey said, “the reserve will provide a layer of security that is needed now more than ever.”

Now, new legal filings in an ongoing federal lawsuit show the state’s Department of Commerce and Insurance has received a “litany of complaints” against Reid Van Ness for failing to deliver on promised funeral services to Spanish-speaking residents of Tennessee and Kentucky in the years after losing his license.

The Lookout investigation found that Van Ness had instead left multiple bodies to decay in coolers in Middle Tennessee funeral homes for periods that ranged between two to 11 months while family members frantically pressed him for information about their loved ones’ whereabouts. 
He falsified shipping documents, stopped answering families’ calls and left some families waiting for months to bury family members, state records showed. Among the grieving and distraught families were the parents of an 18-month old infant who died in a Nashville hospital and the mother of a 17-year-old boy who died by suicide.
At least five families filed suit against Van Ness and four funeral homes that agreed to store bodies for him. A state consumer alert issued in 2021 urged residents to report Van Ness to law enforcement after complaints he was approaching Spanish-speaking residents in Rutherford County to offer funeral services.
Murfreesboro mortuary settles suit in corpse “abuse” case

Van Ness is now fighting the state in federal court to be able to continue to provide volunteer funeral service, arguing he has a First Amendment right to serve as a “community death care advocate.” 
Van Ness claimed the state’s Board of Funeral Directors and Embalmers is illegally trying to restrict his freedom of religion by prohibiting him from participating in funeral services. He says he serves as a volunteer – a claim that is contrary to the complaints the board says it has received that Van Ness has accepted payment for his services. 
Van Ness “is part of a growing national movement rethinking the practices, customs, and approaches surrounding death,” the lawsuit said. 
“Mr. Van Ness shares his knowledge about end-of-life options with families to help them put their own end-of-life plan in place that is best for them and their loved ones. By engaging in these difficult but important conversation(s), he can give families the practical, emotional, and nontechnical support that funeral directors do not typically provide,” the lawsuit said. 
Lawsuits pile up against former funeral director

An attorney representing Van Ness could not be reached for comment about the lawsuit. A spokesperson for the Tennessee Department of Commerce and Insurance, which oversees the state’s funeral board, declined to comment on ongoing litigation.
In their legal response, the Department of Commerce and Insurance noted it had received complaints about Van Ness accepting payments for bungled funeral services between 2021 and 2023 after he had surrendered his license. 
In 2022, the state funeral board warned Van Ness he could not speak to consumers seeking funeral services, medical examiners, or undertake any actions relating to providing funeral, embalming or securing grave plots in Tennessee.
But throughout 2022 and 2023 the state’s funeral board “obtained evidence of various instances of Van Ness: accepting payment to arrange, manage, and perform funeral directing services; requesting to embalm and prepare loved ones of the deceased…and holding himself out as a licensed funeral director under another individual’s name.”
The lawsuit is scheduled for trial in June 2026.

(SPLC graphic)At least 13 organizations espousing hateful, extreme or antigovernment rhetoric were active in West Virginia in 2024, according to a report issued last week by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Per the SPLC’s 2024 Year in Hate and Extremism report, eight of those groups were local while five were considered to be active statewide. The groups vary from neo-nazi and white supremacist groups to organizations that are generally anti-government and militias.
The SPLC is a nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting and advancing civil rights across the South and the wider United States. Since 2000, the organization has mapped and identified extremist groups across the country while researching how their ideologies can, and often do, influence policy making.
The groups identified as extremist by the SPLC that were active in West Virginia in 2024 are:

The Constitution Party of West Virginia, a far-right, small-government focused political party that in 2024 succeeded in getting a gubernatorial candidate, former state delegate S. Marshall Wilson, on the ballot for the general election
The Kanawha County chapter of Moms For Liberty, a local arm of the national nonprofit that gained attention by being at the forefront of book-banning movements. The group has advocated against education on systemic racism and has peddled anti-LGBTQ misinformation. Moms For Liberty has pushed back against being labeled an extremist hate group as classified by the SPLC
The National Constitutional Coalition of Patriotic Americans, an antigovernment group based in Bridgeport, per the SPLC. A Taylor County chapter of the organization is also listed among active extremist groups in West Virginia
The First West Virginia Volunteer Mountain Infantry, a militia based in Huntington
Folkish Active Clubs West Virginia, a neo-nazi organization considered to be active statewide
The Asatru Folk Assembly West Virginia, a statewide Neo-Volkisch organization that, per the SPLC, is characterized by “organized ethnocentricity and archaic notions of gender”
The Appalachia Active Club, a white nationalist organization considered to be active statewide
Full Haus, a white nationalist organization in Purgitsville. Per its website, supporters of Full Haus want a white ethnostate and traditional gender roles
Patriot Front, a white nationalist extremist group considered to be active across West Virginia. In 2024, dozens of members of Patriot Front — carrying fascistic symbols and face coverings to hide their identity — marched through downtown Charleston on a Saturday afternoon
The VDARE Foundation, a white nationalist organization located in Berkeley Springs that espouses myriad of racist and anti-immigrant views and conspiracy theories, including the “great replacement theory” 
Mountain State Contingency Group, a statewide militia

According to the SPLC, there was one more hate or extremist group active in West Virginia in 2024 compared to 2023. Several of the groups listed in 2023 — mostly militias and white nationalist groups — were not on the 2024 report.
Nationwide, the number of hate and extremist groups identified by the SPLC is declining. 
Last week’s report showed an almost 5% decline in the number of hate and antigovernment groups operating from 2023 to 2024. But on a call with reporters upon the report’s release, representatives for the SPLC said that trend is not encouraging. Instead, it is likely the result of far-right extremism becoming more mainstream in otherwise accepted groups and movements.
“After years of courting politicians and chasing power, hard-right groups are now fully infiltrating our politics and enacting their dangerous ideology into law,” said Margaret Huang, president of the SPLC. “Extremists at all levels of government are using cruelty, chaos and constant attacks on communities and our democracy to make us feel powerless.”XX

Patrick Morrisey announced last week that the state sent a SNAP waiver request to the federal government asking to remove soda from being an eligible item under the program. (West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey video screenshot)It’s honestly like West Virginia’s leaders have no idea who West Virginians are, or can’t remember where they came from.
I guess being rich, coming from a family of politicians or being from New Jersey could be the reason for some of that.
West Virginia is one of the 10 poorest states in the nation. We rely heavily on federal funding for our state budget. But instead of working to lift people out of poverty, our state government and our congressional delegation is following the lead of President Donald Trump and making things worse.
Last week, Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced that he formally asked the federal government to disallow the state’s food assistance program from paying for soda. 
“For a long time I’ve talked about the fact that SNAP — the N should stand for nutrition,” Morrisey said in his video announcement. Well, it does stand for nutrition — the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
Indiana and Nebraska became the first states in the nation to ban soda and energy drinks from public grocery aid benefits, such as SNAP. The United States Department of Agriculture approved the states’ requests last week, and both will go into effect Jan. 1, 2026.
The SNAP program is meant to “maintain the dignity” of participants by helping them buy groceries, said Eric Savaiano, manager for food and nutrition access for Nebraska Appleseed. He called the latest SNAP ban “poverty-shaming.”
“With the approval of this waiver, some of that dignity is stripped away,” Savaiano said.
Poverty-shaming is the perfect description of this bill, and others the West Virginia Legislature wanted to pass this past session.
Lawmakers tried to ban SNAP recipients from using their benefits to buy soft drinks and candy, but that bill never made it out of the House of Delegates. 
The state Senate tried to pass a bill that would have expanded work and training requirements for SNAP recipients. 
“We know from lots of studies, including some of our own, that mandating work reporting requirements disconnects people from access to food, but does not connect them to work,” said Rhonda Rogombé, health and safety policy analyst for the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy.
She said the bill, which died in House Finance, would have put pressure on the state’s food banks, which would have been tasked with filling in the gaps for people who lost SNAP benefits because of work requirements. 
Meanwhile the Trump administration is ending the USDA’s Local Food Purchase Assistance program that gave states federal funding to stock food pantries from local farms.
The Ohio Association of Foodbanks sent out an email to farmers announcing the program is being cut, and attached a notice from the USDA, which said that the Trump administration had “determined this agreement no longer effectuates agency priorities and that termination of the award is appropriate.” 
The Local Food Purchase Assistance Program authorized $900 million worth of locally raised produce for food banks. It will end on June 30.
On top of that, the U.S. House of Representatives last week approved the Trump administration’s “big, beautiful bill,” which is actually pretty ugly and will be devastating to those who use SNAP or Medicaid.
More than 500,000 West Virginians rely on Medicaid or Children’s Health Insurance Program,  and about 277,000 — or one in six — residents use SNAP benefits to get access to food. Kelly Allen, executive director of the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, said the bill “feels like a really bad deal for West Virginians.”
The bill — which must still pass the U.S. Senate and be signed by President Donald Trump before becoming law — will shift some of the cost of SNAP to state governments.
Keep in mind, Morrisey has said he’s expecting a $400 million deficit beginning next fiscal year (something other state lawmakers have denied), and in 2022, more than 45% of the state’s total revenue came from federal grants, according to an analysis from Pew Charitable Trusts.
The “big, beautiful bill” will also make deep cuts to Medicaid, reducing the program by $625 billion over 10 years.
And what does West Virginia’s representation in Washington, D.C. have to say about the passage of this bill?
“This legislation will undoubtedly make the life of the average American better, and I am proud to support it on the House floor and help get it to President Trump’s desk,” Rep. Carol Miller said. “I urge my colleagues to do the same.”
Miller is a millionaire. Her husband owns five car dealerships and has a stake in a real estate company. 
Rich West Virginians aren’t living the same lives as the rest of us. When we don’t pay our bills, we don’t win a seat in the Senate like Sen. Jim Justice. We instead don’t eat, have our utilities turned off, go without medicine or lose our homes.
Maybe it’s not in our best interest to keep electing politicians who don’t know how the average West Virginian lives.

Twenty-three years is young for a person. But for a software system, it’s ancient.
That’s why Rhode Island election administrators are pushing to rejuvenate the technology used to collect and share information about campaign finance donations and spending.
But the makeover to the Rhode Island Board of Elections’ Electronic Reporting and Tracking System — colloquially referred to as “ERTS” — requires extra money from state lawmakers already fretting over the many demands pulling at the state’s purse strings. And how to store the last 23 years of reports from 1,300 candidates and committees in a way that people can still access and search remains in question.
Meanwhile, the clock is ticking. The span between the 2024 presidential election and the 2026 state and local races offers the largest window to upgrade software and train users. If not now, the state would have to wait till 2029.
A three-year delay increases the risk of the collapse of the entire system, said Miguel Nunez, Rhode Island Board of Elections executive director.  It also would mean another three years of spending — $70,000 in fiscal 2026 alone —- on an outdated system vulnerable to security threats. 
“At this point, I find it a priority to try and enhance the system because it is so old at this point,” Nunez said in an interview Wednesday. “It is essentially just being, year-to-year, maintained, with no enhancements, no improvements.”
A work order submitted by the board’s existing vendor, Civix, could launch the long-awaited upgrade in July and be ready in time for the 2026 state election cycle. The shift to ERTS 2.0 offers better security and a more user-friendly interface for candidates and the public, and complies with updated state reporting requirements, Nunez told the board at its May 16 meeting.
The elections panel postponed a vote authorizing the contract until its June 3 meeting, to give Nunez time to make the case for the $140,000 in fiscal 2026 funding needed for the upgrades. The first-year expense includes the license and costs for Civix to provide training and troubleshooting, according to the proposed work order by the company, based outside of New Orleans. The elections panel in its fiscal 2026 funding request to the state sought $250,000 for software upgrades. But the request did not make it into Gov. Dan McKee’s $14 billion spending proposal unveiled in January.
Nunez on Wednesday had yet to talk to McKee or legislative leaders but said he planned to “in the coming days.”
McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Thursday.
And the final authority on the state’s annual final tax-and-spend plan, House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, remains noncommittal.
“This is just one in a continuously growing number of asks in an extremely challenging budget year,” Shekarchi, a Warwick Democrat said in an email Thursday. “We are reviewing all the requests.”
The $140,000 first-year cost to upgrade campaign finance software is nearly twice the $69,492 needed for Civix provide service on the legacy campaign finance system, according to cost estimates Nunez presented to the elections panel. 
Under Civix’s proposal, the state would pay nearly $815,000 over five years for the upgrades and continued service. By comparison, it would cost $377,000 over the next five years to maintain the existing system, which includes a 5% increase in the year-to-year contract with Civix.

The cost of doing nothing 
“We shouldn’t be running 20-year-old systems,” Randy Jackvony, an elections board member who works in IT, said in an interview. “I’ve seen other cases with other vendors where when something is way past the end-of-life, the price can jack up incredibly high because they just don’t have the resources to address technical issues.”
Ric Thornton, state campaign finance director, suspects Rhode Island is the lone state still using Civix’s legacy system. Meanwhile, four other jurisdictions — the states of Georgia and Pennsylvania and the cities of Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Aurora, Colorado, already use the upgraded software administered by Civix, Thornton said in an interview.
Many of the Civix engineers who developed and know how to troubleshoot the legacy software are nearing retirement age, or have already retired, Nunez said.
Civix declined to comment on its services or staff, referring questions back to the Rhode Island elections board. 
“If the system goes down and no one can fix it, we might be looking at reverting to paper filings, which is in violation of state law,” Nunez told the board during its May 16 meeting. “And it could not be conducive to efficiency and transparency.”

Keeping it legal
Since 2002, Rhode Island has required candidates and committees raising or spending more than $10,000 a year, or maintaining a minimum $25,000 account balance, to report quarterly campaign finance activities electronically through its software platform. Candidates and committees not subject to the criteria often opt to use the software to submit their financial reports anyway. Just 15% of finance reports are sent in by email or pen and paper form, Nunez said.
Electronic reporting could be even higher if the state’s software was able to accept specialized reports. A 2012 state law passed two years after the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United v. FEC decision requires political action committees to disclose all independent donors and campaign expenses, including on advertising. But the existing ERTS system can’t accept such reports, forcing roughly 75 applicable super PACs to file 200 reports each year by email or through a document upload service, Nunez said.










If the system goes down and no one can fix it, we might be looking at reverting to paper filings, which is in violation of state law.


– Miguel Nunez, executive director for the Rhode Island Board of Elections


Another law which took effect in 2024 requires vendors awarded state contracts worth $5,000 or more to file affidavits with the elections board detailing political contributions. But the existing software offers no way to track submissions from vendors affirming they don’t make any contributions — their submissions are “simply not logged,” Nunez said.
Security considerations 
Upgrading ERTS also provides much-needed security enhancements, including multi-factor authentication, for candidates and committees that submit reports. Under the existing system, if a user forgets their password, only the state elections staff can reset it — posing potential access problems during critical reporting deadlines if the password snafu happens on a weekend and a staffer doesn’t respond right away, Nunez said.
The existing system also leaves the door open to hackers who could, potentially, manipulate the campaign numbers being submitted, said Ken Block, a software engineer who owns Warwick-based data mining company Simpatico Software Systems. Block, who founded the Rhode Island Moderate Party and ran unsuccessfully as an independent gubernatorial candidate in 2014, saw an urgent need for the upgrade.
“Twenty years is a pretty long time in the software world,” Block said. “It’s not unreasonable that the board would find themselves needing to go out and procure a new one.”
The elections board asked Civix, its software vendor since 2002, to propose a better system instead of seeking competing proposals for new software. Nunez cited the short time window to complete the upgrade, as well as the highly specialized nature of the service, as reasons why.
“It’s not a whole new purchase, it’s a modest upgrade to a newer platform,” Nunez said.
Jackvony wasn’t bothered by the lack of a formal request for proposals.
“If you’ve got a good relationship with a vendor, and feel confident, that’s not out of place,” Jackvony said. “It is somewhat common in IT, at least the private sector.”
Jackvony also said the price Civix quoted seemed reasonable, with hourly rates lower than those he vetted for his day job as chief information officer for Rhode Island Medical Imaging. He said his back-and-forth with the vendor on technical details of its proposal further boosted his confidence in them.
“They were incredibly responsive and detailed,” Jackvony said. 
What about the old data?
One wrinkle still not totally ironed out: What happens to the last 23 years of campaign reports? 
Civix’s proposal calls for archiving pre-2023 data as “static read-only” PDFs — meaning not searchable or incorporated into the more modern data interface. Nunez said in an interview that the staff was working with Civix on how to make the PDFs searchable, though he acknowledged they would not be able to be aggregated with the new system data.
“That’s crap,” said Block. “I don’t understand why they can’t move all the data into the new system. They should be able to do that no problem.”
Nunez explained it would be too time consuming and expensive to ask Civix to transfer all existing campaign finance data into the new software. However, he acknowledged he never asked the company what it could cost.
John Marion, executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island, shared serious concerns about losing public access to historic campaign finance data under the transition to better software.
“It doesn’t appear the board is focused on an important part of transparency, which is access to historic data,” he said. “Members of the public, and especially members of the media, often need access to older data in order to make comparisons to what is happening now.”
Marion continued, “It’s good the old data will be there but it remains to be seen how easy it will be to access.”

RFK Jr. calls miners' health ""priority.""","Brendan Demich speaks at a rally outside HHS offices in Washington, D.C. on May 22. (AFGE webstream)Brendan Demich was on a bus to Washington, D.C. last week to attend a rally outside the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ office.
At the same time, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was assuring lawmakers that critical programs in his department, specifically those protecting coal miners, would continue despite drastic cuts to his agency’s staff and budget.
It was the third in a series of contentious hearings for Kennedy. And for Demich, a Pennsylvania employee of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), a research agency in Kennedy’s department, they were hard to stomach.  
He’s part of a roughly 100-person team at NIOSH’s Bruceton facility in Allegheny County that studies the best ways to prevent injuries, illnesses and death in coal mines. Last month, he and all of his colleagues were notified that their jobs would be eliminated in June. Another team in Spokane, Washington, focused on safety in non-coal mines received similar notices. 
Combined, they conduct the bulk of the agency’s mine safety research.
“[Kennedy]’s claiming that he hasn’t fired any scientists, and that the only people that they’re cutting are doing duplicative work, but that is absolutely not the case,” Demich told the Capital-Star. “Our titles may be engineers, but we do science … And there’s no other agency that does the work we do here at NIOSH.”
The picture Demich paints is different from Kennedy’s.
“The work at NIOSH will not be interrupted,” Kennedy responded to a question from a lawmaker about layoffs. “The work on mine safety will continue. We understand it’s critically important to function and we don’t want to see it end.”
The hearings took place over the last three weeks after reports emerged that critical and legally required programs to help miners with black lung disease were no longer functioning, after an estimated 90% of NIOSH’s roughly 1400 full-time staff were laid off, offered early retirement or placed on administrative leave pending termination in early April.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Miners developing black lung, an irreversible and degenerative disease, were suddenly not able to get approved for a program facilitating transfers to less dusty mines. Black lung screenings that can help miners with the disease receive federal benefits were also stopped. 
This led to a class action lawsuit and pressure from Republican lawmakers to reverse the layoffs of federal workers whose jobs were ensuring mine safety.
So, earlier this month, Kennedy brought back over 300 NIOSH employees, including the Morgantown team that studies black lungs and ensures benefits for programs for miners who develop it continue to function. 
Kennedy also restored a team focused on the health of 9/11 first responders, as well as a team that works on the same Pittsburgh campus as Demich’s that tests and certifies respirators used by miners, firefighters and other professionals.
But Demich’s division is still expecting to be laid off.
Earlier this month, at a meeting, Demich said Pittsburgh employees in the mine safety division were told they no longer had to come into work, though a handful still do.
There had been hope with the Trump administration’s rhetoric around increasing coal mining and U.S. Health Department’s statements on the importance of miner safety that the job cuts would be reversed. But when NIOSH staff in other departments were brought back, Demich said, ”it crushed morale in the mining division. A lot of people see it as writing on the wall that we’re not being saved.”
The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to detailed questions from the Capital-Star about future plans for the mine research divisions. But a spokesperson provided a statement saying, “Secretary Kennedy has been working hard to ensure that the critical functions under NIOSH remain intact. The Trump administration is committed to supporting coal miners and firefighters, and under the Secretary’s leadership, NIOSH’s essential services will continue as HHS streamlines its operations. Ensuring the health and safety of our workforce remains a top priority for the Department.”
Demich finds HHS statements on preserving critical programs frustrating, given the cuts on his and similar teams.
“I don’t know how you can say that you’re maintaining essential services for coal workers and miners when you’re cutting the divisions that mainly do the research and provide the services to prevent mine injuries, illnesses and fatalities,” he said. “Our work does not overlap at all with the [Morgantown] division, other than that we both want to prevent black lung.”

‘Those functions are going to disappear’ 
There is virtually no operational mine in the United States that hasn’t implemented safety measures based on research conducted by NIOSH.
The U.S. government got into mine safety research when the Bureau of Mines was established in 1910, after a series of deadly explosions killed hundreds of miners in just a few short years. The bureau was tasked with researching safer practices, inspecting mines and collecting data on the industry.
The work was successful. For decades, miner fatality rates steadily and precipitously decreased. That continued after the Bureau of Mines was shuttered and effectively rolled into the Department of Health and Human Services in the 1990s, where it now sits.
NIOSH’s mine safety divisions don’t set or enforce rules, but research it conducts has led to breakthroughs in technology that detects coal dust levels in real time, prevents mine roofs from collapsing, increases mineshaft ventilation and provides barriers between miners and powerful explosions.
“Those functions are going to disappear and I’m not quite sure who else would be able to do those,” said Tony Iannacchione, a former employee of NIOSH’s coal mine safety team who now teaches at the University of Pittsburgh’s Swanson School of Engineering. “There’s some pretty unique expertise. And if you don’t have a government agency that’s keeping its thumb on the pulse and coming up with modifications and improvements to the systems being used in mines, we’re gonna be in a bad way.”
Iannacchione says that work is only getting more important. The more coal that’s extracted, the deeper miners have to dig to find it. That makes for more dangerous mines and requires new research and safety protocols.
“As you go deeper, you get higher concentrations of methane gas and all these problems just get worse,” he said. “For the industry to react to all these problems, it’s really beyond their capability. You need the government involved.”
Iannacchione cited recent NIOSH research that set new industry standards for blast walls that are placed between miners and explosives, as well as new methods for placing roof supports. The Pittsburgh team has also done extensive work on preventing hearing loss, which is an issue in underground mines that are full of loud machinery.
The coal mine safety team in Pittsburgh is also developing technology that can read silica dust levels in real time, but that has yet to be deployed. As miners dig into tougher terrain, they’re exposed to much more silica dust, which has led to an increase in the development of silicosis and black lung among younger miners and develops at an accelerated rate. Widespread use of real time monitors, Iannacchione said, could save lives. But it’s unclear if the work will be finished by the time the layoffs fully take effect in June.
Demich, the chief steward of the union representing Pittsburgh-area NIOSH workers, said he was working on a virtual reality training program for first responders and rescue teams to simulate mine disasters. They had begun training teams around the country, but the cuts effectively ended that work. He believes, with a little more time, they could have brought it to almost every mine rescue team in the U.S.
Benefit of the doubt’ 
Sam Petsonk has been an advocate for coal miners for his entire career. The West Virginia-based lawyer led the recent lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services that resulted in an injunction ruling last week, effectively requiring the return of NIOSH workers running Black Lung programs in Morgantown.
He successfully argued that the department was breaking the law by effectively shuttering congressionally-approved programs for miners with black lung by laying off the staff that implemented them. But, as he sees it, the law also requires the kind of research done by NIOSH’s teams that are still facing layoffs.
“These Pittsburgh programs are every bit as mandatory under the Mine Act,” Petsonk told the Capital-Star. “I would like to give Secretary Kennedy a bit of the benefit of the doubt here that he’s still digesting his obligations here.”
But the mandate is far less clear, with statute generally requiring NIOSH to conduct “research, demonstrations, and experiments” to support the Department of Labor’s Mine Safety and Health Administration, which sets and enforces rules for mine companies to follow. 
The injunction ruling from U.S. District Court Judge Irene Berger focused on the availability of black lung programs, but also said “the Court orders that there be no pause, stoppage or gap in the protections and services mandated by Congress in the Mine Act and the attendant regulations for the health and safety of miners.”
Asked if he would bring a lawsuit if the mine safety research teams are not brought back, Petsonk said he wants to wait until the end of the 20-day period that Berger allowed to comply with the injunction. That will be on June 2.

“If they look at it, they will see the need to revive the mining research labs within NIOSH,” Petsonk said.
The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to questions from the Capital-Star about whether it believes the injunction applies to the research teams, or whether law requires them to be operational.
“They should just follow the law and re-open the research labs in Pittsburgh and Spokane because miners need it,” Petsonk said. 
While it’s unclear if a legal remedy would be available to advocates like Petsonk who want mine safety research at NIOSH to continue, Demich is trying another way. When he was in Washington, D.C. last week, he and his NIOSH colleagues met with the staff of an estimated 15 to 20 lawmakers in an attempt to inform them about the research being lost and ask them to restore their jobs and research funding.
As it stands, even though Demich and his coworkers in Allegheny County are still technically employed, strict limits on research spending and travel would prevent them from doing a lot of their previous work.
Demich would not say which lawmakers’ staff he and his colleagues met with, since discussions are still ongoing. But he said the initial conversations were promising. He personally met with staff from lawmakers from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. He did note they were two Democrats and two Republicans.
“There’s a lot of questions about coal mines and about all the work we’re doing here in Pittsburgh,” Demich said. “A lot of people want  to follow-up and I think we’ll be reaching out.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Demich-speaks-at-rally-outside-HHS-May-22-1024x507.png,,,2025-05-27 06:09:15.769660

(Getty Images)Congress wants to make work reporting requirements in safety net programs harsher and more pervasive to remove supports from tens of thousands of Mainers and use that money to pay for tax cuts that overwhelmingly go to the wealthy. Maine has been down this road before and saw that work requirements take away help from people who need it and don’t support work.
The congressional bill currently under consideration would make work requirements harsher in three ways. It would:

Expand the existing requirement in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) for adults without dependents or a documented disability by increasing the age limit from 55 to 64, which will put 4,000 older adult Mainers newly at risk of losing food assistance.
Change the definition of “dependent” to only apply to children under the age of 7, which will put another 27,000 parents and caregivers of school-age kids at risk of losing food assistance. In total, 31,000 Mainers are likely to lose food assistance under these two changes.
Impose a similar work reporting requirement on the Medicaid (MaineCare) program for the first time in the program’s history. 34,000 Mainers are likely to lose health care under this change.

“Work requirements” are program cuts
While some Republicans have sought to portray work requirements as distinct from benefit cuts, the proven reality is these changes will remove millions of Americans from the affected programs, the majority of whom are working, caregiving, or suffering from a serious health condition that prevents them from working. Work requirements create a lot of new paperwork and administrative barriers.
According to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, these would cost $6 million a year in additional administrative costs alone. The extra bureaucratic hoops also lead to the disenrollment of many people who are meeting the requirements but just get caught up in red tape. By one estimate, 13% of people impacted by the congressional proposal would not currently meet the work requirements for Medicaid and don’t qualify for an exemption, but the actual number who would lose care is three times higher (39%), meaning that the majority of people losing coverage already participate in the workforce or qualify for an exemption.
Approximately one third of Maine workers below traditional retirement age work less than full-time, year-round. In a seasonal economy like Maine’s, it can be particularly hard for people to meet a work reporting requirement on a consistent basis every month because the jobs simply aren’t available or the hours vary.
Many Mainers have health conditions that make it hard for them to work but are not always easy to prove to gain an exemption from a work requirement. As many as 110,000 Mainers aged 18 to 64 report having some kind of disability, but only 30,000 of them actually receive Social Security Disability benefits, leaving tens of thousands of Mainers with a harder time proving their disability to gain an exemption.
There are plenty of other obstacles to work that the bill doesn’t recognize. A 2021 survey of unemployed Mainers found that one in eight couldn’t work due to childcare problems, and 6% didn’t have reliable transportation.
Finally, it’s worth remembering that food and medical assistance are key to health and stability people need to engage in the labor force. Medicaid expansion has increased employment among adults with disabilities and SNAP has also been shown to help people find and keep employment by freeing up money for expenses like childcare. Taking both away from folks who can’t find consistent work will only make their barriers to employment worse as well as make it harder for them to get by in general.
Work requirements in Maine and elsewhere caused hardships without boosting work
Maine has prior experience with expanding work requirements that proved unsuccessful. In late 2014, then-Governor Paul LePage expanded work requirements in the SNAP program for adults without a documented disability who did not have children at home. Nearly three quarters of the SNAP recipients who were subject to the new requirements lost their benefits, with tens of thousands losing assistance over the next few years. Many of those who lost benefits were still unable to find work in the year afterwards, and those who did had incomes well below the poverty line. A 2017 survey of Mainers who lost SNAP benefits due to the LePage policy changes found that almost 80% of them had to use food pantries more often after the change, and 86% said it led to them making difficult choices between paying for food and other necessities like rent or health care.
National research shows similar patterns in the SNAP program — the federal work reporting requirement makes it much more likely that people will lose food assistance but does nothing meaningful to help those folks find work.
Recently several states have experimented with work requirements in Medicaid, with similarly poor results:

Under Arkansas’ temporary Medicaid work requirement, one in four people subject to the new test lost their health care coverage, most of whom could not get alternative health insurance, and there was no evidence of increased employment as a result.
Georgia imposed the work requirement when they expanded Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act. One year into the program, just 2% of people thought to be eligible for the program have enrolled, leaving hundreds of thousands of people unable to get health care. This is despite the state spending millions of dollars on consultants to conduct an outreach campaign.
New Hampshire suspended its Medicaid work requirement after it had trouble even notifying impacted enrollees about the change. Despite multiple outreach efforts, nearly half of the people potentially subject to the work requirement didn’t even receive notices from the state. Of those assessed for the work requirement, only one third were judged to be meeting it when the policy was suspended.

Congress is at risk of repeating the mistakes made in Maine and other states and expanding them to the whole country in its reconciliation bill. Work requirements are efficient at taking food and health care away and creating more costly rules for states, but they don’t lead to more people working. Tens of thousands of Mainers will lose access to health care and food assistance and will suffer real hardships as a result.

Andy Beshear's Derby eve event mingle in the courtyard of the Old Governor's Mansion in Frankfort, May 2, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Tom Loftus)FRANKFORT, Ky. —  Again this year, Gov. Andy Beshear has refused to identify friends and political supporters who buy prime tickets to the Kentucky Derby made available by Churchill Downs for the governor’s entourage.
The governor’s office responded to an Open Records Act request from the Lantern with a letter saying it has no records of who got the tickets or who was invited to Beshear’s black-tie Derby eve party at the Old Governor’s Mansion in Frankfort.
The office referred questions about the tickets and the party to a nonprofit corporation Beshear created at the outset of his administration to act as broker for his Derby tickets and manage the party.
But the nonprofit, First Saturday in May Inc., is not covered by the Kentucky Open Records Act. And as it did last year, First Saturday refused the Lantern’s request to review details of its income and spending. It ignored the Lantern’s questions asking how many tickets it bought this year, the cost of the tickets and to whom the tickets were sold.
First Saturday did, however, release a copy of its most recent (2023-24) tax return, which it is required by law to do. The tax return reveals only basic financial information — $990,000 in income that year and $965,000 in expenses.
First Saturday reported in that tax return that it is a 501(c)(4) charitable organization whose mission is “to organize and manage events for the promotion of economic development in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.”
The nonprofit released a brief statement to the Lantern which noted its role in hosting the state’s “economic development and tourism guests at the Kentucky Derby.”
But the statement also acknowledged, “Additional tickets to the Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby were privately purchased from Churchill Downs by the First Saturday in May at no expense to the Commonwealth.”
This is the only hint from First Saturday of the substantial payments it has received in recent years from Democratic Party groups — particularly the Democratic Governors Association, or DGA.
The 2025 Kentucky Derby was run as Beshear explores a campaign for president in 2028. Beshear’s national profile was enhanced in December when his fellow Democratic governors elected him vice chair of the DGA and as chair-elect for 2026.
The DGA used the events of Beshear’s Derby weekend — including the private formal party on Derby Eve —  as a fundraiser this year. And disclosures filed by the association with the Internal Revenue Service show that it has maintained a close relationship with First Saturday in May since Beshear first became governor.
The IRS calls 501(c)(4) groups “social welfare organizations” which are permitted to participate in some political activity as long as politics isn’t their primary purpose.
The Democratic Governors Association did not respond to numerous phone messages and emails from the Lantern.
For its part, Churchill Downs refused to answer questions from the Lantern.
 Precedent broken

Last year the Lantern reported that Beshear broke from the practice of his four immediate predecessors  — including his father Steve Beshear, governor from 2007-15 — by refusing to release lists of those who bought Derby tickets from the allotment set aside by Churchill Downs for the governor. 
Several news reports dating back to 1999 published lists released by those governors of the people who bought their tickets from a large allotment set aside by Churchill Downs for purchase at face value by the governor’s guests. The practice was to release lists of actual buyers of the tickets to reporters after the Derby, when the records were no longer considered preliminary.
According to those news reports, each year a small portion of those tickets were bought by state government to host official guests — job creators and tourism promoters. Most tickets were bought by  political donors, lobbyists, administration officials and friends.

That is apparently the case this year. The “spending search” function on state government’s “Transparency” website shows that the state has paid First Saturday $106,291 so far this year — apparently for the cost of tickets and related expenses for the official guests.
But the number of such official guests — job creators and tourism promoters from out of state — is not large. The Beshear administration has said 40 such guests were entertained at the 2024 Derby.
The past news articles reported that Churchill sold as many as 553 Derby tickets to the governor’s group while Democrat Paul Patton was governor in 1999, and as few as 237 in 2016 under Republican Matt Bevin. 
Critics quoted in those articles questioned the propriety of Churchill — an entity closely regulated by the state and a massive political donor — making so many tickets available to the governor — far more tickets than needed for the official state guests. 
The ability to buy a prime Derby ticket at face value is a rare opportunity. Demand exceeds supply and many Derby fans must go online to the secondary market to buy tickets at high prices set by sellers.
Norman Ornstein, an authority on ethics in government and emeritus scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, told the Lantern last year that he was not so bothered by this potential conflict of interest. “My only question now would be: Why are you not letting us know what other governors have let us know?” Ornstein said.
 First Saturday and the Democratic Governors Association

One conclusion that can be drawn from available public records about First Saturday in May is that from its creation it has had a close relationship with the Democratic Governors Association.
The DGA and its affiliated nonprofit group are required to file finance reports with the Internal Revenue Service. Those reports show that since First Saturday in May was created in 2019 through the end of 2024 the DGA has paid it $491,000.
(The specific payments were: $105,000 in January 2022; $172,200 in February 2023; $37,300 in April 2023; $26,500 in March 2024. Also, a DGA affiliated non-profit named America Works USA reported that it made a $150,000 grant to First Saturday in early 2020.)
The DGA is not required to disclose its receipts and spending for the first half of 2025 until July.
The Lexington Herald-Leader reported in April that the DGA used Derby weekend as a fundraising opportunity.

Andy Beshear has refused to disclose who buys coveted Derby tickets from the allotment that Churchill Downs sets aside for the governor. The Beshears were photographed on election night, 2023.

An invitation obtained by the Lexington Herald-Leader said that for a $15,000 donation ($25,000 for two people) a guest would get a ticket to the Oaks, the Derby and the Beshears’ gala at the Old Governor’s Mansion. The gala was not exclusively for the DGA donors and the state’s economic development guests. Beshear Communications Director Crystal Staley said, “Many different people from a variety of groups attend the gala.”
The DGA’s fundraiser invitation offered the opportunity for donors to not only party with Beshear, but also three other Democratic governors: The 2024 Democratic nominee for vice president Tim Walz of Minnesota, Maura Healey of Massachusetts and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico.
Last year a DGA spokesperson told the Lantern that the DGA has hosted events in Kentucky on Derby weekend for many years.
Besides the DGA, other political groups have made payments to First Saturday.
The Kentucky Democratic Party has reported to the FEC that it has paid a total of $99,370 since May of 2022 to First Saturday. And the Democratic Attorneys General Association has disclosed to the IRS that it has paid First Saturday $24,400.
 New leadership for First Saturday in May

First Saturday in May Inc. was formed by Beshear soon after his first inauguration in December 2019. It was not a unique idea; governors going back to Paul Patton had created similar nonprofits to handle expenses of their Derby activities.
Records of Kentucky’s secretary of state show that in mid-February this year, the leadership of the nonprofit changed. Lindy Karns, Beshear’s CPA who also has served as treasurer of his campaign committees, is no longer treasurer and contact person for First Saturday. Jack Dulworth, a Louisville businessman and longtime Beshear supporter, moved from the president’s job to vice president. The new president is Jonathan Smith, who has worked closely with Beshear since Beshear’s 2015 campaign for attorney general.
(Officers of First Saturday receive no salaries, according to the organization’s tax returns.)
Smith resigned last year as deputy chief of staff in the governor’s office. At the time of his resignation, the Herald-Leader reported that Smith “is seen by many political insiders as a liaison between Beshear and others in the political world.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)LOUISVILLE — An organization that led a statewide campaign against last year’s proposed constitutional amendment to allow the legislature to fund nonpublic schools is seeking more insight about education from communities across Kentucky. 
Protect Our Public Schools, which has transitioned to a wider education advocacy role following the defeat of Amendment 2 in November, was one of the highest fundraising political action committees against the amendment. Now, the coalition has launched a listening tour in 10 Kentucky cities to gather input and build a campaign for pro-education legislation in Frankfort.
Ahead of a forum in Louisville on Thursday, Jefferson County Teachers Association President Maddie Shepherd told reporters that Protect Our Schools is “in a unique position right now to chart a course for our kids’ future.” She said the feedback the organization collects in the 10 forums “will inform a larger, broader shared campaign about what all of Kentucky schools need.” 
Addison Lowry, a Jefferson County high school student, said that “community leaders and local voices were the key” to the movement against Amendment 2 last year and argued that the same strategy will be effective in campaigning on behalf of public education in the future. 
“This effort won’t be led by Frankfort lobbyists, but by the people who live with the consequences of decisions made in Frankfort every day — the folks who drive through the bus, the students who ride that bus, those who teach in classrooms, pack the lunches and raise the kids in our communities,” Lowry said. “We believe that those closest to the problem should be the ones helping shape the solution, and that’s exactly what this campaign is about.”

Protect Our Schools held its first listening stop in Owensboro. The next dates and locations are Bowling Green on June 10 and Lexington on July 15. The organization will announce future dates and locations online at protectourschoolsky.com. 
During a forum, those who attend are asked about challenges in their communities and about what they would like teaching and learning for students to be in their areas. They also discuss how to make those goals a reality. 
Lowry said that by the end of the year, Protect Our Schools hopes to “have built a more localized, robust coalition than ever before ready to organize for the future students deserve.”
When lawmakers return to Frankfort in January for the 2026 legislative session, they will deliberate the next biennial state budget and decide which programs to fund with state dollars. Protect Our Schools plans to compile the feedback from its forums into a legislative campaign that focuses on reinvesting in the state’s public schools. 
Education funding has been a contentious topic between public school advocates and Republican lawmakers in recent years. While some groups like the Kentucky Education Association have argued paying teachers more would incentivize more people to go into the profession, Republicans have argued the General Assembly, controlled by the GOP, has provided a historic level of K-12 education funding. 
Public education funding nationwide has faced uncertainty as the Trump administration reviews federal funding for K-12 schools. In Kentucky, all but two school districts signed an agreement with the administration to adhere to new restrictions on diversity, equity and inclusion programs in public schools and avoid the possibility of losing federal funding. Recently, the U.S. Department of Education denied a $10.6 million request to extend COVID relief funding submitted by the Kentucky Department of Education on behalf of school districts for nine projects.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_4161-e1748113856313-1024x642.jpg,,,2025-05-27 06:09:15.769660

Last August, Highlander Elementary partnered with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW). In October, Paul Cuffee Upper School followed suit, joining Rhode Island’s American Federation of Teachers (AFT). In December, Cuffee’s Lower School joined them. Cuffee Middle School has not signed on.
Nationally, 70% of public district schools are unionized. As are roughly 11% of the teachers at charters, with 54% of those in states that mandate charter unionization. Charters are public schools — publicly funded, strictly held to the same public accountability as district schools, with students chosen by lottery systems when over-enrolled. 
Rhode Island’s charter approval vetting process is praised as one of the best, unlike the Wild West of, say, Arizona where lax approval laws let charters frequently open and close, disrupting families. Rhode Island charters are stable and highly attractive to families. 
But why would a charter give up its flexibility to join Rhode Island’s unions? With these negotiations underway now, several educators did not respond to my queries and those who did would only speak off the record. 
To find the answers, I conducted off-the-record interviews, read an announcement in an IBEW newsletter focusing on teacher voice and higher pay, and obtained an email recruitment pitch from a union organizer recently sent to charter schools. Three main issues emerged: 
Better benefits and pay
The critical issue with Rhode Island charter schools generally is that they operate with almost 20% less money, per pupil, than district schools. The Rhode Island Expenditure Council (RIPEC) put its exhaustive study of our charters in a national context that revealed uniquely inequitable funding between charters and district schools. The biggest gap drivers are:

Districts home to the charter building hold back at least 7% of the per pupil cost (PPE) for, as RIPEC put it, “so-called unique costs.” But then, districts can increase the amount using a complex series of calculations to claw back yet more of the PPE, with Woonsocket’s RISE charter topping out at a whopping 62% holdback. 
The state’s School Housing Aid Fund helps schools pay for renovations, new buildings and upgrades. A formula allocates at least 35% of the costs in low-poverty districts (Little Compton, Barrington) and up to 97% and 88% respectively in high-poverty districts (Central Falls, Woonsocket). Charters get a flat 30%, no matter what their needs or poverty level.
Municipalities and districts own the buildings. Charters must buy or rent and make all necessary repairs or risk losing their charter. Charters have no other resources to draw from.
Rhode Island’s charters are subject to extensive audits at least every five years. These accountability requirements are expensive, labor-intensive, time-consuming and inequitable because district schools have no such requirements. 

Surely, the charters would raise salaries immediately if they got their full per-pupil funding without all the holdbacks. The money is supposed to follow the kid. Furthermore, lower salaries make charters vulnerable to teacher poaching by districts. 
Also, charters often have specific missions — i.e., the Nurses Institute, the Greene School — to which the school must deploy resources. If the money is redeployed to, say, salaries, can these schools stay true to their mission? 
To raise salaries and benefits, where would the money come from? 
Answer: mostly by increasing class size. Charters’ smaller classes contribute to their efficacy and popularity. Especially post-COVID, virtually all kids need lots of support and help. Private and suburban schools have small classes. Often charters’ smaller classes attract teachers who want calmer environments where they can be more successful. 
More control over administrative decision making, a.k.a. “teacher voice” 
Schools with poor teacher feedback mechanisms invite conflict. A memo that dictates, “Here is the new rule (which is news to you); implement it tomorrow,” is infuriating.
Some authoritarian administrators only pretend to listen to staff, or they don’t share enough information about a decision to allow the faculty to weigh in on important decisions. Teachers experience them as oppressive.
Other administrators might invite conflict by running a tight ship, holding staff accountable or deploying resources to the mission for which they’ve been chartered when teachers want something else, like higher pay. Teachers often choose to teach (and stay) at charter public schools because they enjoy collaborating on challenges with their colleagues and leadership. Seemingly, something is not working at the unionizing charters. 
Legal protections and power
The email from the union recruiter says, “Our union offers legal protection and liability coverage. Unionized workers also cannot be fired or disciplined without just cause.” 
True, union dues pay for legal departments that protect district teachers from discipline and dismissal, usually to the detriment of the students. Burdensome state laws governing grievance procedures nearly prevent district staff from ever being disciplined. Since the charter teacher and administration would have to pay legal fees, an unprovoked dismissal is not in either parties’ interest. 
So, what now? 
The IBEW is a private-sector, construction union, not part of the state’s public-service union body politic. Incompetent construction workers get fired. Will the IBEW protect ineffective teachers? Also, do they have the clout or will to endure a fight for fair funding? Hard to know.
The far more powerful AFT leaders are crackerjack negotiators. Will Cuffee’s flexibility rigidify with adherence to their new contract? Or will negotiations include a wealth of carve-outs to provide the non-traditional practices consistent with the charter’s mission? 
Most importantly, will the AFT fight to get their charter partners full funding? Nationally, unions have been fighting charter schools since the movement began, mainly by working to hogtie them with underfunding (see item #1 above). Will the AFT represent these new schools with the same fervor as they once opposed them?
If so, that would be fantastic. Because giving all charters their full per pupil expenditure would solve a world of problems.  It’s a long shot, but shouldn’t be.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The ink is barely dry on the U.S. House’s version of the 2025 federal budget — the One Big Beautiful Bill Act— and Kentuckians have every reason to be concerned. 
The bill enacts nearly $700 billion in Medicaid cuts over the next decade, slashes billions more from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and makes permanent a raft of tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals and corporations, as almost all of Kentucky’s congressional delegation hope against hope that tax breaks given to the wealthy eventually trickle down to everyday Kentuckians.
For families across Kentucky, these changes aren’t just political talking points; they are deeply personal. Medicaid provides health coverage for 1.4 million Kentuckians, including seniors in nursing homes, children with special needs and working parents who don’t receive health insurance through their jobs. 
SNAP supports over 575,000 Kentuckians in putting food on the table, leading the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy to recently conclude that “the damage of this plan (i.e., ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’) will far outweigh its meager to non-existent benefits for Kentucky families.” As such, these cuts will ripple through communities, likely shuttering rural hospitals, increasing food insecurity and shifting burdens onto already stretched local services and state budgets.
Economists offer a useful metaphor to explain why this kind of trickle-down economic policy falls short: the flypaper effect. Originally coined to describe how government grants stick with the agencies that receive them rather than flowing to the people those agencies serve, the concept applies nearly as well to tax cuts at the top of the income ladder. 
Like a fly on sticky paper, money tends to stay where it lands — accumulating in corporate coffers, stock buy-backs, executive bonuses, and the bank accounts and investment portfolios of the ultra-wealthy. And for what? More tax breaks for billionaires and corporations that are unlikely to reinvest in places like Benton, Beaver Dam or Beattyville. It rarely reaches Main Street in Hazard or helps struggling families in West Louisville. 
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act is little more than trickle-down economics repackaged, almost assuredly failing the vast majority of Kentuckians once again.
To be sure, the budget includes some small nods to the working class and retirees: Tips and overtime pay will be exempt from federal income tax. The bill also allows middle and low-income seniors a greater tax deduction on their Social Security benefits. 
While these gestures offer welcome relief to many Kentuckians in the service and hourly workforce, particularly in restaurant-heavy communities like Bowling Green or the manufacturing plants of Georgetown, and retirees, it pales in comparison to the sweeping, permanent tax benefits granted to the wealthiest of Americans.  A bone tossed to workers and retirees does little to offset the structural tilt of the budget toward concentrated wealth and corporate power.
As 2024 Nobel laureates Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson explain in “Why Nations Fail,” sustainable prosperity depends on inclusive institutions that broaden access to opportunity, not extractive ones that concentrate wealth and power among a privileged few. Make no mistake about this: with this next budget, we are moving further into the latter. Trickle-down economics assumes wealth will eventually filter to lower-income Americans, but in practice, it locks resources at the top, reinforcing inequality and stagnating opportunity.
We’ve seen the warning signs before. In the 1980s, massive federal tax cuts under President Ronald Reagan touted as trickle-down economics were followed by exploding deficits and cutbacks to vital services, which ultimately convinced Reagan and Congress to reverse many of those tax cuts. In 2017, under the first Trump administration, tax cuts promised economic growth that never materialized for most Americans. Wages in Kentucky barely budged, even as the wealthiest in the nation saw record gains.
Now, with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passing the House, we are watching the same script play out. 
This time, the stakes are even higher for Kentuckians. In a state that already ranks near the bottom in health outcomes, slashing Medicaid funding will hurt both individuals and entire rural health systems. Meanwhile, cutting food assistance, although living costs continue to climb, will push more families toward the brink.
Kentucky’s economic challenges aren’t caused by working families asking for too much; they’re caused by policies that keep giving more to those who already have the most. Our commonwealth has seen what happens when coal jobs disappear, when opioid addiction ravages communities, and when opportunity is outsourced. What we need now isn’t another tax break at the top: We need strategic investment in our people and infrastructure.
The budget should be a reflection of our shared values. It should prioritize affordable and accessible health care in Berea, strong public schools in Covington, job training programs in Owensboro and small business development in Paducah. Instead, this budget undermines those possibilities and entrenches inequality — right here in the Bluegrass and across the nation.
The flypaper effect reminds us that where money lands matters. Right now, it’s not landing with ordinary Kentuckians. It’s sticking with the wealthiest Americans, while poor and working-class Kentuckians and our communities will shoulder the consequences. With the One Big Beautiful Bill, wealth sticks to wealth, power begets more power, and the cycle of inequality deepens.
Budgets are more than dry, technical financial blueprints; they are moral statements about who and what we value. If we truly value family and opportunity, then our national budget should reflect that. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act does not. We need a federal budget that works for the many, not for the privileges of the few.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The concern probably never occurred to you, but if it did, you can now put your mind at rest. Research confirms that the current era – our own modern-day version of the Roaring 20’s — remains a great time to be a billionaire. A new report from the global nonprofit Oxfam provides the numbers.
According to the report, which the Oxfam people gleaned from that chronicle of the ruling class, Forbes, the vast and immoral inequality that dominates the U.S. economy has reached truly stunning levels.
Among the key findings:

Despite recent tariff-related market turmoil, the 10 richest U.S. billionaires saw their wealth increase by $365 billion over the past 12 months.
It would take 726,000 years for 10 U.S. workers with median earnings to make that much money.
If the wealth gains of the 10 richest billionaires were taxed like income from work, they would owe a collective $135 billion in taxes.
A modest three percent tax on wealth over $1 billion would raise over $50 billion from the 10 richest U.S. billionaires alone. This is enough to cover the entire federal rental assistance budget or a year of food assistance for 22.5 million people.

In other words, life remains good for, alphabetically (an ordering system that would no doubt cause most of these men to cringe): Steve Ballmer, Jeff Bezos, Sergey Brin, Warren Buffet, Larry Ellison, Elon Musk, Larry Page, Jim Walton, Rob Walton, and Mark Zuckerberg.
What’s more, the chance that American elected leaders might actually pursue any policy options remotely akin to what those radicals at Oxfam suggest has been firmly put to rest for the foreseeable future.
Indeed, thanks to votes last week in both the U.S. and North Carolina Houses of Representatives, things are soon likely to get even better for the Big 10, as well as for the thousands of other millionaires and billionaires who make up America’s top 1%.
The action in Washington, of course, centered around Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” – an 1,116-page monstrosity that seeks to make much of the Heritage Foundation’s infamous Project 2025 a reality.
Topping the list of billionaire-boosting provisions: a package of tax changes that will further enrich the Big 10 and their ilk and further enfeeble core federal government structures and services.
As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reported, “Under the bill, the top 1 percent of people would receive tax cuts three times the size of those for people with incomes in the bottom 60 percent, measured as a share of after-tax income. The top 0.6 percent of people — the 1.2 million people with annual incomes above $1 million — would receive more total tax cuts than the 127 million people with incomes below $100,000.”
The bill would also slash core social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP food assistance. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office reports that the bill will lead to 3.2 million people losing food assistance benefits, while saddling states with around $14 billion a year in new costs — if, that is, they decide to take them on.
Meanwhile, on the same day the U.S. House approved its bill on a 215-214 vote – a vote made possible in large part by the gerrymandering that gave Republicans three extra seats in the North Carolina congressional delegation – Republicans in the North Carolina House approved their version of a new, omnibus state budget bill.
And while Gov. Josh Stein and several Democratic lawmakers have adopted the pragmatic strategy of praising parts of the bill for not veering as far off the rails as the Senate version that was approved earlier this spring, average North Carolinians should harbor no illusions about the direction the bill takes the state.
As the North Carolina Budget and Tax Center observed, the bill “continues to prioritize tax cuts for corporations and the rich — as well as building up reserve funds for corporate giveaways — above raising employee pay, making child care more affordable, keeping college tuition low, and the numerous other issues impacting quality of life for the average North Carolinian.”
Indeed, in a move that the Big 10 and their minions have undoubtedly already happily noted, the bill will continue to advance the GOP’s destructive and regressive scheme to repeal the state corporate income tax. As the BTC notes, that part of the House’s plan “will cost the state about $235 million over the biennium, and 94 percent of that tax giveaway will flow to out-of-state residents.”
What’s next for these two bills is somewhat unclear. While there remains some faint hope that the U.S. Senate could temper some of the worst program cuts, the expectation in Raleigh is that the state Senate will move aggressively to push things further to the right – a push that Stein and House Democrats (who theoretically possess the ability to sustain a gubernatorial veto) will be hard-pressed to resist.
And sadly, the chance that either package will be amended to include anything akin to the modest billionaire tax proposal suggested by Oxfam (or any other change that might alter the destructive, rich-getting-richer trend that dominates America’s trickle-up economy) remains less than zero.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/elonmuskmarch52025-1024x731.jpg,,,2025-05-27 06:09:15.769660

Pastor Michelle Thomas, president of the NAACP Loudoun Branch, and Robin Reaves Burke of the Loudoun Freedom Center proposed the concept to state Del. David Reid, D-Loudoun, shortly after the commonwealth added African American History and AP African American Studies to the list of courses permitted to be taught in public high schools. 
Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, and Reid successfully passed the proposal through the General Assembly with some amendments. On March 24, Gov. Glenn Youngkin proposed an amendment requiring the General Assembly to pass the proposal again in 2026, but lawmakers did not accept it. Youngkin then vetoed the bill, stating that it would cause students to miss “key concepts essential to understanding how historical world events have shaped our modern economy, government, and international relations.” 
Thomas was surprised and disappointed by the decision, she said.
“You can’t divorce African American history from the founding of America. It is the absolute foundation of American history, and so to try to marginalize this and say students shouldn’t be learning it, or it’s not as important as mainstream history, or the history that he’s trying to tell is absolutely ridiculous,” Thomas said in a statement last week.

Thomas said she first considered proposing the legislation after her daughter was interested in taking an African American studies course and seeking flexibility with her class schedule towards meeting her graduation requirements. 
Under Virginia’s standard diploma requirements, students are required to take U.S. History, Virginia and U.S. Government, and either World History or Geography. The bill would have given the students the option to substitute African American History or AP African American Studies studies with World History or Geography.

“While I am supportive of expanding choices in what classes students may take to satisfy graduation requirements, we must ensure that classes that replace others are germane to the comprehensive goals of high school education standards,” Youngkin wrote in his veto statement.
But Thomas defended the proposal. 
“We’re not saying ‘do away’ or ‘you can take this or that.’ You can take all of them,” Thomas said. “You can take World History II, if parents feel like World History I and World History II are important. But for those parents (and students) who believe African American history is also and equally important, allow them to get graduation credit for it.”
She said she also believes the governor’s decision falls in line with a national agenda to minimize or remove public references to Black history, and could align with his future political plans.
The curriculum has been continually debated by the public, education leaders and Youngkin’s administration during the governor’s entire time in office, which concludes in January. The first AP African American studies course was added last year, but not without controversy — Youngkin’s education department proposed dozens of revisions before its approval, the Washington Post reported.
Reid said in a statement that he was disappointed by the governor’s decision and plans to reintroduce the bill at the next session, beginning in January. 
“The governor chose to ignore the very values he outlined in Executive Order One on his first day in office — his stated commitment to teach the full story of American history,” said Reid. “Instead, he allowed political fear to override principle and missed an opportunity to give parents and students more choice in how they learn our shared history.”
He also said Virginia history and African American history are important parts of America’s origin story, citing the significance of the first House of Burgesses — the first democratically-elected legislative body in what would become America — and the arrival of the first Africans in present-day Hampton, both defining events that took place in Virginia roughly two weeks and 40 miles apart.
“Virginia history is African American history, is American history,” Reid said. “Our children deserve to learn the truth of our shared story — and they deserve the freedom to choose how they learn it.”

Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera said with the Board of Education revising the History and Social Science Standards in 2023, which sets what students are required to learn before graduating, all Virginia students will learn more historically significant figures of all backgrounds. Guidera said students will also learn about Black Americans, American Indigenous people and women leaders in the required courses.
“Our robust standards ensure the comprehensive, illuminating story of our history is taught to all students,” Guidera said in a statement to the Mercury. “While history electives are very important options for students to have and do count towards graduation, we know every graduate from Virginia’s K-12 schools needs a strong, broad-based foundational understanding of civics, world history, and the places, people, events, and ideas that shaped the commonwealth, the United States and the world.”

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Before a federal judge temporarily halted the dissolution of the agency Thursday, the U.S. Department of Education ensured “uninterrupted services” to children and youth with disabilities, in response to probing questions by U.S. Senators from Virginia and other states about the future of special education.
The questions, spearheaded by Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware in a letter to Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, came after President Donald Trump and his administration launched efforts to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. A key point of concern for the lawmakers was the one-month freeze on investigations into discrimination complaints that left a backlog of 12,000 complaints, “half of which involve students with disabilities,” Democratic U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine of Virginia and 20 of their colleagues wrote.
The agency’s plans are of particular significance for Virginia, where a federal investigation found that the Virginia Department of Education failed to meet federal requirements to help resolve disputes involving students with disabilities beginning in 2019.
In December 2024, the investigation ended after the Office of Special Education Programs wrote in a letter that all of its findings and required actions for the agency were closed.
Virginia was responsible for nearly 186,000 students with disabilities this past school year, an increase of almost 5,000 students from the 2023-24 academic period. As federal law requires, Virginia must provide all students with disabilities a “free and appropriate public education” through personalized plans under the Individualized Education Program (IEP).
Facing special ed teacher shortage, Va. education board votes to expand educator pipeline

Sarah Ursprung, acting assistant secretary for legislation and congressional affairs for the federal department, wrote to lawmakers in April that no formula funding to states, including Title I and IDEA, was cut, and the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) continues its enforcement work with a reduced workforce and the same commitment to vigorous vindication of students’ civil rights.
“The department remains committed to ensuring uninterrupted services to meet the needs and develop the potential of children and youth with disabilities pursuant to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),” Ursprung wrote in a letter provided to the Mercury.
The senators’ letter also highlighted their reservations about limited staff at the agency. U.S. Sens. Mark Warner and Tim Kaine from Virginia signed Rochester’s letter in April that said the cuts would have “immense harm” to all students.
“While we appreciate receiving a response from the Department of Education, we still have serious concerns about how the department can ensure services for students with disabilities aren’t interrupted when Secretary McMahon has already reduced staff by nearly 50% and said she intends to close the department,” the senators wrote. 
Ursprung said that no employees in the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), the Rehabilitation Services Administration or the National Center for Special Education Research (NCSER) were subject to the staff cuts on March 11. Employees involved in policy and administrative functions, whose duties the agency said can be reassigned or eliminated, were the ones subject to firing. 
NCSER-supported research continues with obligated funds, according to Ursprung. The research center helps experts understand more about children who have or may have disabilities by studying them from infancy through college.
The trajectory of the federal education department, and the fallout in Virginia, remains uncertain, after the Massachusetts federal judge paused its dismantling and ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 employees. The department is expected to appeal the decision.

About a decade ago, Norfolk officials launched a lengthy federal process for what would become the largest infrastructure project in its history.
The $2.6 billion effort to protect the city from flooding during major storms is set to include an 8-mile seawall, home elevations, pump stations and massive surge barriers stretching across waterways.
The city now has more than another decade to go.
Norfolk officials signal changes are necessary for floodwall to move forward

Leaders from Norfolk and its federal partner, the Army Corps of Engineers, updated City Council last week on what is formally called the Coastal Storm Risk Management project.
It’s part of a series of similar projects planned along the East Coast, prompted by the devastation caused during Hurricane Sandy in 2012.
Norfolk is the furthest along, with other floodwalls in the works in cities including Charleston and Miami. Virginia Beach and the Peninsula are also in various stages of the pre-design study process through the Army Corps.
Here are the major updates.
 The project’s cost and timeline are growing.

The current, official price tag for what city leaders call Resilient Norfolk is still $2.6 billion – 65% of which would be covered by the federal government, leaving Norfolk on the hook for about $931 million.
But officials now estimate the cost will rise beyond what Congress approved in 2020.
Mark Haviland, spokesperson with the Army Corps’ Norfolk District, said in an email that “significant analysis was conducted to document the cost drivers and brief our higher headquarters.”
The Corps declined to share that analysis before it’s certified or provide a new cost estimate until the agency gets approval to finalize a related report.
But Haviland said some factors that influence cost include new survey data and hydrologic modeling that identified the need for additional pump stations, and updated designs for the wall’s foundation and transitions with adjoining levees.
“Wall types were also revised to meet updated barge impact requirements and to better fit within an urban setting and avoid impacts to the foundations of existing buildings,” he wrote.
In addition, the team encountered unexpected delays with the real estate certification process, which involves getting permits and legal permission to use land and negotiating agreements with property owners.
“By addressing these details early on, we can avoid costly delays and complications during construction,” Haviland wrote.
The estimated end date for all parts of the project is 2037, five years later than the original timeline.
The first section of the seawall will be constructed from Chesterfield Heights to the Berkley Bridge, with initial site work starting this year. The first surge barrier will cross the mouth of the Lafayette River, with construction beginning around 2029.
 Officials are still seeking changes to who and what in included behind the wall

The current path of the floodwall wraps around downtown, ending at Chesterfield Heights to the east and Lambert’s Point to the west.
That leaves out five historically Black neighborhoods across the river vulnerable to flooding. A coalition of residents on the Southside strongly resisted being excluded from the wall’s protection, and the city and Army Corps agreed to ask the federal government to reevaluate the path.
Two years later, the Norfolk District is still waiting for federal leaders to include such a study in their budget. Army Corps headquarters did not receive it for fiscal year 2025, meaning the earliest it could begin would be next year.
The Army Corps previously told WHRO a study could take around three years and $3 million, though the scope has not yet been developed. The re-evaluation report would also look at adding structural protection for Willoughby Spit.
Meanwhile, many residents of the historic Freemason neighborhood are fighting for the opposite.
Neighbors said they were blindsided by the floodwall plans and argue it will block waterfront views and tank property values.
Newly-approved state study aims to codify Virginia’s coastal resilience funding

Project officials say they’re just beginning to design the segment that includes Freemason, but will consider the community’s feedback and seek federal authorization to modify the path.
Several council members reiterated concerns this week.
“This is not the first time we talked about the authorized alignment in Freemason,” said Mayor Kenny Alexander. “For us, it’s a nonstarter.”
 Some individual homeowners can soon apply for help

One aspect of Resilient Norfolk is what officials call “nonstructural measures.”
That means helping private owners protect their property by elevating homes, filling in flood-prone basements and using floodproofing techniques at commercial properties.
The city said this week that nearly 1,000 properties on Willoughby Spit and the Southside are considered “pre-eligible” for the nonstructural program, which is voluntary.
Officials launched a new tool for people to type in their address and determine eligibility.
Congress authorized the project to include voluntary home buyouts, but the city says there are no plans to do so.

Initially, you’ll be able to catch our audio content on the Pennsylvania Capital-Star’s website and other content channels. We’re also working to establish partnerships with radio stations throughout Pennsylvania. 
Ultimately, our goal is to produce our own podcast as well. 
You can expect news as well as deep dives and investigations that you won’t hear – or read – elsewhere. 
Tim Lambert, editor in chief, and I worked together for several years in public media. And when you’re expanding into new territory and launching initiatives, having established trust and history as colleagues out of the gate is a huge advantage. I also have a track record of finding stories that have been overlooked despite being highly relevant and telling them in an impactful, distinctive way. 
Most recently, I co-created and hosted the longform podcast Obscured through Kouvenda Media. The pilot series focused on survivors of traumatic police encounters and the support – or lack thereof – available to them. 
Before that, I spent several years as a senior reporter for WITF-FM and the statewide Keystone Crossroads collaboration, where I covered everything from refugee resettlement to housing discrimination to Pennsylvania’s redistricting battles to voting rights and election administration. I also created and produced The Context, a daily newsletter, and led investigations into Pennsylvania’s public defense system and other issues affecting communities across the commonwealth that earned awards on the state, regional and national levels.
I came to Pennsylvania, originally, to cover Harrisburg’s debt crisis beat at PennLive after working as a watchdog reporter for The Press of Atlantic City investigating the casino industry and state and local government corruption. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Throughout, my professional goals have been relatively straightforward, even as navigating the industry and the reporting process itself have proven complicated and challenging at times. 
I aim to tell nuanced, engaging stories that expose root causes of persistent problems and help people understand how policies actually affect them. And to add value to the media landscape with contextual, conversational stories that explore important angles otherwise glossed over or missed entirely with reporting that synthesizes history, data, personal narratives, accountability, policy analysis and potential solutions and alternate approaches.
I also believe in meeting audiences where they are, as do the Pennsylvania Capital-Star and States Newsroom. Some of you prefer to read your news, others want to listen during your commute. Still others want quick updates on social media. Recognizing that, the Capital-Star is experimenting with bringing stories to life in different ways. I’m thrilled to be part of the expansion. 
The focus here on connecting people to the power that affects them resonates strongly with me as well. I feel fortunate to be part of an organization committed to delivering fact-based, nuanced, transparent coverage with its audience top-of-mind. 
Thanks for welcoming me to the Pennsylvania Capital-Star team. I am truly excited to be here and can’t wait to share stories with you.
You can reach me at epreviti@penncapital-star.com with tips or if you want to share how policy decisions are affecting your community. I’d love to hear from you.

The couple said that hiring aides to help Jim with everyday tasks in light of his cerebral palsy is “damn near impossible.” (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Last time Jim Piet, who has cerebral palsy, needed to hire a new personal care assistant to help him complete daily tasks, it took four months.
Amid New Hampshire’s tight labor market and low Medicaid reimbursement rates, people with disabilities, like Piet, face challenges hiring the help they need. And for people with unique needs, this can be difficult, isolating, and exhausting.
‘Damn near impossible’
“I need help for everything,” Piet said.
Piet, who uses a motorized wheelchair, has a personal care assistant, or PCA, to help him get out of bed, shower, and get dressed, and to prepare meals and drive him places. Those everyday services, among others, are paid for through Medicaid.
Piet worked for 29 years, first with the University of New Hampshire’s Institute on Disability, then for New Hampshire’s vocational rehabilitation program as a public relations specialist. He also holds a bachelor’s degree from Southern New Hampshire University and a master’s degree from Springfield College. He lives in Concord with his wife, Pat, who also has cerebral palsy.
“Finding warm bodies is hard,” Pat Piet said. “Finding warm bodies that can actually do the job is nearly impossible.”
Cerebral palsy can manifest differently for different people. For example, Piet uses a wheelchair while his wife doesn’t. For some, cerebral palsy causes developmental delay and intellectual disability. For Piet, it’s just physical. That’s why he hires PCAs as opposed to direct support professionals, or DSPs, another common type of aide who, instead of simply assisting their client with tasks, also guides them, attempts to teach them how to do things for themself, and seeks to assist them with tasks they can’t do for cognitive or developmental reasons. The Piets said there’s a lot of overlap between the two professions.
“A lot of times, especially if we get someone who worked as a DSP, they’re used to being the one who prompts, the one who directs,” Pat Piet said. “They come in to help Jim and Jim’s just throwing out orders one after another. They do not know how to deal with that.”
“Most people are not used to working with someone with a master’s degree,” he added.
They said part of the challenge in finding aides is the job’s difficulty. It requires physical strength to lift clients out of bed, into wheelchairs, and throughout their homes, but Pat Piet noted it also requires “soft skills.”
“I think DSPs and PCAs are some of the most difficult jobs,” she said. “They almost require a degree in psychology. They require you to be able to read people, to be able to prompt someone effectively, to understand Jim is not someone with an intellectual disability, so it’s a different approach.”
Despite this, the jobs pay relatively low wages. Granite State Independent Living, one of the state’s largest agencies hiring DSPs and PCAs, has job postings with wages from $18 to $22 per hour. Those jobs do not require a high school diploma or nursing license.
“You can make almost as much money working retail,” Pat Piet said. “And retail does not require the same amounts of soft skills and emotional and physical investment.”
Jim Piet has two vendors who help him hire his aides: Granite State Independent Living and GT Independence. He said GT Independence pays aides better, but Granite State Independent Living provides better support.
“It’s a double-edged sword,” he said.
He said they often get people incapable of doing the job or who “bring (their) own baggage.” Sometimes caretakers don’t act appropriately when he’s in the community, he said, and treat him like “a charity case.”
“I always cringe when people talk about how emotionally satisfying the job is,” Pat Piet said. “You want to enjoy going to work. You want to get something emotionally out of it. But I feel like when we advertise that, we tend to get people who are emotionally needy and are looking to the person they’re caring for to fill that gap. … This is a job. You get your emotional needs met from friends and family, not at your job.”
They also feel frustrated that people often ask why Pat can’t simply take care of Jim. They note that she has had a career of her own that has required her to go into the office at times he needs help. Jim also said he wants Pat to just be his wife and not rely on her constantly. Still she helps him with his tasks when they absolutely can’t find an aide.
All of these factors make recruiting and retaining good aides “damn near impossible,” Pat Piet said.
Louis Esposito is the executive director of ABLE NH, an advocacy and support group for people with disabilities. He said the struggles the Piets face are common in the disability community.
“They are making below what you would make at Dunkin’ Donuts or Target with the exceptionally high skill level that’s required, and patience that’s needed,” he said. “It’s been very challenging to find anybody.” 
Esposito said he’s heard from people with disabilities that they’ve resorted to paying aides out of pocket to supplement low wages. This presents financial hardship and is only possible for wealthier families.
“If you hire somebody at $14, $15 an hour and they’re there for a couple of years, you want to be able to give them a raise or more income or you lose them,” he said. 
Part of the reason wages are so low for these roles centers around Medicaid reimbursement rates. Medicaid covers this care by reimbursing agencies who provide it. However, the rate at which they reimburse is determined by the state and federal governments and it can vary greatly depending on the type of care provided.
However, Esposito feels it’s more than just financials. He believes the role deserves more respect and “should be treated as a profession.”
“Right now, it’s kind of a job,” he said. “It has to be treated as something more powerful, and it’s not really respected as a long-term profession.”
Esposito formerly worked with Opportunity Networks, which provides services to people with disabilities.
“We would hire and support DSPs,” he said. “They would get trained, you’d put a lot of energy and effort, and they would be fantastic. And then they want to start a family, or they want to proceed with their education. They want to advance. And there’s not a lot of room for growth. So I think until we start respecting this as a field that needs to be given the right respect, I think we’re gonna keep seeing this.”
‘Not up to par’
North Country Independent Living, based in North Conway, operates several homes for people with developmental disabilities and those dealing with the effects of traumatic brain injuries. Patsy Sherry owns and operates the agency with her husband, and they hire DSPs to care for their residents.
“I spend all this money on Indeed,” she said, referring to the job-listing website. “And I’ll schedule interviews, and a lot of times people don’t even show up. They don’t even bother to call to say they’re not coming.”



Gov. Ayotte, the budget, and Medicaid reimbursement rates
Gov. Kelly Ayotte has made services for people with disabilities a key aspect of her agenda during the state’s ongoing budget process. Her budget proposal included $1 billion over two years to ensure there’s no waitlist for anyone trying to receive services for developmental disabilities at facilities like North Country Independent Living or Opportunity Networks.
However, when it became their turn to amend the budget, state lawmakers in the House made significant cuts to that and included a provision that reduced Medicaid reimbursement rates by 3%, which could lower DSP and PCA wages. After public outcry and Ayotte’s urging, the Senate Finance Committee reversed those cuts. Once the full Senate approves its version of the budget, the two chambers will enter committees of conference to hash out the differences between their budgets, including this Medicaid cut. It’s unclear whether the House will agree to reverse this cut during that process.
While she disagreed with the House’s cuts to the reimbursement rate, Ayotte said she doesn’t think a rate increase is on the table for this budget cycle. She said her priority, during this difficult fiscal environment for the state, “was to protect eligibility, to make sure that we don’t have a disability wait list.” She said the current rates are based on a rate study, and said that she wants to reevaluate those rates in the next budget cycle for state fiscal years 2028-29.
“People with disabilities was one of the priorities in my budget,” she said. “And it will continue to be a priority of mine.”



Operating in rural northern New Hampshire means there’s a smaller population to pull from when hiring, she explained. She said they’ve recently increased their starting pay to around $19 an hour. A couple years ago they were paying between $13 and $14 per hour. They now have about 75 employees and are short four full-timers.
“The people that we do get, unfortunately, aren’t — I don’t know how to really say this — they’re not up to par as what we were used to,” she said. “I’m interviewing people that don’t even have GEDs. … Some people that we’ve had come in don’t even have computer skills, and they’re struggling to get through the basic training.”
Fortunately, she has employees who appreciate overtime pay so they help cover gaps left by vacancies. She and the rest of management also step in sometimes.
George Barrett is the associate director at Opportunity Networks, which offers day programming for people with developmental disabilities in Nashua, Bedford, and Amherst. 
“Forty years I’ve been doing this, there’s always been a workforce issue,” Barrett said. “It’s never been as bad as it has been since COVID.”
These challenges, which he also attributed to low pay and the challenging nature of the job, mean they sometimes don’t have the staff to accept new participants, he explained. This means families remain on their waitlist. He noted the majority of their families are middle class, and by not having their loved ones in services, they often must forgo work opportunities to care for them.
“We’ve had staff that have started and have lasted two weeks, and then, due to the demand, have left,” he said, “because they’re seeing the stress and duress that they’re under.”
Barrett said Medicaid comprises nearly 100% of their income, and around 80% of the Medicaid dollars they receive goes directly to staff. In January 2024, when they received a 7% increase, the last time they did, the entirety of that money went to DSPs’ paychecks, he said. Still, that hasn’t kept up with inflation or market changes. He said he’s reached out to state and federal leaders urging them to approve more rate increases, because their current rate — which he called “not even a livable wage” — makes it challenging to compete with other industries for workers.
“In many cases, it’s almost desperation,” he said. “You look at who can you take?”
He said this leads to lower-quality candidates, which “opens the door” for abuse and neglect.
“We haven’t seen that here,” he said. “But, yes, it does. The individuals we work with are, in my opinion, the most vulnerable citizens in the state of New Hampshire. Exploitation is there, because in a lot of cases, they can’t speak up for themselves or defend themselves.”
Barrett called it “a catch-22.”
“You try your best to vet individuals,” he said. “But at the same time, too many vendors are kind of desperate to get staff, to get individuals in service.”
Still, Barrett praised the staff he does have.
“Without them, services like ours do not exist because they do 100% of the work in terms of working with the individuals,” he said. “In essence, individual lives with disabilities are more so in the hands of our direct support professionals. So I can’t give enough credit. And again, I will say they are definitely underpaid.”
While people report struggling to hire DSPs and PCAs nationwide, New Hampshire’s tight labor market makes the problem especially acute. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce ranks New Hampshire as having the most severe worker shortage in the country. As of 2023, the most recent data available, there were only 28 available workers for every 100 open jobs in the state.
Phil Sletten, an economist and research director at the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, pointed out that the size of the labor force — the number of people working or looking for work — still hasn’t recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, the labor force was about 777,300 people, but in 2024 it was roughly 771,600.
“So there has been some labor force recovery from the low point after the pandemic, which was in 2021, but that labor force recovery has not been complete,” Sletten said.
This makes it difficult to hire for any job in New Hampshire. As for DSPs and PCAs specifically, Sletten concurred that low pay was hurting the ability to hire.
As of June 2024, home health and personal care aides — which includes people who take care of anyone, not just those with disabilities — in New Hampshire earn a median hourly wage of $17.27, according to New Hampshire Employment Security. Across all professions, the median wage is $25.01.
“Home health and care aides who may be facing either a financial constraint at home or a more complex environment relative to their own position may be looking for other opportunities,” Sletten said. “And with a higher median wage among all occupations in the state, there may be other opportunities that offer them more compensation.”

‘I can’t change the world if I can’t get out of bed’
Kathy Bates, who lives in her own house in Somersworth and has cerebral palsy, is another who struggles to hire DSPs, which are vital to her day-to-day life.
“Without them, I couldn’t work,” Bates said. “I couldn’t even get out of bed.”
Bates has DSPs come help her a few times a day. They come in the morning to help her get out of bed, shower, dress, get into her wheelchair, and do other tasks. They come again in the afternoon and at night as well. They keep her “connected to the community” by allowing her to get out of her house.
“I really couldn’t live a good life without them,” she said. “I’m not saying I need help with everything, but I need to get out of bed, I need to get my day started before I can make anything happen.”
Bates arranges to hire these aides herself, which takes a long time. She often has people call out sick at the last minute, she said, and has to find coverage when they want to take time off. She keeps a list on her bedside table with names of people to contact if someone calls out the morning of.
“Managing personal care is a full-time job sometimes,” she said. “You want to be a good boss, but I have to bug people. I don’t like bugging people.”
She said this inconsistency means many people with disabilities are afraid to get jobs because they worry they won’t be able to get out of bed every day and have someone to drive them to work.
“There’s this huge untapped workforce out there,” she said.
Bates has a few methods of hiring aides. Sometimes she puts ads on Craig’s List. Sometimes she uses agencies like Granite State Independent Living and GT Independence.
“Coming through the door is like 50% of the interview,” she said.
She often sets up interviews and they never show up. Additionally, many of the candidates who inquire are elderly, which is a problem because it’s a physically demanding job. After someone is hired, there’s a weekslong process of paperwork for Medicaid, background checks, and other administration. Still, she’s grateful for her aides.
“I’m glad I do have the women that work for me,” she said. “I’m really glad that they’re as flexible as they are.”
Bates is also active in advocacy within the disability community. She grew up before the Americans with Disabilities Act, so she remembers what it was like to have a disability before ADA protections, and she wants to continue making the world a better place for people with disabilities. To do so, she leads trainings for medical professionals about working with people with disabilities at the UNH Institute on Disability. She also writes a blog on disability called “From Where I Sit.” And she’s an accessibility and inclusion specialist on the Self Advocacy Leadership Team, a task force within the New Hampshire Council on Developmental Disabilities that seeks to find solutions for problems facing the disability community.
The work gives Bates a lot of joy and fulfillment. She emphasized how none of it is possible without her caretakers.

There are many things that state leaders should do these days to improve the UNC System. Providing adequate funds to hire and retain topflight faculty and reining in out-of-control professional sports programs would be a good start.
Unfortunately, at present, the emphasis in Raleigh is on advancing a right-wing political agenda, and so it is that state House Republicans have approved a bill to give a local far right propaganda outfit — a group founded by conservative financier and activist Art Pope known as the Martin Center for Academic Renewal — a role in crafting university admissions policies.
And it’s hard to overstate just how big a mistake this is. For more than 25 years, the Martin Center has spewed a steady stream of far right attacks on almost all of the best aspects of modern higher education in an effort to turn back the clock on progress.
The bottom line: As is the case in so many areas of higher education, lawmakers should leave admissions to the professionals and tell conservative advocacy groups to stay in their own lane.

For years, states have taxed hospitals and other health care providers to draw down federal matching funds and help finance their Medicaid programs. Now, states may lose their ability to raise or implement new taxes. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)The tax and spending bill the U.S. House approved last week targets a strategy states have used to boost the Medicaid dollars they get from the federal government. The measure would cap or freeze the taxes states levy on medical providers, potentially leaving states with major holes in their Medicaid budgets.
As a result, states would face the choice of either replacing the lost federal money with state dollars, scaling back services or providing coverage to fewer people.
Medicaid is a joint state-federal program, primarily for people with low incomes. For the traditional Medicaid population — children and their caregivers, people with disabilities and pregnant women — the federal government matches state Medicaid spending on a sliding scale, ranging from 50% for the wealthiest states to 77% for the poorest ones.
Consider a state that gets half of its Medicaid funding from the federal government. If that state collects $100 million by taxing providers, it can use $50 million of the revenue to draw down $50 million in federal matching funds, which it can use to expand Medicaid coverage to more people. Then it can take the remaining $50 million in revenue and use that money to draw down $50 million in federal dollars to pay providers more for caring for Medicaid patients.
Children’s health services could see trims even under scaled-back Medicaid cuts

Forty-nine states — all but Alaska — use the strategy. In 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, states relied on provider taxes to fund 17% of their Medicaid spending, up from 7% in 2008, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
As part of their effort to cut federal Medicaid spending by roughly $625 billion over the next decade, House Republicans have proposed capping the state provider taxes and freezing them in place, preventing states from raising them or implementing new ones in response to inflation. Under current law, states can levy taxes of up to 6% on tax providers’ net revenue. The GOP measure also would add work requirements for Medicaid recipients, a step that would save money by reducing the rolls.
A report from the Congressional Budget Office, the bipartisan research arm of Congress, says eliminating the taxes entirely could save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.
Many conservatives say the taxes are an accounting trick that allows states to draw down money from the federal government without having to front their true share of the Medicaid program. Some have even called the provider taxes a “money laundering” scheme.
“States are gaming the system — creating complex tax schemes that shift their responsibility to invest in Medicaid and rob federal taxpayers,” Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said in a May 12 news release.
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that is working with Republicans to formulate Medicaid cuts, described provider taxes as “a way that states and providers can rip off the federal government.”
“States need to have some accountability for the spending in their programs,” Blase said.
States that enshrined Medicaid expansion in their constitutions could be in a bind

But advocates of these taxes, including state Medicaid directors and even the hospitals that pay the taxes, describe them as legal and legitimate financial tools that have helped providers cover essential services and states fund their Medicaid programs for years. The result of eliminating these taxes or freezing them, they say, will be hospital closures and service cuts.
“We don’t like to pay these taxes, but the alternative is resources or access to care aren’t there for that community,” said Jason Pray, vice president of legislative affairs at America’s Essential Hospitals, an association representing about 350 hospitals. “The state would more than likely have to then tax individuals to make up for that, to keep the services at the same level and keep the resources at the same level.”
Blase said the provider taxes allow hospitals to make windfall profits from the additional federal matching funds that flow back to them, representing a type of “corporate welfare.”
But Pray said often hospitals in his association are losing money. By allowing states to boost payments to hospitals and other providers that serve Medicaid patients, he said, the tax enables hospitals to stay open in the long run, not garner a windfall.
Pray also noted that in the past, support for the taxes has been bipartisan.
“Republicans for years have shown they support provider taxes and have understood the value of them,” he said.

Edwin Park, a research professor at the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy, pointed out that some hospitals pay the tax and don’t get much back, because they serve few Medicaid patients. The hospitals that benefit most are the so-called safety net hospitals that do care for many low-income patients, he said.
Park said he is worried that once the strategy is off the table, states will have to cut their Medicaid spending to balance their budgets.
Jay Ludlam, deputy secretary for North Carolina Medicaid, is worried about that, too. In North Carolina, Ludlam said, almost all of the tax revenue the state collects from providers helps pay for Medicaid services.
“The money goes to providers when they provide services. It’s not special. It’s just another way that states tax themselves and put money into the program,” Ludlam told Stateline. “If it means that there’s going to be less money in Medicaid … we’ll have to cut eligibility, cut benefits, cut provider rates, in order to maintain the program.”

The news comes after years of state officials spending billions on economic growth programs tilted heavily toward the wealthy.
It might seem ironic, but Ohio’s economy added jobs in April even as unemployment continued to grow. That’s because job growth isn’t keeping up with the numbers joining the workforce. And there are reasons to believe that things will get worse, according to the think tank Policy Matters Ohio.
Data released last week by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services estimated that the state added 22,200 jobs in April. But statewide unemployment rose for the fifth consecutive month, to 4.9%. That’s the sixth-highest of any state, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Heather Smith, a researcher at Policy Matters Ohio, said the new state data raise some questions.
“The civilian labor force has increased at about the same rate as the number of unemployed workers, suggesting that while more Ohioans are entering the job market, they are not all securing employment,” she said in a written statement. “This raises questions around the reported increases in jobs across service-providing industries – why aren’t Ohioans getting hired?”
The Department of Job and Family Services conducts a monthly survey, releases its estimate of the number of new jobs, and then often revises it downward. For example, it initially estimated that 7,500 jobs were created in March, and then cut that number to 5,200.
Of the jobs thought to be created in April, the great majority were in the service sector, 18,800. More than 6,500 of those were in hospitality as those businesses staff up for summer.
Construction and manufacturing added 1,200 and 1,100 jobs, respectively, while the number of government jobs increased by 1,300.
A separate household survey indicated that 15,000 joined the Ohio job market in April. But only 6,000 found jobs while the rest were unemployed.
“Legislators ought to pay attention to the growing unemployment rate, given its steady increase over the last five months,” Smith said. “The last time we saw the unemployment rate in Ohio decrease was between September and October – prior to the November election.”
Ohio’s economy has lagged for more than a decade after the creation of billion-dollar programs mostly benefitting the well off on the promise that they would create jobs for average Ohioans.
Created in 2013 under the auspices of then-Gov. John Kasich, the LLC tax loophole costs about $1 billion a year. 
It was sold as a way to boost small business. But an analysis showed that hiring in that sector has fallen relative to other states, while the wealthiest 7% are claiming nearly 40% of the benefit.
Started around the same time, JobsOhio is funded through a state liquor franchise that used to flow into state coffers. Its well-paid staff has grown rapidly as it has doled out more than $1 billion in incentives to businesses. But it hasn’t proven that those incentives have created any jobs. 
Controversial ‘private corporation’ JobsOhio gets billions more without paying more to state

Even so, the Ohio Controlling Board in February extended JobsOhio’s control of the state liquor franchise to 2053. The “private” corporation paid the state $1.41 billion for its initial lease of the franchise. But the state didn’t require an additional penny to extend it another 15 years.
Meanwhile, Smith of Policy Matters Ohio warned that several developments at the federal level could further drag down the Ohio job market.
“A recent survey of Fourth District businesses by the Federal Reserve of Cleveland found that 22% of respondents anticipated the tariffs would force them to decrease their staff,” she wrote. “This is already underway: Several large employers across the state have submitted mass layoff notices, including 744 manufacturing jobs in Fremont. A Chillicothe paper plant, which was set to layoff 826 union workers by the end of June, agreed to remain open until December. While this buys impacted Ohioans a bit more time, the plant closing will be a devastating hit to workers in the area.”
In addition to potential harm from tariffs, the Trump administration is trying to cut hundreds of thousands of federal jobs and to slash services as it tries to fund further tax cuts.
“Ohio policymakers need to hold their federal counterparts accountable for the impact of funding cuts on the state and stop preemptively cutting critical public services with trigger language in the state budget,” Smith said. “If federal budget hawks get their way and force the state to pick up a greater share of the Medicaid budget, proposed trigger language could cut off the health insurance of 770,000 Ohioans.”

[…]","Flood debris piles left in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene in Bat Cave, North Carolina. (Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images)A North Carolina-based firm that submitted a bid to manage the state’s Hurricane Helene homebuilding program is alleging that its proposal was improperly disqualified.
IEM International, which is based in Morrisville, said in a statement to NC Newsline that it had filed a complaint with the NC Department of Commerce, which oversaw the contract process. And the firm is seeking to have the critical contract re-bid.
“The decision to disqualify IEM’s compliant proposal without review or scoring is highly irregular and concerning,” the firm said in its statement.
The NC Department of Commerce did not respond to a request for comment sent Friday.
State officials awarded the contract earlier this month to Horne LLP, a Mississippi-based company, for $81.5 million. The firm is charged with implementing a $1.4 billion federal housing grant and overseeing multiple construction contractors to rebuild from the deadliest storm in state history.
Horne’s selection has already drawn scrutiny from state lawmakers after the firm’s previous contract, part of a troubled rebuild process in eastern North Carolina, was not renewed.
IEM was one of four other bidders on the state’s solicitation for Helene. But its bid was deemed “non-responsive” due to inadequate financial information, according to state officials and documents.
“The vendor did not submit required financial documentation, and per DCR’s legal analysis, it was deemed non-responsive,” according to a memo from the department. That same memo shows that IEM’s bid was not formally graded.
IEM said in their statement that the firm “approached this (solicitation) with the seriousness it deserves,” and had provided “three years of audited financial data.”
A copy of IEM’s full offer, obtained by NC Newsline through public records request, includes a page that details the firm’s balance sheet, income statement and cash flow data from three fiscal years.
The firm checked “yes” when asked if the financial figures were based on audited statements. Under a section of the bid asking for a link to annual reports, the firm wrote: “As a privately owned company, IEM’s financial statements are not public. IEM can provide to DCR upon request.”
Financial details for Horne, whose bid was awarded and also obtained through public records, were redacted. The firm appears to have included pages of consolidated financial statements from 2022 and 2021 in an appendix to its bid.
Stephanie McGarrah, who leads the Department of Commerce division tasked with Helene recovery, told lawmakers on Thursday that she was “personally very disappointed” about the result of IEM’s bid.
“There are very few vendors in this space, and they had partners we were familiar with,” McGarrah said.
And asked if she would re-bid the contract with the knowledge of a recent settlement agreement by Horne, McGarrah said she would not.
“I do think we made the right decision,” she said.
IEM’s proposed partners included Deloitte, Fahe, and Tetra Tech, according to the bid. And the firm had proposed tapping multiple partners based locally in western North Carolina: B-K Construction and Brucemont Communications.
According to North Carolina’s administrative rules, a bidder can submit a protest within 30 days of an award being granted, detailing their reasoning and supporting documents.
That protest is received by the “executive officer” for the department that made the purchase — in this case, Commerce. That official can determine the protest is “meritless” and refuse a protest meeting within 10 days.
If the protest meeting is granted, it will be scheduled within 30 days of the bidder’s request.
Details of the decision, regardless of outcome, are sent to the state purchasing officer, David O’Neal.
IEM, which has contracts globally, has worked with the state before. The firm won a bid in 2018, after Hurricane Matthew.
Three years later, it sued ReBuild NC, the troubled office that oversaw hurricane recovery in eastern North Carolina, for failing to pay related to contract work. That case was settled outside of court.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/27/ct-budget-modest-investments/,Will CT Democrats accept a budget that makes far more modest investments in health care and social services than they promised?,"Gov. Ned Lamont and legislative leaders cleared a big hurdle last week on their way to adopting a new state budget when they compromised on the spending cap.
Another key obstacle was removed Friday when the administration struck a last-minute deal to avert strikes at 51 nursing homes and 193 group homes for clients with developmental disabilities.
But with nine days remaining in the regular 2025 session, one challenge remains. 
Will rank-and-file Democrats in House and Senate majorities accept a new two-year state budget that makes far more modest investments in health care, social services and special education than they promised to deliver just a few months ago?
And if so, how will they explain that as Connecticut wraps this fiscal year in five weeks with the second-largest surplus in state history — its eighth consecutive robust finish?
“I’d be surprised if we didn’t have [a budget deal] done in the next couple of days,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Monday, adding that he expects the “vast majority” of Democratic legislators will support what leaders negotiate with the Lamont administration. “You might get a few people who can’t get there.”
Those who fall into that last category likely are those with good memories.
Legislators asked to temper increases for Medicaid, social services
Democratic leaders pledged Jan. 28 at the Capitol to dramatically increase the state’s Medicaid payments to providers who treat the poor, a rate schedule that hasn’t been revised comprehensively since 2007. Critics say thousands of low-income residents effectively are uninsured or underinsured, unable to find physicians willing to treat them.
A 2019 analysis by KFF, the health care think-tank formerly known as Kaiser Family Foundation, found that Connecticut’s Medicaid rates for most specialists ranked 42nd among all states while those paid to primary care doctors ranked 22nd.
Democrats pledged to boost rates roughly 75% by increasing annual funding by $250 million over four years, beginning with a $75 million infusion in 2026.
Ritter didn’t provide full details of ongoing budget talks but confirmed that target would be scaled back considerably.
The compromise on Medicaid funding “is probably the one that is most disappointing,” said the speaker, who noted that for every $1 in spending Connecticut cuts in this area, it loses roughly 50 cents in federal reimbursement. “We’re just leaving money on the table.”
That’s because while Lamont recently agreed to exceed the constitutional spending cap, which keeps budget growth in line with household income and inflation, this fiscal year, normal cap limits come back in force in the coming biennium.
The cap creates a similar challenge for those legislators worried about the private nonprofit agencies that deliver the bulk of state-sponsored services to clients with developmental disabilities, mental health and addiction issues, and those re-entering society after incarceration.
The industry, which misses out on hundreds of millions annually through state payments that haven’t matched inflation for decades, asked for a $264 million increase next fiscal year and another $237 million on top of that in 2026-27.
Legislative leaders won’t come close to those numbers in the final budget.
Ritter said it should hold funding flat in the first year and add about $76 million in 2026-27.
The industry also will get more funds because Lamont struck a deal Friday to avert strikes at nursing homes and group homes. That agreement calls for the state to spend $149 million over the next two fiscal years combined on social service agencies running group homes, according to SEIU 1199 NE, the state’s largest health care workers’ union. 
But those funds would be dedicated only to employees’ wages and benefits and only for nonprofits serving clients with developmental disabilities.
Will rank-and-file lawmakers accept these more modest investments in Medicaid and social services?
Rep. Jillian Gilchrest, D-West Hartford, co-chairwoman of the Human Services Committee and one of the leaders who pitched the big Medicaid investment in late January, said it will hinge on the final budget totals leaders negotiate with Lamont. In other words, will the proposed funding still be enough to make a difference?
“I don’t think the caucus will accept an austere … Medicaid increase or nonprofit increase,” she said, adding that it’s hard to accept in this era of big budget surpluses.
Since resetting its budget caps in 2017, Connecticut has closed the last seven fiscal years with an average surplus of $1.8 billion, which represents 8% of the General Fund. That cushion is even larger considering about three-quarters of the budget involves wages, benefits, Medicaid, debt service and other fixed costs.
This year’s projected surplus approaches $2.4 billion or 10% of the General Fund. And analysts estimate the state will continue to save more than $1 billion annually through at least 2028.
The state has been using those funds to accelerate paying down a huge pension debt amassed between 1939 and 2010. But increasing numbers of legislators are questioning whether one generation is being overburdened to solve a problem created by three.
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, co-chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, also finds it hard to accept Connecticut can’t afford to do more to help vulnerable residents. 
She declined to predict how rank-and-file legislators would embrace the final, negotiated budget but said many of her colleagues are ready to invest more in Medicaid and social services.
“They have been some of the top topics that people are concerned about,” she said, adding that special education falls into that category as well.
More funding for K-12 schools, no ECS cuts
A special education funding crisis in local schools sparked legislators from both parties to defy Lamont earlier this year and approve an extra $40 million for K-12 districts, despite warnings from the governor this would push current finances over a cap that keeps budget growth in line with household income and inflation.
Legislators and Lamont ultimately compromised and used an accounting gimmick that first moved the $40 million for special education outside of the formal budget — and the spending cap system — and then transferred funds to K-12 districts. 
The Appropriations Committee in late April recommended continuing that $40 million in extra funding — and adding another $84 million — in each of the next two fiscal years.
Ritter said leaders will maintain the $40 million increase approved this year but can add only about $35 million to it because of the cap.
At the same time, however, the new budget is expected to add roughly $26 million over the coming biennium to ensure no K-12 school districts receives less Education Cost Sharing funding. The ECS program offers the state’s chief operating grant for municipal school districts.
Ritter predicted that city and town leaders in general would be pleased with the municipal aid package lawmakers were able to negotiate with the governor.
Lamont, a fiscal moderate who has called the spending cap “sacrosanct,” repeatedly has urged lawmakers to embrace budget caps to avoid the huge deficits and large tax hikes that dominated the 2010s.
Connecticut, which still has more than $35 billion in unfunded pension liabilities, has dedicated about $8.6 billion toward reducing pension debt since 2020.
“We appreciate the legislature being collaborative throughout the budget process in the closing weeks of the session,” the governor’s communications director, Rob Blanchard, said Monday. “The governor looks forward to signing an honestly balanced budget that makes smart investments in the future without raising taxes.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_0399.jpg,,,2025-05-27 06:09:15.769660

A bill that would require the Chancellor of Higher Education to create the Hunger-Free Campus Grant Program had supporter testimony last week in the Ohio House Workforce and Higher Education Committee meeting.

The program would award hunger-free campus grants which could, for example, create an on-campus food pantry or a partnership with a local bank, provide students information about SNAP, have an emergency assistance grant available to students, or have a student meal plan credit donation program.
Ohio House Reps. Sean Patrick Brennan, D-Parma, and Jim Hoops, R-Napoleon, introduced Ohio House Bill 157, which had 15 people submit supporter testimony. H.B. 157 would appropriate $625,000 for fiscal year 2026 and 2027 for the program. 
“The Hunger Free Campus Act would incentivize colleges and universities to establish basic needs programs, like an on-site food pantry or emergency assistance grant program as well as connecting students to resources,” said Sarah Kuhns, external affairs manager of the Ohio Association of Foodbanks.  
The Ohio Association of Foodbanks has worked with more than 30 Ohio colleges and universities to create food pantries or distribute food to students struggling with food insecurity, she said. 
“Throughout our network’s engagement on the issue of college student hunger, it has been clear that the approach has been patchwork, leading institutions to establish basic needs programs only if they have the connections, the will and the funds to do so,” Kuhns said. 
Students who are unable to meet their basic needs are more likely to have a hard time in class, take longer to finish their degree or drop out, Kuhns said. 
Some food pantries on Ohio’s college campuses said they are interested in providing microwaves and stoves near the pantry, so commuter students or those with limited access to a kitchen can cook the items they receive from the pantry, she said. 
State Rep. Tom Young, R-Washington Twp., was surprised that food insecurity on college campuses is an issue. 
“I don’t have anyone coming up and saying, ‘We have students starving on campus and things like that.’ I just can’t get my head around it,” he said. “Why is this such a big issue that no one knows anything about?” 
In response, Kuhns said food insecurity is often an invisible problem. 
About 23% of college students experienced food insecurity in 2020 and 59% of food-insecure students potentially eligible for SNAP did not report receiving benefits, according to a report released last summer by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
State Rep. Tracy Richardson, R-Marysville, asked what population of students are experiencing food insecurity and Kuhns said this affects all demographics of students — commuter, non-traditional, and those living on campus. 
Deacon Nick Bates, director of the Hunger Network in Ohio, said he regularly hears from campus ministries about the growing need to help food insecure students across Ohio. 
“Students cannot learn hungry,” Bates said. “Food insecurity on college campuses leads to lower GPA’s and lower completion rates.” 
Sophie Gephardt, a graduate social work student at Ohio State University, talked to students facing food insecurity last year when she did her undergraduate thesis on food insecurity experiences of Ohio State social worker students. 
“Some common themes included poor diet quality impacting energy and health, concerns about rising food costs, and overall constant stress and mental health concerns due to food insecurity,” she said. “The Enact the Hunger-Free Campus Act would be incredibly beneficial to getting students connected to resources that they so desperately need.”
Meeting students’ basic needs leads to higher retention and graduation rates, said Stephanie Dodd, executive director at Community Campus Coalition. 
“These outcomes contribute directly to Ohio’s workforce development priorities and long-term economic growth,” she said.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)Republican leaders in Columbus are floating the idea of attempting to make it more difficult to amend the state constitution, a proposal that was defeated in 2023 by Ohioans across the political spectrum.
Issue 1, decided on Aug. 8, 2023, sent a bipartisan message, say those who worked against its passage.
“Ohioans of all walks of life — Democrat, Republican, independent, labor, business, rural, urban — said, ‘Why are you doing this?'” said union leader and president of AFL-CIO Tim Burga after the election.
Issue 1 would have taken away majority rule in Ohio. The proposed constitutional amendment would have raised the threshold for constitutional amendments to pass from 50%+1, a simple majority, to 60%. It was defeated 57-43%.
But some Republican leaders have floated a rerun, saying special interest groups have been pushing their agendas, and constitutional amendment proposals have gotten out of control.
“A warning that I had a few years ago; we’re going to see a real uptick, I believe, in, people attempting to legislate by constitutional amendment,” Secretary of State Frank LaRose said during a ballot board meeting this May.
LaRose recently raised red flags about two new issues collecting signatures to get on the ballot: one to abolish property taxes and another to end qualified immunity, protecting police and other government agencies from lawsuits.
“That’s not a great way to govern a state, and [I think] that legislation should be done by the legislature,” LaRose said. “I think that’s something to be discussed in this building going forward.”
House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, wants to change the rule, too — having said for years that it’s too easy to change state law.
“Good government folks want it raised to 60%,” he said in early May. “I think that it should be.”
Ohio Education Association President Scott DiMauro was one of the leading voices against raising the threshold back in 2023.
“When the people of Ohio are confronted with a choice, either protect your freedom and your ability to exercise your rights in our democracy or give more power to power hungry, corrupt politicians — the people of Ohio are going to say, ‘We want to have the freedom to choose our destiny,'” DiMauro told WEWS on Friday.
People deserve a voice, DiMauro said.
“It’s from people that are just frustrated that they believe that their elected representatives and senators in Columbus just are simply unresponsive to their needs and interests,” he said. “People will take matters into their own hands.”
Putting the question back on the ballot would have the same result, he said.
Huffman acknowledged this, saying that it would be an uphill battle and unpopular.
“Short of everybody steps back and says, ‘We really should raise the limit,’ which I don’t see that happening,” he said. “I don’t think that’s a reality.”
Some lawmakers, like state Rep. Thomas Hall, R-Madison Township, still think it’s a good idea to try again.
Former Speaker Jason Stephens, R-Kitts Hill, disagreed.
“First and foremost, the Legislature works for the people,” he said in a text. “Changing the current method of holding the legislature accountable when it acts (or does not act) would require consensus across the political spectrum as to what those rules should be… Recent history has shown the effort will not be successful.”
Said DiMauro, “The people have spoken, and they spoke pretty loudly and pretty clearly. I wish they would start listening to the people.”

(Illustration by tolgart/Getty Images)ChatGPT has taken a couple of steps closer toward becoming a Kansas Reflector opinion columnist.
The last time I asked the artificial intelligence chatbot to write a column about Kansas politics, in December 2022, it couldn’t connect to current articles online. ChatGPT produced a generic and inoffensive piece: “There is much more to Kansas than meets the eye,” and so on.
When I asked it to write about the 2025 state legislative session on Monday, a better column resulted, citing both current events and web sources (including the Reflector).
 “Advocates must continue to push for increased education funding, expanded health care access, and the protection of civil rights,” it pontificated.

Yet something was still missing.
In the two-and-a-half years between those two columns, the AI sector has exploded. New models have made their debuts, and big tech has sunk billions of dollars into making them smarter than ever. Yet the promise that I once wrote about has been replaced — for me — by a nagging sense that AI still falls woefully short and poses profound risks for the globe. The problem of hallucinations has not only persisted, but grown worse. Too few people have given serious through to where we’re all headed.
No one invests in these large language models to create robotic columnists. Yet the job of synthesizing current events and adding context or perspective would seem well suited to artificial intelligence. For good or ill (probably good, given my hope to remain employed), ChatGPT has shown little improvement in writing memorable prose. Its sentences read like so much baby food, mushed and mushed again into a smooth paste.
The code underlying this current brand of AI offers an explanation. These “large language models” train on text generated by human beings and generate responses based on probability. Words follow other words thanks to statistical calculation. The addition of real-time web searching improves the experience, but blandness persists.
These models can be more interesting to read about than use. For example, researchers don’t entirely understand why current AI technology works at all.
Perhaps that’s why computer gurus hold AI in such reverence. The rest of us, though, deal with its real-world shortcomings. Last year, I wrote about a particularly gnarly hallucination in which ChatGPT insisted that my last name — created by my husband and I in 2010 — had deep historical origins. Those lies irritated me, and I wrote a column venting my frustration.
These days, an identical query results in a much smarter response. The bot refers to my piece, for one thing.
This kind of improvement can’t be denied. Yet it only happened because a human being noticed the mistake and fussed about it. If I had not noticed, if I had not written the column, there was no reason to expect that the model would improve. And this points to the fundamental, continuing limitation of large language models: They only know what they’ve been taught and can infer from such data. They can’t imagine, create or desire new experiences. They only reflect what has gone before.
At the same time, I wouldn’t grow too comfortable. A growing cadre of scientists warn that AI could lead to devastating outcomes — and not from boredom. They believe that if current technology leads to the creation of artificial superintelligence, humanity itself might go extinct. A forthcoming book on the subject bears the comforting title “If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies.”
I could go into the existential risk arguments at length, but for convenience’s sake I’ll summarize.
If you create something much more intelligent than you, it could decide that its own goals differ from yours.  If you stand in its way, that something might decide to remove you. In other words, Frankenstein’s monster might decide to depose Dr. Frankenstein.
That’s it.
While you might consider such a situation far-fetched, the world only has to end once. There could well be multiple super-intelligent AIs in years to come, with different creators and goals and personalities. Can we be sure that every one of them has our best interests at heart?
For that matter, I don’t think the risk comes exclusively from super-intelligent systems. Just hook up a garden-variety AI to the military assets of any reasonable-sized country. Presto! Instantaneous instability. Again, this might seem far-fetched to most of us. But can you guarantee that every single country will refrain from such a step?
The risks seem real enough to merit attention from governments and everyday folks. Better safe than sorry, as the saying goes.
Yet I’m not much worried about the current-generation large language models, of the type that fuel ChatGPT or Google’s Gemini or Elon Musk’s Grok. I have watched this technology develop over the past couple of years with a skeptical eye. It can take decent notes from an audio recording. It can help high schoolers and college students cheat on tests. It has made many aspects of software coding faster and more efficient.
That all makes sense. It could do the same things back in 2022, to a lesser extent. Meanwhile, customers sigh as poorly integrated “AI” features spam their search engines and cell phones. Immense power requirements gobble up grid capacity and spew pollution.
Where are the breakthroughs? What happened to the hypothesized medical discoveries? Where are the penetrating insights from virtual Kansas Reflector columnists? Could it be that large language models, as we currently experience them, only go so far and work well in limited circumstances? Could it be that the furor we’ve experienced stems mostly from marketing hype and the wishful thinking of tech bros?
I’m not sure. But I’m suspicious.

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
The number of new apartments is at a 50-year high, but states expect a slowdown

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.
 Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
 Help for teachers

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Fast-building states get more babies

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Photographer: Elijah Nouvelage/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesThe Georgia Public Service Commission is set to hold a second round of hearings on Georgia Power’s controversial long-range plans.
The five-member utility regulator is set to vote July 15 as the state’s largest utility expects to spend billions of dollars to meet skyrocketing energy demands attributed to new electricity-hogging data centers. Georgia Power’s 2025 Integrated Resource Plan calls for renewable energy but also more fossil fuels.
Georgia Power has come under fire after PSC hearings in April when the company disclosed it is considering building new methane gas units to generate up to 9,000 more megawatts of capacity by 2031.
A number of environmental groups are calling on the utility to include a more diverse mix of clean, affordable energy solutions like solar power in its long-range plan instead of relying more heavily on fossil fuels.
Georgia Power’s plans include upgrading the nuclear units at Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle and the oil and gas-fired units at Plant McIntosh.
In addition, the company plans to upgrade nine hydroelectric dams throughout the state and build new transmission lines along more than 1,000 miles of power lines.
Georgia Power’s plans also include the addition of 1,100 MW of renewable energy from solar and battery storage.
“The 2025 IRP provides a comprehensive plan to support Georgia’s continued economic growth and allow us to serve Georgians with clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy well into the future – we look forward to continuing the process through the hearings this week,” Georgia Power spokesman Matthew Kent said.
Three days of hearings about the plan will begin Tuesday, following a proposed agreement reached between Georgia Power and the PSC to freeze base electric rates from 2026 to 2028. Some critics have argued that the proposed agreement is a political maneuver to protect Republican incumbent commissioners Fitz Johnson and Tim Echols. The PSC members are facing voters for the first time in years after a lawsuit delayed the usual six-year election cycle.
Since 2023, the average Georgia Power residential ratepayer is paying $43 more per month due to rising base electric rates, higher natural gas costs and the completion of two nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle.
In April, the Environmental Protection Agency approved a two-year exemption at the request of Georgia Power’s parent Southern Company allowing Plant Bowen and Plant Scherer to bypass federal emission regulations for mercury and other air pollutants.
Fossil fuels under fire
Georgia Power is requesting permission from the PSC to continue burning coal at Plant Scherer near Macon and Plant Bowen outside Cartersville well into the 2030s. Georgia Power  planned to retire one of its Plant Scherer units by the end of 2028 and Plant Bowen’s closure date is uncertain.
Georgia Power is also planning to continue to use coal and gas at Alabama’s Plant Gaston for energy generation.
The commission staff filed a recommendation this month that the company should be allowed to satisfy its projected 2033 needs, which would be 5,226 MW instead of 5,989 MW.
Georgia Power’s resource plan will reinforce its energy demands while also adapting to the changing regulatory environment and supply chain requirements, according to the PSC staff recommendations. The increases will provide Georgia Power with greater flexibility and time to adapt, according to the PSC staff.
Brionté McCorkle, executive director of Georgia Conservation Voters, argued that the driving reasons behind Georgia Power’s fuel rate increase is the continued reliance on fossil fuels.
Georgia Conservation Voters is one of several organizations challenging the power company’s models for predicting the growth of massive data centers. According to the company’s projections, data centers will consume 80% of all electricity, and all customers will benefit from these facilities that support the growing use of artificial intelligence.
Critics contend that the company’s projected demand is overstated and that existing ratepayers could be saddled with the cost of  unnecessary electricity generating infrastructure.
“We’ve seen them double down on gas and coal and all of the costs from Plant Vogtle,” McCorkle said. “All of those things have resulted in people’s bills going up despite public comment for years that people want to see the power company investing in renewable energy and energy efficiency. These are measures that will not only promote clean energy, but also help save the money on their power bills.”
Georgia Power company has been criticized by environmental groups for reversing its plans to close plants Bowen and Scherer, long among the worst polluters in the region. The company is instead seeking approval from state regulators to extend the life of the two plants and expand its fossil fuel energy capacity.
Last year, Georgia regulators signed off on an amended 2022 Georgia Power plan allowing it to build new biomass power plants that will burn wood waste and other organic material to generate electricity.
Jennifer Whitfield, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said the Georgia Power 2025 plan is unusual since there is a large amount of projected demand that is not based on proven analysis.
“How good are their projections, and are they good enough to make big resource decisions right now?” Whitfield said. “We think that they are not and expect that next week you’re going to hear from a lot of people who say their load forecasts are way too high.”
Whitfield gave credit for the Georgia Power proposal calling for significant investments in energy efficiency that can help ratepayers save money on their bills.
“I think there’s going to be some exciting stuff in (the IRP), but the commission shouldn’t take any action making radical decisions based on the data they have before them because the data is not good,” Whitfield said.
Neil Sardana with the Georgia Conservation Voters Education Fund said the organization will present testimony this week for how Georgia Power can reduce emissions, accelerate coal plant retirement and increase clean energy such as solar, wind and battery storage in a way that could potentially save customers $10 billion by the year 2040.
“Georgia Power could be doing a lot better when it comes to planning and developing resources for energy production that not only improves our air quality emissions and also saves everyday customers tons of money,” Sardana said.

Even before then, by 2030, AI is expected to shape industries and refine jobs which necessitates a comprehensive approach to ensuring Connecticut women are not left behind. It is imperative that we understand and act proactively on this crucial moment – by investing in our educational pipeline, supporting upskilling and reskilling initiatives and passing forward-looking policies like Senate Bill 2.
The impact of AI on women in the workforce
Recent studies paint a clear picture: generative AI and AI automation threaten jobs traditionally held by women, especially in sectors such as administrative support, customer service, food service and retail/sales.  According to a 2024 report from McKinsey Global Institute, approximately 30% of roles held by women are at a high risk of automation within the next five years. Conversely, AI also opens new pathways, if we prepare our workforce, especially women and underserved communities of color, to seize these opportunities.
Connecticut’s COVID-19 recovery underscored how economic instability disproportionately affects women, who often bear the brunt of workforce disruptions due to caregiving responsibilities and occupational clustering.  As AI advances, these disparities, could widen unless deliberate policies support women’s transition into emerging careers.

Building the future of AI careers
Senate Bill 2, which recently passed the State Senate, is poised to be a game-changer.  It is a robust bill covering everything from accountability and algorithmic discrimination to preventing deep fake abuse and supporting workforce development. Critical components of the bill include the creation of the Connecticut AI Academy, targeted upskilling programs, and initiatives to support career pathways in AI and quantum computing.  These investments are essential for continuing to position Connecticut as a leader in AI innovation, an area the governor recognizes as vital to our economic future, as evidenced by his executive investments in artificial intelligence and quantum computing research as reported by the CT Office of Policy and Management, 2024.
Most importantly, SB2 emphasizes upskilling and reskilling programs which ensures that when automation displaces certain roles, the workforce will have pathways into new high-demand sectors such as data science, AI ethics and cybersecurity.
The educational pipeline starts early
We know well that early education shapes future opportunities. Connecticut has an opportunity, and obligation, to foster a robust science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pipeline starting in elementary school, especially for girls.
Introducing STEM concepts early, providing engaging coding and robotics programs and supporting mentorship initiatives will cultivate a diverse generation of innovators ready to lead in AI. Funding and expanding STEM programs and partnerships with local tech firms will be vital. Additionally, supporting successful initiatives like the Lt. Governor’s Computing Challenge are instrumental in sparking curiosity and interaction with coding, furthering efforts to increase accessibility to STEM education. Connecticut must remain committed to the goal of dismantling the barriers that keep women and girls from pursuing STEM careers, from the outset. Early exposure not only inspires interest but builds the confidence necessary for future success.
Supporting a transition to high-demand AI careers
Senate Bill 2 also intimates investments in adult retraining initiatives crucial for women already in the workforce.  As the McKinsey report indicates, effective retraining reduces unemployment risk and smooths the transition from traditional roles to tech-driven careers. Programs such as the Connecticut Online AI Academy will serve as hubs for learning and reskilling, likely offering accessible training in AI development, machine learning and related fields.
Moreover, the state must continue to innovate on how we incentivize private sector partnerships, internships and apprenticeships — building pipelines from education to employment that prioritize equity and inclusion.
Now is the time to act
Delaying action leaves too many women vulnerable to job losses and wage stagnation– particularly those in lower-income brackets or in industries most susceptible to automation. By proactively supporting AI-related career pathways, we mitigate the risks and maximize the benefits of technological progress.
We are at a pivotal moment. Senate bill 2’s passage through the Senate paves the way for vital investments in Connecticut’s AI economy – if it advances through the House.  Our collective goal must be to ensure that women and girls, and others who lack opportunity have equal access to training, employment opportunities in artificial intelligence fields, and leadership roles in the burgeoning tech sector. By doing so, we will not only foster economic growth but also create a more inclusive and resilient workforce prepared for the innovations of tomorrow.

It’s the harsh reality that grips not only Suffield, but every district in the state – as administrators scramble to do more with less in the face of skyrocketing fiscal pressures that are exacerbated by soaring special education costs.
Now, more than ever, we need our state legislature and governor to work together to fulfill their fiscal and moral obligation to students who receive special education services. Districts across our state, including Suffield, need immediate and lasting special education funding reform.
As lawmakers continue exploring options for such reform, they do so knowing that the financial burdens felt by districts not only impact special education services, but also the ability of districts to maintain essential programs and resources for the entire student population. Districts like Suffield often have no choice but to make cuts to be mindful of the impact of an escalating property tax burden on residents.
In recent years, the state’s surplus has grown to a staggering $4.6 billion, yet state reimbursement for special education has dropped while student needs have sharply increased. Budgeting for special education is challenging due to the formula used for excess cost reimbursement and the unpredictability of students with various needs moving into town after budgets have been adopted.
The state has long promised greater special education reimbursement, but has consistently failed to deliver. Rather than broken promises, districts like Suffield need reliable and predictable solutions.
We urge lawmakers to consider the following options to bring relief to districts across the state.
1) Fully fund the Excess Cost Grant: This grant is designed to reimburse districts for special education expenses above an established threshold, but has not been fully funded since 2009. Recently, reimbursements for districts such as Suffield have been further scaled back.
While a $40 million rescue package brought much needed relief earlier this legislative session, the amount brought Suffield’s excess cost reimbursement rate from 62% to 75%, leaving town taxpayers to close the $407,000 gap.
2) Address high costs of outplacement programs: The cost of out-of-district placements continues to escalate for a number of reasons, including that such programs are increasingly run by private investors.
Districts stand to save substantial amounts of money if they could service high-needs students closer to home. Grants to help offset the high cost of developing and launching local programs and capping expenses for districts that utilize private programs are desperately needed.
3) Address costs associated with mid-year transfers: Costs for students who transfer into districts mid-year can be significant and challenging to absorb into already adopted budgets. Districts need relief from these unexpected and unpredictable expenses.
In Suffield, we are proud to offer opportunities to students of all needs. So are districts across the state. However, we cannot continue to bear the burden of the state’s fiscal shortfalls.
Now is the time for our state legislature and governor to fulfill their obligation to our state’s most vulnerable students. Implementing special education funding reform will be a crucial step in helping districts like Suffield stop painful cuts, enhance academic outcomes, and position each and every student to reach their full potential.

The 2025 poll points to a continuing trend in the chamber’s polling, with Richard Czuba, the president of the Chicago-based Glengariff which conducted the poll, telling reporters during a discussion of the 2024 data that political affiliation is a major factor in economic perception.
While last year’s assessment saw a more negative perception of the economy from Republicans and a more positive assessment from Democrats and independents, the 2025 assessment saw the opposite. 
“Democrats have gone from 62% in January, thinking the economy is growing to now 17%. Independents have dropped from 35 to 25[%] but Republican base voters have jumped from 22 to 64[%] that think the economy is growing,” Czuba said. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Of the 600 registered voters polled, 62.4% see a weakening economy, while 34.4% say it’s growing. 
Fears of a recession have similarly jumped, rising from 20.5% in September to 27.2% in January and 38.2% in April, a shift Czuba attributes to Democrats and independents. 
“Democrats’ concern of a recession has gone from 43 to 73[%],” Czuba said. 
“Independents have gone from 22 to 40[%], so doubled amongst independents. But base Republicans, fear of a recession has fallen from 15 to six[%],” he said. 
On inflation, Democrats’ concerns have increased by 25 percentage points, while concern among independents has jumped by 21 percentage points. Republicans on the other hand saw a two percentage point decrease in their inflation concerns. 
Despite holding increasingly worse perceptions about the economy, voters aren’t reporting big changes in their own situation, Czuba said. 
“Right now, 26% say they’re worse off than they were a year ago. 17 better, and 56% say the same. That’s identical to January. 21% of those who are in the workforce are concerned about losing their job. That also is unchanged since January,” Czuba said. 
Additionally, 86% of voters polled said they believed their job would still be available in five years, compared to 8% who said it would not be. 
“It’s interesting who said it would not be. If you are lower income, household incomes under $50,000, you rise to 20% thinking your job will not be there. If you are a respondent in an automotive manufacturing household, it’s 16%,” Czuba said. 
The divide over tariffs
When looking at tariffs, 51% of Michiganders oppose President Donald Trump’s tariff policies while 43% support them. However, 30% say they strongly support them while 43% strongly oppose the tariffs. 
There is no better issue to illustrate the divide amongst voters right now than tariffs, Czuba said, noting that 96% of Democrats oppose them while 92% of Republicans support them. Independent voters were split with 29% in support and 51% opposed.
“You can’t get more divided than that,” Czuba said.

Automotive households were similarly split with 48% in support and 46% opposed.
However, voters across the board said that tariffs will cost them more money, with 78.6% voters in agreement.
“Even a majority of those base Republicans, strong Republicans, believe tariffs mean they pay more. While they agree they pay more, that doesn’t stop them from supporting the tariffs. 92% of those base Republicans support the tariffs, while 56% say they will end up paying more,” Czuba said. “Forty-nine percent of independents support the tariffs, and 87% of independents say they’ll pay more. So a third of the voters who say tariffs are going to cost them more still support them.”
In light of these tariff concerns, 55% of Democrats and 44% of independents have changed their spending habits. Twenty-one percent of voters overall said they’ve delayed purchases, while 14% said they sped them up. 
“The top delays were automobiles and home improvement. The top sped up purchases were electronics, automobiles and home repairs,” Czuba said. 
Meanwhile only 7% of Republicans have altered their spending habits due to tariffs. 
Overall 21% of Michiganders polled said they’d been impacted by tariffs with the majority of that share citing increased costs. 
Additionally, while 54% of voters say tariffs will be bad for Michigan, 9% of that share still supported the new levies. 
However, 48% of respondents expected the tariffs would create more manufacturing jobs, compared to 28% who said they would create less and 15% who expected no change. 
The polling also looks specifically at the auto industry, with 65% of respondents saying it would hurt Michigan if China became the world leader on electric vehicles, with the majority of voters across every demographic group in agreement. 
Despite these concerns, Czuba noted that 35% of Republicans said it would have no impact on Michigan while 38% of auto manufacturing households gave the same answer, compared to 55% of auto households who agreed China leading the EV industry would hurt the state. 
While 56.3% of voters said the U.S. should compete for EV manufacturing and 57.9% saying Michigan should compete, 24% of voters who said letting China lead would hurt Michigan’s economy still say Michigan should not lead, Czuba noted, with most of these voters being Republicans. 
Looking across the spectrum 72% of Democrats and 56% of independents agreed Michigan should compete aggressively for EV manufacturing, 54% of Republicans said the state should not compete. 
Education perceptions
Czuba and Baruah also looked at education, with 70% of voters saying a college education is important for making a living wage and supporting a family, compared to 27% who said it’s not important. 
However only 17% of voters said a four year college education is affordable. 
“They do strongly agree and understand by a tune of two-thirds that a two year college education is affordable. And that’s a good thing, because with the policy work that’s been done in Michigan over the last few years, two years of college, either at community college or at a four year institution, is largely paid for, for most students should they choose to do that,” Baruah said.

Czuba explained that while there’s a large ecosystem telling students that they’re crazy for pursuing a four-year degree due to the high cost, they’re not hearing information on how to make college affordable, or at least reduce costs. 
“So many issues are now getting dragged into the mill of polarization. There used to be a general consensus amongst Michigan voters for a long, long time that college education or further education was a good thing. We’re starting to see that’s not necessarily the case, because it’s being whipped into this polarization mill that we have now,” Czuba said. 
Confidence in democracy
In revisiting a data point from last year, Czuba also discussed Michigan voter’s faith in democracy. 
“Back in May of ‘24 29% were satisfied, 66% were dissatisfied. This year it’s largely unchanged,” Czuba said. 
However, the big shift, once again, came down to political affiliation, with Democrat dissatisfaction jumping from 55% to 85% over the last year, and Independent dissatisfaction increasing from 63% to 75%. Republicans saw a shift in the opposite direction with dissatisfaction decreasing from 81% to 43% while their level of satisfaction increased from 15 to 51%. 
As Michigan stares down another election year, and what will likely be a hotly contested race for the Governors seat and the U.S. Senate, alongside multiple competitive U.S. House districts, Czuba emphasized one point. 
“It’s independents who are going to make decisions in Michigan. And so we have to pay particular attention to where they are on all of these issues.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/blue-red-voting-booths-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-05-27 01:02:20.415897

This critical shortage has dire consequences for the health of Connecticut residents. Wait times to see primary care physicians already average over 26 days and are projected to get longer. As fewer physicians struggle to manage the health of an ever-growing population, healthcare outcomes suffer. One study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine showed that the average life expectancy of people living in HPSAs was almost a full year shorter than those who do not. In short, physician shortages kill.
Connecticut ranks 46 out of 50 states in physician retention, as only 41.7% of physicians who complete their residency in Connecticut remain here to practice medicine. By contrast, the proportion of physicians who stay in the highest-ranking states, California and Texas, after training are 78% and 66%, respectively. This dire situation demands urgent action to attract physicians to our state rather than push them away, to prevent our physician shortage from getting worse.
An Act Limiting Out-of-Network Costs (H.B. 6871) is being proposed, purportedly to control healthcare costs. However, beyond worsening the physician shortage that is already drowning Connecticut’s healthcare system, we are concerned that this bill would also particularly devastate rural hospitals and small physician-run private practices. 
At first glance, the bill’s goals appear innocuous, capping the maximum amount that healthcare providers could charge health insurers for out-of-network care at 240% of the Medicare rate. However, by tilting the balance in negotiations far in favor of insurers over physicians and hospitals, this bill would do serious damage to the ability of healthcare providers to negotiate fair rates with insurers. These adverse consequences have led to a coalition of physicians and hospitals from around the state to warn of dire consequences for access to care in Connecticut should the bill pass.
Medicare reimbursement for hospitals and physicians is 50% and 70% the rate of private insurers, respectively. Even worse, Medicare payments to physicians have fallen 33% in inflation-adjusted terms since 2001. Tying out-of-network reimbursement to Medicare rates would place providers at a significant disadvantage as these rates continue to decline. 
Physicians and other clinicians will become scarcer as practicing in Connecticut becomes infeasible. Hospitals will close. Essential physician practices, beloved by the communities they serve, will be forced to shut their doors for good.  As struggling healthcare facilities and practices are forced to close, the health of Connecticut residents will ultimately suffer. Rather than the approach being offered by this bill, which will limit services while not addressing the root causes of cost, we advocate for focus on policies to improve physician retention in and recruitment to Connecticut. 
Tax and regulatory incentives can entice physicians to move or keep their practices here. Providing student loan relief to young physicians who are being crushed by sky-high student loan debt in the face of high cost of living can make it practical for them to start their lives and careers here. These reforms can expand the supply of physicians available to Connecticut residents, reducing wait times and meaningfully improving public health.
We urge the General Assembly to reject H.B. 6871 and get to work on practical solutions to heal our ailing healthcare system. The health of Connecticut’s people depends on it.

The Road to Omaha now has its road map, and we should hear no complaints from Hattiesburg, Starkville or Oxford. As per usual, Mississippi will be well represented in the NCAA Baseball Tournament.
Ole Miss and Southern Miss will both host NCAA Regionals and Mississippi State, after a season in which it fired the head coach, is in the tournament as a 3-seed at Florida State. You won’t see that happen often.

Rick Cleveland
First things first: Ole Miss, the No. 10 national seed, will play Murray State Friday night at 7 p.m. Southern Miss, the 16-seed, will play Columbia University Friday night at 6 p.m. State plays Northeastern, which has won 26 straight games, Friday night at 6:30 at Tallahassee.
In the other half of the Oxford regional, Georgia Tech plays Western Kentucky. In the other first round game at Hattiesburg, Alabama plays Miami. At Tallahassee, host Florida State will play Bethune-Cookman.
You ask me, both Southern Miss coach Christian Ostrander and Ole Miss coach Mike Bianco have big decisions to make. Both teams have established pitching aces in USM’s JB Middleton and the Rebels’ Hunter Elliott. Do you start your ace against the weaker 4-seed, or do you save him to pitch against a decidedly more formidable opponent on Saturday? Clearly, State interim head coach Justin Parker doesn’t face the same quandary. You go with your best when facing a higher seed with a 26-game win streak – no matter what league they play in.
The old school approach is that the next game is the most important game. In other words, throw you ace. Keep in mind also, you need for your game one starter to go as deep as possible into the game, saving your bullpen arms for a long weekend. The flip side: Having your best pitcher available to start the second game gives you a decided edge going against your opponent’s No. 2 pitcher.
Bianco’s decision is complicated by the fact that Murray State, the Missouri Valley Conference regular season and tournament champions, is one of the nation’s best No. 4 seeds. The Racers have won 39 games and seven for their last eight. In mid-week regular season games, the Racers lost 8-7 in 10 innings at Ole Miss and won at Kentucky 5-4. Using golf terminology, Murray is no gimme. The Racers hit .301 as a team. Still, I’d lean toward holding Elliott for either ACC regular season champ Georgia Tech or Western Kentucky.

Southern Miss head coach Christian Ostrander has a decision to make before Friday’s regional opener.
At USM, Ostrander must strongly consider holding Middleton, the recent Ferriss Trophy winner and likely All-American and high MLB draft choice. Columbia, the Ivy League regular season and tournament champ, hits at a .290 clip but, at least on paper, has pitching issues. The Lions’ team earned run average is 6.57 and opponents are hitting .290 against them. Me? I’d take my chances with Matt Adams, who has been really good of late, against Columbia, and then have Middleton, he of the 10-1 record and .168 opponents’ batting average, to go against Alabama or Miami. Southern Miss has won all six of Adams’ most recent starts, and he threw seven innings of four-hit, shutout baseball against Old Dominion in the Sun Belt Conference Tournament.
More college baseball observations:
• The SEC placed a record 13 teams in the tournament, which represents roughly 20 percent of the field. The only SEC selection I’d quibble with: Kentucky, at 29-24 and losing its last four and seven of its last 10 games.
• Color me surprised the Troy Trojans were left out of the 64-team field. Troy finished 39-21 and was nationally ranked for much of the season. Troy was the nation’s only team that hadn’t lost a weekend series until being swept in the last series of the regular season by Southern Miss. The Trojans did lose six of their last eight, and it now seems certain that the 2-1 loss to USM in the Sun Belt semifinals probably kept them out. 
• Ole Miss, picked to finish 15th in the SEC, is instead the 10th national seed. Mike Bianco deserves strong consideration for any Coach of the Year honor out there.
• Looking ahead: The Oxford Regional is matched with the Athens Regional, meaning if the No. 1 seeds advance, Ole Miss would play a Super Regional at Georgia, a team the Rebels did not play in 2025. The Hattiesburg Regional is matched with the Nashville Regional, which means Southern Miss, the No. 16 national seed, would play overall 1-seed Vandy if both teams advance. The Tallahassee Regional is matched against the Corvallis Regional, which means State would likely head far to the west if the Bulldogs can advance.
• Southern Miss has now achieved nine consecutive 40-win seasons. No other Division I baseball team in the country has done that. This will be the Golden Eagles’ ninth consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance (not counting the 2020 season curtailed by Covid).",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/06155430/AP_22157085286549-scaled.jpg,,,2025-05-26 19:01:23.290306

(Photo courtesy of Scott and Julia Whitnall)Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.


 Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.
Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
 Help for teachers

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

(Photo by Thomas Barwick/Getty Images)Despite Republican U.S. Congress members’ intentions to set Medicaid work requirements at a federal level, South Dakota officials plan to ask President Donald Trump to approve their own set of Medicaid work requirements.
Medicaid is government-funded health insurance for people with low incomes, and for adults and children with disabilities. South Dakotans voted in 2022 to expand Medicaid to adults with incomes below 138% of the poverty level, a decision that allowed the state to capitalize on a 90% federal funding match. In 2024, voters passed another constitutional amendment to let the state to seek approval from the federal government to impose Medicaid work requirements. 
The state’s waiver proposal seeking approval for a Medicaid work requirement had been drafted by the time Congress began to debate work requirements at the federal level this year. 


Two public hearings will be held during the public comment period:

10:30 a.m. May 30 at the DSS office in Pierre.
11 a.m. June 12 at the DSS OneStop office in Sioux Falls.

Written comments can be emailed to MedicaidSPA@state.sd.us with the subject line “SDCareerLink Public Comment,” or mailed to the Division of Medical Services in Pierre.


Individuals working, earning an income and gaining “independence and self-sufficiency” experience “greater health and economic well-being,” the proposal states.
Ben Hanson, North and South Dakota government relations director for the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, said barriers to accessible and affordable health care hurt South Dakotans in the long run. He worries work requirements at the state or federal level will burden employees and small business owners with paperwork. A majority  of Medicaid recipients already work or are exempted from work, he said.
Given South Dakota’s tight budget outlook, he worries lawmakers won’t pay to properly staff and oversee a work requirement program. Too little staff and too much paperwork, could keepSouth Dakotans from seeking needed care, he said, which could lead to more costly expenses if a medical condition goes untreated.
“It seems like it’s set up for non-success,” Hanson said.
The state will take public comment on its proposal through June 18.
How is SD’s proposal different from the federal proposal?
At the federal level, proposed Medicaid work requirements would mandate those between 19 and 65 who rely on the state-federal health program to work, participate in community service, or attend an educational program for at least 80 hours each month.
South Dakota’s state-level work rules, as proposed, wouldn’t require employed Medicaid recipients to work or be in school for a set number of hours. The state would review compliance on an annual basis, at the time of Medicaid renewal.
The federal government also has more exceptions to its proposed changes than the state.
South Dakota would allow exceptions for people who are:

Pregnant or postpartum,
Disabled, as determined by the Social Security Administration,
Have a cancer or other serious or terminal medical condition verified by a physician,
In an intensive behavioral health treatment program, hospitalized or living in a nursing home facility,
In an area with at least unemployment 20% higher than the national average and are exempt from SNAP requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents.

People who would meet the state’s requirements are:

Employed
Enrolled in job training or school
Caretakers for a dependent child in their home
Caretakers for an elderly or disabled person in their home
People who already meet work requirements for other federal programs like SNAP or unemployment insurance.

The federal program would also exempt tribal community members, those in the foster care system, people who were in foster care who are younger than 26, individuals released from incarceration in the last 90 days, among others, from work requirements.
During Trump’s first administration, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services approved 13 state work requirement waivers. Arkansas’ program was the first to implement its program in 2018, but that state was stopped by a federal court after nine months. About 18,000 people lost coverage in Arkansas. Employment levels did not increase.
The Biden administration rescinded all work requirement approvals, but Georgia started its own work requirement program in July 2023 without federal support.
How would work requirements impact South Dakota’s Medicaid expansion enrollment?
Per South Dakota Department of Social Services’ estimate, 80% of the people who got coverage under Medicaid expansion already work or wouldn’t have to under its proposed work requirement.
South Dakota’s Medicaid expansion population as of April 2025 stood at 30,542. Covering the expansion population will cost about $364.5 million this year.
A work requirement program would reduce enrollment by 5-10% in the first year, the department said. 
That would save the Medicaid program between $48.9 million and $71 million in the first year, the department claims. In the following years, the department expects enrollment to stay flat if work requirements are implemented rather than grow at a previously anticipated 2% each year.
South Dakota voters will decide next year whether to continue requiring Medicaid expansion if federal support for the program declines. The ballot question will ask voters to authorize the termination of Medicaid expansion if federal support falls below 90%.
In addition to setting work requirements at a federal level, Republicans pushed a Medicaid overhaul through the House in a budget reconciliation package this week. The changes reduce the program by $625 million over 10 years under the latest estimate by the Congressional Budget Office.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/hospitalbed-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-26 13:11:50.348577

(Photo by Tom Foley/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Americans check their phone on average 205 times a day or around once every five minutes. With phones seldom out of reach, it can be difficult to moderate usage in an increasingly connected world. For many people, this habit can persist even when behind the wheel, but the distraction it provides can have real consequences. 
On July 1, Iowa law enforcement will begin distributing warnings for the handheld use of electronic devices while driving. Here’s how to break texting and driving habits before then to avoid a penalty, or worse.
For background, Senate File 22, signed on April 2, 2025, bans the handheld use of cellphones and other electronic devices while driving when not in hands-free or voice-activated mode. Officers will begin enforcing the act on July 1, and will begin penalizing violations on Jan. 1, 2026. Drivers convicted of a violation will be charged with a simple misdemeanor after Jan. 1.
Here are some tips from four Iowans who work to decrease distracted driving in their communities on how to break the habit for good:
Understanding the risks
“People need to recognize that operating an electronic device while they’re driving is a distraction, and that distraction can cause harm to others and themselves,” said Larry Loss, an active cyclist and Des Moines metro resident since 1993.
Loss was crossing an intersection on his bike on May 18, 2022, when a young male driver, who was on his phone, made a right turn directly in front of him. Loss was cut off from the bike trail and collided into the curb, which propelled him into the concrete base of a utility pole. The injuries he sustained resulted in two surgeries, 17 days in the hospital, and left him unable to return to work for two months. The driver of the car never stopped.
Loss, however, considers himself to be one of the “lucky ones,” as he can still tell his story. 
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reports that in 2023, 3,275 lives were lost and around 325,000 were injured in crashes related to distracted driving. Around 8% of all fatal crashes involved distracted driving. 
The day of the crash, BikeIowa was holding its 18th annual Ride of Silence. Every year since 2005, cyclists from across Iowa have gathered to remember the riders injured and killed on the roads and trails in the past year, celebrate current achievements, and discuss how to continually make the roads safer for bikers going forward.
  Scott Sumpter, founder of BikeIowa, reads from a list of recorded cycling accidents at the 21st annual Ride of Silence, Wednesday, May 21, 2025, outside the State Historical Society of Iowa.(Photo by Tom Foley/Iowa Capital Dispatch)
Loss joined Luke Hoffman, director of the Iowa Bicycle Coalition, Scott Sumpter, founder of BikeIowa, and many others for the 21st annual Ride of Silence on Wednesday.
Loss says drivers should determine if their vehicle has Bluetooth capability and get the system set up as soon as possible to prepare for the changes in the law. If not, researching a compatible Bluetooth adapter or external system will allow drivers time to familiarize themselves with this technology before the law goes into effect on July 1.
Identify triggers
“If you are tempted to reach for your phone in the cup holder, maybe leave it in your bag” said Ryan Crane, executive director of NAMI Iowa.
Crane is the executive director of the Iowa branch of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. NAMI Iowa registered in favor of Senate File 22 during the legislative process. NAMI Iowa works to help communities address concerns about mental illness and provide information on treatment. 
A 2024 report from reviews.org, found not only that Americans check their phones over 200 times a day on average also that the figure represented a 42.3% increase from 2023. The survey also showed that over 43% of Americans feel addicted to their phones — and like other addictions, the habit is not easy to break.
Crane recommends drivers compassionately but intentionally observe themselves as they drive to understand what triggers them to pick up their phone. NAMI Iowa and other mental health institutions have recently begun to promote the importance of self-compassion as the standard for mental health practices.
Research by the Stanford Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education indicates that self-compassion is a learnable mindset that is linked to decreased stress and increased productivity. These things can play a major role in personal ability to identify and modify behaviors. By understanding what triggers the impulse, without excessive self-judgment, each driver can implement a solution that works for them. 
“Awareness is honestly the first step,” Crane said.
Some solutions may include finding another activity to replace the habit, such as anchoring their hands on 10 and two, placing their phone out of arm’s reach, regularly creating new playlists to prevent constant song-skipping, etc.
Finish online work before beginning to drive
“If you have text messages, emails, phone calls that you need to handle, do that right as you get in the car,” said Luke Hoffman, executive director of Iowa Bicycle Coalition.
Hoffman and the Iowa Bicycle Coalition were major supporters of Senate File 22, with some members advocating for some form of a hands-free bill for more than 10 years. He believes that this act is a “fundamental leap forward for safety in Iowa.” 
Hoffman and the IBC plan to launch a “Safe Roads Iowa” educational campaign sometime after July 1, which seeks to educate local communities on best practices for driving safety.
Setting aside time to settle online to-dos before driving may grant drivers the peace of mind to put down the phone while on the road.
This can take the form of setting up GPS directions prior to starting the car, utilizing the “add stop” GPS function for each destination if there are multiple, enabling driving mode on Android devices or driving focus on Apple and ensuring no notifications are set up to bypass this feature, etc.
Rely on passengers
“If you have a passenger, designate them to be your phone person,” said Dr. Cara Hamann, director of the University of Iowa Transportation Research and Injury Prevention Safety Lab and UI associate professor of epidemiology.
Hamann and the TRIPS lab put together a policy brief that outlined “the gaps in the distracted driving laws in Iowa.” She also personally made visits to the Capitol to speak with legislators about her research and inform them about her findings. 
Among facts outlined in the brief:

State bans on handheld phones while driving reduce handheld usage of electronics devices shortly after the laws take effect by almost 50%;
Handheld bans are associated with fewer driver deaths, while texting-only bans are not and may be more enforceable by law enforcement.

A designated phone user allows the driver to stay connected without investing in Bluetooth or other hands-free hardware. Designating a phone user ensures drivers aren’t tempted to pick up the phone themselves.
This may be a solution for drivers with non-integrated cars who can’t afford to invest in additional hardware. Other than working as a designated phone user, Hamann recommends passengers speak up if drivers go to grab their phone while on the road. 
“We need to work towards a cultural shift to make it the norm for people not to be using their phones,” she said.

(Photo courtesy of the University of Iowa Office of Innovation)A little-known, not-taught facet of the nursing profession is the art of the workaround, Allison Hurt said — taking something that isn’t working in the situation and making it fit for whatever the patient or fellow staff members need.
When she started working in the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics burn unit, Hurt said one workaround was cutting gauze and dressings to better fit the burned area of a patient’s body.
Later, when she transferred to the medical intensive care unit that later became the COVID-19 unit at the start of the pandemic, workarounds involved using long lines of IV tubing to have machinery and equipment outside of a patient’s room, allowing nurses to administer medicine and check information while saving important personal protection equipment.
“I didn’t realize I was innovating when I was doing it,” Hurt said.
In her current role as a Nurse Innovator Liaison for the UI Office of Innovation, Hurt helps other nurses identify challenges, recognize the innovations they’ve been making without realizing it and look ahead to how they can help others with their ideas.
The University of Iowa’s Iowa Nurse Innovators Program connects nurses to the resources and expertise they need to turn workarounds into specially crafted, even marketable, solutions. With early successes from UIHC nurses currently getting off the ground, the program is working to reach health care professionals across the state.

UI Chief Innovation Officer Jon Darsee, who oversees and helped launch the program in fall 2022, said there are many programs aimed at helping faculty or physicians develop their ideas into products or services, but nothing geared specifically toward nurses. With his background in medical technology, Darsee said he learned early on to listen to nurses and their needs.

May is National Nurses Month. According to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, this is a “time to honor and celebrate the incredible work of nurses.”
The UI Office of Innovation celebrated the month by sharing information about the nurse innovation program and stories of nurses seeing success from their product development.

Since the project’s launch, 1,300 nurses have engaged with the nurse innovation program, according to a newsletter from the UI Office of Innovation. There are 38 active projects in the program, eight of which came from nurses outside of the UI system, and several patent disclosures have been filed. There are four products currently being used by nurses.
A requirement of a donation from the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation in Kansas City was that the innovation program expand beyond the UI and offer opportunities to nurses across the state, which Darsee said was a brilliant idea that hadn’t come to him yet.
“Contributing to the health and happiness of nurses in rural Iowa environments is one way this program can influence patient safety and ultimately the quality care on a local level,” Darsee said.
Bringing resources to the experts
Each of the products designed by nurses have come from challenges they’ve faced in their profession or see others struggling with in the health care system. They’ve developed their own ways of dealing with these issues in the day-to-day, using “workarounds” as Hurt described them.
Nurses commit to around 27 workarounds per 12-hour shift, Hurt said, and program staff learn about them by visiting different hospital units personally to speak with staff.
“We’ve discovered that the way that works best is having nurses identify their challenges where they’re happening,” Hurt said. “It’s obviously kind of fresh in their mind — in-the-moment frustration is really kind of what we’re going for.”
Once a nurse has identified a challenge, Hurt said the program and its partner, prototyping company MakerHealth, work with the nurse on their schedule to further discussions about the problem, how they’ve tried to solve it in the past and what solution they’re hoping to develop.
It was on one of these visits when Courtney Smith learned about the program. The nurse innovator team had brought their “innovation station” to a nurse staff council committee meeting and asked if anyone knew about innovation projects, which Smith had previous experience with at a different job.
With the help of the nurse innovators program, Smith collected all the information and materials belonging to her from her previous work and got started where she left off — developing a tool to get cords and wires off the operating floor and out of the way.

Smith has created and tested multiple iterations of her invention, a cord clamp designed to attach to a patient’s bed and hold cords out of the way of foot traffic. She and those helping her in the program are working on different attachments to handle other materials that may need to be held out of the way.
Staff members who have worked with Smith while she used it have enjoyed its functionality and simplicity, she said, and that it is easy to sanitize after doing its job.
“I think right now, our biggest barrier is the fact that I’m the only one that currently carries it around with me, I take it with me when I go,” Smith said.
For nurses just starting out on their idea, Hurt said the program provides them with a kit full of materials to design and craft a low-fidelity, or rough draft, version of their product. After figuring out what works and what doesn’t, the nurse has more discussions with the team before trying out new materials and designs, until they have a functional prototype. All of this is at no cost to the nurse.
At this point the nurse graduates from the MakerHealth portion of the program, Hurt said, and from there they can work with the UI Office of Innovation to eventually bring their idea to market, if that’s what they wish.
The program has also helped nurses who are already making products to think bigger about how — and who — they could help.
Lynette Kenne, a retired UIHC nurse with decades of experience in different areas of the field, said her product was inspired by her first grandchild, who was diagnosed as an infant with mild-to-moderate permanent hearing loss.
Her daughter reached out to her one day asking if she still had a sewing machine and could make something to cover her grandchild’s ears, as he would keep taking out his hearing aids and try to put them in his mouth.
After some trial and error, Kenne said she’s developed a small beanie with a band around the bottom and mesh patches over the ears in order to keep it on but comfortable for the wearer. She connected with a UI Health Care audiologist to give the extra hats she made to other babies and toddlers getting fitted for hearing aids before ever connecting with the innovators program.
“I think this has made me think big about how (to) bring a good service to more than just the people locally,” Kenne said.

The innovation program helped Kenne expand her knowledge about how infants’ heads change as they grow, what would be needed for older children with disabilities to be able to use the hats, what materials are best and more.
Kenne’s eyes were also opened to the idea of eventually marketing the hats in order to reach more people in need. Her next steps include reaching out to audiologists across the state to gauge their interest in the product and finding ways to make the sewing process faster.
Nurses were neither told nor taught in school about workarounds and how often they would need to adapt their materials and equipment to fit patients’ needs, Kenne said, and having this program just for them is an immense help.
“We have lots and lots of nurses across the state and across the nation that for years and years and years have been doing workarounds simply because they don’t have a product or a process that currently works,” Kenne said. “And this is a little tickler to say, if you have an idea, come talk to us and we’ll help you make it a reality.”
Expanding ideas and program reach
Without the UI Nurse Innovators Program, Smith said her cord clip would still be an idea she left behind, and Kenne said she would still be thinking small when it came to who her hats could help.
Both innovators have taken steps to determine whether their products can be patented, something Smith said she would have never been able to accomplish without the program’s support.
“I feel like the nurse innovators program makes me feel limitless when it comes to the capabilities that we are able to achieve with these products,” Smith said.
While it may have been in a different way for her than program participants, Hurt said the innovators program helped her get to a better place in her career while looking for the next step. Like the nurses she meets at their stations, the innovation team came to Hurt while she was working on her unit and asked about her challenges, leading her to find and be selected for the liaison position.
Beyond aiding in turning nurses’ ideas into reality, Darsee said the program helps improve quality of life for the nursing profession in general, hopefully leading to more nurses staying in their jobs and combating the national nursing shortage.
“From the leadership perspective, leadership is excited that their nurses are happy, their nurses aren’t chomping at the bit to get away from patient care,” Hurt said. “And by no means are we trying to steal nurses away to start companies. We’re really trying to make nurses’ days better in the place they work, and solve challenges where they are spending 40 hours a week.”
To Darsee and Hurt’s knowledge, there are no other programs like UI Nurse Innovators, in academic settings or otherwise. Other health care systems, including hospitals, nursing homes and more, have spoken with the team about trying to start their own, similar programs, Darsee said.
“There is no reason why this couldn’t go to any hospital, anywhere you have a nurse,” Darsee said.

(Courtesy of Jon Bahr/MilkShake Factory)The number of births in some Western states that are adding new housing rose last year, reversing losses the year before in many cases, according to new federal statistics released Wednesday.
Increases from 2023 to 2024 were highest in Colorado (4.5%), Idaho (3.8%), Utah (3.6%), Washington state and Nebraska (each 2.6%). Births increased around 2% in West Virginia, South Dakota, North Carolina, Montana, Rhode Island and South Carolina.
Almost all those states had decreases in births the previous year, and many have been building housing rapidly since 2023. Idaho, North Carolina and Utah have issued enough building permits in 2023 and 2024 to add about 4% to their housing stock, the highest in the nation.
Melissa Kearney, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in families and fertility, said there could be a link between homebuilding and more babies.
“It is quite possible that increased access to home ownership, coming from a reduction in the price of houses in places that are building more houses, could meaningfully increase birth rates,” Kearney told Stateline in an e-mail.
Many of the other states with increases in births are also seeing building booms: Colorado, Nebraska, South Carolina, South Dakota and Washington state are all set to add more than 2% to housing stock based on permits issued in 2023 and 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau Building Permits Survey data.

 
Building permits can take up to two years to translate into finished houses and apartments, but they indicate which states are most willing to allow new housing that can boost population, tax receipts and the workforce. In Colorado, Denver County is set to add almost 10,000 housing units and in Idaho, Ada County, which includes Boise, could add 11,200 units based on building permits.
Nationally births were slightly higher in 2024 than the year before, by about 1%, according to provisional federal numbers from the National Vital Statistics System within the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The fertility rate also increased slightly, but it remains below the “replacement level” needed to keep the population stable — 2.1 children for each woman over her lifetime.
All the increase nationally was in births to Hispanic and Asian mothers, with births continuing to decline for Black, American Indian and white mothers. Births to teenagers and women ages 20-24, in sharp decline since 2007, continued to drop last year, while births increased for women 25 and older.
The number of births dropped most in states struggling with stagnant population: falling about 4% in Louisiana, 3% in Mississippi, and 2% in New Mexico and New Hampshire. All those states had little or no population growth between mid-2023 and mid-2024, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.

Over the past six years, few public servants in North Carolina have had a bigger or more positive impact under more difficult circumstances than former State Board of Elections executive director Karen Brinson Bell. Despite woefully inadequate appropriations from the state legislature and relentless attacks from uninformed conspiracy theorists, Brinson Bell persevered, strengthened North Carolina elections and kept them among the nation’s most efficient and honestly run.
Unfortunately, those accomplishments were of little interest to the newly installed and hyper-partisan members of the board appointed by Republican state auditor Dave Boliek, who summarily fired Brinson Bell at their first meeting and refused to even allow her to deliver farewell remarks. Happily, Brinson Bell was kind enough join Newsline’s Rob Schofield this past week for a special extended conversation and in Part One of our chat, we explored some of the accomplishments from her term in office that she thinks will be the most impactful.
In Part Two, we turned our attention to some of the broader issues and challenges facing American elections – including the increasingly intense partisanship that led North Carolina GOP lawmakers to withhold election funding and, more recently, add seven new political appointees to the agency’s staff, and the unfortunate phenomenon of politicians spreading unfounded conspiracy theories and refusing to concede close elections.

State records indicate Jesse Husmann began working for Jefferson County as a full-time paramedic in October 2023. On Feb. 17, 2025, a hospital emergency room nurse allegedly reported to Ambulance Service Director Josh Hemminger that Husmann’s behavior that day was unusual.
Hemminger then spoke to one of Husmann’s co-workers about her behavior, and the co-worker allegedly reported Husmann seemed confused and didn’t know where certain things were located in the emergency room even though she frequently worked there, according to the records. The co-worker also is alleged to have reported that Husmann didn’t know how to get to the hospital, couldn’t sit still and had walked into a wall.
Hemminger then spoke with Husmann and allegedly observed that she could not sit still, and asked that she submit to drug test, the records show. Husmann agreed to do so and was allowed to drive herself to the testing site and then return to work. The next day, she was placed on paid administrative leave until the test results were produced.
On March 5, the lab allegedly faxed Hemminger the test results showing Husmann had tested positive for marijuana and amphetamines and that Husmann had not provided any information to explain the results. Husmann allegedly told Hemminger she was using marijuana to address a non-work injury and that she was taking a prescription medicine that would show up as amphetamines on a drug test, state records show. Husmann was immediately fired. She later applied for unemployment benefits, which led to a hearing before Administrative Law Judge Daniel Zeno.
Zeno recently ruled in Husmann’s favor and awarded her unemployment benefits, noting that Jefferson County “did not notify Ms. Husmann of the test results by certified mail return receipt” before firing her. As a result, Zeno found, the county could not use the results of the drug test as a basis for challenging her application for jobless benefits.



Other Iowans fired for alleged workplace misconduct 
Other Iowans whose unemployment cases were recently heard by an administrative law judge include:
— Sara Bergeson, who began working for the Ames Community School District in August 2022 as a full-time educational associate and was fired on April 4, 2025. Bergeson typically took her daily 30-minute, unpaid lunch breaks inside a classroom where she would sit at a table, set an alarm for the end of her break, and listen to music or sleep. On April 2, an employee sent district officials two photos of Bergeson showing her sitting in a chair in the classroom with her arms crossed, head back, leg propped on a table and eyes closed.
She was subsequently fired for sleeping on the job, with the district noting that she had been “written up” for sleeping on the job in April 2024. Administrative Law Judge Daniel Zeno ruled recently that Bergeson is entitled to jobless benefits, finding that even if one were to assume that Bergeson was sleeping when photographed, she was on an unpaid break at the time. “It is not misconduct for an employee to sleep during a break in a place where the employer authorizes an employee to take breaks,” Zeno ruled.
— Justin J. Haubrich, who began working for the Omara Law Office in February 2024 as a full-time paralegal and was fired in October 2024. The law office alleged Haubrich had been performing below expectations, had been insubordinate, and had become upset, slammed doors and used profanity in speaking to colleagues in the office.  At some point, the law office discovered Haubrich had been accessing, from his home, the employer’s security-camera system to watch two female colleagues at work.
When the employer confronted Haubrich, he allegedly admitted to the behavior, according to state records. In a subsequent meeting with partners of the law firm, Haubrich allegedly became upset and began yelling and arguing before telling one partner to “f— off” and leaving the building. He was fired that same day and subsequently collected $602 in jobless benefits. An administrative law judge ruled recently that Haubrich is not entitled to benefits and that he must repay the $602.
— Jordan S. Bates, who worked as a full-time care aide for Immanuel Pathways, a care program for the elderly, from March 2023 until she was fired in March 2025. Her dismissal was based on a finding that Bates had worked outside of the scope of her professional duties when she made a report to an animal-rescue agency regarding the welfare of animals living in the home of a client and the unsanitary conditions the client faced due to the amount of animal feces inside the home.
Bates made the complaint after a superior asked her to consult with an Iowa Department of Health and Human Services worker who, in turn, directed Bates to make the animal-welfare report. She was subsequently awarded unemployment benefits, with an administrative law judge ruling she had not committed any form of workplace misconduct.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Ambulance.jpg,,,2025-05-26 11:05:46.244187

(Tracey Attlee)More than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest — not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery.
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”

She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial.
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time. 
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said. 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said. 
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
  Seven sailors fire their guns three times in a salute in March 2025 at Arlington National Cemetery for the late John Connolly. (Tracey Attlee)
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one — an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown — history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.” 
A final sendoff at last.

An abnormal test result is always terrifying, but somehow Oklahoma’s health care system made the uncertainty infinitely worse. I found out it would be 54 days between receiving my results and the first available appointment at Mercy’s renown breast center in Oklahoma City. That location had the ultrasound technology necessary to provide the specialized followup needed to determine if the unexplained masses were cancerous or benign.
Thinking the scheduler had made a mistake, I called the clinic directly. The woman who answered was shocked — shocked that I had gotten in that quickly. 
Usually, she told me, it takes longer.
So the agonizing wait for answers began.
To put this timeframe into perspective: It took so long that nearly half of Oklahoma’s four-month legislative session ticked by. Seven-figure pygmy gobies – tiny fish that live among coral in the Indian Ocean –  had almost lived an entire life cycle. Red foxes had completed gestation and given birth. People had applied for and received their U.S. passports.
That delay is probably why I found myself so irked earlier this month by Gov. Kevin Stitt’s decision to veto bipartisan legislation that aimed to increase women’s access to diagnostic mammogram testing. The bill, had Stitt signed it, would have required insurance companies to foot the bill for two additional tests. In short, it would have eliminated copays and deductibles.
The proposal passed overwhelmingly through both legislative chambers and seemed like an easy win for Stitt and his fellow Republicans trying to signal that they actually care about women’s health outcomes. 
After all, breast cancer is a disease that disproportionately affects women, and ours is a state where women die from the disease at higher rates than the national average. In Oklahoma, an estimated 22.4 per every 100,000 women die compared with 19.3 nationally, according to the National Cancer Institute. In rural McCurtain County, the death rate is a staggering 36.4 women per 100,000 – almost double the national rate.
The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, which advocates for evidence-based medicine and prevention, notes that Black women are 40% more likely to die from the disease than their white counterparts, and that it is critical that patients “receive equitable and appropriate follow-up.” The task force recommends women have a biennial mammogram for over three decades — from age 40 until 74.
Breast cancer is a disease where the odds of surviving are significantly improved by early detection, so it boggles the mind that Stitt would reject legislation that removes a cost-barrier that might prevent Oklahomans from getting screened.
But with the stroke of a pen, our male governor demonstrated that he doesn’t understand — or even care about — the struggles we women face to access what should be a routine health care procedure. And, he showed that he’s fine with women being forced to disproportionately bear those testing costs. Because how many men do you know who pay for biennial mammograms?
And as icing on the already unsavory cake, Stitt vetoed this legislation authored by a lawmaker fighting breast cancer, experiencing first hand the struggles that Oklahomans face. 
In 2022, legislators passed a law requiring coverage of diagnostic mammograms, but Melissa Provenzano, the bill’s author, said access to mammogram machines depends on where you live. She also said that women report their insurers are pushing back on the copay protections despite the law.
In his veto message, Stitt wrote that he was “deeply sympathetic” to women who have bravely fought the disease. He noted that he was aware that early detection and access to care are critical priorities. But, Stitt said,the legislation “imposes new and costly mandates on private health insurance plans” that will raise premiums for “working families and small businesses.”
Stitt is clearly more sympathetic to health insurers who often charge “working families and small businesses” large monthly insurance premiums and then continue to collect even more from them in copays and deductibles.
Like most businesses, insurance companies aim to make money. It often takes legislative action to force them to waive copays or deductibles, which chip away at their profits.
It remains to be seen whether lawmakers will let Stitt’s veto stand. If every lawmaker who supported it initially stayed the course, they’d have the two-thirds of votes needed to override it.
While they’re mulling it over, perhaps they should consider that ours is a state that has some of the worst health outcomes in the country. Maybe it’s time to worry less about hurting insurers’ feelings, put on their big girl pants and champion policies that will make lifesaving testing easier to access and more affordable — for Oklahomans of any gender.
Because while the masses in my breast were determined to be benign, nobody should have to wait months for those answers or be required to pay for a doctor-recommended screening that could save her life.

One of North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein’s first acts upon assuming office earlier this year was to name a new Secretary of the state Department of Health and Human Services, and from the looks of things thus far, the person to whom he turned, Dr. Dev Sangvai, was a winning selection.
Since taking office, Sangvai — a family medicine practitioner and Duke University professor – has quickly hit the ground running and emerged as forceful voice for commonsense in the often rancorous world of health care policy.
Most recently Sangvai has spoken out publicly and energetically in opposition to the massive Medicaid and SNAP food assistance cuts working their way through Congress. And as Sangvai reminded NC Newsline, his concerns about the cuts are about more than mere empathy for struggling families – they’re also based on hard data which show the devastating ripple effects the cuts will have on North Carolina’s overall health and economic wellbeing.

In January, Disability Rights Mississippi and Jackson reached a settlement agreement establishing standards that JTRAN, Jackson’s transportation system, must continue to reach for in the coming months. Otherwise, the city could face further legal action from disability advocates. 
While it may be considered progress for the city, the conclusion of the lawsuit was not publicized earlier this year as the mayor ran unsuccessfully for reelection, though he generally touted improvements in JTRAN during the campaign. Materials from Mayor Chokwe Lumumba’s campaign highlight updates to JTRAN’s bus fleet, as well as securing more than $20 million in federal funds to improve Jackson’s transit system. 
Scott Crawford, the lead plaintiff in the 2008 lawsuit, which led to a 14 year-long consent decree, said the settlement agreement is a move in the right direction. 
“The notion that the consent decree could last forever is just not realistic. You can’t tie up a court system overseeing a transit system forever. That is not practical, and I’m the lead plaintiff,” said Crawford, JTRAN Paratransit Advisory Committee Chairperson. “You can’t have courts overseeing a system forever, so they needed it off the docket. That’s just a pragmatic fact of life. We had it in place for 14 years, and that’s a very long time.”
Those standards include ensuring that 95% of telephone hold times are not longer than three minutes and 99% are not longer than five minutes. It also states no more than 10 trip denials in a month, which occurs when JTRAN cannot provide a trip or when JTRAN offers a trip with a pick-up or drop-off time differing by more than 60 minutes from the requested time.
In addition, the settlement agreement focuses on the timeliness of passenger pickups, with at least 90% of all pickups occurring within the on-time pickup window, which is 30 minutes, and 95% of all pickups within 45 minutes.
“To be accurate and clear, we’ve only met that standard one month, so we’re not there yet. Nobody’s declaring victory. It’s a work in progress,” Crawford said.

Minutes from April’s JTRAN Paratransit Advisory Committee meeting provides data that shows trip cancellations were down in January and February. Excessive ride times were up, with a few rides lasting longer than 120 minutes. The settlement agreement says that the city shall not provide excessively long trips for more than 5% of paratransit trips in a month, and no trip should be longer than 120 minutes.
“We have been in the range of 78% to 85% (for on-time dropoffs) in the last several months. I hope we can get up to 90% for Paratransit on-time performance. That would be an acceptable level of timeliness when you’re trying to get to appointments,” he said. “If you’re the medical provider or you’re the employer, you really want your folks to be on time for their appointments and their jobs, so it matters.”
The city of Jackson contracted with MV Transportation to manage transportation services, including JTRAN bus drivers, in January of 2024. Last fall, the Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 1208, which represents the drivers, went on strike against MV Transportation due to concerns such as long hours, wrongful terminations and safer working conditions. The strike lasted two weeks. 
Christine Welch, deputy director for the Office of Transportation, said that one thing JTRAN needs now is more bus drivers.
“It’s across the board. Drivers,” Welch said. “Currently we have about 54, 55. The desired number is hopefully about 60 drivers.”
JTRAN’s buses are ADA accessible, she said, meaning that people with disabilities can ride fixed routes or paratransit. But paratransit comes with some limitations. 
“You have to first be certified for that service based on your medical disability,” she said. “It’s a door to door service, curb to curb. Our services operate within three-fourths of a mile of a fixed route.”
Crawford said that one way to ensure JTRAN meets the standards agreed to in the settlement is for the city to hire more bus operators and pay them a fair wage. 
MV Transportation’s current job listings for CDL drivers in Jackson come with a starting pay of about $16-an-hour. The city is also seeking an associate planner who will aid JTRAN in managing paratransit services.
“I think public transit is worth its weight in gold. I think we underpay our transit staff, and that would help. That’s one way to fix this, but trying to convince lawmakers is an uphill battle,” Crawford said. “These are professionals who are doing a stressful job, and they need to be paid like it.” 
Greta Martin, litigation director for Disability Rights Mississippi, said that the protection and advocacy organization will continue to monitor data that the city of Jackson provides to them on a monthly basis. 
“For every piece of data that we get from the city of Jackson, there is some kind of number that they have to stay within,” Martin said. “It’s kind of a wraparound situation that we have. We’re making sure that we keep an eye on the data, but we’re also trying to work with the city, knowing that they have their own limitations, but then we also want to be accountable to the community and understand what their perspective is as people that utilized the services.”
Martin said by ending the consent decree and reaching a settlement agreement, it allows the city and her organization to direct time and resources toward improving public transit and quality of life for people who have disabilities. 
“That was the point of filing the litigation to begin with, to hold them accountable for the services they should be providing people with disabilities in the city,” Martin said. “I hope it fosters a collaboration with the city so that not only will they lean upon us for these issues involving public transit, but also that they will lean upon us for making the city of Jackson more accessible as a whole.”
Martin has represented plaintiffs in the JTRAN lawsuit since she started at the legal advocacy organization seven years ago. A little over a year ago, the city hired Martin’s husband, Drew Martin, as its lead attorney. The plaintiff’s lawyer said she’s received more feedback from the city attorney’s office in the last year than at any other point in the litigation. 
She quipped that may be because “my husband sees my name on the email and says, ‘I better answer it.’”
“I’ll take my wins anywhere I can find them for people with disabilities,” Greta Martin said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/19205814/JTRAN-1.jpg,,,2025-05-26 10:09:29.126790

Their beauty, wildlife and opportunities for adventures are a great gift to current and future Alaskans, as well as our many visitors. From Denali to Katmai to Glacier Bay, these special places help drive a thriving tourism economy and support reliable, made-in-Alaska jobs. Unfortunately, Alaska’s national parks and the economic benefits they bring are threatened by drastic staffing and budget cuts to the National Park Service. It was recently reported that the National Park Service Alaska Regional Office in Anchorage has lost an estimated one-third of its staff — more than 60 knowledgeable Alaskans — a result of downsizing the Department of Interior through pressured buyout tactics. And the federal administration has threatened additional cuts through mass firings.
Roughly 2 million people visited Alaska national parks in 2023, and more are expected this year. They spent $1.5 billion dollars and supported 23,000 jobs, according to the National Park Service. In Anchorage alone, 1 in 9 jobs is in tourism, Visit Anchorage has found. Across the country, one tax dollar invested in the Park Service returns $10 to the economy. 
But national parks don’t run themselves. People are needed to keep parks running, from park rangers to contracting experts, from educators who design the visitor center exhibits to biologists who make sure that park wildlife survive and thrive.
The Alaska Regional Office provides oversight and expertise to 24 national park sites across Alaska, covering more than 50 million acres of federal land. The scale and landscape of Alaska makes the Alaska Regional Office essential. Most Alaska national park sites only have one or two resource staff and limited capacity.  It doesn’t make financial sense for every park to have its own pilot and plane, geologist, or subsistence expert. The Regional Office provides support and expertise that serve all our parks.
At the Alaska Regional Office, cuts and consolidation programs have eliminated crucial positions, including the regional chief ranger overseeing law enforcement. Now there is only one staff member leading archaeology and cultural resource protection for all of Alaska’s national park sites, and just a handful of staff remain to work with Alaska Native tribes, whose culture, food security, and traditional ways of life should be respected by those parks.
The people who work in the National Park Service in Alaska are Alaskans. Their jobs bring important cash into our communities, and they are our friends and neighbors. The loss of Park Service jobs and the other federal land management agency jobs will hurt our economy and jeopardize the valuable resources of the parks. Without adequate staffing, park visitors may be at risk or at least disappointed. The tourism market is extremely competitive. It may not take too many bad experiences with deteriorating roads, dirty restrooms, inadequate information, disorganized commercial operations and absent wildlife to undermine one of the pillars of Alaska’s economy.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski has pushed hard to protect federal jobs in Alaska. In contrast, Rep. Nick Begich just voted for a $250 million cut to Park Service staff funding. We need our delegation to stand up for our national parks, our economy and our communities. It is not too late to keep our amazing national parks safe, accessible, sustainable, productive and world class.

Michelle Lujan Grisham about public safety, threats to Medicaid and governing through Trump.","New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in her office on the fourth floor of the state Capitol in May, 2025 (Julia Goldberg/Source NM)New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham still uses coffee left over from Gov. Susana Martinez’s administration, which she describes in less-than-flattering terms before offering some at the outset of this interview (we declined). She drank from a mug festooned with the New Mexico flag and noted that her staff had been mocking her all day for wearing metallic pants. Source’s extended interview, however, did not touch on fashion—of which we know zilch—but, instead, focused on the governor’s executive order deploying the National Guard to Albuquerque to help manage that city’s crime problems; threats to New Mexico’s Medicaid from the proposed budget recently approved by U.S. House Republicans; and governing during the Trump administration(s). Lujan Grisham began her second term as governor in 2023, and previously served three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives, representing the state’s 1st Congressional District, and as the state’s health secretary under former Gov. Bill Richardson. The governor’s Chief of Staff Daniel Schlegel and Communications Director Michael Coleman sat in the room during this interview, which has been edited for concision and clarity.
Source NM: Your front desk just received a call from someone who wants you to recall the National Guard from Albuquerque. Are you getting mixed reviews on that?
MLG: I don’t feel like we’ve gotten mixed reviews. I do think people are confused about what it is and maybe we can do a better job explaining it. We’ve previously sent the state police into Albuquerque in a number of ways and strategies, but I’m running out of state police to cover all of that additional work in areas where we’ve got growing risk. The Guard can do all of these administrative police activities [such as] dispatch. Some of them are a little more frontward facing: driving arrestees if they need medical attention, meeting them at the hospital so they can provide security. They can do security at the shelters, where we’ve got [the Albuquerque Police Department] and the [Bernalillo County Sheriff’s] office doing court security. All of that will be managed and directed by Guardsmen and women who were trained military police already, who were retrained about how APD and how the sheriff’s office handles those efforts. And then you have more police on the ground in the areas that need them. All [people are] going to see in a neighborhood is a sheriff’s vehicle with deputies and an APD vehicle [and] APD on cycles the way you would normally see that. I don’t think people quite understand that a tank and people in uniforms like soldiers are not coming into your neighborhoods under this administration. That’s not what we have ever proposed and it’s not something I’m interested in.
Has your stance on public safety changed during your tenure as governor? The New York Times has highlighted, more than once, that your positions have put you in conflict with some other Democrats.
I think maybe because it’s become such a lightning rod favorably to Republicans. But remember, I put 50 state police into the International District primarily, but all along that central corridor, in 2019. I have consistently moved them around and, I would argue, made them a little short staffed for the [Interstate 25] corridor, and then that [Interstate 40] intersection, because there are not enough police. [According to the governor’s office, the state police currently has 100 vacancies.]
We’re an interesting state for crime in a number of ways. High poverty states usually have more difficulties. We didn’t have any behavioral health [due to the dismantling of behavioral health services during Martinez’s administration]. Drug addiction is rampant, though that’s being, I think, attenuated. We’ve got some really good outcomes there, but it’s not gone by any stretch of the imagination. And that I-25/ I-40 connection is just not good for stopping crime. It’s where it moves. All those trucking stops. It’s one of the reasons Albuquerque gets hit so hard. So, I think I’ve been very consistent. I just have not gotten enough attention. And I think you can hear it in my voice. I think what they’re seeing shift is I’m a bit more frustrated about, ‘My gosh, how many more victims do we need?’
You said at the end of the legislative session you wanted a special session to address crime, juvenile crime in particular. Is that still a possibility?
It is still a possibility. We’ve been meeting with leadership staff. There’s more movement to be in a more productive place for a special session. But we’re not where we need to be and there’s no reason to call them and not have any effort. Plus, I don’t want to do three or four or five or six special sessions, as we see what rolls out from the feds, particularly in the next couple of days [this interview took place on May 21, prior to the U.S. House May 22 passage of the GOP budget bill]. And I think there’s widespread agreement by the Democratic leadership that we should adjust our priorities and our budgets to reflect whatever we need to do and can do in the short term to protect New Mexicans.
Do you have an ideal scenario of how the state would make up Medicaid funding shortfalls?
I think that the fact that we’ve got money in reserves…there are things that we can do. My pitch to the Legislature today—and of course, I haven’t seen what’s coming, although I have a pretty good idea—is we should try to sustain to the degree that we can for a year. And it’s really two [years] between now and when [the 2026 midterm elections] would take hold in Congress, but see if you can stem the closures of rural hospitals and healthcare clinics, and that we don’t lose any movement to hold onto OBGYNs, which is precarious. That’s my perspective today. It’s still a lot of money and we’d have to game it out. It could be as little as $1 billion that we’d have to come up with in healthcare. It could be as much as $3 billion and that’s before you get to education and the [Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program].
Would the strategy for addressing SNAP cuts be similar to Medicaid?
Yes, because you’ve got $1 billion that we get into the state for SNAP. They’re not eradicating it. These are radical cuts. It’s a little bit different and I don’t think people quite understand the nuance of it, but we could be on the hook for up to $300 million if the cuts, as we know them, were voted on today. I don’t think that’s going to happen, and I’m going to fight hard to prevent that from happening. I think I might be doing a call shortly to encourage voters of every persuasion all across the country: These cuts will change your communities as you know them, and people will get hurt and they will die. And when we have food prices as high as they are, and with all the tariff complications, then you have your food budget goes not nearly as far. So, we’d have to figure out SNAP. I’m not as worried, believe it or not, about education, but there are education cuts. There are impacts everywhere.
We haven’t had much success getting anything more than boiler plate out of the Public Education Department as it relates to the Trump administration’s orders about diversity/equity and inclusion to avoid funding cuts.
That makes me happy. And the reason it does is: We don’t discriminate in New Mexico. We’re also a minority-majority state. We think that when they do a blanket search for inclusion or equity or equality, they forget that that’s how we define rural investments. So, we’ve just provided that boilerplate language that we think meets the federal effort at changing what they believe are reverse-discrimination rules. I work hard to not tip the scales against New Mexicans. That department and others are going to respond to the feds as they’re required to, but we have been a little vanilla about, ‘We don’t violate any of those rules right now. Thank you so much for reminding us that there’s no discrimination allowed.’
But in my mind, what the federal government is after is different, right? They want to discriminate against people who have racial differences, gender differences, sexual orientation differences, religious differences. This is a state that’s proud about its inclusion and diversity, but we don’t discriminate, and we just have been saying so. And we’re going to continue to do that and continue to provide Attorney General [Raúl Torrez] with information that we think is harmful and illegal in the way in which the feds might approach any of these issues and see where they go in the courts. All of this is being tested, as you know, in the courts, and we’re doing well in terms of preliminary injunctions. But who knows where it goes? The bigger risk isn’t with these executive orders. The bigger risk is Congress’s action right now.
Do you support AG Torrez’ approach in joining various lawsuits against the Trump administration?
California or New York, collectively, have thousands of lawyers who can just pay attention to the federal lawsuits. [Torrez] doesn’t have that luxury, so he has to be—pardon the pun—judicious, and we certainly understand that. I totally respect that he makes decisions about which places where he’s out front more. But we’re participating robustly, and I have no doubt that he is identified as one of the leaders. We are one of the states with the most to lose, given our federal footprint here, and he’s out there doing it. You’re going to see New York and California and Illinois —the bigger states—get a lot of attention. But I know that our AG is robustly engaged, and I’m glad. I need him to be and he is.
You have not been particularly outspoken or making public speeches about the Trump administration.
Because I don’t know what it does. I don’t need New Mexicans to be targeted when I may not have all the things I need to protect you adequately. I mean, these people at Homeland Security are terrifying. The abandonment of our constitutional rights and due process is terrifying. Now, I don’t want New Mexicans to think that I’m not tough. You know you got to be tough to roll up like a burrito and sneak into the White House. I took on Trump in a very public phone call during [COVID-19], and basically said, ‘You are not telling the truth. You never tell the truth, and I will not let you create a situation where New Mexicans aren’t protected.’ Right after that, we got on as the last tiered state for [Personal Protective Equipment] and COVID vaccines and testing supplies. Now I got that reversed, but what if I hadn’t gotten that reversed and we couldn’t get any testing kits? That’s a big problem, and so I know what the risks are.
But Trump [in his first term] was navigating. Trump [in his second term] has people who will do whatever he asks them to do. This is a whole different agenda. They’ll have to come through me to get to you, but I’m not going to invite them to drive over here and get into a boxing match, particularly when the courts are doing, I think, fairly well in terms of saying, ‘wait a minute, this doesn’t seem right. You don’t have the authority.’ I’m more worried about the cuts than anything.
But let’s talk about the stuff that we have done. We have really strong privacy laws. They’re not getting access to our data. We aren’t providing any of that legally protected information and we aren’t going to do it. They ask for it all the time. You can expect a whole lot more in the 30-day session. You’ve seen us really strengthen reproductive laws. We’ll probably do a state [Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act] EMTALA statutory protection, [in case] the feds take that away for reproductive health.










I don't need New Mexicans to be targeted when I may not have all the things I need to protect you adequately.


– Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham


New Mexico plays an important role in the Trump administration’s immigration and deportation agenda, partly because there’s a new so-called militarized buffer zone on the state’s border. What is your take on that?
I don’t like it for the number of risks it introduces to an area that needs more security and support, not more risk. I’m also worried because now I don’t have direct access in that militarized zone either. We would do sometimes…well more than 100 humanitarian rescues in that part of the desert. New Mexico is very dangerous to cross, and they will leave you out there, those coyotes, to die. But I’m more worried about [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] [and] anything that begins to interfere with due process, rights and constitutional protections. Believe it or not, I invited any of the feds in Homeland Security: ‘You want to go after bad actors through the Organized Crime Commission? I’m in. By the book. By the law. Due process.’ No, they’re not interested. What they want is for me to authorize or support them in convincing local police, including the state police, to do ICE enforcement and I’m not doing that because I think it’s unconstitutional.
The Times also had a story last month about [Michigan Gov.] Gretchen Whitmer and other Democratic governors trying to cultivate some kind of relationship with the Trump administration. Is that what you’re doing?
I wouldn’t call it cultivating a relationship, but part of your job as a governor, you get what you get at the federal level. In the Biden administration, you might imagine that I had some very challenging conversations with [former Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack], who kept burning down stuff here without…providing notice or following the rules. In any administration, I have very terse, aggressive stances, conversations, debates and lawsuits against the federal government. I also have great relationships with certain departments on certain issues, and I think you have to do that.
I do think, frankly, if you can get in to see the president, you can actually get him to be more reasonable. He likes you to propose a deal. I have asked to meet with the White House recently about a number of issues, not the least of which is, they owe me money for [the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant] for the roads. I need them to be serious about public safety. They rejected what we thought was an easy proposal: If you know where someone is on a felony warrant, let’s go, let’s do it together. You’re involved in a in a big fentanyl drug bust? Let’s do it together. I got sort of squarely rejected because their priority is massive deportations. And I said, ‘No, thank you.’ That’s not a deal I’m willing to be engaged in.
We had another big issue I was trying to navigate with them…[which was Liquified Natural Gas]. I was just in Japan and Singapore, and we’re pitching clean LNG. We reduce the world’s carbon footprint if we’re using our LNG, and they can’t produce geothermal and solar and wind in Japan and Singapore. So, they’re going to be using LNG. So, I wanted to talk to the White House about that because they’re not pushing the western states [for energy projects]. They’re pushing one state, and I’ll bet you can guess which one.
[Reporter feebly offers incorrect guess]
No, Alaska. So, I’m going to Alaska next week because: Don’t have a conversation about my energy without me at the table. I couldn’t get in to see the president. I got in to see some very nice liaisons. We’re working on economic development, on introducing the states [to] green energy [and] to a number of other countries. Some of the best methane detection companies are in Japan, so I want them locating here. You don’t need a foe who says, [the energy economy is] only in Alaska. Gretchen and other [Democratic state governors] are doing their jobs. I’m not looking to curry favor with any president. I’m looking to represent New Mexico effectively.

At a recent town Sen. Ben Ray Luján [D-N.M.] held, many attendees seemed to want a stronger response from Democrats. Some of them wanted Sen. Luján to go on the road with [Vermont Sen.] Bernie Sanders and [New York U.S. Rep.] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. You’ve been in politics a long time: Are you critical of how Democrats are handling this current moment?
I don’t know that I’m critical. For me, the politics here don’t solve the fact that I have to figure out how to keep a rural hospital open. I’m going to tell you how I answered a question recently. A person said, I think, that they didn’t vote for Trump, but they’re Republican —this wasn’t in New Mexico —and they said, ‘I just can’t support this president. What do I tell my kids?’ As people were talking about it, somebody else said, ‘Well, but there’s two sides to Trump.’ And they talked about the nice sides. And I said, ‘No, there are not two sides.’
I have to do my job to get the federal government to apply its resources here…but I’m not going to stand up and support a person who openly lies, is vile and abhorrent and doesn’t seem to understand or care that he creates real risk and people are harmed. I respect the office of presidency. I respect the federal government. I respect all the branches, but I can’t accept that behavior by any person, and I won’t excuse it. So, I get that people are really pissed. I do. That’s the word. I’m really pissed about it my own self.
These tours, I hope, are aimed more at getting Democrats to realize they have real choices. But in those real choices, be careful that you don’t actually create the opposite, which is that we are electing extremists on either side of the political spectrum. Congress can’t run like that. It isn’t running like that. Congress is broken. And when Congress is broken, you have sweeping changes. You can’t govern. You need a little bit of everything. You need a body that can govern and deliver.
We have to be very clear about what we need in [the 2026 midterm elections]. We can never allow people who lie to us, who aim to hurt us and punish us, who use the office for retribution, elected into any office ever again. And we need to be open minded. Don’t let what you think is the perfect solution be the enemy of good overall.
I am going to go to some of these town halls with our delegation because I think people want to know, ‘what do you think, and what are you doing?’ And I do have an opinion, and I am doing stuff, and I think that could be helpful because people deserve elected leaders to have a conversation about where we find ourselves today.

– NM Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham


Are you sorry you’re ending your tenure as governor in this particular federal climate?
I am sorry about that, because I don’t think the world deserves someone as reckless as the current president. You know, it’s very nice to have a president or a president-elect ask you to think about being a cabinet secretary, and to ask you to be thought about as a vice president. That’s very flattering, but I think people made assumptions that I was really interested in pushing that, and these two [gestures at Schlegel and Coleman] can tell you unequivocally: I wasn’t leaving. I like this job, and I don’t feel like I’m done. I feel like I need six more years. And I tease that I lost three with COVID-19 and fires.
But I’m also really proud: No state in the nation has our cradle to career system. We did far better economically than anyone thought we could. I’ve always believed that we could punch above our weight class. I think COVID really stalled out a lot of our educational potential progress [but] I think we’re going to get there.
What about the Children, Youth and Families Department?
CYFD is one of those really hard ones. We need to do more. We have had some missteps. There’s no question about that, but nobody wants to work there. And the more that you try to take it over, the less that’s the case. We have some ideas that didn’t get over the finish line that we can implement anyway, and we’re going to do what the Legislature told us to do in a robust and cooperative manner. I wish it was an easier road to hoe. Maybe on a happier note, at CYFD, 200 or 300 foster kids and families were at the residence on Saturday, and a lot of them have suggestions about what we need to do better, which is great, and we’re doing it. We are going to do a massive adoption effort and get lots of families all ready to go, and that’s really good news and exciting for these families and kids.
Your term doesn’t end for more than a year and a half, but do you know what you’re doing next?
I don’t quite know. I do want to work, and I think folks are expecting me to look at healthcare some more and look at energy. We really are a powerhouse, and we have the ability to do a lot more transition and green work, not just in the country, but around the world. I’m excited about that. [New Mexico is hosting the Western Governors Association in June] and we’re going to have a robust conversation. You cannot power the eastern United States without the western states.

(Win McNamee/Getty Images)Our soldiers have endured unimaginable hardships and faced profound challenges, testing the very limits of human resilience and strength. When they arrive home, the trauma many veterans experience abroad comes with them, and the toll it takes on their mental health can be devastating without intervention. Veterans will face additional challenges if promises of massive U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs layoffs around the country and in Idaho go forward.
Our veterans deserve better.
Several Americans have protested cuts to the VA. Here in Boise at the VA campus, local community members have supported those protests, demonstrating just how important VA services are to Idaho veterans. Our communities are concerned about access to behavioral health care for our veterans and with good cause. Military veterans are 57.3% more likely to die by suicide than non-veteran U.S. adults. This stark statistic reveals the harsh reality that our service members face, particularly those living in rural areas like many veterans do in Idaho. Our state has one of the highest rates of rural military populations, and it has a higher rate of VA reliance for health care than the national average.
The Trump administration aims to cut 83,000 jobs from Veterans Affairs. The VA is tasked with caring for our veterans who return home, it provides crucial medical and behavioral health services including telehealth services for our rural vets. At the Boise VA campus alone, we may lose 300 employees, and this is a VA that already lacks staff for the vets it serves.
Veterans and active-duty military personnel face unique challenges. Reintegrating into civilian life, Adverse Childhood Experiences (or ACEs) and post-traumatic stress all can contribute to poor mental health outcomes for our nation’s heroes.
Many veterans shy away from seeking help due to stigma, barriers to care created by the isolation of rural living, or a lack of access to services, but the need is real. Veterans in rural areas often feel most comfortable accessing these services through the VA, a community that knows what they have gone through, specifically telehealth options which can allow access to behavioral health professionals working from home.
Current changes by the administration have put into question these services, leaving our veterans uncertain about where they might find care in the future.
In Idaho, one of the most pressing issues connected with this uncertainty is the disproportionate suicide rates among service members. Research consistently shows that veterans, especially those living in remote, rural regions — a common way of life in Idaho — are at greater risk of suicide. A lack of accessible mental health services can prevent veterans in need from receiving vital care.
Furthermore, for patients at risk of suicide continuity of care, including consistent follow-ups with trusted health care providers is critical. Any threat to losing that continuity of care poses a significant danger, it is well known to be a key component of successful strategies to prevent suicide.
Veterans health care provided by the VA removes barriers to care associated with insurance accessibility and affordability, and in many cases has been offered with telehealth options. However, any health services required outside of the VA falls on the service members to cover. If the VA’s behavioral health services are disrupted in a way that jeopardizes telehealth for rural veterans, it not only creates a crisis in continuity of care but also establishes a significant barrier to access for many low-income veterans.


For more information on the Idaho Association of Free and Charitable Clinics, go to www.idahoafcc.org.


For veterans who are unable to access mental health services through the VA, safety net options such as the Idaho free and charitable clinics are crucial. These clinics are closely monitoring the situation, hoping for continued care and support for our nation’s heroes.
In the meantime, they can provide health care to any Idahoan without health insurance including our former service members. To ensure the wellbeing of our nation’s heroes, we must advocate for health care and behavioral health care as a basic human need, and work to improve and protect access to these services.
Veterans and service members deserve the support and care necessary to thrive, both during and after their service.

When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial.
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”

On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time.
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy.
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated.
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity.
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died.
Mary Connolly never remarried.
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said.
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said.
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.

“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life.
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved.
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.”
A final sendoff at last.

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-05-26 12:00:30+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,The Canadians no longer visit down the shore — but why’d they come here in the first place?,Jen A. Miller,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/05/26/the-canadians-no-longer-visit-down-the-shore-but-whyd-they-come-here-in-the-first-place/,Canadians used to be regular visitors to the Jersey Shore — but a poor economy up north and more recent hostility from the U.S. changed that.,"Avalon Campground in Cape May Court House was a top destination for Canadians who were regular summer visitors to the Jersey Shore starting in the 1970s. (Beach photo courtesy of the Greater Wildwoods Tourism Improvement and Development Authority)Last week while in Avalon, I stopped at the Cape May County Habitat for Humanity to look for deck furniture. I didn’t find any, but while looking through used books and sofa sectionals, I found a mug featuring a maple leaf. “Eh?” it also read in an equally bold red.
A Canadian mug in a South Jersey Shore second-hand store might seem like an oddity, but it’s becoming an artifact of another time and a signifier of the once-strong-but-now-fraying relationship between this part of New Jersey and Canada.
According to Statistics Canada, Canadian car trips into the United States this March are down almost 32% compared to March of last year. Things don’t look better for the summer either. According to a New York Times analysis, summer plane ticket sales from Canada to the U.S. are down 21%.
If this winter’s dip in Canadian snowbirds flying to Florida (and selling their Florida properties) is any indication, the Jersey Shore, particularly Cape May County, could see a similar drop. 
But in all the “will they or won’t they” coverage I’ve seen about the issue this year, I noticed one thing left out: why Canadians — in particular French Canadians — came here in the first place. Like the drive from Quebec to Wildwood, it’s a long and sometimes winding journey. 
A Canadian solution to an American problem
In the 1950s and 1960s, South Jersey Shore towns were in trouble.
Where they were once the only place people could go to escape stifling summer heat, the advent of air conditioning and swimming pools meant that relief could be found close to home instead — no long train or car ride required. 
Atlantic City turned to gambling. Cape May County? French Canadians. In 1970, Quebec legislated a two-week holiday for all construction workers for the end of July, a move that rippled out beyond the industry, with many residents of the province also taking that block of time off for summer vacation. Les Quebecois were also, theoretically, one day’s drive away, so starting in 1968, the county pitched them on better beaches, warmer water, and cheap accommodations in motels and rooming houses in Wildwood and in campgrounds that lined Route 9 just inland of beach towns like Sea Isle, Avalon, Stone Harbor, and the Wildwoods. 
In 1970, Cape May County opened a tourism office in downtown Montreal to further bind the regions. In 1973, a tourism official told The New York Times that they spent 75% of its promotional budget to attract Canadians. 
By the mid-1970s, the Canadians had taken over. Motels in the Wildwoods gave themselves names like Canadian and Quebec Motel, and venues booked Canadian stars like singer, radio, and television host Michel Louvain and Lousie-Marie Houde, a.k.a. Mademoiselle Quebec. In 1977, Atlantic City hosted Quebec Day to thank their Canadian visitors, with a flag raising, cocktail party, concert, and fashion show featuring Quebec-based artists. 
“Two weeks after the Fourth of July, cars were backed out all the way to Route 9 to see if we had campsites,” said Lenny Catanoso, 74, who until last year owned Avalon Campground in Cape May Court House with his sister Marlene. Their parents opened the business in 1967, and they were teenagers working there when the influx of Canadians started coming in. 
For part of July, “every car in town was Canadian. I haven’t seen anything like it,” said Larry Lillo, 77, Wildwood Historical Society secretary and owner of the Holly Beach Train Depot.
Lillo has also held a gamut of jobs during his lifetime in Wildwood, including ice cream salesman, lifeguard, and firefighter.
“It wasn’t just the mother and father and the kids. It was the grandmother, aunts, and uncles. The whole gang would come down and stay in apartment houses here,” he said.
I saw it too, as a kid who spent all of her summers in the 1980s and 1990s in Avalon Campground. While my family’s summer place is now in Avalon proper, we were there then for the same reasons as the Canadians: It was more affordable than on-island accommodations and offered more things to do for large family groups that might include parents and kids but also grandparents, cousins, and that guy who isn’t really your uncle but that’s what you call him. 
For the last two weeks of July and the first two weeks of August, 75% of the campground’s bookings were French Canadians, according to Lenny Cataonoso. You could see it — and hear it. The U.S., New Jersey, and Canadian flags all flew at the campground pools (where, yes, you could usually tell who was Canadian by their penchant for Speedo bathing suits). When it came time for me to pick a language to study in middle and then high school, I picked French, not because I had young girl dreams of Paris, but because I thought it would help me get a summer job down the shore when I was old enough to do so.
Currency, COVID, and conflict take a toll
I never got the chance. By the time I was old enough to work, the Canadian dollar plummeted in value, and the parade of Quebec license plates coming down the shore just about stopped. Marlene Catanoso, 72, remembers her father working the phones, offering regular Canadian visitors half-price tent spots. The Cape May County Montreal office closed in 1995. 
The relationship hasn’t entirely died out, though. Gen X and Millenial Canadians come back so their kids can have the same kind of magical Jersey Shore experience they had when they were younger. Cape May County still has a French language website and Facebook and Instagram accounts, and the county tourism department has a public relations consultant focusing on Quebec and the Toronto region of Ottawa. Before the pandemic, about 8% of Cape May County visitors were from Quebec. 
Marlene Catanoso said that older Canadian visitors stopped coming to their campground during the first Trump term, but COVID had a much bigger impact.
“For two years, we had a campground that was half empty,” she said.
It wasn’t just that the Canadian border was closed, but accommodations in the area shifted to attract locals who didn’t want to travel either. To cope, Avalon Campground converted sites that once had bare-bones amenities with tent campers in mind and upgraded them with sewer, water, and better power, in order to accommodate RVs, campers, and mobile homes — and charging for it.
Diane Weiland of Cape May County’s tourism department insisted that other factors, like the value of the Canadian dollar and a stagnant Canadian economy, are playing a bigger role in keeping the Canadians up north this summer than political discontent (though she did note that the Canadian Automobile Association has declined to run their ads; and Canadian news outlets won’t be covering U.S. destinations this year). But she believes the region will be OK, as local business owners have said that American travelers have been picking up Canadian cancellations. 
So, as the unofficial opening of the summer begins, and more restaurants, bakeries, bike shops, and arcades open for the season, we don’t know what will happen. But it’s hard to see how this more than half-century relationship can repaired, at least during this administration, when the president insists that Canada is going to be the 51st state, pushes punitive tariffs on Canadian goods at who knows what whim, and eggs on the imprisonment of foreign travelers for things like a visa mix up, translation mistake or having tattoo equipment. If I were Canadian, I wouldn’t come here. Heck, I’m an American with a beach house and don’t know if I want to be here this summer. I guess we’ll see, eh?

“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.
On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.

 Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.
Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
 Help for teachers

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.
Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Housing_RondaChurchill_012-aerial-vista-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-26 08:03:40.271589

(Stock photo by Peter Unger/Getty Images)Memorial Day is a time to set aside our differences and join together in remembering and thanking those brave souls who gave their last full measure for their fellow Americans. They deserve that honor even for serving in what some thought to be an ill-advised conflict. Vietnam turned out to be such a war, but that cannot take away from the fact that the 58,220 service personnel who died in that war were answering the call of their country and doing it well.
On Memorial Day, we think of the almost 1,355,000 service personnel who have perished in the nation’s conflicts, starting with the 70,000 who died in the Revolutionary War. Since then, about 655,000 died on both sides of the Civil War. The death toll in World War I was 116,516 and 406,399 died in World War II. The vicious and almost forgotten Korean War saw 36,574 deaths. After Vietnam, 2,325 died in the War in Afghanistan and 4,492 in the Iraq War. May they all rest in peace.
But there are others we should hold in our hearts in addition to those who died in the war theaters. War has a way of inflicting mortal injuries that only take their toll on veterans after the guns are silenced. They include illnesses caused by exposure to toxins, like poisonous gas in WWI, Agent Orange in Vietnam and burn pit fumes in the Gulf War, Afghanistan and Iraq. Those toxins have resulted in untold deaths from a variety of cancers and other diseases. They are not counted on the official death tallies, but they nevertheless are directly attributable to combat conditions.
Many veterans have experienced health problems attributable to wartime conditions or know of others who have. It has been estimated that about 300,000 Vietnam veterans have died because of exposure to Agent Orange. The late Dan Eismann, my colleague of 12 years on the Idaho Supreme Court, received substantial exposure to Agent Orange during two tours in Vietnam. While on the Court, he developed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and metastatic melanoma, passing away with honor last year. I was also exposed during my Vietnam service and developed pancreatic cancer in 2017. With surgery, chemo and a great deal of luck, I’ve been cured.
More recently, about 60,000 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are suffering and dying from medical ailments caused by exposure to toxins emanating from burn pits used to destroy all sorts of trash. Congress finally passed the PACT Act in 2022 to provide the necessary medical care, but the Act has not been funded for the current fiscal year. That is a serious breach of the country’s duty to those veterans.
There are many other serious problems that our veteran community faces on an all-too-frequent basis, including mental health issues, chronic substance abuse, suicide, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. There is obviously a lot of intermingling of these problems, but they present serious issues for many veterans.
While we can only honor the memories of the veterans who died in war zones, everyone concerned about our living veterans can take action to address problems presently confronting them. That could help to prevent future war-related deaths. When we see  veterans in distress, we can reach out to them, provide a voice of caring and make a referral to a helpline for expert assistance.
Everyone can provide a service to our community of living veterans by speaking out on their behalf in public. We should inform members of our Congressional delegation, as well as state and local leaders, that we expect them to advocate for preserving and protecting veterans and the benefits they have rightfully earned. The message must be that we will not put up with massive cuts of medical and support staffing at VA medical facilities. The lives and health of our veteran population must not be sacrificed based on unsupported claims of wasteful spending in veterans programs.
Our Senators and Congressmen should take aggressive action to maintain the current level of VA spending and to ensure funding of the PACT Act in the current budget fight. Funding must be restored for important programs designed to halt the war-related deaths of our veterans, including lifesaving cancer trials, mental health care, and suicide prevention. These essential programs, along with many others, must be restored, stabilized and adequately funded, in order to address war-related injuries and illnesses in our veteran population. They deserve nothing less.
On Memorial Day, May 26, let’s remember, honor and mourn those gallant Americans who gave their lives in service to this great country. We should also pay tribute to the veterans who died off of the battlefield because of war-related causes. And let’s resolve to do our utmost to prevent future loss of life for that veteran population.

A bus boycott began in Tallahassee, Florida, after Florida A&M students Wilhelmina Jakes and Carrie Patterson refused to give up their seats to white passengers. Police charged them with “placing themselves in a position to incite a riot.” 
After their arrest, the student body president, Broadus Harley, called for a meeting of the 2,300 students. They voted to boycott the buses, leading to two temporary shutdowns of the bus company. The police arrested 26 people in the protests. 
The Rev. C.K. Steele helped form the Inter-Civic Council, which created a car pool system for African Americans that city leaders attacked as an “illegal” business, leading to the arrest of Steele and others. He shot back to their opponents, “I would rather walk in dignity than ride in humiliation.” 
Council leaders were arrested and charged with operating an “illegal car pool.” Steele, Jakes and Patterson had crosses burned outside their homes. On Jan. 3, 1957, a federal judge ruled bus segregation laws unconstitutional. Four days later, Tallahassee’s city commission repealed its segregation clause.

In April 2025, the Supreme Court heard arguments about whether the nation’s first religious charter school could open in Oklahoma. The St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School would have been funded by taxpayer money but run by a local archdiocese and diocese. Several justices appeared open to the idea during questioning, leading some analysts to predict a win for the school.
They were proved wrong on May 22, 2025, when the court blocked St. Isidore. The one-sentence, unsigned order did not indicate how individual justices had voted, nor why, simply declaring it was a split 4-4 decision that leaves in place the Oklahoma Supreme Court’s ruling against the school. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case. Her former employer, the University of Notre Dame, runs a law clinic representing the school’s supporters.
Ever since the proposed school started making headlines, attention has focused on religion. Critics warned a decision in the school’s favor could allow government dollars to directly fund faith-based charter schools nationwide. In part, the justices had to decide whether the First Amendment’s prohibition on government establishing religion applies to charter schools.
But the answer to that question is part of an even bigger issue: Are charters really public in the first place?
The Supreme Court’s order applies only to Oklahoma, so similar cases attempting to open religious charter schools may emerge down the road. As two professors who study education law, we believe future court decisions could impact more than issues of religion and state, determining what basic rights students and teachers do or don’t have at charter schools.
 Dueling arguments

In June 2023, the Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board approved St. Isidore’s application to open as an online K-12 school. The following year, however, the Oklahoma high court ruled that the proposal was unconstitutional. The justices concluded that charter schools are public under state law, and that the First Amendment’s establishment clause forbids public schools from being religious. The court also found that a religious charter school would violate Oklahoma’s constitution, which specifically forbids public money from benefiting religious organizations.
On appeal, the charter school claimed that charter schools are private, and so the U.S. Constitution’s establishment clause does not apply.
Moreover, St. Isidore argued that if charter schools are private, the state’s prohibition on religious charters violates the First Amendment’s free exercise clause, which bars the government from limiting “the free exercise” of religion. Previous Supreme Court cases have found that states cannot prevent private religious entities from participating in generally available government programs solely because they are religious.
In other words, while St. Isidore’s critics argued that opening a religious charter school would violate the First Amendment, its supporters claimed the exact opposite: that forbidding religious charter schools would violate the First Amendment.
 Are charters public?

The question of whether an institution is public or private turns on a legal concept known as the “state action doctrine.” This principle provides that the government must follow the Constitution, while private entities do not have to. For example, unlike students in public schools, students in private schools do not have the constitutional right to due process for suspensions and expulsions – procedures to ensure fairness before taking disciplinary action.
Charter schools have some characteristics of both public and private institutions. Like traditional public schools, they are government-funded, free and open to all students. However, like private schools, they are free from many laws that apply to public schools, and they are independently run.
Because of charters’ hybrid nature, courts have had a hard time determining whether they should be considered public for legal purposes. Many charter schools are overseen by private corporations with privately appointed boards, and it is unclear whether these private entities are state actors. Two federal circuit courts have reached different conclusions.
In Caviness v. Horizon Learning Center, a case from 2010, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit held that an Arizona charter school corporation was not a state actor for employment purposes. Therefore, the board did not have to provide a teacher due process before firing him. The court reasoned that the corporation was a private actor that contracted with the state to provide educational services.
In contrast, the 4th Circuit ruled in 2022 that a North Carolina charter school board was a state actor under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In this case, Peltier v. Charter Day School, students challenged the dress code requirement that female students wear skirts because they were considered “fragile vessels.”
The court first reasoned that the board was a state actor because North Carolina had delegated its constitutional duty to provide education. The court observed that the charter school’s dress code was an inappropriate sex-based classification, and that school officials engaged in harmful gender stereotyping, violating the equal protection clause.
If the Supreme Court had sided with St. Isidore – as many analysts thought was likely – then all private charter corporations might have been considered nonstate actors for the purposes of religion.
But the stakes are even greater than that. State action involves more than just religion. Indeed, teachers and students in private schools do not have the constitutional rights related to free speech, search and seizure, due process and equal protection. In other words, if charter schools are not considered “state actors,” charter students and teachers may eventually shed constitutional rights “at the schoolhouse gate.”
 Amtrak: An alternate route?

When courts have held that charter schools are not public in state law, some legislatures have made changes to categorize them as public. For example, California passed a law to clarify that charter school students have the same due process rights as traditional public school students after a court ruled otherwise.
Likewise, we believe states looking to clear up charter schools’ ambiguous state actor status under the Constitution can amend their laws. As we explain in a recent legal article, a 1995 Supreme Court case involving Amtrak illustrates how this can be done.
Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation arose when Amtrak rejected a billboard ad for being political. The advertiser sued, arguing that the corporation had violated his First Amendment right to free speech. Since private organizations are not required to protect free speech rights, the case hinged on whether Amtrak qualified as a government agency.
The court ruled in the plaintiff’s favor, reasoning that Amtrak was a government actor because it was created by special law, served important governmental objectives and its board members were appointed by the government.
Courts have applied this ruling in other instances. For example, the 10th Circuit ruled in 2016 that the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children was a governmental agency and therefore was required to abide by the Fourth Amendment’s protection from unreasonable search and seizure.
Since the Supreme Court did not release any reasoning for its order, we do not know how the justices viewed the “government actor” question in the case from Oklahoma. That said, we believe charter schools fail the test set out in the Amtrak decision. Charter schools do serve the governmental purpose of providing educational choice for students. However, charter school corporations are not created by special law. They also fall short because most have independent boards instead of members who are appointed and removed by government officials.
However, we would argue that states can amend their laws to comply with Lebron’s standard, ensuring that charter schools are public or state actors for constitutional purposes.

Most people will not need to apply.","The Summer EBT program provides an extra infusion of funds for food over the summer when children are out of school and do not have access to reduced price or free breakfast and lunch. This is the second year the program, federally known as SUN Bucks, is offered to eligible families.
Connecticut is one of 38 states, along with several tribal nations and U.S. territories, participating in SUN Bucks this year. Through the program, families receive a one-time benefit of $120 per child to spend on food. Around 300,000 children in Connecticut are expected to be served by the initiative this year.
Do I need to enroll? 
According to Daniel Giacomi, the director of program oversight and grant administration at the Department of Social Services (DSS), most families will not have to apply but rather will be automatically enrolled in the program. That includes children between 5 and 18 years old who receive SNAP benefits or Temporary Family Assistance, are on HUSKY A with an income at or below 185% of the federal poverty line, and children who have applied for the national school lunch program at their school and were determined eligible for the 2024-25 school year. In all, DSS says that 97% of recipients will be automatically enrolled.
If your child does not fall into one of those categories but your household income is less than 185% of the federal poverty line, you can apply for the program by visiting this link, starting in June. DSS says enrollment is not yet available because they are still making enhancements to the application.
When will benefits begin? 
Benefits will be added to EBT cards at the end of June or the beginning of July, but a precise date has not yet been confirmed, according to DSS. While last year the benefits were delayed after Connecticut agencies failed to effectively coordinate the launch of the program, Giacomi said that he did not anticipate a similar snafu this summer.
“We took the lessons learned from last year, and the hiccups that came along with it, to minimize the repeating of the same issue, so at this time, we don’t foresee any issues in being able to distribute the benefits on time,” he said.
What can the money be used for? 
Similar to the SNAP program, the money can only be used to buy food and can’t be used on prepared food. It can’t be used at restaurants, but it can be used for food from the grocery store or farmer’s market, and to buy plants that are used to grow food.
There are also a number of farmer’s markets throughout the state that offer SNAP doubling, so that $20 worth of produce can be purchased for 10 SNAP dollars, for example. 
Why is the program needed? 
During the summer months, children who rely on reduced price or free meals at school suddenly lose that source of food. The Summer EBT program was created by Congress in 2022 and is operated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to bridge that gap.
“We know that kids are home. We know obviously kids are hungry. Having two children myself, they eat more than I could possibly have ever imagined that small children would eat,” Giacomi said. “So having any amount, you know, having any funding to be able to lessen the burden upon their families is worthwhile and is something that we’ll do everything in our power to be able to continue and to operate as efficiently as possible.”
Will federal cuts impact the program? 
While Congress is currently debating a tax bill that could cut SNAP benefits by about 30%, Giacomi said it’s still unclear whether the Summer EBT program will be impacted.
“We’re taking this year as it comes. We’ve received approval to operate the program, so that’s how we’re proceeding,” he said. “But obviously we’re in communications with our federal partners, both at the USDA as well as our congressional delegation, to determine whether there would be any operational challenges in future years.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2024_0709_THM_EBTsalesign-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-26 08:03:40.271589

Memorial Day is a day of remembrance for those who made the ultimate sacrifice for this country. But this year, a gray cloud hangs over the occasion.
Since Jan. 20, we’ve witnessed a clear and coordinated effort to erase the contributions of many service members who died defending the very freedoms we hold dear, an attempt to ease the discomfort that comes with confronting hard truths about our nation’s history. The reality is simple: Americans of all backgrounds have long played a significant role in securing the liberties that define this country.

During my 22 years of active federal service, I proudly served six combat tours, from Kosovo to Iraq to Afghanistan. I carry the weight of every deployment.
In Iraq, 2003, as a noncommissioned officer, I witnessed a young African American father killed in action. He never got to see his daughter take her first steps, graduate or walk down the aisle. That same sorrow followed me to Afghanistan in 2016, as a senior enlisted advisor in Kabul, conducting a ramp ceremony for a Caucasian American 18-year-old recent high school graduate killed in action. He had his whole life ahead of him, but laid it down so that young women and children in Afghanistan might have a better life.
Like so many before me, service members have sacrificed, endured and stood firm in defense of the values America claims to uphold. Throughout history, African American veterans have fought with honor, on foreign battlefields and here at home. Many gave their lives in service, generation after generation, and now their contributions are starting to be ignored, sacrifices buried under systemic neglect, literally being erased from military records, including  at Arlington National Cemetery and at service academies.

This country was built on the ideals of liberty, equality and the pursuit of happiness, principles that have too often been denied to many veterans. For generations, service men and women have laid down their lives for this country, in the hope that their children might one day inherit the full promise of the American Dream.

As Memorial Day becomes more associated with the start of summer than with solemn remembrance, I urge you to pause. Reflect on the lives lost to make our freedom possible, especially those who never returned home, whose families were left to grieve in a country that too often denied them the very rights their loved ones died to protect.
It is deeply disappointing to see individuals in positions of influence and power show such disregard for the lives lost in defense of this nation. When Memorial Day is politicized or dismissed, it dishonors every man and woman who gave all.
This holiday is more than symbolic. It is a sacred testament to sacrifice, service and the enduring legacy of groups like the Tuskegee Airmen, who helped change the course of World War II, even as they faced discrimination at home.
Amid both domestic turmoil and international uncertainty, understand this: the unrelenting sacrifice of any veteran, including African American veterans, helped build the superpower that America is today. There is no freedom, no liberty, no pursuit of happiness without those who came before us and gave everything they had.
Let us remember them, not just with words, but with the dignity and recognition they earned.

It is in knowing each other that we will come to find ways to care about our common humanity.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Alis Headlam: Inclusion Week and Gov. Phil Scott.","This commentary is by Alis Headlam of Rutland.Gov. Phil Scott of Vermont proclaimed the second week in May as Inclusion Week for the fifth year in a row. Although the week has already gone by, his message should resonate with every Vermonter. His post on Facebook reminded us that “All of us are part of the story of America, those seeking liberty and fundamental freedoms of speech, religions and equal rights that no other country can provide.” We are all a part of the human family that contributes not only to our small state and to the country, but to the world. According to comments made on Facebook after his speech was posted it is clear that some people do not clearly understand or accept the premise that inclusion is important. It will take time to help everyone understand that the concept is not a threat to any individual, but rather a way of looking forward towards justice and fairness for all. It is important that we recognize the fact that although we accept and welcome each other, there are differences that must be met with certain parameters. Inclusion does not imply equality in all aspects of our lives but rather equity. We don’t all need the same medicine if we are not ill. We don’t all need the exact same education if we are going to perform the various tasks needed to keep our communities thriving. The similarity is that we all have the same basic needs. We all need to nourish ourselves both body and mind. We need to live in safety that includes shelter and sufficient nourishment for our bodies. It means that with equity we seek to meet the needs of everyone, but also understand that we have different needs depending on our circumstances.Some of us will be teachers. Others will be plumbers or electricians. Some people provide services while others will act as administrators. No matter what road we take in life we all make a difference. Gov. Scott said, “Vermont must continue to be a welcoming place for all people by protecting civil rights, opposing hate, discrimination and bigotry whenever and wherever it shows up to improve the lives of all Vermonters.”Justice for all of us means that we have certain laws to obey. Laws that are passed by our legislators both at the national and state levels of government, not by an executive branch. In our system of checks and balances the Legislature proposes the laws and passes them, and then they are certified by our executive branch — or should that not happen, the Legislature can override the executive branch.The executive branch can issue proclamations and executive orders which are not laws. There is no legal way to enforce these wishes. But our leaders give us guidance that we can all abide by if we choose. So when Gov. Scott issued a proclamation for inclusion it is not a law that we must abide by. Rather it is a strong statement of what should guide our lives.Asked what the plan is to execute this proclamation, the answer is obvious. It is up to each of us to follow his advice as best we can. He says, “I hope you’ll take time to get to know your neighbors, learn about a culture or a tradition that is not your own.” It is in knowing each other that we will come to find ways to care about our common humanity. We don’t have to agree on everything. We don’t even have to like each other, but we should try to understand each other so that we can live peaceably.It is only by making this a priority in our lives that we will find the way to live with all of our neighbors in a peaceful existence. World peace is possible, but it will take the entire human family to make it happen. Read the story on VTDigger here:  Alis Headlam: Inclusion Week and Gov.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Eve O. Schaub: Why we turned our hayfield into an art protest.","This commentary is by Eve O. Schaub of Pawlet. She and her husband Stephen create artworks under the name EveNSteve. Their Hayfield Art Gallery is free and open to the public every day, dawn to dusk.My husband and I are artists, and for the last five years we’ve been putting up a free outdoor art exhibit in the hayfield across the street from our house in Pawlet, as a way to express gratitude to our community.This spring, like other years, we were formulating a plan for a new show, but as the news of 2025 kept rolling in, we felt an urgency to address the rapidly shifting landscape in the world of the arts. We wanted to create a space to pose and contemplate what is happening.Consequently, this year, instead of a mixed media display of photographs with hand painted text, we have a 32-foot artwork in the hayfield that simply reads “WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DEFUND THE ARTS?” The other four scaffoldings that normally exhibit artworks are all painted black.READ MORE
The arts help us make sense of the world. In fact, during the pandemic, this is why we felt so strongly — as art venues and public spaces were closing, and shows and events were all being cancelled one after another — that we needed to find alternative venues for people to experience art. This is how the Hayfield Art Gallery was born.At first, we literally had no idea what we were doing. Would the artwork last? Would the frameworks hold up over time? Would people just hate it? What if, after investing all the time and expense, we ourselves deemed it a failure, which of course happens in art all the time?We built one artwork, a black and white photograph of a woman in an orchard, 12 feet long and painted into it words prompted by our Covid-19 experience: “My heart is very big. Sometimes I wonder if it is big enough.”Thankfully not only did we like it, but our neighbors did too. Horns honked and hands waved as cars drove down our road. People learned about our project and came from far and wide to see it, some getting out of their cars and walking the field. During a very dark time, we had found a way to create some light.We kept going, adding additional scaffoldings, becoming more ambitious. We had a conversation with our town zoning administrator to explain why this free outdoor art display did not violate Vermont’s billboard ban. The town ultimately agreed with our argument and the artworks remained, ultimately becoming a revolving annual exhibition open to all.The days of the pandemic are now, thankfully, behind us. During that time, we all found reason to turn to the creative arts to help make sense of the world, to find hope, distraction, solace. Movies, songs, podcasts, books, poetry, art of all kinds took on a renewed significance.The recent efforts to defund the arts represent a different kind of dark time. The current administration is proposing to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts. Drastic NEA cuts have already affected Vermont institutions as varied as the Vermont Symphony Orchestra, the Flynn Theater and the Governor’s Institutes of Vermont.It’s important to note that the NEA is one of the largest arts funders in the U.S., yet it is also one of the smallest federal agencies. It does a tremendous amount of good with very little.Last year each taxpayer paid less than one dollar to support the NEA, and its entire budget represented about 0.003% of the federal budget. The NEA brings concerts, readings, performances and arts education to the entire country, including underserved, impoverished and rural communities, all for less than the cost of a cup of coffee.Our show for 2025 sincerely asks the question: What happens when we defund the arts? But it also asks it rhetorically, because the surrounding blank canvases represent one answer: when you defund the arts you are left with darkness.Read the story on VTDigger here:  Eve O.

Martin Library, Northeast Minnesota Historical Collections) When I was young my grandfather told me that he emigrated from Austria-Hungary as a teenager in 1907 to avoid being drafted into the army of the Habsburg Empire. Like many Europeans, he was trying to avoid the big war that seemed to be coming. As it turned out, migrating to Chicago was not enough. In 1917, the United States declared war on Germany and conscripted men to fight in Europe, requiring all men 21 to 30 to register. My grandfather showed up on June 5, 1917, the national registration day.
According to family lore, he would have done anything, even broken his arm, to avoid being drafted. Fortunately, his draft board exempted him because he was married and had a 4-year-old son. Unfortunately, his wife died in November 1918, a victim of the influenza pandemic that spread across the country largely through the army’s huge training camps. My grandfather’s experience was my first glimpse of the wrenching impact of World War I on individual Americans.
People “make their own history,” Karl Marx observed, “but they do not make it just as they please.” We are born into a specific set of geographic, social, cultural and economic circumstances that open opportunities, at least for some, but also puts limits on individual lives — limits that for many are stark and brutal. The impact of world-changing events on individuals comes into sharp focus during times of massive social upheaval, like periods of invasion or total mobilization for war. Leo Tolstoy famously demonstrated this in “War and Peace.” Once Napoleon decided to invade Russia with a huge army, the lives of every Russian in his path would never be the same. A century later, Vasily Grossman, another great Russian writer, wrote two massive novels showing how Hitler’s army, even larger than Napoleon’s army, trampled on the personal life of every Soviet citizen, particularly those of Jewish ancestry.
The impact of World War I on Europeans needs no introduction. The armies of the belligerent states suffered more than 30 million casualties, of which about 10 million were fatalities from combat or disease. The wounded were often permanently disabled or horribly disfigured. Millions of civilians also perished, often the victims of war crimes. Postwar Europe was a continent of mourners, especially the 3 million war widows.  Personal lives were thrown up for grabs by the collapse of the Russian, German, Habsburg and Ottoman empires. Even victorious countries like Britain and France limped into the 1920s in debt and clinging precariously to their empires. The stage was set for fascism, which also came to have a profound impact on individual lives.
Americans also experienced serious disruptions in daily life during World War I, even though our country entered the war late and suffered only a small fraction of the casualties sustained by Europeans. Citizens faced a massive propaganda campaign to build support for the war, as well as food rationing, aggressive Liberty Bond drives, government-sanctioned vigilantism, prosecutions under the Espionage Act for dissenting speech, and of course, the drafting of young men, many of whom had recently arrived from Europe to escape conscription. There was no avoiding the war even half a world away from the Western Front.
When the conflagration broke out in Europe in 1914, Americans were living through a wrenching transition to a new, centralized form of industrial capitalism, dominated by corporations rather than entrepreneurs, where “trusts” held near monopolistic power in banking, mining, steel and transport. Industrialization stimulated relocation, immigrants continued arriving from Europe, and Black Americans began the Great Migration to northern cities. Economic inequality reached astounding levels, with men like Carnegie and Rockefeller rich beyond belief while millions lived at subsistence levels.
As passionately divided as Americans were about the war, it was hardly the only source of tension. The United States entered World War I during a contentious period when farmer and worker militancy challenged entrenched economic power, the elected mayors in several cities (including Minneapolis) were Socialist Party members, Black Americans struggled against Jim Crow and white nationalist terrorism, women were in their final surge toward suffrage, and millions campaigned for “prohibition” in the belief that alcohol was a fundamental source of the country’s problems. As David Kennedy wrote in his indispensable book on the American home front, “Americans went to war in 1917 not only against Germans in the fields of France but against each other at home.” What happened on the home front, he continued, “was a deadly serious contest to determine the consequences of the crisis for the character of American economic, social and political life.”
Over a century later many find it hard to believe that relatively peaceful and well-mannered Minnesota was an explosive hotspot in this “war at home.” Exploring Minnesota’s history from the beginning of the European war in August 1914 through the 1920 election provides a unique vantage point from which to assess the impact of World War I on American society. Those years in Minnesota were marked by bitter political polarization, ethnic intolerance, a flagrant disregard for democratic norms and the rule of law by business leaders, and intense conflicts sometimes punctuated by violence.
This was partly the result of timing. The controversial declaration of war on Germany coincided with an intense period of battles between Minnesota’s grain milling industry, mining conglomerate, big banks, and railroads on the one hand — and the organizations representing farmers and workers on the other. The success of the Nonpartisan League in organizing farmers and the influence of the Industrial Workers of the World among miners and loggers sent shock waves through the state’s business elite. As a result, ongoing economic, social, and political conflicts merged with new ones generated by the war and the draft.
 Soon, editors of German-language newspapers were investigated as possible spies, farmers arguing for market equity were attacked as “disloyal,” and workers trying to get union contracts were branded as “Bolsheviks.”
As war was declared, the Legislature created the Minnesota Commission of Public Safety  and gave it nearly unlimited power until the armistice. The commission consisted of Gov. Joseph Burnquist, the attorney general, and five men appointed by the governor, mostly conservative businessmen. John McGee became the dominant personality in this powerful body, and until the war ended, the most powerful man in Minnesota. McGee was the oldest son of Irish immigrant farmers, and he became a successful Minneapolis lawyer representing banks and railroads. He set a tone of uncompromising nationalism and maintained that anything less than 100% support for the war effort was treasonous. McGee focused on building the Home Guard, an armed force available to enforce “loyalty,” curb the growing political power of angry farmers, and block trade unions trying to break through employers’ resistance to collective bargaining.
For McGee, the most dangerously disloyal man in the state was Charles A. Lindbergh, Sr., the Little Falls lawyer who in 1914 was elected to his fifth consecutive term in the United States Congress. Lindbergh, the only son of Swedish immigrant farmers, had emerged as a leader of the Minnesota Republican Party’s progressive wing. While in Congress, he fought a determined battle to limit the power of Wall Street bankers. Lindbergh’s radical populism put him in the same camp as Robert La Follette, known as “Fighting Bob,” the fiery senator from Wisconsin. Having left Congress, Lindbergh accepted the nomination of the Nonpartisan League to run against Joseph Burnquist in the 1918 Republican primary for governor. Their electoral battle was the climax of the war for the Minnesota home front, and the most violent campaign in Minnesota history. Lindbergh is one of the most important figures in Minnesota political history but largely forgotten, eclipsed by the fame of his aviator son who bears his name.
* * *
Although Minnesota’s home front experience was the product of a particular confluence of events and personalities, the issues it raises have not been left safely in the past. 
Studying this history can alert us to how extreme economic inequality can warp democracy, how patriotism can be used to suppress fundamental rights, how politicians can harness racism and anti-immigrant nationalism to further their agendas, and how the wealthy sometimes resort to authoritarianism when their power is threatened.  Hopefully exploring these years of sharp polarization can help us navigate our own perilous times.

I was flying a mission in a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter over northern Kuwait near the Iraq border when I learned that terrorists had attacked our homeland. 
I remember the flood of emotions that hit me — shock, sorrow, anger, and an overwhelming sense of resolve. In that moment, the mission became personal. The idea of service, which had always been central to my life, was no longer just about duty — it became about defending the people I loved, the nation I swore to protect, and the ideals that define us as Americans.
As a soldier and an American, I am humbled by the memory of those we honor on Memorial Day. From the beaches of Normandy to the jungles of Vietnam, from the fields of Gettysburg to the deserts of Iraq, generations of selfless men and women have laid down their lives so that we may enjoy the blessings of freedom, security, and peace.
Every headstone at Arlington National Cemetery, every name etched on a memorial wall, tells the unique sacrifice of a Soldier, Sailor, Airman, or Marine who gave everything in the service of something greater than themselves, and we will never forget them.
The origins of Memorial Day trace back to the Civil War, a conflict so brutal it claimed more American lives than any war in our history. After the devastation brought about by that war, America committed to the idea of remembering and honoring our fallen. That brought about many of today’s memorials, including the Soldiers and Sailors Monument in downtown Indianapolis. Over the nearly 250 years of our nation, what remains constant is the character of those who wear the uniform: courage, sacrifice, and a love of country that transcends self-interest. 
Whenever I am in Washington D.C., I find time to stop by the Lincoln Memorial and take a moment to reflect by reading the Gettysburg Address etched in the memorial wall. I always walk away humbled and with a renewed sense of purpose because of the words President Lincoln spoke that day.
“The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us, the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain.”
As we approach this long weekend and the unofficial start of summer, let us remember the true meaning of Memorial Day — to honor the cost of freedom and remember those who paid it for us. This weekend is for the people who never made it home, whose lives were cut short in the pursuit of liberty.
To my fellow service members, past and present, I say thank you. To the Gold Star families, know that your loved ones will never be forgotten — their sacrifice lives on in the heart of this nation. And to all Americans: may we honor the fallen not just today, but every day, through our commitment to the values they fought and died to protect.
Honoring their names means more than offering gratitude. It means carrying forward the ideals they believed in — freedom, justice, and unity — and understanding that the fight to preserve them is never over.

(Provided/Robert Smalls Monument Commission)When Rob Edwards started telling people he was writing a comic book about South Carolina Civil War hero Robert Smalls, he’d have to accompany it with an explanation of Smalls’ life.
Now, when he mentions his graphic novel, many people already know Smalls’ story, he said.
“It’s really fantastic to see,” said Edwards, a writer and producer who lives in Los Angeles. “And no one is more deserving than Capt. Smalls himself.”
Edwards’ upcoming graphic novel “DEFIANT,” which he hopes to turn into a feature-length film, is part of a broader effort to educate the public about a story that had been largely forgotten, including Smalls’ escape from slavery on a commandeered Confederate ship and his time as a state legislator and five-term congressman.
South Carolina legislators are planning to commemorate Smalls’ life with a statue across from the Statehouse visitors’ entrance, the first on the grounds recognizing an individual Black person.
A joint committee of senators and representatives approved plans for the statue May 8, on the last day of the 2025 session. The vote by the State House Committee affirmed the design and location chosen by the commission created by a bill the Legislature approved unanimously last year.
  “DEFIANT” is a comic book slated for release June 19 telling the story of Civil War hero Robert Smalls. (Provided/Legion M)
“He’s probably one of the greatest South Carolinians of all time, as is well documented,” former Sen. Gerald Malloy, who is in charge of fundraising to build the statue, said during a recent trip to scout out the Statehouse grounds with the statue’s artist.
Edwards, who has written movies for titans such as Disney and Marvel, didn’t know Smalls’ story either when a friend first brought him the idea.
The friend had seen a post on X, formerly Twitter, asking why of all the movies being made none had featured the action-packed story of Smalls’ escape on the U.S.S. Planter in Charleston and ensuing life in politics.
That intrigued Edwards, who started researching Smalls’ life.
He got in touch with Michael B. Moore, Smalls’ great-great-grandson, as well as a Harvard historian who studied Smalls, trying to learn as much as possible.
It was crucial to get the details of Smalls’ incredible feats correct, Edwards said.
“Because it’s true and because it’s phenomenal, (the story) has to reflect reality or else somebody’s going to say, ‘Oh, come on, that didn’t happen,’” Edwards said.
The part of Smalls’ story people tend to know is what Edwards calls “the heist:” Under cover of night, Smalls stole the Confederate ship he piloted and, using Confederate disguises and hand signals, delivered himself, his family and other enslaved workers to freedom in Union waters.
Exciting as that story is, Edwards was drawn to Smalls’ life as a free man. He became the first Black man to pilot ships for the U.S. Navy, used his prize money for capturing the steamship he hijacked to buy the same mansion where he had been enslaved, and became a renowned politician.
During Reconstruction, Smalls was part of the majority-Black convention of delegates who wrote the state’s 1868 constitution, which promised free education to all children and voting rights to all men. He served in the state House and Senate before winning a seat in Congress in 1874.
In 1895, Smalls was again a delegate for a convention — this time majority white — to rewrite the state constitution. He pleaded for a constitution guaranteeing “free and honest” elections while recognizing the convention was meant to disenfranchise Black voters.
“That was the stuff that was really amazing to me,” Edwards said.
Edwards, whose writing credits include Disney’s “The Princess and the Frog” and Marvel’s “Captain America: Brave New World,” wanted to turn the story into a movie, but he knew selling the script might prove difficult.
He wanted proof that this was a story people cared about.
So, he and a team launched a fundraising campaign through Legion M, a company that lets people back projects they want to see happen. The plan was to start with the comic book to drum up more interest, then set sights on a movie.
Almost as soon as the campaign was posted, donations started flooding in, Edwards said. As of Friday, the project had raised about $160,000.
That was enough to get the comic book started, Edwards said. Once that’s out in the world, his hope is that it will be compelling enough to prove people want to see a live-action movie about Smalls’ life.
In the meantime, comic books appeal to teenagers, which is the audience Edwards most wants to reach.
“The thing that I would most want to tell a 16-year-old is, ‘Hey, there was this guy, he was born a slave, and look what he did,’” Edwards said. “If he can do that, then think of the things you can do.”

Edwards partnered with illustrators Nikolas Draper-Ivey, who created the art that accompanies the soundtrack for Marvel’s “Black Panther,” and Ray-Anthony Height, a longtime comic book artist who has created illustrations for Marvel and Star Wars comics.
The comic book, titled “DEFIANT: The Story of Robert Smalls,” is set for release June 19, which is also Juneteenth, a federal holiday celebrating the day slaves in Texas learned they were free in 1865.
The release date has become especially significant after the Defense Intelligence Agency ordered a pause in events related to Juneteenth, alongside other holidays, following an executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs earlier this year, Edwards said.
“We’re in this really interesting time when I think inspirational stories like ‘DEFIANT’ are really, really important,” Edwards said. “I’m thrilled that we’re able to be part of the Juneteenth celebration with this book.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-08-at-3.50.25-PM-1024x581.png,,,2025-05-26 08:03:40.271589

(Photo by Tracey Attlee)More than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery.
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial.
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time.
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy.
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated.
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity.
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died.
Mary Connolly never remarried.
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said.
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said.
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”

There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life.
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved.
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.”
A final sendoff at last.

But he could have been after putting a loaded pistol in his mouth in October 2021. 
Terhune had been deployed to Iraq in 2003 and again in 2007. His second two-year mission was cut short in 2008 after he contracted leishmaniasis, which causes skin lesions and ulcers, and was taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for treatment.

He retired from the Reserves in 2015 after 24 years in service and later from his position at the Tallahassee Fire Department, where he worked for 28 years, in 2020.
The separations, though, left him feeling lost.
“I couldn’t take it anymore and the hurt, the pain,” Terhune said. “It was physical pain that was eating my gut, my kidneys. I walked out on my back patio with my pistol, and after my wife and kids went to school, and I said, ‘I’m done. I just can’t do this.’ 
“And as I’m sticking the pistol in my mouth, Tyler, my friend who killed himself the year prior, was standing in front of me. And call it divine intervention or whatever. But he said, ‘Doc, stop. You have so much more to give.’ And then he was gone,” Terhuune recalled in an interview.
“It was almost like a slap in the face. And I thought it was the bullet honestly going through my head — that’s what I thought the slap in the face was. But I realized at that point. I said, ‘What am I doing?’ And I threw the gun down.”
Terhune immediately called a counselor he and his wife had been seeing for couples therapy. While he had been going to counseling, he’d never been put on medication. He found, however, that that was a necessary part of the solution for him.
Now Terhune runs a nonprofit organization, Team Guardian Inc.
“I feel like I’ve been given this opportunity to tell this story, because everybody who knows me is like, ‘What? There is no way that I would have ever thought that you would have gone down this road.’” Terhune said.  
“And so now I run a nonprofit, do a bunch of veteran stuff. But basically it’s about being there. I’m willing to get up in the middle of the night, and I’ve had people call me, you know, crying and saying, ‘You know, I need help.’ And I’m willing to get up in the middle of the night, go to your house, and sit and talk and get you through this.”
The Fire Watch
The National Library of Medicine notes that “suicide is a major public health challenge that disproportionately affects service members and veterans.” And for the past 12 years, suicide rates have been consistently higher among veterans than nonveterans.
Six hundred and twenty-two Florida military veterans killed themselves in 2023, the latest available data. That’s a dip from 655 veteran suicides in 2022 but an increase from the 612 Florida military veterans who killed themselves in 2021. 
But another effort to identify and help veterans at risk of suicide is showing signs of success in Florida.
Veteran suicide rates in the state dropped by 5% between 2019 and 2023, compared to just 1% nationally. But in a five-county area in Northeast Florida, the suicide rate dropped by 25% between 2019 and 2023, from 81 to 61, Florida Department of Health data show.
Nick Howland maintains that his organization, The Fire Watch, is helping to drive down the suicide rate in Duval, Clay, Baker, St. Johns, and Nassau counties through its “Watch Stander” program.
Since starting the program in Jacksonville in 2019, Howland and other founding members of The Fire Watch took a page from the American Heart Association, which in 1960 launched a closed-chest cardiac resuscitation course for physicians. It was the forerunner of CPR training for the general public.
Under the model, participants take a 45-minute course learning what is called “SAVE” training, teaching the “SIGNS” of crisis: ASK the veterans if they are considering suicide; VALIDATE the veterans’ experience; and EXPEDITE getting the veteran help. 
“Basically, what we do is train community members to recognize the warning signs of a veteran in crisis, to ask them if they need help, and to give them the help they need,” Howland said. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“It’s inspired by CPR, because, you know, CPR basically isn’t training you to be a paramedic or a cardiologist. It’s training you to recognize when something’s different and to get help quick. And that’s what we’re doing.”
For Howland, the key to the program is broad community involvement, not just buy-in from the veterans community.
“There’s only 9% of the country who has served. So, if you’re relying on that 9% of the country to get veterans who are showing risk science to help, you’re leaving out a whole section, 91% of the people, who could be helping,” he told the Florida Phoenix. 
“What we do is train community members to recognize the warning signs of a veteran in crisis, to ask them if they need help, and to give them the help they need. “
Half of the 9,000 volunteer watch-standers, he said, reside in northeast Florida.
The program expanded to Hillsborough, Pinellas, Broward, Palm Beach, and Escambia Counties two years after its launch. The expansion locations have collectively experienced a 12% reduction in veteran suicides, according to Howland.
The other 57 counties lacking The Watch Stander program experienced a collective 2% reduction in veteran suicide rates, he said.
All of Howland’s statistics are based on Department of Health CHARTS (community health assessment resource tools data) and U.S. Census American Community Survey data. 
Meeting its goals
The Fire Watch has a vision statement: To end veteran suicide by preventing veteran suicide.
But that takes time.
The Fire Watch’s goals this year are to train 10,000 volunteers through its Watch Standers program, hoping that 70% of them interact with veterans quarterly and that 30% of the veterans with whom watch-standers interact will be referred for health care services.
It appears to be on track to meet those goals. 
The Centers for Disease Control Foundation developed a quarterly survey for The Fire Watch to track volunteer watch-standers’ efforts. The data show that since the second quarter of 2023, at least 76% of watch-finders have engaged with a veteran and that there’s never been under than a 31% referral rate (with a high 48% referral rate in 3Q 2024).
Howland’s third goal is to reduce suicide rates by 25% for three consecutive years in the 10-county area.
To date, that goal has proven more elusive.
Although there’s been a 25% reduction in veteran suicides between 2019 and 2023, the number per year has gone up and down. The number in Northeast Florida dropped to 38 in 2021 but jumped to 59 the following year, mostly due to an increase in Duval County.
The number of veteran suicides in Duval County nearly doubled between 2021 and 2022 jumping from 22 to 41, respectively.
As for Terhune, he said he has a list of people he contacts weekly.
“Whether they have medical issues or they’re struggling mentally or whatever else. I go down this list and I call them, and that could be that slap in the face, you know, someone sitting there with a pistol in their lap, getting ready to shoot themselves. And that could be that time that makes them rethink that, or stop, or realize that they do have more to give.”

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerThis story by Liberty Darr was first published in the Other Paper on May 22.The City of South Burlington is pausing its effort to expand local voting rights to all legal residents.All resident voting would allow all the city’s legal residents, including those who are noncitizens, to vote in local elections and other supplementary school or city votes. The idea was first brought to the city council by the city’s Democratic committee last September with the hopes of having it placed on this year’s Town Meeting Day ballot. Since this would require a charter change, the city must bring the question to the voters for approval.While the committee at the time said it needed more time to study the issue, its final report recommended against moving forward at this time.Even the charter committee’s own members were split 4-3 on the decision. Committee members opposed to the expansion said, given the tense political climate, enabling people to put their names on a public list of legal non-citizens could make those people targets of federal retaliation, they said.They also said that, in this hostile environment, the committee would be unable to obtain useful information from the relevant South Burlington community to help them understand whether legal residents even want this change.“I immediately made the motion that we should put this thing in the freezer and wait, for humanitarian reasons,” Wendell Coleman, a member of the charter committee, told city council Monday.Anne LaLonde, another member of the committee, offered a different perspective.“This definitely, clearly comes from a place of empathy, and I understand that it’s a frightening time for noncitizens in the United States, whether you have a green card, whether you don’t, I think that’s a completely valid point of view,” she said. “But I would say I think legal residents of South Burlington should be able to choose for themselves whether or not to register to vote.”In the report, they listed an executive order by President Donald Trump that among other things, directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to “ensure that state and local officials have access to appropriate systems for verifying the citizenship or immigration status of individuals registering to vote or who are already registered” and to “take all lawful and appropriate action to make available information from relevant databases to state and local election officials engaged in verifying the citizenship of individuals registering to vote or who are already registered.”Committee members say it is unclear whether registered local non-citizen voters would be in Vermont’s database or in Vermont’s “publicly available voter registration list,” creating safety concerns for some residents.Other pending federal legislation would require proof of U.S. citizenship to register to vote in elections for federal office. And it remains murky what exactly that means for local elections, the committee wrote in its report.Three Vermont cities — Winooski, Montpelier and Burlington — have already allowed voting for all legal residents.All three cities have been challenged in court and upheld, but plaintiffs in the Burlington case have recently filed an appeal to the Vermont Supreme Court. That case is still ongoing.The committee undertook a series of public outreach initiatives, interviewing the clerks in each of the three cities and reaching out to several community groups to gauge feedback on how this topic would be received by legal permanent residents or new naturalized citizens.While council chair Tim Barritt had more of an appetite to continue the work now, other members of the council concurred with the committee’s recommendation. Aside from all councilors holding the moral standpoint that those who pay taxes should be able to vote on issues that pertain to the city, from a practical standpoint, the issue could prove difficult.“I think before we proceed, we need to have some confidence that the runway is not a very long runway, but a runway that actually is a genuine question that people should put thought to and make a decision,” councilor Mike Scanlan said.Before the vote to conclude the discussion, the committee had talked about continuing outreach to community groups and impacted community members and if the city council takes this issue up in the future, it could build off the plan to do community outreach to obtain more information and learn more about public opinion.“I’m full steam ahead,” Barritt said. “We’re operating out of fear for these individuals who might want to vote, and I understand that, but there almost is never a good time, so to speak, when you have situations like this, and we don’t know what’s going to unfold.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  South Burlington city hits pause on voting for all residents.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/south-burlington-1-20211110.jpg,,,2025-05-26 07:01:07.391694

Feb. 8 (Anna Spoerre/The Missouri Independent).The last time Missouri was in danger of losing an NFL franchise, deep disagreements between the governor and lawmakers over whether the state should pay for a new stadium led to litigation and the threat of a constitutional showdown.
It was 10 years ago when then-Gov. Jay Nixon and the legislature quarreled over a $1 billion plan to build a new St. Louis stadium for the Rams. 
Expecting GOP resistance, Nixon, a Democrat, came up with a strategy that didn’t involve the legislature. That sparked a group of legislators to file a lawsuit to block Nixon’s plan and threaten to refuse to allocate money the governor committed to the stadium when the General Assembly reconvened in January 2016. 
But that looming clash fizzled when the Rams announced an intention to move to Los Angeles two days before the 2016 session began. NFL owners overwhelmingly agreed to let them do it soon after.

A decade later, Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe is pushing a plan for the state to pay up to half the costs of a new stadium for the Kansas City Royals and renovations to Arrowhead Stadium for the Kansas City Chiefs. 
Both teams have expressed interest in leaving Missouri when the lease on their current stadiums expire in 2030, and Kansas lawmakers have put a deal on the table that would use state incentives to pay for up to 70% of the costs of new stadiums.
Kehoe has one advantage Nixon didn’t — a legislature dominated by his own party. But while the governor successfully convinced the Missouri House to sign off on a stadium funding plan earlier this month in the final days of the session, the Senate was in no mood to play ball. 
House Speaker Jon Patterson, a Lee’s Summit Republican, alerted his colleagues on Friday that the governor is expected to call the legislature back into session as early as next week to debate stadium funding. The governor may also include a $500 million construction package on the special session agenda, a move seen as vital to winning over support in the Senate for any stadium plan. 
But with partisan tensions running high after a tumultuous end to the regular legislative session, and serious heartburn among Republicans over the idea of spending hundreds of millions to subsidize sports franchises, the outcome is anything but certain. 
“I love the Kansas City Chiefs. I’m obnoxious during football season,” state Rep. Darin Chappell, a Republican from Rogersville, said in a recent interview with KSGF. “… But I’ve got constituents trying to pay their rent and feed themselves, and they’re struggling. And I’m going to take their money and give it to billionaires so multimillionaires can play in a prettier place? That’s obscene.”
Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin, a Shelbina Republican, said state funding for stadiums is “an easy demagogue topic.” But losing the teams to Kansas, she contends, would cost much more than the proposal put forth by the governor. 
“My personal belief is both the direct and indirect dollars accruing to Missouri businesses from the Chiefs and Royals being located here far exceeds what they are asking,” she wrote on social media. “I also believe if they left the state it would tear out the heart of Missouri, leaving two big concrete structures as a forever reminder of what might have been.”
Governor’s plan for Chiefs, Royals stadium funding derailed in the Missouri Senate

The Chiefs and the Royals face a deadline at the end of June on whether they will accept the offer from Kansas.
The proposal floated by Kehoe and set to be debated next week would pay up to half the cost — estimated to be up to $3 billion — as well as up to $50 million in tax credits for any direct investments made by the teams. 
The stadium plan died in the regular session when the Senate twice used a rare procedural rule to end debate on controversial bills on abortion and paid sick leave. The move infuriated Democrats, who vowed the Senate will not function normally until they feel they can trust the GOP to work towards compromise.
There is also lingering bipartisan anger over the projects that were lost when the House sunk a capital improvements bill. The $513 million would have paid for projects at eight hospitals around the state, supported a new nuclear reactor at the University of Missouri to make cancer treatments and a new mental health hospital in Kansas City.
The rollout of Kehoe’s plan didn’t help soothe the tensions.
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle complained that the governor kept the legislature in the dark on stadium funding plans, then demanded it sign off on the proposal with little debate and no details on the cost.
The lack of legislative involvement echoes 2015, when lawmakers took umbrage at Nixon’s efforts to work around them by trying to use existing incentive programs to help fund a new St. Louis stadium.  Republicans and Democrats demanded Nixon either submit a proposal to the legislature or put it on the ballot for a vote. 
 “We will not stand idly by as the people of this state are committed to millions of dollars in debt without proper legislative approval or a public vote,” a group of House members said in a letter to Nixon at the time.
Lawmakers will get their wish this time around to have a say on whether Missouri taxpayers should help subsidize Kansas City stadiums. 
Kehoe is optimistic, arguing that keeping the teams in Missouri “is a critical piece of economic development. And I’d like to see us make sure we can solidify our offer with legislative approval.”

Vermont hospitals are charging more than five times the average sales price for outpatient drugs — the highest markup in the nation by a wide margin. Lawmakers are seeking to cap those prices.

Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDiggerLast year, Andy Kehler, a co-owner of Jasper Hill Farm, was looking to renew his employees’ health insurance plans.The first quote the Greensboro-based cheesemaker received — for an “apples to apples” renewal of the plans, Kehler said in an interview — would have cost 74% more than the 2024 plans. For a company with flat sales, now facing the threat of tariffs on its sales to Canada, the increase was nigh unaffordable, he said. “We ended up scrambling to get an only 44% increase,” Kehler said. “That’s just ridiculous. It’s completely unsustainable.”One big factor driving that price tag up: drugs. Jasper Hill is paying tens of thousands of dollars — a significant chunk of its roughly $300,000 annual health care costs — for pharmaceuticals to treat an employee’s autoimmune condition, Kehler said. The company is grappling with one of the state’s dubious distinctions. According to data from 2020 through 2022 compiled by RAND, a national policy think tank, Vermont has the nation’s highest prices for outpatient pharmaceuticals, by a wide margin. In Vermont, the average prices of outpatient pharmaceutical drugs — meaning, drugs administered to patients without admitting them to hospitals — are more than five times the manufacturers’ average sale prices, according to RAND. That’s the highest average markup out of all 50 states.Andy and Mateo Kehler, co-owners of Jasper Hill Farm. The cheesemaker has faced steep hikes in its insurance costs, driven in large part by outpatient drug prices. Photo courtesy of Andy KehlerOver the past several weeks, as lawmakers seek to rein in skyrocketing health care costs, that statistic has sparked criticism — and a legislative effort to cap those prices. “I can’t move beyond the immorality of this,” Rep. Alyssa Black, D-Essex, the chair of the Vermont House Committee on Health Care, told a hospital lobbyist Tuesday.“How is this not price-gouging?” she added. Low federal payoutsOutpatient pharmaceutical drugs are generally administered via injection or infusion in hospitals or clinics, rather than dispensed by a pharmacy. These are generally specialty drugs used to treat cancer, Crohn’s disease, autoimmune disorders or other conditions.“These tend to be drugs where you have a doctor and a nurse watching you while you’re taking the drug to make sure it’s working,” Sara Teachout, a lobbyist for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont, said in an interview. Some hospitals are able to buy some of the drugs in question at a discount under a federal program called 340B. And yet, according to data Teachout presented to lawmakers last week, the markups for some of those drugs are steep. At the University of Vermont Medical Center, for example, one cancer treatment drug, Neulasta, costs private insurance nearly 70 times the manufacturer’s average sales price. Rep. Daisy Berbeco, D-Winooski, said on the House floor Friday that that markup means Vermonters who need that drug may pay $95,000 a year for Neulasta — compared with an average sales price of $1,357 a year. It’s not clear  — even to the state’s hospital association — why Vermont’s drug markups are so large. Vermont has the highest markups on outpatient drugs in the nation, according to RAND’s analysis of data from 2020 through 2022. Screenshot via RAND “I don’t know exactly why we’re so high,” Devon Green, a lobbyist for the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, said in an interview. She said that she was not sure hospitals were even aware of the state’s disproportionate costs.But Green said she believes the reason has to do with low payments from the federal government’s Medicare and Medicaid programs. According to data compiled by a hospital consultant for Southwestern Vermont Medical Center, Vermont receives smaller Medicare payments than all other states for a variety of hospital procedures.“The hospitals in Vermont are the least paid (by Medicare) of any hospitals in any state in the union,” James Trimarchi, Southwestern Vermont’s planning director, said in an interview Thursday. The reason for that? “We don’t know,” Trimarchi said. Medicare calculates reimbursement rates based on numerous factors, including the procedure, type of facility and geographic region. “I hesitate to speculate,” he said. But, he noted, when Medicare reimbursements do not cover the cost of the procedures they help pay for, hospitals must make up the losses elsewhere — such as prices charged to private insurance for commercial drugs. ‘I do find it cruel’Some health care players, however, expressed doubt about that logic.“There are many reasons that Medicare reimbursements may be low, and I’m not sure that I necessarily agree with the premise,” Owen Foster, the chair of the Green Mountain Care Board, told lawmakers in the House health care committee Wednesday. He wondered whether Vermont’s hospital leaders are doing all they can to maximize their Medicare reimbursements — and why they weren’t dipping into cash reserves rather than hiking prices for drugs. “I do have to say that I do find it cruel to charge enormous markups on life-saving treatments to patients who are incredibly sick,” he said. On Thursday, Vermont’s House health care committee voted unanimously to advance an amendment that would cap those drug costs at 130% of their average sales price starting July 1, and 120% of their average sales price starting January 2026.The amendment, part of a larger bill relating to drug pricing, passed out of the House Friday and now heads to the Senate. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont has said that the proposal could reduce their requested premiums — which are expected to rise by double digit percentages — by four percentage points for individual and small group insurance plans on the health care marketplace, and three percentage points for school health insurance plans. The Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, however, said the proposed legislation would cause millions of dollars in losses, and would require multiple Vermont hospitals to cut staff or services. Asked in an interview later that day about the morality of charging large markups on critical pharmaceuticals, Green, the hospital lobbyist, paused for a long time. “I do not think that it is right,” she said finally. “And I think it is an unfortunate byproduct of a very flawed way of paying for health care.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  ‘How is this not price-gouging?’: Hospital drug markups spark legislation, anger .",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/prescription-pricing-1-20250523-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-05-26 07:01:07.391694

In Randolph and Rutland, bowling centers are keeping up the sport — and the camaraderie it inspires.

Photo by Catherine Morrissey/CNSEliza Walsh is a reporter with the Community News Service, a University of Vermont journalism internship.Rick Wilbur surveyed each lane at Rutland Bowlerama, marking up a scoresheet as pins crashed, high-fives smacked and kids scurried around decked-out competitors. It was a mid-April night of bowling in this year’s Green Mountain Open Tournament, and Wilbur, who’s been around the Rutland alley for over 50 years, was right at home. His family has been coming to Bowlerama for decades; he’s competed as a bowler for close to six. He started teaching his son Jon the craft of the game when the boy was 10 years old. Twenty-six years later, in 2019, Wilbur watched his son become the first Vermonter and 35th person in the U.S. to bowl a 900 series in open league play, achieving three consecutive perfect games in one set — all at Bowlerama on a Monday night. As Wilbur meandered his way among the lanes last month, regulars at the bowling alley patted his back and chatted with him while he kept score.“Being that I’ve been here so long, it’s like a family reunion every weekend,” he said. Rick Wilbur, Rutland Bowlerama employee, poses with his favorite bowling ball: a realistic eyeball. Photo by Catherine Morrissey/CNSOwner Chip Forte came into the business shortly after his grandparents started the institution in 1965. Originally a 16-lane bowling house, the facility is now 32 lanes large, many of which still boast the original wood. Ron Carrara, lifelong Rutland resident, has worked maintenance at Bowlerama since he was a kid and grew up with Forte and his family — Forte’s mom being his Boy Scouts den mother. “It’s changed a lot,” Carrara said. “In the early ’70s this place was packed. Now, we’re lucky if we fill 10 or 12 lanes.” Bowling seems to be a dying pastime, with digital technology taking the forefront in family entertainment. According to industry firm Hansell Group, the U.S. had around 5,800 sanctioned bowling centers and nearly 120,000 lanes in 2003. By 2019, there were about 4,500 commercial centers with around 95,000 lanes in operation, the group reported.Increasingly, old bowling alleys nationwide have been converted into facilities offering a host of other games, activities and amenities. And new businesses opening up have focused on sleek, upscale experiences, according to the same report.But for the few rural bowling centers in Vermont, old school charm and long community ties have been tough to beat. Bowlerama still uses the analog keypads installed in the 1990s, and prior to that the center relied on halogen-lit, handwritten scorecards.Isaiah “Grizzly” Turgeon starts to count scores near the end of the competition on Easter Sunday at the Rutland Bowlerama. Photo by Catherine Morrissey/CNSWhile the regular crowd at Rutland Bowlerama isn’t what it used to be, the business had no trouble filling out its lanes for the Green Mountain Open Tournament, which participants traveled hours across New England to attend. “We have a lot of leagues, we have a lot of competition, we have a lot of fun,” Wilbur said. He is a coach for a local youth league and often helps out with Addison County Special Olympics events. The varsity bowling team at Fair Haven Union High School plays and practices at Bowlerama as well. The school has been in something of a friendly interstate rivalry with Randolph Union High School, and the two teams have duked it out at Bowlerama and elsewhere in recent years. Randolph is home to Valley Bowl, which holds a similar spirit to Bowlerama — the open game rate is $5 per hour with $3 shoe rentals and has been since the place opened in 2006. The year prior, the town’s only bowling center, Rose Bowl, closed after being sold to a New York developer who wanted to open a Family Dollar. Couple Karen and Wayne Warner, avid bowlers, had made a bid to buy the property but lost out.  A corkboard displays photos from years of bowlers past. Photo by Catherine Morrissey/CNSSo they bought all the bowling alley’s lanes and equipment off the old owner, built Valley Bowl on Prince Street and opened in January 2006. Karen Warner also runs the area’s Special Olympics program and has been coaching the Randolph Union bowling team for the past 10 years.Valley Bowl recently started up a kids-bowl-free promotion, which offers two free games a day to minors all the way through the summer. “What we try to do is grow a love of the sport,” said Warner. “We certainly see a lot of that come to fruition.”Warner drills balls at the Valley Bowl pro shop, one of the few in-house pro shops in that part of Vermont, and helps with many of the other needs of local bowlers. She’s familiar with the folks at Rutland Bowlerama and has crossed paths with them many times while coaching. “Fair Haven and us were in the finals this year,” Warner said. “They ended up coming out on top. They wanted it, and sometimes it’s about that want. They’re a fun group of kids.”Wilbur and Warner have also banded together to coach for the regional Senior Classic, a competition where the top 10 Vermont high school seniors go up against the top 10 seniors from New Hampshire. A competitor lets one rip during Rutland Bowlerama’s Easter Sunday competition. Photo by Catherine Morrissey/CNS“We all came together to coach these kids. It was a lot of fun,” Warner said. The two haunts preserve a sense of retro family fun in Vermont. Still, business continues to decline as bowling becomes a less fashionable form of recreation. “When one of these VT bowling houses closes, it’s not good for any of us,” said Warner. “It’s always good to see those guys, to talk to them as a resource. Maybe that doesn’t happen in other places, but it happens in this town.”Said Wilbur, “Seems like every three months, everything changes.” A retired police officer, Wilbur doesn’t let the slump get him down. He still bowls in a league every year from August to April, coming in recreationally with family and friends during the off season. It’s even a family tradition to bowl on Christmas Eve. “It’s just fun,” Wilbur said. “I think I was put here for this reason.”Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont bowling alleys preserving retro fun while facing biz trends.",https://vtdigger.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Morrissey_Rutland_Bowlerama-13-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-26 07:01:07.391694

A federal judge last week ordered them reinstated, in the latest twist in the case. (Photo by Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order that would have dismantled the Department of Education, and he ordered the reinstatement of hundreds of department employees who were laid off in a massive March reduction in force.
U.S. District Judge Myong J. Joun ruled Thursday that there is no evidence the layoffs were part of a plan to improve efficiency at the department, but said they were merely steps toward closing the statutorily mandated agency without congressional approval, or even any effort to get Congress to do so.
“A department without enough employees to perform statutorily mandated functions is not a department at all,” Joun wrote. “This court cannot be asked to cover its eyes while the Department’s employees are continuously fired and units are transferred out until the Department becomes a shell of itself.”
The ruling, in the U.S. District Court for Massachusetts, came in response to legal challenges filed there by 21 Democratic attorneys general, including Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown, and by a coalition of labor and education groups . A separate challenge was filed days later by a group of advocacy and labor groups in U.S. District Court for Maryland.
Joun temporarily prohibited enforcement of a March 20 executive order that called for the department to take “all necessary steps to facilitate the closure” of the federal agency, as well as the president’s call to move oversight of federal student loans, nutrition programs and special education services to other federal agencies. Joun also ordered the return of more than 1,300 employees who were laid off in the March reduction in force.
Federal layoffs drag down state employment gains for second month, new numbers show

Madi Biedermann, a spokesperson for the department, told States Newsroom in a statement Thursday that the decision by “a far-left” judge overstepped his authority. The administration filed an appeal the same day.
“President Trump and the Senate-confirmed Secretary of Education clearly have the authority to make decisions about agency reorganization efforts, not an unelected Judge with a political axe to grind. This ruling is not in the best interest of American students or families,” Biedermann said.
But Brown, who has joined numerous lawsuits against the administration, said Joun’s injunction “ensures Maryland schools and students will get the resources they need while we continue the fight for our children’s future in court.”
“Employees who work for the Department of Education help keep class sizes small, make sure students with disabilities get the care and support they deserve, and administer college loans and grants to young adults so they can one day land their dream job,” Brown said in a statement released Friday morning.
Moody’s downgrades Prince George’s County bonds
Moody’s Analytics has downgraded its rating of Prince George’s County’s general obligation bonds from its highest rating of Aaa to Aa1, saying the county’s overall financial outlook is strong but noting that financial reserves are lower than other jurisdictions with similar ratings.
The rating Thursday came the same day that the other two major bond-rating agencies, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings, reaffirmed the highest AAA ratings for the county’s planned June 4 sale of $247.7 million in general obligation bonds. Both maintained their stable outlook for the county’s finances, with Standard & Poor’s saying it does “not expect to lower the rating during the next two years.”
Acting County Executive Tara Jackson acknowledged the “slight downgrade” by Moody’s but noted that it mirrors similar rating changes for other jurisdictions in the region. Both Maryland and the District of Columbia were downgraded in recent weeks by Moody’s from Aaa to Aa1.
Jackson said in a prepared statement that the overall ratings from all three agencies reaffirm the county’s position as “among the top-rated jurisdictions nationwide.”
“The AAA ratings from Fitch and S&P reaffirm our strong financial management and longstanding commitment to fiscal discipline,” Jackson’s statement said. “In light of our successful efforts to address the issues that led to their negative outlook, I am disappointed that Moody’s chose to downgrade us to Aa1.

“Our ability to meet those challenges demonstrates our agility and sound planning. By maintaining healthy reserves, diversifying revenue, and investing strategically in our communities, we continue to build investor confidence and deliver long-term stability for our residents,” she said.
The Moody’s report cited the county’s reliance on federal employment, with an estimated 9% of the county workforce classified as federal workers, but it said it “has seen minimal data suggesting negative consequences from either job contraction or policy shifts” at the federal level so far. It added that the county’s “very large and dynamic local economy, with a pipeline of ongoing redevelopment projects in progress” will offset the possible loss of projects like the proposed new FBI headquarters in Greenbelt, which President Donald Trump has proposed canceling.
But Moody’s said federal uncertainties present “risk to its [the county’s] budget and fiscal position in the next year and beyond,” and noted the county reserves, at 22% to 24% of revenues, were below the median of 33% for other Aa-rated jurisdictions. It reduced its ratings for county bonds across the board by a notch, but maintained a stable outlook for all.
Standard & Poor’s said its decision to keep an AAA rating for Prince George’s reflects “the county’s strong economic trends, robust management practices, and very strong budgetary flexibility and liquidity.” It also cited the county’s “ability to maintain generally stable finances, balancing competing expenditure priorities consistent with a large, diverse, and growing community.”
Fitch said its AAA rating represents “the county’s historically strong operating performance … and a ‘high midrange’ level of budgetary flexibility.”
AIB members needed
The independent body that oversees the state’s 10-yeear, multibillion-dollar education reform plan needs new members.
Applications opened Thursday for people to apply to the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future Accountability and Implementation Board (AIB). The AIB nominating committee will send the governor at least two names for each of three board vacancies.
Board member Mara Doss, a former associate vice president for teaching, learning and student success at Prince George’s Community College, plans to resign June 30 with one year left in her six-year term. Board member Laura Stapleton, who chairs the Human Development and Quantitative Methodology Department at the University of Maryland, College Park, said last week she will not reapply when her term expires July 1.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
AIB board member Joseph Manko, an education program officer at the Abell Foundation, also has a term that expires July 1. But Maryland Energy Secretary Paul Pinsky, who serves on the nominating committee, said in a meeting Tuesday that one person “is seeking reappointment,” without naming names.
Candidates should have expertise in certain areas, such as understanding of education policy, teaching in public schools and “leading and implementing systemic change in complex organizations,” and they must submit a 500-word essay describing how they would contribute to the success of the board.
Applications are due by 5 p.m. June 12 and nominees will be announced in July. The governor has 30 days after receiving the list to name the board members.
Homeland Security director to lose ‘acting’ title
Travis Nelson, the acting director of the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security since January 2024, is about to be “acting” no more: Gov. Wes Moore (D) announced Friday that Nelson will officially take over as director on June 11.
“For the last year and a half, Travis has already been doing the work – helming the Office of Homeland Security as acting director,” Moore said in a statement from his office. “This appointment marks simply the latest chapter in a distinguished record of keeping Marylanders safe and ensuring we are prepared for any crisis.”
Nelson, a 19-year veteran of the Maryland State Police, has “high-level experience coordinating complex public safety initiatives across the region,” according to the governor’s office. Since 2014, he has served as co-chair of the Maryland Active Assailant Interdisciplinary Work Group, working with multiple agencies to identify, prepare for and respond to active assailant incidents.
He was previously commander of the Maryland State Police Complex Operations Management Unit, responsible for contributing to the oversight, management, and planning of complex incidents and events, the governor’s office said. He began his public safety career more than 20 years ago in Kent and Queen Anne’s counties, serving as an emergency communications specialist, public safety dispatcher, emergency medical technician and state trooper. He is a life member of the Kent and Queen Anne’s Rescue Squad in Chestertown.
Nelson said he was honored to be named to the director’s job.
“In an era of evolving threats, our mission is clear: to build a more resilient, responsive, and unified security infrastructure that safeguards every Marylander,” he said, in the statement released by the governor’s office. “I look forward to working closely with our federal, state, and local partners to ensure the safety and security of all our communities.”

[…],"Jen Kruse, from Tipton, holds up a sign in protest of the Missouri State Legislature's decision to pass legislation to overturn voters' recent ballot measures. ""I wish reason would take over,"" she told The Independent. (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Maybe you collected signatures last year so that Missourians could vote to overturn the state’s abortion ban. 
Maybe you walked door to door asking voters to support paid sick leave benefits for lower-wage workers.
Maybe you were one of millions of people who successfully voted to pass those measures on the statewide ballot last November.
Republicans in the Missouri legislature want you to go pound sand. They are not impressed with your hard work, or the sanctity of your vote, or your show of direct democracy. 
They have convictions to uphold, special interests to please and power to wield. And so, in a breathtaking show of arrogance, they wrapped up the 2025 legislative session by stomping all over the wishes of the state’s voters. 
First, Republicans passed a proposed constitutional amendment that, if approved by voters, would negate the freedoms won in Amendment 3, which enshrined the right to an abortion in the Missouri Constitution.
The just-passed Republican amendment seeks to deceive. Its language — which will likely be challenged in court — creates a narrow window in which victims of rape and incest and women with a medical emergency can obtain an abortion. It doesn’t mention that abortion will be banned for everyone else.
Following this betrayal of women, lawmakers moved on to workers.
They gutted a statute known as Proposition A, initiated by citizens, that passed with a hefty 58% of the vote. No citizens’ initiative is safe from the vicissitudes of Missouri’s Republican supermajority.
Lawmakers struck down a paid sick leave provision. They left intact a minimum wage increase but erased a provision that would have attached future increases to the rate of inflation. By the time the 2025 legislature mercifully adjourned, Prop A was a shadow of what its organizers had intended.
This is by no means the first time Missouri’s Republican supermajority has overturned the will of voters. Legislators have altered voter-initiated statutes in recent years having to do with puppy mills and redistricting and campaign finance. 
Constitutional amendments are somewhat less subject to damage, but Republicans nonetheless tried to thwart an amendment calling for expansion of Medicaid eligibility by refusing to grant the funding until ordered to do so by a court.
During that fracas, in 2021, a then-Republican legislator said the quiet part out loud. 
“I am proud to stand against the will of the people,” Justin Hill, a representative from the St. Louis area, declared from the House floor.
There you have it.
Most Republicans prefer to frame their disregard for voters a bit more diplomatically.
“Those who support conservative measures and vote us into office expect us to stand our ground on issues which reflect their bedrock beliefs,” Senate President Pro Tem Cindy O’Laughlin said on social media after Republicans gutted the two voter initiatives this month. 
This willingness of voters to support progressive measures while simultaneously electing rock-solid conservative legislators is indeed the great disconnect in Missouri politics.
But almost six of 10 voters supported paid sick leave for low-wage workers. That seems quite bedrock. The people expecting lawmakers to “stand their ground” on this particular issue are select business interests which are powerful in Jefferson City.
“I am proud of all my colleagues for taking a stand for what we consider right,” O’Laughlin added in her social media post. 
Which is just a short hop, skip and jump away from “I am proud to stand against the will of the people.” 
Republican lawmakers count on voters across the state to not watch what they do too closely, and to forget about their outrages once the session adjourns.
But if anything grabs the attention of Missourians, it could be this latest double punch. 
Prompted by groups such as Missouri Jobs for Justice and the recently formed Respect Missouri Voters, protesters convened at the Capitol and in locations around the state.
On the protest lines, they mingled with people out and about objecting to Trump administration policies. That’s a willing audience, already in the streets, just waiting to be informed about what the state legislators are up to.
And for those who missed the rallies, volunteers are distributing flyers at the homes of voters in legislative districts where Proposition A garnered more support in November than the Republican lawmakers representing the district. 
That includes House Speaker Jon Patterson’s district in Lee’s Summit.
Patterson didn’t vote for the House measure seeking to reinstate an abortion ban, but he didn’t do much to slow it down, either. And his explanation that he supports paid sick leave but voted to gut Prop A because he doesn’t think state government should mandate the benefit is double talk.
Across Missouri, workers who are finally accruing sick time are being told that the benefit will be taken away from them. And people who only a few months ago celebrated the end of an abortion ban are finding out that they’ll have to go back to work to preserve a right they legitimately won.
A simple question keeps coming up: How can they do this to us?
They do it because they can.
Until enough voters decide they can’t.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/051525_workersrally7-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-05-26 07:01:07.391694

Wes Moore said it needed more study, writes J.H. Snider. But a year later, there's been no study, the issue has come and gone and this year's version of the bill failed.","A worker poses by the presses of the Daily Republic in Fairfield, California, in this 2018 file photo. (Photo by Staff Sgt. Amber Carter/U.S. Air Force)Maryland law mandates that estate beneficiaries pay hundreds of dollars, plus transaction costs, to place legal ads in a local newspaper announcing an estate’s opening.
In 2024 and 2025, Maryland’s legislature introduced bills to revoke that mandate and instead allow such notices to be posted for free on a more publicly accessible government website.
Experts knowledgeable about estate legal ads know that virtually no potential beneficiaries and creditors learn about a deceased person via such ads. But the mandate is politically impregnable because it benefits one of Maryland’s most politically powerful industries at the expense of the politically weak; that is, monopoly local newspapers receive millions of dollars per year while the average Marylander only pays hundreds of dollars per lifetime.
This incentive structure of concentrated industry benefits and diffuse public costs constitutes the classic incentive structure of special interest politics. The problem is compounded by the local newspaper lobby’s unique power, as reflected in the politicians’ motto: “Never pick a fight with anyone who buys ink by the barrel.”

Today, Maryland mandates some 190 separate statutory legal ad subsidies for the local newspaper industry, of which the estate subsidy is only one.  But the industry worries that revoking even one of these subsidies will cause a domino effect, so fights accordingly.
The case against the obsolete estate legal ad mandate was so compelling that the 2024 legislation revoking it passed both the Maryland House and Senate unanimously (175-0). (Assisting such support, when the bill was introduced, Maryland’s leading newspaper chain was owned by an unpopular, out-of-state hedge fund.)
But Gov. Wes Moore then vetoed the legislation, justifying his veto on the basis that the issue needed more study:
“This veto should not be seen as the end of the conversation, and in fact the administration believes we need a broader conversation about public notices rather than a conversation focused solely on estate notices. Our administration looks forward to engaging with … all of the advocates on that topic during the interim,” he wrote.
This year the same bill was introduced in the legislature and again passed unanimously (132-0) in the House. But it wasn’t allowed even a vote in the Senate’s Judiciary Committee, whose chair, as is said in Annapolis, “placed the bill in his desk.” The chair didn’t respond to my written query asking him to explain his opposition.
I first got a sense of how dirty newspaper legal ad politics was when decades ago I tried to gather data to study them. I had worked at a D.C. think tank studying media public policy and knew that legal ads were the newspaper industry’s largest government subsidy.
No scholarly data existed on this subject because other scholars who had tried to study such subsidies had run up against the same brick wall I had; that is, I could find no industry data because national and state newspaper organizations, while aggressively lobbying for such subsidies, had refused to provide authoritative data on them, and politicians were too terrified of the industry’s political power to ask how much their subsidies cost the public. So most Maryland legislative sessions some legislation passes that expands legal ad newspaper subsidies without accountability provisions.
I was curious: Did the governor fulfill his veto statement’s promises? The answer is no. In the year between the end of the 2024 and 2025 legislative sessions, neither the Governor nor his staff participated in, let alone orchestrated, such a public discussion.
My sense is that the best hope to eliminate Maryland’s obsolete estate legal ad laws would be to shame the governor into acting consistent with his own stated values, as he has promised to support the poor and politically weak, and that’s whom estate legal ads most hurt. On the other hand, since the media have negligible incentive to expose this hypocrisy, such hope appears quixotic. Moreover, the governor’s politically astute aides have undoubtedly counseled him not to risk the newspaper industry’s wrath, given its power to shape his and his opponents’ public image.
Conversely, recall that the governor won a Bronze Star for bravery. Accordingly, the governor should convene his promised public forum to discuss the merits of newspaper legal ads. Until then, he should instruct his staff to stop lobbying to kill legislation that only reduces but not expands legal ad subsidies. (The largest new newspaper subsidy last session reduced newspapers’ legal ad costs).
If the governor’s policy is only to call for public discussion when reducing but not increasing newspaper industry subsidies, that double standard should be called out.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/4993621-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-05-26 07:01:07.391694

She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial.
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time.
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy.
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated.
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity.
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died.
Mary Connolly never remarried.
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said.
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said.
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.

“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life.
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved.
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.”
A final sendoff at last.

(Photo by Pat Kinney with background via Canva)MARSHALLTOWN — Ralph Alshouse hadn’t even seen an airplane until he was in his teens.
That was about 90 years ago. He’d see a lot of planes — from the inside —throughout World War II.
Now 101, he can recall a few times he may not have lived to 21 by the time the war ended in 1945.
But he knew from his dad, who saw trench warfare in World War I, that if he went to war, an airplane was where he wanted to be.
Alshouse, a resident of the Iowa Veterans Home in Marshalltown, was a Navy pilot who delivered or “ferried” planes all over the country from the manufacturer to be loaded on to aircraft carriers, or brought battle-worn craft into repair shops. He was part of Ferry Squadron VRF-2, based in Columbus, Ohio, but flew to installations nationwide.
Growing up near Oelwein and graduating from high school in Stanley in 1941, he went into the Navy shortly after Pearl Harbor.
The duty was hazardous enough, flying various aircraft which had equally varying and challenging capabilities. He had 13 emergency landings during the war, out of 146 flights and more than 1600 hours flight time, involving 28 different kinds of naval aircraft, ranging from small Piper Cub medical evacuation ambulance planes, to Marine Corsair and Navy Helldiver fighter-bombers to multi-engine heavy bombers like the B-24 Liberator or its Navy version, the PB4Y-2 Privateer.
On one nighttime training flight, he dodged an encounter with a tropical storm over the Gulf of Mexico. Two other cadets weren’t as fortunate.
“We were flying out of Pensacola Naval Air Base (in Florida), flying (Vought) OS2Us (Kingfisher observation float planes). Each of us had one. It was the final phase of our training before we got our wings. And three of us went out, and I was the only one to make it back. We were in the Gulf. We hit a line cloud out there they didn’t know about. And I told the other two guys, ‘I’m gonna turn (away from the storm); so let’s all turn.’ They said, “No, no our orders are to go straight.’ ”
He radioed out and received clearance to turn; the other cadets didn’t pick up the message over the static. He radioed back to them after making the turn but received no answer.

“I thought ‘Well, I better head back to base.’ There was no light, darker than hell, and my first thought was, ‘Oh s–t, I must be lost.’ And then all at once I saw the flicker of the (airfield) beacons. When you’re think you’re lost out at sea, in the middle of the night, and you see a beacon, boy, that makes you feel better.
“We went out the next morning with everything that flew; I think there was eight to us,” looking for the missing pilots, Alshouse said. “And we didn’t find a thing.”
On another occasion, he was pulling a target behind him for gunnery practice for other planes — only to get shot at himself. He discovered dents in his own craft after landing. Had the pilots been using a higher caliber ammunition in practice, the outcome might had been far different.
While ferrying a small medical evacuation plane from Florida to a shop near Memphis, Tenn., for repairs — basically a flying ambulance with space for one patient in the rear of the cockpit — he touched down at the scene of a serious multiple-injury automobile accident and picked up the victim in the worst condition for transport for medical treatment. He taxied off the pavement as highway patrol officers at the scene cleared the road for him to take off.
Among other narrow escapes, he also made a forced landing in Pittsburgh of a Corsair fighter plane on fire. In another instance, he and comrades rescued another pilot from a downed, burning plane before it exploded.
Alshouse, a 1948 graduate of Iowa State University in dairy science, is retired from work as a farmer, Farmers Home Administration farm appraiser at different locations around the state. He also served a stint as the mayor of Seymour in Wayne County near Centerville southeast of Des Moines.
He’s a former chairman of the Rathbun Area Solid Waste Commission. In 2018, he was recognized by a recycling customer, Indian Hills Community College in Ottumwa, for helping provide commission land to the college to start a sustainable agriculture program.

He found another more recent calling — as an author. He jotted down memories of his service to his offspring. A fellow former military pilot he met at a veteran dinner in Seymour, retired U.S. Marine Corps Capt. Mark Hewitt, suggested he write a book. He had no intention of such thing, but discovered he in fact already had enough material for one, if he combined all his written recollections.
He fused all those reminiscences into a book, entitled “80 Percent Luck, 20 Percent Skill.” It was published in 2023 and is available online on Amazon and through Barnes & Noble.
Alshouse saw his first plane as he was working for his dad in the farm field near Oelwein.
“I was cultivating beans one day. It landed in the hay field south of where I was cultivating beans,” he said. “Two gentlemen in business suits got out,” a car picked them up, “and they left the airplane.” They may have been going to a nearby farm on business on a property that had been through foreclosure.
His father came over from an adjacent field. Ralph came up on the plane, a Club Cadet, and peeked inside. “My God, all those instruments and all those controls.” he said. “I told Dad it must take a genius to fly one of those.
“That gave me the urge,” he said, “after Dad told me about all the guys that was killed in no man’s land in World War I. There was so much gunfire the trees fell over and they stacked the bodies up like cordwood and get behind them (for cover) to shoot. That helped me commit to being in the air instead of on the ground.”
He saw advertisements in the local paper seeking applicants for flight training. Lacking applicants, the standards were lowered from a four-year college degree, to a two-year degree, to high schools. “That’s when I stepped in,” he said. He and other enlistees didn’t know the different between the advantages of different branches of service, “we just wanted to fly.”
He took testing and training in Decorah, Minneapolis and pre-flight training at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, where he became a champion boxer in his class. “I never had a pair of boxing gloves on before, but I won the championship,” though he quipped, “My nose always got in the way.” He was bloodied a few times.
“We had about a 25 percent washout rate at Iowa City,” he said. He received flight training at the naval air installation at Wold Chamberlain Airport in Minneapolis, and then to Pensacola for training in catapult-launched scout planes like the kind used on various naval ships at that time.
“I got shot off a catapult three times in flight training,” he said “If you think you know what happiness is, that’s when you’re happy, that you’re still alive” and flying after a catapult launch.
Ralph still flew some in civilian life after the war. He had an ultralight craft and still has a trophy from a glider competition he won in 1970.
And his flying skills allowed him to avoid another close call — as a farm appraiser.
When a shotgun-wielding farmer ordered Alshouse off the property, he complied — but still flew over the farm and conducted the appraisal by air.
He discovered that on many occasions in peacetime as well as war, it’s still safer by air than on the ground.

(Courtesy of John Grinvalds)LINCOLN — After his fifth goodwill and fact-finding trip to war-torn Ukraine, a former Nebraska state legislator and decorated veteran still feels that Ukraine can prevail in its war with Russia if given the right weapons.
And former State Sen. Tom Brewer, who represented north-central Nebraska, said he sees a possible reckoning ahead for President Donald Trump in his dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Putin, he said, has never been truthful in his negotiations over the war, and his latest flirtations with peace talks may turn out to just be a delaying tactic to allow Russian forces to get organized for a summer offensive.
“There’s a huge game of chess that’s being played right now,” Brewer said in a recent interview. “I think the next month will bring to light that Putin is not serious about negotiations, he’s just buying time.”
“If you look at history, the Russians have never been honest about any of the negotiating they’ve done,” he added. “Why would they start now?”
Brewer, now 66, is at an age when most veterans are working on their golf game or heading out on a fishing trip. He’s had more than 70 surgeries to repair war wounds and a bad back. The trip by plane, train, bus and eventually Toyota 4Runners in the dark of night is long and grueling, over roads pock-marked by missile strikes.
But he keeps going back to Ukraine in part because he admires their freedom-loving spirit and in part because he feels his military experience — six tours of duty in Afghanistan and experience with artillery and helicopters — could help their war effort.
Reconstruction will require help
Eventually, he believes he could also help the reconstruction of a country known as the “bread basket of Europe.”
On this latest trip he was accompanied by Don Hutchens, a retired head of the Nebraska Corn Board and a veteran of foreign trade missions. They set up a video meeting with University of Nebraska President Jeffrey Gold and Ukraine’s ministers of agriculture and intelligence to lay the groundwork for possible collaboration in rebuilding Ukraine’s crop production.

Ukraine has lost more than 20% of its farmland since the Russians invaded, according to Alliance Magazine, and an estimated 139,000 square kilometers of land — almost twice the size of Nebraska — are suspected to hold land mines.
Brewer said that in areas where the Russians had occupied, anything of value was taken and farm machinery not taken was disabled. Farmers are left using old equipment in hopes of growing a crop, he said.
During his trip, Brewer visited associates of Howard Buffett, the son of Omaha billionaire Warren Buffett, who is on track to pass a total of $1 billion in private aid this year given to Ukraine to remove mines and provide new combines, planters and tractors.
“(Buffett) has a really good team over there that is well-organized,” he said. “He’s probably more highly thought of than anyone else in the country. If he wanted to run for president he could beat out (Ukraine President Volodymyr) Zelinskyy.”
Brewer also visited an orphanage under construction near Kyiv that has been supported by Ukrainian-Americans as well as a hospital where wounded soldiers are fitted for prosthetic limbs. An estimated 52,000 Ukrainians have lost parts of arms and legs in the war, he said, which has left possibly 18,000 children orphaned.
Some aid still coming
Some U.S. military aid is still reaching troops in Ukraine, he said, but the elimination of the USAID agency has meant an end of food shipments to those living in a “no-man’s land” near the front. Despite the pull back of some American aid, the Ukrainians provided a warm welcome back, Brewer said.
As after past trips, the former legislator will provide a trip report to the Nebraska delegation in Congress in hopes that makes a difference.

On this trip, Brewer watched young Ukrainian soldiers, fueled by Red Bull and vape pens, guiding attack drones and was impressed by the capability of an artillery team unit that got only three week’s training on guns the U.S. Army provides months of training to operate.
He said that if he was “king for a day,” the U.S. would provide more long-range missiles so that Russian forces could be moved farther away from the Ukrainian border to deter drone attacks and dropping of unguided “glide bombs.” Tougher sanctions, Brewer added, could help squeeze the Russian economy to the point that they would give up.
The former senator said he is sometimes “astounded” about how long it took the U.S. to provide the weaponry that is needed.
The sounds of drones buzzing overhead is a constant near the front, Brewer said, and the glide bombs, which cannot be detected by anti-missile batteries, have exacted a horrible toll.
He said that this war could completely reshape Europe and the future of democracy, and it’s important to stop Putin now, or else he will be emboldened to invade more countries. Brewer said he “hates” the idea that Ukraine would have to give up valuable territory to end the war.
“The only way to defeat (the Russians) is to defeat them on the battlefield,” he said, “and the only way to do that is give (Ukraine) the right weapons to do it.”
“Even though they’ve been through three years of war, and even though they’ve lost an estimated 100,000 civilian and military lives, their spirit is still passionate about staying free,” Brewer said.
“You’re not going to see the Ukrainian people say, ‘We’ve had enough.’ I think they’ll fight until they have nothing left to fight with.”

“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”

On Dec. 7, 1941, during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time. 
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.
Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah, Georgia, in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, 8-year-old Virginia and 6-year-old Helen, were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said.

Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said. 
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played ‘Taps.’ They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.” 
A final sendoff at last.

Sign up for their newsletter here.
Forecasters at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expect above-average hurricane activity this season.
The federal agency, in its annual outlook released Thursday, predicted 13 to 19 named storms, including six to 10 hurricanes. Of those, it expects three to five major hurricanes of category 3, 4 or 5 strength, packing winds of 111 mph or greater.
The agency said there was a 60% chance of an above-normal season, a 30% chance of a near-normal season and a 10% chance of a below-normal season. The forecast represents an estimate of activity, not number of landfalls.
The average season features 14 named storms, including seven hurricanes and three major hurricanes, according to NOAA. The season begins Sunday, June 1, and ends Nov. 30.
“We’re ready here at NOAA,” said Ken Graham, director of the National Weather Service, during a news briefing held in Gretna, to mark 20 years since Hurricane Katrina. “Are you?”
NOAA based its forecast on a confluence of factors, including warmer than average ocean temperatures, potentially weak wind shear and the possibility of higher activity from the West African Monsoon, a primary starting point for Atlantic hurricanes. Warmer oceans fuel storms with more energy, while weaker winds allow them to develop without disruption.
Forecasters at Colorado State University also anticipate an above-average season, with 17 named storms — including nine hurricanes, four of them major. The forecasters predicted activity would be about 125% of that during an average season between 1991 and 2020.
By comparison, activity in 2024 was about 130% of an average season’s during that time. The 2024 season will be best-remembered for hurricanes Helene and Milton, which together caused more than 250 fatalities and $120 billion in damage across the Southeast.
The Colorado State University forecasters said this season there is a 51% chance of a major hurricane striking the U.S., with a 26% chance of one of the storms making landfall along the East Coast and 33% chance along the Gulf Coast. They predict a 56% chance of a major hurricane tracking through the Caribbean.
The season arrives amid widespread uncertainty over the role the federal government will play in disaster response and recovery, as the Trump administration fires employees, freezes funding and dismantles agencies. NOAA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are among the targets.
“Uncertainty is not great,” said Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at Colorado State University’s Department of Atmospheric Science. “It just adds another layer of stress. That isn’t great when people are trying to prepare for hurricane season.”
As much as 30 percent of the workforce at NOAA’s National Weather Service has been eliminated, said Rick Spinrad, a former NOAA administrator under the Biden administration. He worried NOAA may struggle to maintain its Hurricane Hunter flights, which he said account for a 15 percent improvement in track and intensity forecasting.
“If you lose that capacity to predict the track, you could either unnecessarily evacuate tens or hundreds of thousands of people, or evacuate the wrong people or not evacuate people who should be evacuated,” he said. “So we are putting lives and property in significant danger with the degradation of the forecast capability.”
No changes to the flights have been proposed, said Michael “Mac” McAlister, who has flown with the Hurricane Hunters for 10 years. This will be the 50th season for one of the two aircraft involved in the program, a WP-3D Orion named Kermit. The other plane is called Miss Piggy.
“There are hardly any 50-year-old pieces of this aircraft left,” McAlister said, referring to Kermit. “The wings get chopped off every five years. In my opinion these are two of the greatest national assets because of the data they provide.”
No one from the National Hurricane Center, a division of the National Weather Service, attended this year’s National Hurricane Conference in New Orleans, said Craig Fugate, a former FEMA administrator under the Obama administration and former director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management.
Normally the National Hurricane Center would brief state and local emergency managers at the conference on new forecasting methods, to help the managers improve communications with the public about, say, when evacuations are necessary. The training is important because there can be high turnover among emergency managers, he said.
“I’m just not aware of any other time that the hurricane center staff wasn’t at that conference,” Fugate said.
NOAA declined to comment on the conference but said Thursday its forecasts would be no less accurate. For instance, the federal agency said the model used to predict hurricanes would undergo an upgrade that would improve track and intensity forecasts by as much as 5 percent.
“We are fully staffed at the Hurricane Center, and we are definitely ready to go,” said Laura Grimm, acting NOAA administrator. “We are really making this a top priority for the administration.”
Kim Doster, the agency’s communications director, added in a statement, “in the near term, NWS has updated the service level standards for its weather forecast offices to manage impacts due to shifting personnel resources. These revised standards reflect the transformation and prioritization of mission-essential operations, while supporting the balance of the operational workload for its workforce. NWS continues to ensure a continuity of service for mission-critical functions.”
Meanwhile, FEMA is in turmoil, with President Donald Trump suggesting he might eliminate the federal agency. Cameron Hamilton, acting head of FEMA, was ousted earlier this month after testifying before a congressional subcommittee that elimination would not be “in the best interest of the American people.” His dismissal coincided with National Hurricane Preparedness Week, declared by Trump in a proclamation in which the president said he remained “steadfastly committed to supporting hurricane recovery efforts and ensuring that Federal resources and tax dollars are allocated to American citizens in need.”
But during Trump’s first week in office he appointed a task force to review FEMA’s ability to respond to disasters. And in March he signed an executive order asserting that federal policy must “recognize that preparedness is most effectively owned and managed at the State, local, and even individual levels.” The order called on state and local governments and individuals to “play a more active and significant role in national resilience and preparedness.”
In April the administration denied a request for assistance from Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Republican, after tornadoes ripped through several counties there. The administration approved the request in May.
Nonetheless, FEMA told Inside Climate News in a statement, before Hamilton was fired, that its response to disasters would not be diminished.
“Unlike the previous administration’s unprepared, disgraceful and inadequate response to natural disasters like Hurricane Helene, the Trump administration is committed to ensuring Americans affected by emergencies will get the help they need in a quick and efficient manner,” the statement reads. “All operational and readiness requirements will continue to be managed without interruption in close coordination with local and state officials ahead of the 2025 Hurricane Season. Emergency management is best when led by local and state authorities.”
In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis welcomed the prospect of more state leadership in disaster response. During an April event in Kissimmee he said he believed the Trump administration would send block-grant funding to states, which could manage the calamities more efficiently.
“We’re not going to be left in the cold. But I can tell you that the FEMA bureaucracy is an impediment to disaster recovery,” said DeSantis, who ran against Trump in the 2024 Republican primary. “We’re nimble. We’re quick. We adjust. So empower the states. Give us the resources, and we don’t necessarily need the federal government to be involved at all.”
But state and local governments already lead the response to disasters, Fugate notes. Governors request federal help only when the scope of the crisis exceeds the state’s capabilities, with the federal government providing little more than funding.
He said it was too soon to guess how all of the developments may affect hurricane season.
Even more cuts could be coming
Trump’s budget request, released earlier this month, would slash more than $1.3 billion from NOAA and $646 million from FEMA. Congress must approve the proposal.
An earlier leaked draft, obtained by Inside Climate News, would abolish NOAA’s research office, called Oceanic and Atmospheric Research or NOAA Research. The office is charged with providing unbiased science to, among other things, improve forecasts and enhance warnings ahead of disasters. The draft included $171 million for the office, down from $485 million in 2024. The few programs that remain, including research into severe storms, would be moved primarily to the National Weather Service and National Ocean Service.
The Trump administration’s 2026 budget passback, as the draft was called, included “significant reductions to education, grants, research, and climate-related programs within NOAA,” according to the document. “Passback levels support a leaner NOAA that focuses on core operational needs, eliminates unnecessary layers of bureaucracy, terminates nonessential grant programs and ends activities that do not warrant a Federal role.”
Project 2025, the conservative strategy for remaking the federal government, calls for NOAA to be taken apart, with many functions eliminated, privatized or moved to other agencies or state and local governments. The document suggests reforming FEMA to shift much of its spending on preparedness and response to state and local governments.
“We’re just providing as accurate information as we can,” said Andy Hazelton, a National Weather Service scientist who was let go earlier this year. “Hopefully we can get back to that, but it’s been a very, very tough environment for the last few months.”
In central Florida, all of the uncertainty has left Alan Harris, the emergency manager in Seminole County, grappling with how to prepare for hurricane season. Seminole is a suburban county north of Orlando that is spliced through by the St. Johns River, Florida’s longest. The county has experienced flooding during several recent hurricanes, including Ian in 2022 and Milton in 2024.
The agency depends on forecasts from the National Weather Service and National Hurricane Center and assistance from FEMA after a storm has passed. It had applied for a grant for a new generator for a special needs shelter under the federal Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which Trump signed into law in 2020. But the Trump administration ended the program recently.
“We at the local level are going to make sure that our residents are taken care of regardless of what happens at the federal or state level,” Harris said. “We will need help. We just don’t know where that help is going to come from. But I have 100 percent confidence that there will be help whether it’s through mutual aid agreements or it’s from other states or our own state. We’re going to make sure our residents are taken care of.”

Memorial Day is a time to set aside our differences and join together in remembering and thanking those brave souls who gave their last full measure for their fellow Americans. They deserve that honor even for serving in what some thought to be an ill-advised conflict. Vietnam turned out to be such a war, but that cannot take away from the fact that the 58,220 service personnel who died in that war were answering the call of their country and doing it well.
On Memorial Day, we think of the almost 1,355,000 service personnel who have perished in the nation’s conflicts, starting with the 70,000 who died in the Revolutionary War. Since then, about 655,000 died on both sides of the Civil War. The death toll in World War I was 116,516 and 406,399 died in World War II. The vicious and almost forgotten Korean War saw 36,574 deaths. After Vietnam, 2,325 died in the War in Afghanistan and 4,492 in the Iraq War. May they all rest in peace.
But there are others we should hold in our hearts in addition to those who died in the war theaters. War has a way of inflicting mortal injuries that only take their toll on veterans after the guns are silenced. They include illnesses caused by exposure to toxins, like poisonous gas in WWI, Agent Orange in Vietnam and burn pit fumes in the Gulf War, Afghanistan and Iraq. Those toxins have resulted in untold deaths from a variety of cancers and other diseases. They are not counted on the official death tallies, but they nevertheless are directly attributable to combat conditions.

Many veterans have experienced health problems attributable to wartime conditions or know of others who have. It has been estimated that about 300,000 Vietnam veterans have died because of exposure to Agent Orange. The late Dan Eismann, my colleague of 12 years on the Idaho Supreme Court, received substantial exposure to Agent Orange during two tours in Vietnam. While on the Court, he developed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and metastatic melanoma, passing away with honor last year. I was also exposed during my Vietnam service and developed pancreatic cancer in 2017. With surgery, chemo and a great deal of luck, I’ve been cured.
More recently, about 60,000 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are suffering and dying from medical ailments caused by exposure to toxins emanating from burn pits used to destroy all sorts of trash. Congress finally passed the PACT Act in 2022 to provide the necessary medical care, but the Act has not been funded for the current fiscal year. That is a serious breach of the country’s duty to those veterans.
There are many other serious problems that our veteran community faces on an all-too-frequent basis, including mental health issues, chronic substance abuse, suicide, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder. There is obviously a lot of intermingling of these problems, but they present serious issues for many veterans.
While we can only honor the memories of the veterans who died in war zones, everyone concerned about our living veterans can take action to address problems presently confronting them. That could help to prevent future war-related deaths. When we see veterans in distress, we can reach out to them, provide a voice of caring and make a referral to a helpline for expert assistance.
Everyone can provide a service to our community of living veterans by speaking out on their behalf in public. We should inform members of our congressional delegation, as well as state and local leaders, that we expect them to advocate for preserving and protecting veterans and the benefits they have rightfully earned. The message must be that we will not put up with massive cuts of medical and support staffing at VA medical facilities. The lives and health of our veteran population must not be sacrificed based on unsupported claims of wasteful spending in veterans programs.
Our senators and congressmen should take aggressive action to maintain the current level of VA spending and to ensure funding of the PACT Act in the current budget fight. Funding must be restored for important programs designed to halt the war-related deaths of our veterans, including lifesaving cancer trials, mental health care, and suicide prevention. These essential programs, along with many others, must be restored, stabilized and adequately funded, in order to address war-related injuries and illnesses in our veteran population. They deserve nothing less.
On Memorial Day, May 26, let’s remember, honor and mourn those gallant Americans who gave their lives in service to this great country. We should also pay tribute to the veterans who died off of the battlefield because of war-related causes. And let’s resolve to do our utmost to prevent future loss of life for that veteran population.

The State Historical Society of North Dakota has about 10,000 military items, but only about 5% is displayed at one time. The new North Dakota Military Gallery, planned for the state Capitol grounds in Bismarck, will be able to showcase more of the collection.
Brig. Gen. Jackie Huber, deputy adjutant general for the North Dakota National Guard, said one unique aspect of the new museum is that it will focus on North Dakota’s role in the military and the stories of state service members serving abroad and at home.


How to donate
For information on how to donate an item for the museum collection, visit the Historical Society’s website.


“We have a number of Medal of Honor recipients that I think most North Dakotans don’t even know the stories behind them,” Huber said. “We are also going to incorporate Native American stories of the warrior culture before statehood, so that’s really unique, too.”
A groundbreaking for the North Dakota Military Gallery is expected mid-summer, with completion planned for fall 2027.
In anticipation, the Historical Society is looking to fill some gaps in its military collection, said Lori Nohner, research historian at the State Historical Society of North Dakota.
The collection begins with the Civil War and goes all the way through the Global War on Terror to current military items.

The collection features a handful of uniforms worn by soldiers who fought in the Civil War and who moved to the Dakota Territory following the conflict. One uniform was worn by a member of the Dakota Territory Guard, which was a precursor to the state’s National Guard.
“This was a guy from Wisconsin who came to North Dakota and homesteaded, and then he went back to Wisconsin, but he stayed long enough to be in the Guard,” Nohner said.
The Historical Society also has a Spanish-American War cavalry uniform worn by former state lawmaker Leslie Simpson of Dickinson and a Navy officers peacoat from World War II, worn by Lt. William Guy of Devils Lake who later became the 26th governor of North Dakota.
Guy served as a gunnery officer on the U.S. Navy Destroyer William D. Porter, which was sunk by kamikaze pilots near Okinawa, Japan in 1945.
“His original uniform is at the bottom of the ocean, so this is his uniform from the rest of his service during World War II,” Nohner said.

The collection needs more Coast Guard uniforms and items from the Navy after the Korean War, Nohner said. The Historical Society also is seeking more uniforms worn by women, Native Americans and other minorities.
When people donate old military uniforms and fatigues, Nohner said they’re asked to provide a story about the service member and a photo of the person in the uniform to stand alongside the collection.
“You can get some information just looking at a uniform, but you can’t get the whole story,” Nohner said. “You can’t get the personal stories. The real meaty, interesting histories.”
Nohner said some of her favorite military items are the less ceremonial items, such as physical training sweatsuits. She said the Historical Society would accept an iPod used by a service member during a deployment, or even military-issued underwear, socks and other everyday items.
“They are so ubiquitous, but no one seems to donate them to a museum because they wear them out,” she said. “They keep wearing them. That’s why we don’t have many boots from World War I because the soldiers would wear them when they got home.”
Nohner said personal items have become increasingly difficult to find. More recent service members are less likely to have letters or photographs they sent home.
The Historical Society also has a need for more modern, American-made military weaponry, she said.
“We have a lot of foreign weapons from World War I especially because they were taken as souvenirs and the War Department divvied up a lot of war trophies … to the states based on how many people per capita served,” Nohner said.

People who donate items to the collection can make appointments at the Heritage Center to view their items in the collection vaults. 
“There’s still a lot of things that we’re preserving for the next generation that maybe don’t go up on exhibit, so we’re happy to show any donors the items that they donated,” Nohner said.
She added the storage spaces housing the military uniforms and other items are climate-controlled to keep the artifacts at the right temperature, in the best humidity conditions and lighting to prevent fading.
The Historical Society and the North Dakota National Guard have been consulting about the new gallery since October and working together to determine the displays and content for the new museum, Nohner said.
The total cost of the Military Gallery is estimated at $77.9 million, with about half of the funding coming from the state and half coming from private donations to the North Dakota National Guard Foundation.
Lawmakers so far have approved $19.2 million in state funding, with some of the allocation contingent on private donations being pledged. Legislators earlier this year also approved a $20 million Bank of North Dakota line of credit for the museum and directed the Historical Society to request funding in 2027 if the loan is used. 
Huber, who also serves as president of the North Dakota National Guard Foundation, said about $8 million in private donations have been raised out of the $40 million fundraising goal. She said many donors were waiting to see how much the state planned to contribute. Fundraisers also are working to secure larger donations from corporations involved in the defense industry.
“We have got a number of pending proposals,” Huber said. “Nobody has said, ‘No,’ to it, if you can believe that, which is pretty incredible.”
The Historical Society is continuing to add to its video collection of thousands of veterans’ oral histories. Veterans interested in making a testimonial should make an appointment at the Heritage Center to record the first-hand stories of their service time.
“Our goal is to have these last for hundreds and hundreds of years, not just for the next generation, this is for several more generations,” Nohner said.",https://northdakotamonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_1296edit-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-05-26 06:03:45.695262

(Courtesy of Honor and Remember Nebraska)OMAHA — It was a cold January day when an idea popped into Jim Meier’s head — why not plant a tree for every fallen soldier from Nebraska?
“It was just me talking to me,” said Meier, a Vietnam War veteran and tree lover, who jotted down the thought.
It’s a thought that has grown over three years into the planting of nearly 2,000 trees across the state as part of a “Nebraska Memorial Forest,” with small groves in Omaha, Lincoln, South Sioux City and Papillion.


Nebraska Memorial Forest

“It seems only worthy and appropriate to provide support and comfort for those who have fallen,” Meier said. “It’s such a small action we Nebraskans can take to pay tribute.”
The Omaha-based sports psychologist and development consultant has some experience in that realm already as director of Honor and Remember Nebraska, an all-volunteer nonprofit organization.
That group, founded in 2012, provides “honor and remember” flags for Gold Star families — those who have lost a loved one in active-duty military service — and “honor and sacrifice” flags for families who have lost a first responder or law enforcement officer.
Meier, 79, said the Memorial Forest trees are intended to be a “living memorial” to fallen heroes.
So far, 1,785 trees have been planted for the 7,500 soldiers, first responders and law enforcement officers “known” to have fallen.
On Memorial Day, Meier’s group will dedicate groves of 50 trees in Valentine and 70 in Bassett after dedicating 92 trees on May 17 that were planted last fall at Summit Lake State Recreation Area near Tekamah.
The first 60 Memorial Forest trees were planted in 2020 at Omaha’s Levi-Carter Park, and similar sized forests are now located in 15 other communities, from the Horning State Farm Demonstration Forest near Plattsmouth to along old Highway 2 that through south Lincoln.
Conversations, Meier said, are underway to plant new forests of at least 50 trees each in communities from Falls City to Scottsbluff and Beatrice to Aurora.
The group hopes to plant 1,500 new trees this year, and complete the project by 2030.
Meier said there’s a lot of analogies between military service and a grove of trees.
Trees were chosen and assigned to a plot of land — as are soldiers — he said, and while each tree is unique, there are many species and types that become stronger when working together as a grove or military unit.
Because there is no official data base of “fallen heroes,” he said the Memorial Forest group is always learning about someone new. They are added to the list, Meier said.
Each tree, typically six-feet-tall and of several, native varieties, costs about $300 each, money raised through donations or sponsorships.
For instance, the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission donated and planted the trees at Summit Lake, with the help of contributions by Tekamah native Ron Carson and his wife Jeanie. The Middle Niobrara Natural Resources District planted and will care for the trees at Valentine and Bassett.
Each tree is named for a military member, first responder or law enforcement officer who died while serving or from causes directly related from having served. Thus soldiers who died from exposure to Agent Orange or burn pits in Iraq are eligible.
Signage near the groves of trees features a QR code so that people can access a website that lists the location of each tree and the person associated with it, along with stories based on available information about them.
Eligibility extends back to the Spanish-American War of 1898.
Meier said he hopes the groves prove educational for those who visit the trees, as well as providing comfort for families and honoring those who made the ultimate sacrifice.

While the federal government protects animals listed under the Endangered Species Act, states are tasked with keeping the vast majority of other species out of the “emergency room.” Habitat loss, pollution and climate change are making that job much more difficult.
At the same time, states are finding it harder to count on the hunting and fishing revenues that have long funded most of their work. Agencies say they have more challenges than ever before, and less money to take them on.
In many states, lawmakers are rethinking the long-standing model for wildlife management. They’re considering new funding sources to make the agencies less reliant on license fees. They’re asking wildlife managers to expand their work beyond traditional “game” species, adding protections for threatened insects and other animals. And some are scrutinizing the commissions that have long governed wildlife management.
Some of the proposals have seen broad support from outdoors lovers who want to strengthen their wildlife agencies. Others have drawn opposition from sporting groups, who fear the new focus will diminish hunting and fishing opportunities.
“We’re seeing quite a bit of action this year,” said Logan Christian, wildlife and habitat specialist with the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators, a forum for state lawmakers. “We definitely have noticed that states are working on strengthening their wildlife agencies.”
As Stateline previously reported, New Mexico enacted the most sweeping overhaul this year. It renamed the Department of Game & Fish as the Department of Wildlife, giving it a more explicit focus on non-game species. Budget writers provided $10.5 million in new funding over the next three years to help threatened species. And lawmakers created a new process for appointing the agency’s commissioners, with guidelines ensuring a diversity of expertise and experience.
Wildlife advocates in other states say the New Mexico overhaul was a game changer. But lawmakers elsewhere are taking a more piecemeal approach.
Dollars
Numerous states are reconsidering their wildlife agencies’ funding model.
“There’s definitely a growing awareness that the current management system is outdated and really unfit for 21st century challenges,” said Michelle Lute, executive director of Wildlife for All, a nonprofit focused on overhauling state wildlife governance. “State wildlife agencies are seeing that they can’t rely on hunting and fishing license fees to be able to do this work.”

Earlier this year, lawmakers in Utah enacted a new tax on wind and solar projects that will help fund the state’s wildlife agency. The revenue could double the department’s funding to protect non-game species, from $5 million to $10 million.
“We have a funding model in place for game species,” said Paul Thompson, administrator of the Species Protection Account with the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. “Funding to work on some of our native species programs has been really hard to come by.”
The new revenue could allow the agency to invest in more biologists, conservation easements, watershed restoration projects and native fish hatchery programs. State Rep. Casey Snider, the Republican who sponsored the bill, argued that the clean energy sector should pay because its development is harming Utah’s habitat.
“Wind and solar projects have an outsized impact on [non-game] species, and they have not been contributing financially,” he said.
But industry leaders said the law will threaten the state’s energy development.
“[The measure will] severely strain the economics of an existing project and send a negative message to developers and the financial institutions that provide capital for these projects,” said Theresa Foxley, chief of staff to rPlus Energies, a renewable developer, in testimony to lawmakers.
Lawmakers in Oregon are considering an increase to the state’s tax on hotel and short-term rental stays to help fund non-game wildlife work. The proposal would bring in about $30 million annually. State Rep. Ken Helm, the bill’s Democratic sponsor, said the state wildlife agency’s division to manage non-game species “has come and gone over the last 30 years as funding is available.”
Growing concerns about climate change and biodiversity have created urgency to find a stable funding source, he said. Helm said the lodging tax is a logical source, because the state’s tourism industry is centered on the outdoors. He noted that Oregon’s natural resources agencies receive only a tiny fraction of the state’s general revenue.
Travel and tourism groups oppose the bill, arguing it could drive visitors elsewhere. Helm has also proposed a bill that would bring in wildlife funding through an income tax increase.
He said his message to fellow lawmakers was: “I’ve given you two ways to get the money we need for this agency. Nobody’s been able to come up with a better idea. Just pick one.”
The bill was heard in committee earlier this month, but has not yet advanced.
Meanwhile, lawmakers in Hawaii approved a “green fee” — a lodging tax increase of 0.75% that Democratic Gov. Josh Green’s office estimates will bring in $100 million annually to help protect the state from climate change. While the fund is not explicitly focused on wildlife, it’s expected to contribute to efforts such as coral reef restoration and watershed protection that will benefit important habitats.
State Rep. Amy Perruso, a Democrat who was among the advocates for a green fee, said the COVID-19 pandemic was a wakeup call.
“With the absence of tourists, we saw a lot more fish in the ocean, everything about the environment was so much more healthy because we didn’t have 10 million extra people,” she said. “If we’re going to do something to protect the environment, [tourism] is a logical connection.”
Washington state was among the first to significantly invest in non-game conservation through state tax revenue, with legislation enacted two years ago. The budget passed by lawmakers this session continues that work, with $14 million set aside for biodiversity and species recovery each of the next two years.
Lawmakers in Kansas and North Carolina also proposed using more general fund revenue for wildlife work, although those measures have not advanced.
Mission
In other states, lawmakers are focused on expanding their wildlife agencies’ mission to more non-game species. Last year, Colorado gave wildlife managers the authority to manage insects and other invertebrates, as well as rare plants.
“Invertebrates are wildlife, and their conservation benefits the entire ecosystem, including the species [state wildlife officials] traditionally managed,” said Richard Reading, vice chair of the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission. “They do everything from creating our soils to filtering our water to pollinating the food we eat.”
Reading also serves as vice president of science and conservation at the Butterfly Pavilion, an insect zoo. He noted that studies are showing that many invertebrate species are in rapid decline. In addition to expanding the agency’s authority, lawmakers provided funding for six staff members to take on the additional work.
A similar bill in Nevada, focused on invertebrates, advanced through the Assembly’s natural resources committee.
“There’s definitely concerns about declines in pollinator species,” said Assemblymember Howard Watts, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. “Our wildlife agency can and should take proactive action to do research, surveys and habitat improvement to keep these species off the [endangered species list].”
Watts said the bill would allow wildlife managers to consider insects in state plans to protect imperiled species. He said the Nevada Department of Wildlife has requested an entomologist position if it’s asked to take on the additional species. Beyond that, he said, the measure would not require additional money, as it’s focused on voluntary, proactive work, rather than additional regulations.
Another bill in Pennsylvania would expand wildlife managers’ authority to include insects. That measure has been approved by the House Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee.
Sporting groups have largely been supportive of efforts to provide new funding sources to manage non-game species. But some are skeptical of plans to expand agencies’ mission without an increase in revenue.
“Most hunters and anglers understand that healthy game populations are dependent on ecosystem integrity,” said Devin O’Dea, Western policy and conservation manager with Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, a nonprofit focused on public lands. “But when you take a model that’s been developed with the intent of enforcing regulations for fish and game species, expand that scope without funding and additional capacity, it’s a recipe for something to fall off the plate.”
Governance
Meanwhile, some legislators want to rethink the commission model that oversees wildlife governance. Critics say that governors often select commissioners who are hunting guides, farmers and political donors. Once appointed, they enact wildlife policies to suit their economic interests.
Florida state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, a Democrat, drafted a bill that would overhaul the state’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Her proposal would increase the board from seven to nine members. It would designate seats for scientists, conservationists, local officials, farmers, hunters and anglers.
“The commission has made decisions not based on science or conservation, but based on developers or landowners that engage in agricultural practices,” she said. “We tried to strike a balance to ensure there are voices with an environmental background, with a conservation and wildlife background, with an academic background.”
The bill did not advance, but Eskamani said grassroots support is building for systemic changes in wildlife management.
Some sporting groups are more wary of commission overhaul proposals.
“We have seen examples where proposed changes to commissions were politically motivated or motivated by anti-hunting and anti-angling interests,” said Kent Keene senior manager for Western states and agriculture policy with the Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation, a group that promotes hunting and fishing priorities on Capitol Hill. “When those changes are focused on science-based needs, then the sportsmen’s community has a long history of supporting those steps to ensure we are protecting our heritage.”
Some hunting and fishing groups have emphasized that the expanded mission should come with additional funding, so agencies aren’t stretched thin. Keene noted that hunters and anglers pay an excise tax on the purchase of gear, which provides an important funding source for wildlife agencies. Some have proposed a similar “backpack tax” on gear for hikers, birdwatchers and others.
Another proposal in New Hampshire would give the wildlife agency’s executive director the authority to make policy decisions, relegating the Fish and Game Commission to an advisory body. That bill did not advance.

Bliss in El Paso, Texas on Armed Forces Day was an important occasion. Veterans Day and Memorial Day were revered in a city where the military presence was strong. Recent politicians have called for replacing these solemn occasions with holidays celebrating American victories in World War I and World War II. To do that would be to undermine what makes the Armed Forces Day, Memorial Day, and Veterans Day special.
This is not to knock America’s performance in both world wars. It was impressive what Americans were able to accomplish.  In fact, I’ve written columns about our victories in these conflicts. I was even criticized by some readers for my verbal attacks on Nazis for their killing of U.S. P.O.W.s and pretending to surrender in order to kill more G.I.s (I was accused of spreading “propaganda.”  I’ve written how we should honor American generals, not praise Nazi Generals.
But Armed Forces Day is about honoring all active-duty military. Veterans Day is for recognizing the living veterans who served this country. And Memorial Day is about commemorating those who gave their lives in defense of this country.
Making May 8 “Victory Day for World War II” completely ignores those who still had plenty of fighting in the Pacific. I would recommend the politician who suggested it should study the Battle of Okinawa, and see what our U.S. Marines and Army accomplished in that fight, which lasted until June 22. That politician should watch “Hacksaw Ridge,” and learn what happened to the sailors who suffered from a massive Kamikaze attack, as well as the pilots who took on the massive Japanese battleship Yamato. All in all, 12,000 Americans and General Simon Bolivar Buckner Jr. died, while another 36,000 suffered wounds. There’s no word on how many were afflicted with terrible memories of that conflict, which did not conclude until well after V-E Day.
To replace Veterans Day with “Victory Day” set off a colleague of mine, a veteran who earned two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star in Vietnam. “So how about a day for Korea?” he texted me. “Guess, technically that one isn’t over. Panama? Invasion but not really a war. But didn’t we win in Panama? Shouldn’t we celebrate that? Desert Storm? Wasn’t that a win? What else? Maybe we could….have a big military parade on every one of them? Isn’t that how you’re supposed to celebrate a victory?”
He wasn’t done, by a long shot. “And since it’s all about wins now and not really about honoring veterans, no more uncomfortable visits to cemeteries and VA hospitals? Wars are or should be last resort solutions to perceived problems. We had it right. Focus on the people who have served our country, often at great risk and sacrifice, by individuals, including sometimes the ultimate sacrifice. Why can’t we just continue to recognize that? People who only think in terms of wins and losses should stick to football and leave the analysis of a war to adults who have a clue of what war is like and what it does to people and to a country. But that kind of history makes some people uncomfortable and heaven forbid that anyone should ever have to be uncomfortable and have to think about anything that might upset them.”
He continued in perhaps the longest text I have ever received. “You know, I have a bias when it comes to war. Having known and having had serious conversations about serious things with friends whose names are now inscribed on a wall up in D.C. probably does that.”
For those who still serve, served in the past, and those who paid the ultimate price, let’s preserve Armed Forces Day, Veterans Day, and Memorial Day instead of changing these for political purposes. It’s the least we can do for them.

More than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery. 
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial. 
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”

On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time. 
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.
Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said. 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said. 
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”

There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one — an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown — history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.”

(Darwin Fan/Getty Images) Memorial Day is a time to set aside our differences and join together in remembering and thanking those brave souls who gave their last full measure for their fellow Americans. They deserve that honor even for serving in what some thought to be an ill-advised conflict. Vietnam turned out to be such a war, but that cannot take away from the fact that the 58,220 service personnel who died in that war were answering the call of their country and doing it well.
On Memorial Day, we think of the almost 1,355,000 service personnel who have perished in the nation’s conflicts, starting with the 70,000 who died in the Revolutionary War. Since then, about 655,000 died on both sides of the Civil War. The death toll in World War I was 116,516, and 406,399 died in World War II. The vicious and almost forgotten Korean War saw 36,574 deaths. After Vietnam, 2,325 died in the War in Afghanistan and 4,492 in the Iraq War. May they all rest in peace.
But there are others we should hold in our hearts in addition to those who died in the war theaters. War has a way of inflicting mortal injuries that only take their toll on veterans after the guns are silenced. They include illnesses caused by exposure to toxins, like poisonous gas in WWI, Agent Orange in Vietnam and burn pit fumes in the Gulf War, Afghanistan and Iraq. Those toxins have resulted in untold deaths from a variety of cancers and other diseases. They are not counted on the official death tallies, but they nevertheless are directly attributable to combat conditions.

Many veterans have experienced health problems attributable to wartime conditions or know of others who have. It has been estimated that about 300,000 Vietnam veterans have died because of exposure to Agent Orange. The late Dan Eismann, my colleague of 12 years on the Idaho Supreme Court, received substantial exposure to Agent Orange during two tours in Vietnam. While on the  ourt, he developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma and metastatic melanoma, passing away with honor last year. 
I was also exposed during my Vietnam service and developed pancreatic cancer in 2017. With surgery, chemo and a great deal of luck, I’ve been cured.

More recently, about 60,000 veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are suffering and dying from medical ailments caused by exposure to toxins emanating from burn pits used to destroy all sorts of trash. Congress finally passed the PACT Act in 2022 to provide the necessary medical care, but the act has not been funded for the current fiscal year. That is a serious breach of the country’s duty to those veterans.
There are many other serious problems that our veteran community faces on an all-too-frequent basis, including mental health issues, chronic substance abuse, suicide, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress. There is obviously a lot of intermingling of these problems, but they present serious issues for many veterans.
While we can only honor the memories of the veterans who died in war zones, everyone concerned about our living veterans can take action to address problems presently confronting them. That could help to prevent future war-related deaths. When we see veterans in distress, we can reach out to them, provide a voice of caring and make a referral to a helpline for expert assistance.
Everyone can provide a service to our community of living veterans by speaking out on their behalf in public. We should inform members of our congressional delegation, as well as state and local leaders, that we expect them to advocate for preserving and protecting veterans and the benefits they have rightfully earned. 
The message must be that we will not put up with massive cuts of medical and support staffing at VA medical facilities. The lives and health of our veteran population must not be sacrificed based on unsupported claims of wasteful spending in veterans programs.
Our senators and congressmen should take aggressive action to maintain the current level of VA spending and to ensure funding of the PACT Act in the current budget fight. Funding must be restored for important programs designed to halt the war-related deaths of our veterans, including lifesaving cancer trials, mental health care, and suicide prevention. 
These essential programs, along with many others, must be restored, stabilized and adequately funded, in order to address war-related injuries and illnesses in our veteran population. They deserve nothing less.
On Memorial Day, May 26, let’s remember, honor and mourn those gallant Americans who gave their lives in service to this great country. We should also pay tribute to the veterans who died off of the battlefield because of war-related causes. And let’s resolve to do our utmost to prevent future loss of life for that veteran population.

More than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery. 
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial. 
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time.

After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.
Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said. 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said. 
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.

“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.”

While their friends are cannonballing into the city pool this weekend, my sons will spend the day in an Eastern Kentucky cemetery, placing flowers on the graves of relatives they never knew.
We are going back home on Decoration Day — a folk tradition practiced by generations of Appalachians and Southerners dedicated to visiting cemeteries where their families are buried to clean and decorate their graves, and often to attend a religious service and dinner on the cemetery grounds.
Like most who grew up in Eastern Kentucky, I’ve been practicing various rites of Decoration Day all my life. I loved the reunions, playing with my cousins, and filling plates of food and desserts. Although, I admit: I have often seen the other parts of Decoration Day as an unnecessary effort, one I had little interest in carrying on. What good was there in spending money on artificial flowers for people who would never know you made the gesture?
Yet this year, something changed. Perhaps it was turning 40, or the reckoning of the pandemic, or both, that made Decoration Day seem urgent and important not only to observe, but to pass down to my children.
As my perspective changed, my interest grew and sent me seeking answers, both historical and personal, about the cultural tradition, its origins, and why I felt a sudden urge to drag my three children to a cemetery on their first week of summer vacation.
 What Is Decoration Day?

In Ohio, the streets of my small town are lined with tiny American flags. Living near a military base, with many active-duty and retired U.S. Air Force neighbors, I am keenly aware of the reverence paid to Memorial Day. Each year, I’d find myself asking my friends, “We always called it Decoration Day. We decorated everyone’s graves. Did you?” The answer was, with rare exception, no. Secretly, I worried if somehow I had incorrectly celebrated a patriotic holiday. Was this the same as not knowing I needed to illuminate a flag at night or take it down in the rain? Did we get this wrong? Had we expanded it selfishly to include everyone when we should have been only honoring those who died in battle?
For insight, I turned to the book “Decoration Day in the Mountains,” by folklorist Alan Jabbour, founding director of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress.
Jabbour’s thorough exploration of Decoration Day relieved me of my concerns and filled me with a new appreciation for history and rituals.

Decoration Day, Jabbour wrote, actually inspired Memorial Day, pre-dating any post-Civil War celebration in the South or North. Before the war, Appalachians and Southerners were already practicing what they called Decoration Day, also called “a decoration,”  which involved an annual “cleaning of community cemeteries, decorating them with flowers, and holding a religious service in the cemetery, often with “dinner on the ground.” Families spent weeks leading up to Decoration Day making buds and petals from bright crepe paper, cleaning the cemeteries.
His research also softened my other silent concern that Decoration Day was tied up in celebrating the Confederacy. Jabbour explains that two early and unrelated celebrations of the Confederate dead — one in Charleston, South Carolina, and the other in Petersburg, Virginia — both using the word “decoration” and both using flowers, led Jabbour to the conclude that organizers of the events each drew upon an existing tradition.
After reading Jabbour’s book, I called my grandmother, with whom I had tagged along to the cemetery, reunions and flower-buying expeditions. It was she who had carried the duty of Decoration Day to me, and I wanted to know why.
 ‘I was kindly like your youngins‘

One question from me about Decoration Day transports my grandmother back to her childhood — and ties me to the generations that came before me.
“Can you tell me what you remember about Decoration Day?”
From the old days?
“Yes.”





It used to be a big day for people. When I was a little girl, my grandma would start in her spare time … and make crepe paper flowers. She usually made them out of bright red and turquoise and bright pink and white crepe paper. They would make a bud, and cut out petals, and take a knife to the petal and scrape the end of it to make it lay down and curl. They would have their wire, and put that bud on the end of the wire, and start with the little petals and tie them on.
It was about two-and-a-half  miles to that cemetery. Grandpa would always walk, and grandma would be on the horse. She would have a basket full of fried chicken, maybe fried pies, and cake, just food like that. And me, I was always running. We cut through the hills instead of going on the main road … we’d come down so far out of that hollow and then cut through the hill. When you go through the hills there’s wild honeysuckle, the prettiest orange, and as you go up through there, there are pine trees … and it smells like pine all the way through there. It was where grandma’s babies were buried, ones who died when they were born, and her son who died when he was 21.
They’d sing, decorate graves, and talk, a lot of them hadn’t seen each other in a month or a few weeks.
They had a preacher; he always, at least to me, preached too long. I would get so hot and tired that I just wanted to hurry up and get gone. …
I’ll be honest with you, I was kindly like your youngins, I never was still.  As far as standing around and watching what everybody did, I just sure didn’t. But I do remember decorating the graves. I think it’s important to decorate.			


Hearing her stories made it clear: Decoration Day, for me, was the remembering, linking myself and my children to the generations before us.
As I grow older, and as a pandemic has brought the fragility of life into clear focus, I’m buoyed by the remembering, by the traditions that connect the present, future and past. To quote Alan Jabbour, “At the deepest spiritual level, a decoration is an act of respect for the dead that reaffirms one’s bonds with those who have gone before.”
And so today, my children will carry the flowers over the hillside to the graves of their great-grandfather, great-great grandparents and other relatives.
We’ll make sure to place a small bouquet on the stone of my grandfather’s little brother, who died as an infant.
They’ll listen to our stories as we walk around the cemetery, and I hope, feel connected to the people who came before them.
They will get hot, tired, and bored.
Like their great-grandmother 80 years before them, they will want us to hurry up and get gone.
But someday, maybe they will want to come back.

(Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)When I began teaching courses on homelessness and poverty at Gettysburg College more than 20 years ago, I regularly noted to my students that I often found common cause with a wide range of people from across the political spectrum when it came to seeking solutions and providing services for homeless veterans.
While some people certainly still make the right noises in this regard, the current obsession with wiping the slate of the federal government clean and starting from scratch now is putting many veterans at-risk.
Homelessness is a tragedy that affects far too many Americans, and the reality is that“[h]omelessness remains more common among veterans compared to non-veterans.” Veterans are especially vulnerable to a number of risk factors related to homelessness, including substance abuse, PTSD, mental health issues, low income, and economic instability.
Unfortunately, veterans who fall into homelessness are also particularly prone to remaining unhoused, as research indicates that, “98% of homeless veterans have a chronic pattern of homelessness.” As the Pennsylvania Department of Military and Veterans Affairs notes in this regard: “For some, taking off the uniform and acclimating to a non-military life comes with social challenges and can ultimately lead to hard times, such as being homeless. U.S. military veterans are estimated to make up a large portion – 11 percent – of homeless adults.”
Although PTSD and related disorders certainly loom large amongst the risk factors for veteran homelessness, it is important to keep in mind that the number one reason for homelessness in America today is actually the lack of affordable housing. As reported in the Independent in its recent coverage of Elon Musk’s baseless claim that “the word ‘homeless’ is a ‘lie’ and ‘a propaganda word,’” the reality in the United States today is that “[t]he primary driver of homelessness, particularly among families, is a lack of stable affordable housing, with evictions, overcrowded housing, domestic violence and job losses sending homeless families into shelters and onto the streets.”
Currently, the curtailing of rental assistance seems poised to tip tens of thousands more Americans out of housing. Experts suggest that many of us are more vulnerable to such risks than we’d like to imagine, and veterans are especially so. Given this reality, it is particularly alarming that under the Trump Administration, the VA recently “has ended a new mortgage-rescue program that so far has helped about 20,000 veterans avoid foreclosure and keep their homes.”
As did the Obama Administration before him, Trump has claimed that he will end veteran homelessness. It is only fair to note that the Obama Administration had some successes in striving towards that goal. In this current environment, however, it is difficult to reconcile Trump’s rhetoric in this regard with sweeping executive actions demolishing some of the key federal players in this effort. To cite one staggering recent example, “[t]he US Interagency Council on Homelessness, which helps coordinate federal housing aid to cities, was targeted for elimination by a Trump executive order in March.” Moreover, according to the New York Times, the president seeks to end permanent supportive housing for an estimated 300,000 people considered chronically homeless. Many are veterans.
Veterans are more vulnerable than the general population to the sweeping demolishment of the federal government. This is not simply because the “Department of Veterans Affairs is planning to cut 83,000 jobs, slashing employment by over 17% at the federal agency that provides health care for millions of veterans” It is also in part because “nearly 30% of federal workers are veterans, half of whom are disabled. This means that veterans, who make up 6.1% of the U.S. population, are disproportionately affected by federal worker cuts.”
Because the vast bulk of the VA workforce provides veteran healthcare, “cuts to VA workers mean cuts to health care.” Since veterans as a group rely so heavily on Medicaid, cuts to that program disproportionately disadvantage veterans. Furthermore, because “[w]orking-age veterans face an elevated risk of experiencing food insecurity compared to their nonveteran peers,” cuts to food assistance programs also hit veterans harder than other groups.
  The Iron Mike statue overlooks the La Fiere bridge in Normandy, France. (Tim Lambert/Pennsylvania Capital-Star).
The news is not all bad, and in our own region in Pennsylvania, efforts to help house homeless Vets have been laudable and even inspiring. For example, a tiny home project for veterans experiencing homelessness opened last year in Harrisburg. In addition, the commonwealth offers VETConnect Services, and there are a number of local private organizations dedicated to helping veterans at risk of homelessness. This includes a dedicated veteran aspect of the 211 program, which allows those in need of services to dial 211 to find help.
In the end, though, only on the national level can we find the resources to coordinate efforts and to tackle challenges on this scale. In any case, it is only reasonable to expect the federal government that recruited and ordered these veterans into harm’s way to take the lead in seeking to offer them whatever services they need.
I am a Pennsylvania Quaker, a member of the pacifist religious organization that founded this Commonwealth. Quakers do not embrace military service, to be sure, but we do embrace ideals of honor, service, and integrity, and we believe strongly in honoring social contracts.
If someone feels moved by their conscience to perform military service and is true to their ideals, I do not condemn that person. Indeed, many such folks number amongst my closest friends, and even some of my family members. I believe that those who serve this country selflessly in any capacity deserve recognition and support for doing so, and not merely in terms of lip service.
If a veteran’s military experience results in the need for special accommodations, medical care, drug or alcohol rehabilitation, housing assistance, or similar services, I think that we should take special care to meet such needs.
My own father, a proud veteran of the U.S. Army, died homeless in 1988. He was a chronic alcoholic and estranged from his family, so I am sure that there are those out there who will claim that he brought his fate upon himself. I have always maintained, however, that we can do better as a nation, and that civilized people care for the most vulnerable amongst the population without regard to blame or shame.
I have spent much of my adult life trying my best to live this truth, through regular active service in my community, through educational opportunities for my students, and through leadership roles on boards and within service organizations.
Veterans Day was established to remember those who have fallen in defense of this country. Let us also remember on that day those who have served with honor but have fallen on hard times.

By most common measures, the life of Adriana Smith ended three months ago, when a tragic series of undiagnosed blood clots left her brain dead, with no hope of recovery. Yet today, in a hospital room in Midtown Atlanta, Adriana’s body is still being kept alive by machines, without regard to her family’s wishes.
As someone who has been there, I know how difficult and extremely personal that decision can be, but I can only imagine what it must be like to have that choice stripped away, as it has been stripped away from Adriana’s loved ones by people who don’t know them, who know little of their circumstances and deal with none of its consequences.
In Adriana’s case, she was nine weeks pregnant at the time the blood clots hit, which under some readings of Georgia law has meant that what remains of Adriana’s body is now under government control until the fetus can be safely extracted.
“She’s been breathing through machines for more than 90 days,” April Newkirk, Adriana’s mother, told 11Alive News. “It’s torture for me. I see my daughter breathing, but she’s not there.”
Doctors and lawyers at Emory Healthcare – but mainly the lawyers, I suspect – say that under Georgia’s anti-abortion law, they are required to keep Adriana’s body functioning as the fetus inside her develops. They are erring on the side of caution – not medical caution, but legal caution.
The law in question is the “Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act.” or the LIFE Act.

  Sen. Ed Setzler (Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder)
The main sponsor of that law, state Sen. Ed Setzler, R-Acworth, says it’s working as intended in this case.
“I’m proud that the hospital recognizes the full value of the small human life living inside of this regrettably dying young mother,” Setzler told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. “Mindful of the agony of this young mother’s family, the wisdom of modern medical science to be able to save the life of a healthy unborn child is something that I trust in future years will lead to great joy, with this child having a chance to grow into vibrant adulthood.”
Proud as he might be, Setzler isn’t the one who has to watch what’s left of his daughter lay lifeless in that hospital room, not alive exactly, with machines performing basic life functions, week after week. He isn’t the one who has to explain what’s happening to his seven-year-old grandson, Adriana’s son. If the fetus survives, he also isn’t the one who will have to raise the child. Doctors have warned Adriana’s family that the fetus has fluid on its brain, with unknown consequences.
“She’s pregnant with my grandson,” Newkirk said. “But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,” she said. “This decision should’ve been left to us.”
According to Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr, however, Emory Healthcare and Setzler are misreading the legislation.
“There is nothing in the LIFE Act that requires medical professionals to keep a woman on life support after brain death,” his office said in a statement. “Removing life support is not an action ‘with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy’.”
Carr’s reading of the law seems to be correct. As his statement indicates, the law defines abortion as “the act of using, prescribing, or administering any instrument, substance, device, or other means with the purpose to terminate a pregnancy,” and the withdrawal of extraordinary life-maintenance measures on a brain-dead woman would not fall within its restrictions.
But this is the problem when you try to write a law into black and white, when you try to legislate what is right and what is wrong when dealing with decisions that are so personal, so intimate. Moral certainty sounds good, it may feel good, it may play well in a political campaign, but it cannot possibly make such hard choices from a distance.

More than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest — not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery. 
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. 
“Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial. 
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”

On Dec. 7, 1941, during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time. 
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said. 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said. 
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one — an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown — history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.” 
A final sendoff at last.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-05-26 09:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT child tax credit still possible as budget talks hit home stretch,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/05/26/ct-budget-child-tax-credit/,"Democratic leaders are cautiously optimistic about one popular tax-cutting idea: A $150-per-child tax credit, up to $450 per household.","State legislators are focused mainly on spending now, trimming their requests to compromise soon with Gov. Ned Lamont on a new two-year budget.
But with just over one week left in the 2025 session, one popular tax-cutting idea is still alive: a new credit for low- and middle-income households with children.
Leaders of the Senate and House Democratic majorities were cautiously optimistic about the child tax credit, though the full program likely would need to be phased in over several years.
The initial $150 per child income tax break under consideration would cost state government $83 million per year, even as looming federal Medicaid cuts could cost Connecticut hundreds of millions in annual revenue. But given the unprecedented surpluses the state has amassed since 2017 and the extremely conservative revenue growth the Lamont administration has projected during its six years, lawmakers say Connecticut can afford this relief.
“We are trying very hard to protect that tax credit the best that we can,” said House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford.
“It still is a reasonable objective,” said Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, who said working families here needed more relief long before President Donald J. Trump and Congress began planning huge cutbacks in Medicaid, food stamps and other social assistance programs.
“The pressures [on working families] are going to be extreme, and we hear all the time about the potential Draconian, punitive choices” federal cutbacks will force upon them, Looney added.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said only that tax proposals remain part of ongoing budget negotiations among the administration and legislative leaders. The governor proposed boosting a different state income tax credit, one that offsets a portion of municipal property tax bills, from $300 to $350, while also broadening eligibility. 
Connecticut is the only state with a broad-based personal income tax that doesn’t account for the cost of raising children. Many Democratic lawmakers here largely have endorsed offering a $600-per-dependent credit with relief capped at $1,800 per household.
But because of the uncertainty surrounding federal funding, the General Assembly’s Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee endorsed a less costly $150-per-child credit starting with 2025 earnings and tax returns filed in the spring of 2026, with a maximum household benefit of $450.
It would be available to single parents earning up to $100,000 per year and couples earning up to $200,000, starting with 2026 earnings.
The credit would be gradually phased out above those income levels. For every $1,000 earned above those thresholds, households would lose 10% of the credit’s value.
The credit also would be refundable. Even if a household earns so little it has no state tax liability to reduce via the credit, it still would have $150 per child added to its refund.
Nonpartisan analysts project this tax break would cost government about $83 million per year, about the same as Lamont’s plan to expand the property tax credit. It’s also roughly one-quarter of what legislators anticipate the state would lose with a full $600-per-child benefit.
And while the finance committee measure wouldn’t order increases in the credit in future years, many supporters say proposals to increase the credit would enjoy strong backing down the road.
Rep. Jillian Gilchest, D-West Hartford, co-chairwoman of the Human Services Committee and another backer of the $600-per-child benefit, predicted most Democrats won’t be satisfied for long with “an austere child tax credit” given likely federal cutbacks in health and human service programs. 
“More people are going to feel the pain of these [federal] budget decisions,” she said.
Reformers have been clamoring for a child credit in recent years as public and private analyses show Connecticut’s state and municipal tax systems, combined, disproportionately burden the poor and middle class.
The Department of Revenue Services’ 2024 report found the lowest-earning 10% of households effectively spent almost 40% of their income in 2020 to cover state or municipal tax burdens, more than five times the rate faced by Connecticut’s highest earners and two-and-a-half times the statewide average.
Even one of the largest state tax cuts in 2023, which included the first income tax rate reduction since the mid-1990s, only slowed — but didn’t reverse — the ever-widening shift onto working families, according to a 2024 analysis from Connecticut Voices for Children, a progressive New Haven-based policy group.
The United Way of Connecticut, one of the progressive groups spearheading this year’s push for a child tax credit, released a report last October showing that a family of four — two parents and two children — needed to earn $113,520 in 2022 in this state to cover a basic “survival budget.”
The United Way’s methodology covers housing, food, utilities, transportation, child care and — assuming the family can’t afford a computer — at least one smart phone. By comparison, the Federal Poverty Level, a simple metric developed in the mid-1960s by U.S. Social Security Administration economists and based largely on the cost of a minimum food diet, said a family of four earning more than $27,750 in 2022 was above the poverty line.
“On a good day, 42% of Connecticut families with children struggle to make ends meet,” said Lisa Tepper Bates, president of the United Way’s Connecticut chapter. “The proposed cuts to Medicaid and SNAP will hit many Connecticut families hard. And ongoing economic upheaval and rising prices affect every family in our state. Creating a Connecticut child tax credit has never been more important.”
CT has underestimated tax revenues by wide margins
Legislators also were optimistic that Connecticut could afford to provide a child tax credit, even given the uncertainty of federal funding, given its budget caps and its track record of projecting revenues since Lamont took office in 2019.
These caps have generated surpluses averaging $1.8 billion, an amount equal to 8% of the General Fund, since they last were set in 2017. The administration is projecting a $2.4 billion surplus this year, equal to 10%. Analysts project budget caps will capture at least about $1.3 billion in each of the next two fiscal years.
Connecticut has funneled $12.5 billion in surpluses since 2017 to build reserves and scale back pension debt, a furious pace that far outstrips any similar effort in modern history. 
Critics say the state has overcompensated for fiscal mistakes of prior decades and is saving excessively now at the expense of core programs and tax relief for the poor and middle class.
The state also has been extremely conservative in its revenue projections in recent years.
Legislators largely build the budget each year using an April 30 forecast prepared by their nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis and by the governor’s budget staff. The basis for that forecast is income and other tax data provided by the administration, particularly the Department of Revenue Services.
Connecticut has amassed large surpluses in each of Lamont’s six years in office. Most of those surpluses turned out to be significantly larger than projected on April 30. The state’s fiscal year ends June 30, and the comptroller formally closes the books in late September.
Since Lamont has been governor, the actual surplus has topped the April 30 projection by an average of $600 million per year.
But 2020 and 2021 were outliers. The coronavirus led officials to push the 2020 income tax filing deadline back from Apil 15 to July 15. And in 2021 they moved it to May 15. In both cases, that meant analysts had limited data to build their projections.
But even if those two fiscal years are removed, the average increase in surplus after the April 30 projection has been $375 million.
“I believe it’s realistic to continue to talk about a phase-in” of a larger child tax credit, Looney said, noting that the average surplus in recent years far exceeds the cost of helping working families.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Nunez-Speech-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-05-26 06:03:45.695262

Today is Memorial Day – the day on which we honor the memory of the servicemen and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our nation.
All caring and thinking people should take at least a moment today to lift up these heroes.
And today would also be a good one to help assure that the government supports the heroes who are still with us.
And sadly, the need here is great.
As recent news reports have recounted in painful detail, Trump administration budget cuts are decimating the already understaffed and underfunded Veterans Administration and VA hospitals. More than 80,000 employees are being fired and that’s sure to wreak havoc with the services upon which millions of military veterans depend.
At a Voices for Veterans event in Fayetteville last week, several vets blasted the cuts as cruel, shortsighted, and sure to cause enormous pain and suffering.
The bottom line: Memorial Day is about remembering those we’ve lost – that’s for sure – but we also honor their sacrifice by doing everything in our power to spare living veterans from an early grave.

CAVE CITY, Ark. — When a severe tornado tore through Cave City, Arkansas, in March, retiree Debra Lindsey was in her trailer home with her husband.
“I didn’t even know there was a tornado on the ground until the sirens went off, and then in 45 seconds it was here,” Lindsey said. “It was very scary. If it would’ve been 100 to 150 feet closer to here, it would’ve taken the front of our trailer off.”
Even without a direct hit, she estimated that the damage to their home and property was between $30,000 and $40,000. Their storage buildings were destroyed, along with their two vehicles. And the insurance company won’t cover everything.
Across the street, Robert and Kymberlie Watson rode out the tornadoes with their seven children in the nearest storm shelter. When they returned, they found roughly $60,000 worth of damage to their property.
About one month after the tornadoes, the Trump administration denied Arkansas’ request for a major disaster declaration. The declaration would have brought federal funds into the state to help with recovery. Both families thought they’d have to pay out-of-pocket for repairs.
The power to grant a disaster declaration and access to the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s assistance programs lies solely in the hands of the president, and President Donald Trump’s administration is looking to significantly scale back FEMA and pass disaster recovery costs onto states.
Lindsey, a disabled retired nurse, feared that the lack of federal assistance for their home repairs would force her back into the workforce.

Another round of severe weather walloped the Lower Mississippi River Basin in early April, causing extensive flooding and more tornado damage in parts of Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky and Mississippi.
Then, some good news: The Trump administration reversed course on May 13 after an appeal and a personal plea from Arkansas Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders. The president granted a major disaster declaration, allowing individuals like Lindsey and the Watsons to apply for aid.
“If we get some help out of it, that’s absolutely amazing. We could really use it,” Kymberlie Watson said. “We’re surprised, a little bit … because the government actually stepped up and helped its citizens.”
Cave City may not be so lucky. Trump has yet to approve recovery assistance to public entities, which may leave local governments — including the town of less than 2,000 residents — with big bills. On May 3, Sanders submitted another disaster declaration application asking for extensive public assistance. Requests for FEMA aid from Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee also remain outstanding, though the Trump administration did grant Kentucky’s request.
“President Trump and his administration will continue working to further empower state and local governments to build their own resilience before disaster strikes and to execute rapid, smart response when supplemental federal assistance is required to truly protect citizens and aid a return to normalcy,” a White House official wrote the Desk by email.
Cave City pushes forward
Cave City Mayor Jonas Anderson was at a ribbon-cutting event for the city’s ambulance service when he learned of the initial rejection from the Trump administration. His first thought?
“You have got to be kidding me,” he said.

Anderson estimated that some 50 Cave City homes were damaged in the March tornado, and 25 of those were completely destroyed. He said underinsurance was likely a huge issue in the community, and the costs for the city to remove all the debris might run over $300,000 for a municipality that only has an annual budget of around $1.4 million. Cave City also lost its only grocery store, forcing residents to drive 20 to 30 minutes to nearby towns for necessities.
A disaster declaration opens up potential programs for state and local governments to recoup some money spent on removing debris and repairing infrastructure. It can also unlock assistance programs for individuals, including post-disaster support services and financial aid for people who are uninsured or underinsured. Not all programs are offered for every disaster.
After a disaster, government personnel assess the cost of damage. Sanders’ requests for federal disaster aid for dozens of counties mostly in the Arkansas Delta estimated public damages at over $21 million from both the March and April storms, including more than $3 million in Sharp County, home to part of Cave City.
FEMA uses cost per capita to gauge whether local and state governments can handle recovery themselves, or if they’ll need federal help. Those thresholds currently stand at $4.72 per capita for counties and $1.89 per capita for states. Per capita damages for Sharp County, where Cave City is located, are estimated at $179.
But meeting those thresholds does not guarantee that the president will approve a disaster declaration. A president is not required to justify their decision, and documentation of the reasons for denial is considered privileged — not public record.
Sanders released a statement thanking the Trump administration for finally delivering individual assistance, but did not mention her second, outstanding request for public assistance and additional funds. She also expressed support for Trump’s efforts to reform FEMA.
“Our entire state is grateful for President Trump’s leadership and assistance as we recover from the devastating storms that struck Arkansas earlier this spring,” Sanders said. “I had a productive conversation with the President in which he expressed his support for our state and I offered my full endorsement of his plans to reform FEMA to save money and provide greater direct assistance to disaster victims.”
FEMA politics
Over the past two years, the Biden administration provided more than $101 million in public disaster recovery funding to Arkansas, according to FEMA data. And before that, the first Trump administration gave Arkansas more than $101 million in federal disaster recovery assistance between 2017 and 2020.
States in the Lower Mississippi River Basin have received more than $31.3 billion in federal public recovery assistance following natural disasters since 1998, according to FEMA data. Hurricane response has consistently required the most federal assistance.
In recent years, there have been more requests for disaster declarations and more of them have been approved than denied. Between 1953 and 1999, Lower Mississippi River Basin states saw two approvals for every one denial. Within the last 25 years, the approval ratio rose to 5-1.
John Gasper, an associate professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business, found in a 2015 analysis of county-level FEMA data from 1992 through 2005 that the chance of a denial is lower when the president and governor belong to the same political party. In “non-election years or non-opportune times,” denials typically follow FEMA’s unofficial guidelines, he said in a May interview.
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

There are two reasons for FEMA aid’s president-centric policy design, Gasper said: The federal government wants the ability to grant aid in “marginal cases that don’t make the threshold but still are clear disasters,” and politicians realize the benefits of giving aid to constituents.
“In an election year, it’s a great opportunity for a campaigning official to come in, do photo-ops, roll up their sleeves, etcetera,” he said. “In non-election years, they have less concern there, so the probability of denial goes up substantially.”
The denial of Arkansas’ initial request for help was “shocking,” said Anderson. Sanders, who worked as press secretary for Trump for part of his first term, credited her access to the president for her appeal’s eventual success.
Changes at FEMA have further muddied the process of requesting and obtaining disaster assistance. Since January, the Trump administration has dismissed hundreds of FEMA employees and scrapped an agency program funding disaster prevention efforts in states and municipalities. The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program had made $5 billion in grant money available since 2020, awarding over $12 million to Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee through 2023.
Federal officials have also discussed making it harder to secure funds after a disaster. In an internal memo obtained by CNN, former acting FEMA Administrator Cameron Hamilton proposed various reforms to curb the agency’s disaster spending, including quadrupling the financial burden states must sustain to qualify for public aid. Hamilton was fired weeks later, and state officials say they have received no word regarding changes to FEMA’s public assistance threshold.
While the higher benchmark proposed by Hamilton has not been adopted publicly, the low number of disaster declarations approved so far this year suggests the White House is following new standards for public aid eligibility, one emergency management expert explained.
“We don’t have to wait for an official guidance on this. We know that the bar has shifted,” said Bryan Koon, who led Florida’s Division of Emergency Management from 2011 to 2017 and is CEO of IEM, a disaster management consulting firm. “What got you a declaration in 2024 and earlier is not going to get you a disaster declaration in 2025.”
Hamilton’s replacement at FEMA, David Richardson, reportedly held a meeting with staff where he said a large part of the response and recovery would be put on states under his leadership, according to Drop Site News.
20 state AGs sue feds for tying transportation and disaster funding to immigration enforcement

Bipartisan support for disaster aid reform does exist, but Trump’s FEMA overhaul has sparked concern among state emergency management officials, who say they aren’t prepared to take over disaster funding responsibilities from the agency.
Such a transition would require extensive guidance from the administration and planning from state and local governments, said Lynn Budd, president of the National Emergency Management Association and director of Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security. Reducing FEMA assistance with little clarity or advance notice risks leaving communities unprepared for disasters moving forward, she added.
Even with clearer messaging from the administration, scaling back FEMA support would require states to make tough choices on how to cover disaster costs and budget for future emergencies, Koon explained. Reallocating funds toward disaster management would mean cuts to other services, and states would have to lean heavily on volunteer organizations to fill financial and staffing gaps.
“States are going to have to adapt,” Koon said. “It’s going to be a lot more of a patchwork of support to make up for what would have come from the federal government.”
Koon emphasized that shifting disaster expenses to states would also mean higher costs for residents. Households will have to purchase broader insurance coverage in the absence of FEMA assistance, he explained, and families will have to pay for damage previously covered by the agency.
In Mississippi, where residents are still recovering from the same storms and tornadoes that struck Arkansas in mid-March, emergency management officials said they will continue looking to FEMA for disaster assistance until they are instructed otherwise. The state is awaiting a decision from the White House on its own disaster declaration request, and officials said they won’t adjust operations or request additional funding from the legislature without more guidance from the administration.
“We have received no indication from FEMA about any proposed changes to formulas that determine federal disaster assistance,” said Scott Simmons, director of external affairs at the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. “Until the rules of the game change, we’re going to continue playing by the rules.”
Others are looking ahead at how states could respond if FEMA steps back.
States already play active roles in recovery but they “need to become a little bit more proficient and get help in coordinating and answering disasters together,” Colin Wellenkamp, executive director of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, a coalition of more than 100 mayors of river basin cities, said in early April following severe flooding along the river.
  Cave City’s welcome sign rests against a building. It was damaged along with much of the town after a twister ripped through Northeast Arkansas in March. (Photo by Lucas Dufalla, Arkansas Democrat-Gazette)
Flooding on the Mississippi River typically impacts all of its 10 bordering states, he said, so if states do take on more responsibility, they would need to work “in tandem” to coordinate recovery efforts.
“That isn’t necessarily something that happens through the FEMA process,” Wellenkamp said.
A new round of storms and tornadoes swept through the basin in mid-May, leaving major damage in St. Louis. And hurricane season begins June 1. Researchers are predicting above average activity this year.
With the Trump administration’s new approach to FEMA aid, Anderson worries that recovery for small places like Cave City may become even harder.
“There’s just things the Federal government has been or should be doing … they’re just a lot more equipped to handle that than a city or a state,”Anderson said. It’s an imperfect process and he added that “numbers on a spreadsheet don’t always tell the human story.”

More than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery. 
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”

She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial. 
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time. 
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy. 
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated. 
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity. 
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died. 
Mary Connolly never remarried. 
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said. 
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said.

Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process, and scientific evidence.
“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life. 
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one — an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown — history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved. 
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.” 
A final sendoff at last.

In the years following the bitter Civil War, a former Union general took a holiday originated by former Confederates and helped spread it across the entire country.
The holiday was Memorial Day, an annual commemoration was born in the former Confederate States in 1866 and adopted by the United States in 1868. It is a holiday in which the nation honors its military dead.
Gen. John A. Logan, who headed the largest Union veterans’ fraternity at that time, the Grand Army of the Republic, is usually credited as being the originator of the holiday.
Yet when General Logan established the holiday, he acknowledged its genesis among the Union’s former enemies, saying, “It was not too late for the Union men of the nation to follow the example of the people of the South.”
I’m a scholar who has written – with co-author Daniel Bellware – a history of Memorial Day. Cities and towns across America have for more than a century claimed to be the holiday’s birthplace, but we have sifted through the myths and half-truths and uncovered the authentic story of how this holiday came into being.
 Generous acts bore fruit

During 1866, the first year of this annual observance in the South, a feature of the holiday emerged that made awareness, admiration and eventually imitation of it spread quickly to the North.
During the inaugural Memorial Day observances which were conceived in Columbus, Georgia, many Southern participants – especially women – decorated graves of Confederate soldiers as well as, unexpectedly, those of their former enemies who fought for the Union.

Shortly after those first Memorial Day observances all across the South, newspaper coverage in the North was highly favorable to the ex-Confederates.
“The action of the ladies on this occasion, in burying whatever animosities or ill-feeling may have been engendered in the late war towards those who fought against them, is worthy of all praise and commendation,” wrote one paper.
On May 9, 1866, the Cleveland Daily Leader lauded the Southern women during their first Memorial Day.
“The act was as beautiful as it was unselfish, and will be appreciated in the North.”
The New York Commercial Advertiser, recognizing the magnanimous deeds of the women of Columbus, Georgia, echoed the sentiment. “Let this incident, touching and beautiful as it is, impart to our Washington authorities a lesson in conciliation.”
 Power of a poem

To be sure, this sentiment was not unanimous. There were many in both parts of the U.S. who had no interest in conciliation.
But as a result of one of these news reports, Francis Miles Finch, a Northern judge, academic and poet, wrote a poem titled “The Blue and the Gray.” Finch’s poem quickly became part of the American literary canon. He explained what inspired him to write it:
“It struck me that the South was holding out a friendly hand, and that it was our duty, not only as conquerors, but as men and their fellow citizens of the nation, to grasp it.”
Finch’s poem seemed to extend a full pardon to the South: “They banish our anger forever when they laurel the graves of our dead” was one of the lines.

  Not just poems: Sheet music written to commemorate Memorial Day in 1870. Library of Congress
Almost immediately, the poem circulated across America in books, magazines and newspapers. By the end of the 19th century, school children everywhere were required to memorize Finch’s poem. The ubiquitous publication of Finch’s rhyme meant that by the end of 1867, the southern Memorial Day holiday was a familiar phenomenon throughout the entire, and recently reunited, country.
General Logan was aware of the forgiving sentiments of people like Finch. When Logan’s order establishing Memorial Day was published in various newspapers in May 1868, Finch’s poem was sometimes appended to the order.
 ‘The blue and the grey’

It was not long before Northerners decided that they would not only adopt the Southern custom of Memorial Day, but also the Southern custom of “burying the hatchet.” A group of Union veterans explained their intentions in a letter to the Philadelphia Evening Telegraph on May 28, 1869:
“Wishing to bury forever the harsh feelings engendered by the war, Post 19 has decided not to pass by the graves of the Confederates sleeping in our lines, but divide each year between the blue and the grey the first floral offerings of a common country. We have no powerless foes. Post 19 thinks of the Southern dead only as brave men.”
Other reports of reciprocal magnanimity circulated in the North, including the gesture of a 10-year-old who made a wreath of flowers and sent it to the overseer of the holiday, Colonel Leaming, in Lafayette, Indiana, with the following note attached, published in The New Hampshire Patriot on July 15, 1868:
“Will you please put this wreath upon some rebel soldier’s grave? My dear papa is buried at Andersonville, (Georgia) and perhaps some little girl will be kind enough to put a few flowers upon his grave.”
President Abraham Lincoln’s wish that there be “malice toward none” and “charity for all” was visible in the magnanimous actions of participants on both sides, who extended an olive branch during the Memorial Day observances in those first three years.
Although not known by many today, the early evolution of the Memorial Day holiday was a manifestation of Lincoln’s hope for reconciliation between North and South.

Like many moderate-income workers, public school teachers Julia and Scott Whitnall didn’t think they’d become homeowners in their early 30s. Especially in California.
“We never felt homeownership was in our cards. But we did it!” Julia Whitnall said. “We’re extremely happy.”
The couple moved May 16 to a $509,000 two-bedroom house in Ripon, east of San Francisco in the Central Valley region.
It wasn’t easy. Despite a relatively high combined income of $140,000 from their nearby jobs, they had to compromise on size and take on extra work at summer camps to pull it off. Then they had to exercise patience as the sellers struggled to find a new home.
High interest rates and high prices in a still-competitive housing market continue to make it tough for first-time buyers, even those with good but moderate incomes.

On a national level, households making $75,000 to $100,000 — typical of teachers, nurses and skilled trades workers in many states — face a daunting lack of homes they can afford. That’s according to new research by the National Association of Realtors and Realtor.com based on listings in March of this year compared with 2024. However, the numbers showed an encouraging 20% increase in homes for sale, affordable or not.
Despite more houses for sale, those moderate-income buyers — which the report called “middle- and upper-middle-income buyers” — are much more hard-pressed to find an affordable home than they were in 2019, when almost half the homes on the market were affordable to them. This year they can afford only 21.2% of homes on the market — a slight improvement compared with 20.8% in 2024, according to the report.
It also found that a few states are improving in affordability for people in the $75,000-to-$100,000 income range. But many states are not.
The largest affordability gaps are in California, Hawaii, Idaho, Massachusetts and Montana, where such households can afford fewer than 12% of houses on the market. By contrast, they could afford about half the houses for sale in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio and West Virginia.
There’s progress in states that are adding more housing at moderate price points: Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Florida and Utah, according to the Realtors report.


 Balanced markets

Nationwide, to get home markets back in line with moderate-income families, the United States needs 416,000 more homes for sale at or below $255,000, according to the report.
“In many places, we’re still seeing a huge mismatch between income levels and what’s available to buy for moderate-income families,” said Nadia Evangelou, the National Association of Realtors’ senior economist and director of real estate research.
“We are no longer in crisis mode, but we are still very far from where we need to be. We can’t fix it overnight. It will take years,” Evangelou said.

Heather, who asked not to share her last name for privacy reasons, said she can’t even think of buying a house near her job on Long Island, New York. She makes more than $100,000 as a registered nurse and her family makes $170,000 with her husband’s job in building maintenance. But $4,400 in rent and $2,000 in monthly day care costs for three children have them living paycheck to paycheck.
“We can’t even afford a small car repair, let alone a mortgage in our hometown” of Ronkonkoma in Suffolk County, Heather said. Their jobs exposed her and her husband to risks in the pandemic that her neighbors avoided with remote work, she said. But she now feels like she’s in worse shape financially than she was in 2019 and considers moving away.
“All of our hard work feels like it was for nothing,” Heather said. “It’s disheartening that we can’t afford to live where we grew up, but that’s the reality we are facing.”
Some states can still be a refuge of affordability.
Ashley and Tristan Jonas bought a $252,000 house in northwest Ohio after three years of getting shut out by higher or all-cash offers. Ashley Jonas, 32, trained as a teacher but now works in skilled trades as a project coordinator for a countertop company, and the couple makes about $140,000 with Tristan Jonas’ job as a computer programmer.
“We happened to hit the market at the right time in 2025,” Ashley Jonas said. “We bid on this house just as [President Donald] Trump was announcing tariffs. I think a lot of people were holding their coin purses. We weren’t.”
 Help for teachers

Teachers, who generally make less than nurses or trades workers, are particularly squeezed. Some states, facing teacher shortages in local schools, are working to raise pay. And increasingly, some schools and hospitals are providing housing to lure more teachers and nurses.
“We lose so many teachers because they can’t find housing here,” said Autumn Rivera, a 20-year teaching veteran and 2022 Colorado Teacher of the Year. Despite her experience and credentials, Rivera said she can’t contemplate buying even a townhouse in the rural resort town of Glenwood Springs, where she teaches.

Prices for those townhouses now start in the $700,000 range, more than twice what they were when she last considered buying in 2019. Rivera feels lucky to have a reasonable rent by sharing a home with its owner, but many teachers in her Roaring Fork Schools need the 117 apartments provided by the district with affordable rent, she said. The district hopes the apartments will allow teachers to save up for a home; it has also built 14 houses for staff with Habitat for Humanity and Holy Cross Energy.
One way to make homebuying more feasible for teachers is to pay them more — a strategy that paid off for New Mexico, one of the few bright spots in a different report on teachers’ inability to afford housing, which was published this month by the National Council on Teacher Quality, a research and advocacy group.
Beginning teachers in Albuquerque saw a 60% increase in pay between 2019 and 2025, which fell just short of a 65% jump in home prices, according to the report. The report credited a state law that raised teacher salaries, including starting pay, by $10,000.
“We’re dealing with the issue of teachers being able to live in the communities where they’re actually working,” said state Rep. Joy Garratt, a Democrat who sponsored a new law, signed in April, that sets higher minimum salaries for teachers effective July 1.
Detroit schools also gave teachers with advanced degrees a pay boost of up to 50% since 2019, about the same increase as home prices, according to the report from the National Council on Teacher Quality. Albuquerque and Detroit are on the report’s list of most affordable places for beginning teachers to live.
But nationally, on average, experienced teachers who started in 2019 are less able to afford a home now than when they began, according to the report.
“Teacher pay has gone up 24% in the last five years, which some might say is solid growth, and yet the increase in house for purchase has gone up 47%,” said Heather Peske, the organization’s president.
“Housing prices are critical to being able to attract and keep great teachers,” Peske said. “People will be leaving the profession trying to find something that pays enough for housing. And bottom line, kids won’t get as good an education.”

Puskar/The Associated Press)In submitting her updated budget proposal in March, Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs lamented the rising costs of the state’s school vouchers program that directs public dollars to pay private school tuition.
Characterizing vouchers as an “entitlement program,” Hobbs said the state could spend more than $1 billion subsidizing private education in the upcoming fiscal year. The Democratic governor said those expenses could crowd out other budget priorities, including disability programs and pay raises for firefighters and state troopers.
It’s a dilemma that some budget experts fear will become more common nationwide as the costs of school choice measures mount across the states, reaching billions of dollars each year.
“School vouchers are increasingly eating up state budgets in a way that I don’t think is sustainable long term,” said Whitney Tucker, director of state fiscal policy research at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a think tank that advocates for left-leaning tax policies.
House and Senate pass bills to remove income limits on EFA program

Vouchers and scholarship programs, which use taxpayer money to cover private school tuition, are part of the wider school choice movement that also includes charter schools and other alternatives to public schools.
Opponents have long warned about vouchers draining resources from public education as students move from public schools to private ones. But research into several programs has shown many voucher recipients already were enrolled in private schools. That means universal vouchers could drive up costs by creating two parallel education systems — both funded by taxpayers.
In Arizona, state officials reported most private school students receiving vouchers in the first two years of the expanded program were not previously enrolled in public schools. In fiscal year 2024, more than half the state’s 75,000 voucher recipients were previously enrolled in private schools or were being homeschooled.
“Vouchers don’t shift costs — they add costs,” Joshua Cowen, a professor of education policy at Michigan State University who studies the issue, recently told Stateline. “Most voucher recipients were already in private schools, meaning states are paying for education they previously didn’t have to fund.”
Voucher proponents, though, say those figures can be misleading. Arizona, like other states with recent expansions, previously had more modest voucher programs. So some kids who were already enrolled in private schools could have already been receiving state subsidies.
In addition to increasing competition, supporters say the programs can actually save taxpayer dollars by delivering education at a lower overall cost than traditional public schools.
One thing is certain: With a record number of students receiving subsidies to attend private schools, vouchers are quickly creating budget concerns for some state leaders.
The rising costs of school choice measures come after years of deep cuts to income taxes in many states, leaving them with less money to spend. An end of pandemic-era aid and potential looming cuts to federal support also have created widespread uncertainty about state budgets.
“We’re seeing a number of things that are creating a sort of perfect storm from a fiscal perspective in the states,” said Tucker, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Last year, Arizona leaders waded through an estimated $1.3 billion budget shortfall. Budget experts said the voucher program was responsible for hundreds of millions of that deficit.
A new universal voucher program in Texas is expected to cost $1 billion over its next two-year budget cycle — a figure that could balloon to nearly $5 billion by 2030, according to a legislative fiscal note.
Earlier this year, Wyoming Republican Gov. Mark Gordon signed a bill expanding the state’s voucher program. But last week, he acknowledged his own “substantial concerns” about the state’s ability to fund vouchers and its public education obligations under the constitution.
“I think the legislature’s got a very tall task to understand how they’re going to be able to fund all of these things,” he said in an interview with WyoFile.
Voucher proponents, who have been active at the state level for years, are gaining new momentum with support from President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans.
In January, Trump ordered federal agencies to allow states, tribes, and military families to access federal money for private K-12 education through education savings accounts, voucher programs or tax credits.
Earlier this month, Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee voted in favor of making $20 billion available over the next four years for a federal school voucher program as part of broader work on a bill to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts.
Martin Lueken, the director of the Fiscal Research and Education Center at EdChoice, a nonprofit that advocates for school choice measures, argues school choice measures can actually deliver savings to taxpayers.
Lueken said vouchers are not to blame for state budget woes. He said public school systems for years have increased spending faster than inflation. And he noted that school choice measures make up a small share of overall state spending — nationally about 0.3% of total state expenditures in states with school choice, he said.
“Public schooling remains one of the largest line items in state budgets,” he said in an interview. “They are still the dominant provider of K-12 education, and certainly looking at the education pie, they still receive the lion’s share.
“It’s not a choice problem. I would say that it’s a problem with the status quo and the public school system,” he said.
Washington, D.C., and 35 states offer some school choice programs, according to EdChoice. That includes 18 states with voucher programs so expansive that virtually all students can participate regardless of income.
But Lueken said framing vouchers as a new entitlement program is misleading. That’s because all students, even the wealthiest, have always been entitled to a public education — whether they’ve chosen to attend free public schools or private ones that charge tuition.
“At the end of the day, the thing that matters most above dollars are students and families,” he said. “Research is clear that competition works. Public schools have responded in very positive ways when they are faced with increased competitive pressure from choice programs.”
Public school advocates say funding both private and public schools is untenable.
In Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers are considering a major voucher expansion that would alter the funding structure for vouchers, potentially putting more strain on the state’s general fund.
The state spent about $629 million on its four voucher programs during the 2024-2025 school year, according to the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, which represents employees in school district finance, human resources and leadership.
The association warns proposed legislation could exacerbate problems with the “unaffordable parallel school systems” in place now by shifting more private schooling costs from parents of those students to state taxpayers at large.
Such expansion “could create the conditions for even greater funding challenges for Wisconsin’s traditional public schools and the state budget as a whole,” the association’s research director wrote in a paper on the issue.
In Arizona, Hobbs originally sought to eliminate the universal voucher program — a nonstarter in the Republican-controlled legislature. She has since proposed shrinking the program by placing income limits that would disqualify the state’s wealthiest families.
That idea also faced Republican opposition.
Legislators are now pushing to enshrine access to vouchers in the state constitution.
Marisol Garcia, president of the Arizona Education Association, the state’s 20,000-member teachers union, noted that vouchers and public education funds are both sourced from the general fund.
“So it almost immediately started to impact public services,” she said of the universal voucher program.
While the union says vouchers have led to cutbacks of important resources such as counselors in public schools, Garcia said the sweeping program also affects the state’s ability to fund other services like housing, transportation and health care.
“Every budget cycle becomes where can we cut in order to essentially feed this out-of-control program?” she said.

Credit: Tracey AttleeMore than 80 years after he died in the attack on Pearl Harbor, John Connolly was finally laid to rest – not as an unknown in a mass grave, but as a naval officer in Arlington National Cemetery.
When the Navy first called to tell his daughter, Virginia Harbison, that her father’s remains had been identified, she hung up. At 91, living in assisted care in Texas, she could hardly believe it. It was her son, Bill Ingram, who called her back to share the news again. She was silent for so long that he had to ask if she was all right. “Bill,” she said, “I hadn’t thought about that for 60 years.”
She has lived the full life her father never had the chance to. In March, Ingram pushed his mother in her wheelchair to her father’s gravesite for the burial.
“They fold the flag in this very tight, nice triangle, and then with white gloves, the commanding officer comes and takes it and kneels down and hands it to my mother,” said Ingram, who lives in San Francisco. “It was incredible.”
On Dec. 7, 1941 during the attack on Pearl Harbor, 429 service members aboard the USS Oklahoma died. Horrifyingly, men trapped below deck after the ship capsized could be heard tapping out “SOS” in Morse code as the air supply dwindled. Though 32 men were rescued, the rest were tragically not reached in time.
After the war ended, the remains were recovered and buried in the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii, too water damaged and commingled to be identified individually. There they remained for years until modern science caught up with historical tragedy.
The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency disinterred the USS Oklahoma remains in 2015 to send to a DNA laboratory. Carrie LeGarde, a forensic archaeologist with the agency and project lead for the Oklahoma Project, said her team started the process by testing small pieces of bone for maternal line DNA. Overall, they inventoried 13,000 bones and took 4,900 DNA samples. For Connolly, identification was complicated.
“We had several sequences that had multiple individuals, and that was actually the case with John Connolly, and part of why his identification occurred later in the project,” she said.

Since John Connolly was older than most of the men aboard the USS Oklahoma as one of the few officers on the ship and scheduled to retire just three weeks after the bombing, the team at DPAA relied on dental evidence in addition to DNA testing to confirm his identity.
Connolly was born in Savannah in 1893 and joined the Navy in 1912. He served during World War I and was eventually promoted to a chief warrant officer. In 1941, his wife, Mary Connolly, and their two daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and six-year-old Helen were eagerly awaiting his return and retirement in Long Beach, California, when the Navy informed them he had died.
Mary Connolly never remarried.
“She was very sad all her life because she married at age 30 or 31 and her husband was away in the service, but was killed right before he was supposed to retire,” Ingram said.
Connolly’s memory has been passed down through the generations.
“We’ve taken my family to Hawaii, and we went to the memorial and found the marker for his name,” Ingram said.
Everything changed last year when Ingram got a call from the Navy. In a 200-page report, the Navy detailed the historical background, identification process and scientific evidence.

“With the research that was involved, both with historical research and medical research, there’s a lot of folks at DPAA that are involved,” Navy POW/MIA branch head Richard Jenkins said. “We as a service will explain that to the family, with the hopes of them feeling comfortable with the findings and showing them that it’s not just any set of remains, it’s actually going to be that person.”
There’s a story that runs in Ingram’s family about his grandfather. A couple of years after World War II, a young man knocked on the family home and introduced himself to Virginia and Mary Connolly. He had been on the USS Oklahoma with John Connolly, he said, and when the ship was hit, Connolly pushed open a hatch and forced him out. Connolly had saved his life.
In 1944, the Navy re-commissioned one of their ships as the USS John Connolly. Though his story was a tragic one – an officer who never returned home whose remains were left unknown – history has granted him a second chance at closure. Over eight decades later, he got the hero’s burial he deserved.
“They did everything. They had a band. They played Taps. They fired the guns,” Ingram said. “Seven soldiers fired three times for a 21-gun salute.”
A final sendoff at last.

(JackF/iStock via Getty Images Plus)Republican lawmakers have been battling over a bill that includes massive tax and spending cuts. Much of their disagreement has been over provisions intended to reduce the cost of Medicaid.
The popular health insurance program, which is funded by both the federal and state governments, covers about 78.5 million low-income and disabled people — more than 1 in 5 Americans.
On May 22, 2025, the House of Representatives narrowly approved the tax, spending and immigration bill. The legislation, which passed without any support from Democrats, is designed to reduce federal Medicaid spending by requiring anyone enrolled in the program who appears to be able to get a job to either satisfy work requirements or lose their coverage. It’s still unclear, however, whether Senate Republicans would support that provision.
Although there are few precedents for such a mandate for Medicaid, other safety net programs have been enforcing similar rules for nearly three decades. I’m a political scientist who has extensively studied the work requirements of another safety net program: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.
As I explain in my book, “Living Off the Government? Race, Gender, and the Politics of Welfare,” work requirements place extra burdens on low-income families but do little to lift them out of poverty.
 
Work requirements for TANF
TANF gives families with very low incomes some cash they can spend on housing, food, clothing or whatever they need most. The Clinton administration launched it as a replacement for a similar program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, in 1996. At the time, both political parties were eager to end a welfare system they believed was riddled with abuse. A big goal with TANF was ending the dependence of people getting cash benefits on the government by moving them from welfare to work.
Many people were removed from the welfare rolls, but not because work requirements led to economic prosperity. Instead, they had trouble navigating the bureaucratic demands.
TANF is administered by the states. They can set many rules of their own, but they must comply with an important federal requirement: Adult recipients have to work or engage in an authorized alternative activity for at least 30 hours per week. The number of weekly hours is only 20 if the recipient is caring for a child under the age of 6.
The dozen activities or so that can count toward this quota range from participating in job training programs to engaging in community service.
Some adults enrolled in TANF are exempt from work requirements, depending on their state’s own policies. The most common exemptions are for people who are ill, have a disability or are over age 60.
To qualify for TANF, families must have dependent children; in some states pregnant women also qualify. Income limits are set by the state and range from US$307 a month for a family of three in Alabama to $2,935 a month for a family of three in Minnesota.
Adult TANF recipients face a federal five-year lifetime limit on benefits. States can adopt shorter time limits; Arizona’s is 12 months.
 
An administrative burden
Complying with these work requirements generally means proving that you’re working or making the case that you should be exempt from this mandate. This places what’s known as an “administrative burden” on the people who get cash assistance. It often requires lots of documentation and time. If you have an unpredictable work schedule, inconsistent access to child care or obligations to care for an older relative, this paperwork is hard to deal with.
What counts as work, how many hours must be completed and who is exempt from these requirements often comes down to a caseworker’s discretion. Social science research shows that this discretion is not equally applied and is often informed by stereotypes.
The number of people getting cash assistance has fallen sharply since TANF replaced Aid to Families with Dependent Children. In some states caseloads have dropped by more than 50% despite significant population growth.
Some of this decline happened because recipients got jobs that paid them too much to qualify. The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan office that provides economic research to Congress, attributes, at least in part, an increase in employment among less-educated single mothers in the 1990s to work requirements.
Not everyone who stopped getting cash benefits through TANF wound up employed, however. Other recipients who did not meet requirements fell into deep poverty.
Regardless of why people leave the program, when fewer low-income Americans get TANF benefits, the government spends less money on cash assistance. Federal funding has remained flat at $16.5 billion since 1996. Taking inflation into account, the program receives half as much funding as when it was created. In addition, states have used the flexibility granted them to direct most of their TANF funds to priorities other than cash benefits, such as pre-K education.
Many Americans who get help paying for groceries through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program are also subject to work requirements. People the government calls “able-bodied adults without dependents” can only receive SNAP benefits for three months within a three-year period if they are not employed.
 
A failed experiment in Arkansas
Lawmakers in Congress and in statehouses have debated whether to add work requirements for Medicaid before. More than a dozen states have applied for waivers that would let them give it a try.
When Arkansas instituted Medicaid work requirements in 2018, during the first Trump administration, it was largely seen as a failure. Some 18,000 people lost their health care coverage, but employment rates did not increase.
After a court order stopped the policy in 2019, most people regained their coverage.
Georgia is currently the only state with Medicaid work requirements in effect, after implementing a waiver in July 2023. The program has experienced technical difficulties and has had trouble verifying work activities.
Other states, including Idaho, Indiana and Kentucky, are already asking the federal government to let them enforce Medicaid work requirements.

The phenomenon is sometimes known as the “Proust Effect,” for a scene from Marcel Proust’s novel “Remembrance of Things Past,” when a character’s childhood memories come flooding back, triggered by the scent of a sweet cake called a madeleine.
For me it’s lilacs. Every Memorial Day of my childhood my mother would cut lilacs from the big bush near the back porch of our home in Grand Island. She would bunch them into bouquets and then send my sister and me in search of vases and mason jars to fill with water. 
On the trip to the cemetery in the back seat, my sister and I would hold tight to the lilacs and whatever else mom culled from our yard or that of a generous neighbor. Mom would manage my father’s driving to keep the sloshing to a minimum.
  Rich Gillham is shown a couple years before he died. (Submitted photo)
The car was thick with the unmistakable fragrance of lilacs, an aroma now permanently linked in my memory to Memorial Day. And, sadly, more.
The lilac bush was large enough that anyone passing by on the sidewalk enjoyed the scent.
Rich Gillham knew the smell.
He was two grades ahead of me in school and six blocks to the north of me on Kimball Street, but a childhood friend nonetheless, the way neighborhood friends know each other.
He would pedal by on his bicycle and then, as a teen he would zoom past on his motorcycle — sometimes stopping because he had me on the back hitching a ride home from football practice.
There was an uncluttered ease to Rich, a confidence that this 15-year-old, saddled with a high school sophomore’s lack of self-assurance and no driver’s license, admired.
My parents didn’t want me riding on a motorcycle, but they knew Rich and his parents, Gerald and Ursula, the way neighborhood parents know each other.
Rich never came by as an adult.
He was killed in a place called Dinh Tuong Province, thousands of miles from Kimball Street and the smell of lilacs. He was 20.
I’m not sure I’ll remember Rich more this Memorial Day than I do any other day. With war now a modern constant and young men and women from their own streets and neighborhoods in places we call harm’s way, he is more on my mind.
I paid my respects to Rich and others when the traveling wall made it to our hometown, where I was overcome with many emotions, not the least of which was the rushing back of a shared and gentle childhood.
War being what it is, we’re never far from paying respects and decorating graves and realizing the true and somber meaning of Memorial Day.
Vietnam was my generation’s war. Rich was my neighbor and friend who died there, whose life and death touched many, especially those of us from Kimball Street.
We played as kids. Our families shared dinners. Our parents laughed over beers.
In high school, Rich played football his senior year, never getting in a game, but sticking it out nonetheless. And he was always willing to throw me on the back of his little two-wheeler and take me home.
My best last memory of Rich was of him astride his new, powerful Triumph motorcycle, so loud a conversation next to it was impossible.
A group of us were parked at Nifty’s Drive-In on South Locust Street when we heard him coming on the Triumph, a growling, snarling monster in faded copper.
We were taken with the clamor and power … and Rich, nonchalant and indifferent to the stares from the curious, the impressed and the disgusted.
He turned it off for a few minutes for a little back and forth chatter, then stomped the Triumph a few times to bring it back to life. He sped off in a cloud of youth and noise.
We made a point to see how far he would get before we could no longer hear him. It was long after he drove out of sight, much to our delight and admiration.
Delight and admiration. That’s how I remember my neighbor, the first casualty of war from my childhood.
Come to think of it, delight and admiration could fit millions of memories on Memorial Day.
And maybe throw in the scent of lilacs, too.

When people picture families in need of support, they often think of new parents juggling diapers and daycare. And yes, those were challenging years. But the truth is, the financial stress doesn’t end when your child starts school. It changes and, in many ways, it gets even harder.
I’m the mother of two middle school boys. They’re funny, thoughtful, energetic, and I’m incredibly proud of the young men they’re becoming. But as they’ve grown, so have the costs of raising them. Like many parents across Connecticut, my family works hard and budgets carefully, but we are living in a time of economic strain. Every trip to the grocery store costs more than the last, and electricity rates are sky high.  
In this time of rising expenses, Connecticut—already one of the most expensive states in the country to live—remains the only state that taxes personal income without adjusting for family size. This includes all of our neighboring states. That means a single adult with no dependents pays the same rate as my family with two kids. It’s an outdated system that doesn’t reflect the cost of raising a family. 
That’s why I strongly support creating a fully refundable Connecticut Child Tax Credit. I’ll be honest — it won’t solve everything, but it will make a meaningful difference. 
This is a common-sense policy that would benefit more than 550,000 kids of all ages across our state until they reach the age of 17. It’s a practical, proven, and bipartisan solution. It’s time to make it real. 
Families across Connecticut are being asked to do more with less, and we simply can’t afford to wait any longer.

One such victim was our beloved son, Alec Pelletier, who died from fentanyl poisoning in 2018 while living in a sober home in Canaan.
Alec struggled with bipolar disorder and SUD for seven years. He was a sensitive, intelligent, funny young man, and a loving brother to his three siblings. In the end, Alec was fully engaged in recovery and looked forward to a spiritually fulfilling life of sobriety, empowered by the love of his family and friends. 

Dita Bhargava
The real tragedy of our family’s loss is how many others have been affected by the addiction crisis. More than 7,000 people in CT have suffered fatal overdoses since Alec’s passing. Connecticut residents are more likely to die from unintentional drug overdoses than from motor vehicle crashes. Many of these lives, including Alec’s, could have been saved if they had access to a safe place where an overdose could be reversed.
Victims of a broken system
Like many innocent people, Alec, a AAA hockey player, fell victim to easily accessible and highly addictive painkillers in his early teens. 
Big pharmaceutical companies misrepresented the addictive nature of these opioids. At the same time, FDA and government leaders failed to act promptly as the addiction crisis spread rapidly through communities. Then, foreign countries compounded the addiction crisis by flooding our nation with poisonous fentanyl, which ultimately took Alec’s life and is responsible for over 80% of overdoses in Connecticut. 
Congress was too slow to act. Our children deserved protection from the deceptive greed of big pharma and drug cartels.
Better standards of care in treatment facilities and sober homes is critical.  A few weeks before Alec overdosed, he was discharged from a treatment center in Kent, without being put on the only known evidenced-based protocol – Medically Assisted Treatment, and was referred to a home meant for people who had been sober for a year, even though Alec was only sober for three months.
 Overdose prevention centers will keep people alive
S.B. 7, also known as An Act Concerning Protections For Access To Health Care And The Equitable Delivery Of Health Care Services In The State, would allow for establishing safe, non-judgmental centers in Connecticut that provide a space where individuals struggling with SUD can have an overdose reversed and their lives saved. 
While opponents argue that OPCs enable drug use and pollute communities with crime and homelessness, decades of robust research demonstrate an association with reduced morbidity, mortality, and transmission of infectious diseases, improved individual health outcomes and services engagement, and cost-effectiveness. The FDA’s decision to make Naloxone available over the counter reflects a growing recognition of the efficacy of harm-reduction strategies. 
The widespread availability of Naloxone has played a pivotal role in decreasing overdose rates – OPCs are essentially an extension of Narcan distribution. OPCs also promote cleaner environments by keeping drug paraphernalia like syringes off the streets and keeping people from using them in the open public.
The Opposite of Addiction Is Connection
In six simple words, journalist Johann Hari summarized the profound importance of community and connection for those suffering from SUD. Co-existing disorders, such as mental health illnesses, often accompany addiction. Loneliness can lead to depression, anxiety, and other health problems.
Last summer, I was privileged to visit several overdose prevention centers in Canada, where they have operated for over two decades. The centers exude compassion, understanding, and love. Clients feel welcomed, valued, and connected.
According to reports, between 2017 and June 2023, over 49,000 overdoses and drug-related emergencies were attended to at these Canadian sites, with no recorded fatalities. Beyond emergency care, OPCs offer comprehensive resources, including addiction treatment, harm reduction services, health education, and necessities like food, water, and toiletries. Successful models also operate in neighboring states, New York and Rhode Island, where thousands of lives have been saved. Vermont and Minnesota are advancing similar initiatives.
The night Alec passed, on July 13, 2018, was especially devastating because Alec had been doing so well, giving us hope for his future. It was his 26th birthday, and we had discussed celebrating together just days earlier. However, addiction is a chronic disease with high relapse rates, and on that night, Alec succumbed to his cravings. His tolerance to opiates had diminished due to months of sobriety, making him especially vulnerable. 
Alec was aware of the dangers of fentanyl lacing and carefully placed a package of Narcan by his bedside in case of an overdose, but ashamed of relapse he decided to use alone. Young men right outside his sober homeroom were unaware Alec was in trouble. What good is Narcan if no one administers it? If Alec had connected to a safe, unbiased place in his moment of despair, where a healthcare provider could have given Naloxone, he would be here today.
The call for bold leadership
At a recent Hearing, State Sen. Heather Somers urged that the overdose epidemic not be labeled a public health crisis so that residents don’t bombard the Connecticut Department of Public Health for better solutions. 
Over the last two decades, over a million Americans, including thousands in Connecticut have vanished like Alec – children, siblings, friends, colleagues, and parents, because our society has failed to protect them. Overdose rates have increased in Connecticut by over 250% from 2014 to 2024. This is a public health crisis of epic scale, and we cannot shy away from that fact. 
Somers is also unduly concerned that OPCs are not a bridge to recovery. A study on an OPC in Vancouver showed a 30% increase in detoxification services uptake within a year. In another study, 42% of OPC participants not in treatment at baseline enrolled within 24 months
Gov. Ned Lamont once asked me what more we can do to address the overdose crisis in our state. Governor, act boldly and responsibly to help the vulnerable find life, recovery and hope. Please pass S.B. 7.

George Floyd’s death is a time that many remember as a “racial reckoning” that heightened the world’s attention on police brutality and its deadly impact on Black people.
Activists, leaders and community members believed five years ago that the country would point to this moment as the one that brought lasting change toward racial equity. Now, the majority of Americans say that moment has passed with its promise unfulfilled.
In a study published on May 7, the Pew Research Center found that in 2020, 52 percent of U.S. adults believed that an increased focus on racial issues across the country would lead to significant change in the years to come. In 2025, 72 percent of U.S. adults said that the focus on racial inequality did not lead to any changes that helped the Black community.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of the 19th News Network.

Furthermore, in 2025, 67% of Black Americans said they felt doubtful the United States would ever achieve racial equality; 65% felt similarly in 2020.
The 19th spoke with Black activists about the country’s progress toward equality since Floyd’s death and how they envision a more inclusive future.
‘You have to do things to actually show how you feel’
Alaunna Thompson was attending a predominantly White high school in Montville, N.J., when Floyd died. His murder was a call for her to organize a protest in her local community, she said, describing her ongoing struggles with racism in school as the driver that pushed her to use her voice.

Protestors gathered at Mackay Park in Englewood, N.J., to demand justice after Floyd’s death. Following a route that led them around the city, participants stopped to deliver passionate speeches and craft signs that they would carry while organizing. Parents, teachers, students and Englewood residents all came out to support.
“It was a mix of us feeling some way about our school and on top of that, hearing all this stuff [about] Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd. It was back to back to back.”
Arbery was a 25-year-old Black man who was shot and killed while on an afternoon jog in the Satilla Shores neighborhood of Georgia. Arbery’s death happened in February 2020, just months before Floyd’s.
Thompson remembers feeling sadness, anger and disbelief. With the stunting pain also came the realization that this time, something felt different.
“I saw people talking about [Floyd’s] drug charges and the things he did, and I was just, like, ‘Wow, this is really sad,’ and I felt angry about it. Honestly, I thought nothing would happen,” she said. When Derek Chauvin got arrested and convicted in federal court of killing Floyd, “that was a shock to me,” Thompson said. “That’s never really happened before.”
In Thompson’s eyes, while Floyd’s murder did not put an end to racially motivated violence, it did shift our social understanding of how we discuss police brutality. Up until the day of Floyd’s death in 2020, she had never witnessed so much language that reflected how brutal police violence is.
“People are more comfortable holding these police officers accountable now. I think versus the Trayvon Martin period, people were [thinking] these are not people who are going to get prosecuted because they are above the law,” she said. “They’re also more comfortable saying that this person killed this person instead of it being police brutality. This is murder.”
At just 17 years old, Martin was shot and killed while walking in Sanford, Florida. His killer, George Zimmerman, was the captain of Sanford’s neighborhood watch and reported to police that he saw a “suspicious person” prior to shooting Martin. Zimmerman was later found not guilty in the trial.
Although Thompson does not feel there has been effective systemic change in the five years since Floyd’s life was taken, she does recognize the impact that he has had. Her place in history is what will continue to compel her to use her voice, she said.
“It’s about history. It’s not about two little kids from Englewood who may not make that much of a difference when it comes to the law, but it makes a difference when it comes to which side of history you were on.”

‘The possibility that lies ahead’
Throughout her life, Angela Ferrell-Zabala has looked to the strength of her mother and grandmother to inspire her activism. At a young age, her family instilled in her the belief that she has a voice and the power to advocate against injustice in the world. As she grew older, she followed their lead in the work she’s done for her community.
As a mother of four living in Washington, D.C., she wanted to do something about gun violence in the city. So she joined Moms Demand Action, a gun violence prevention advocacy group. Three years ago, she became its first executive director.
Ferrell-Zabala felt that Floyd’s murder was a continuation of violence against Black and Brown people that had become normalized. While she helped the people in her community, she had to remember to give herself grace to deal with the emotional turmoil she was also experiencing.
“In the moment, you just want to make sure everyone’s OK,” she said. “You want to wrap your arms around them, but then there’s this point about ‘What do I need?’”
Five years later, Ferrell-Zabala said that it’s a hard moment for the country — and a hard moment for Black folks in particular. Decades of pain and trauma are continuing to impact the Black community, and many in the community feel like no one cares about the struggles they are facing.
For instance, Ferrell-Zabala said that Black people are disproportionately impacted when it comes to gun violence, and communities say that solutions aren’t meeting their needs fast enough. With corporations and the federal government rolling back inclusive programs that civil rights leaders fought hard for, many people have lost hope.
“Right now, it feels particularly difficult because there’s this sense of, ‘No one cares, no one gives a damn,’” she said. “But I think what makes it harder [is that] now, it’s beyond not caring. It [feels] like intentional cruelty.”
Ferrell-Zabala told The 19th that the country has a long way to go when it comes to creating true equality, equity and justice. She looks to her grandmother’s resilience as a reminder to keep working toward a better future. To move forward, she said that the Black community has to think about where they are and balance it with their radical visions of what could be.
“That’s one of the things I hold onto,” she said. “I hope many people hold onto who we are, where we come from and the possibility that lies ahead.”
  Destine Riggins says she was the only photographer at the various West Jefferson, North Carolina, racial justice protests she attended and documented, such as this 2020 march. (Vicki Randolph)
‘We’re the only thing protecting each other’
Destine Riggins saved on her phone an album of pictures labeled Black Lives Matter March. She took these photos five years ago in West Jefferson, a town in the rural Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. She was the sole photographer there.
Riggins used to look at the photos and see impact, unity and change. Now, when she looks at them, Riggins said she feels like “the whole world is against us again.”
“I feel like we’re in a worse scenario right now than we were five years ago. With the current administration we have, police brutality is easy for them to slip under the rug or even for a policeman to get off, especially with [President Donald] Trump wanting to pardon officers,” Riggins said.
Floyd’s murder immediately made Riggins think of Trayvon Martin and Sandra Bland, a Black woman roughly handled and arrested by the police in Texas and then found dead in her cell a few days later by what the local police consider suicide. There was also Sonya Massey, who was shot and killed in her home by the police last summer.
Since the march, Riggins has watched the national conversation around race and policing shift, making her feel tired, heavy and more unsure than ever.
“Each time we see these murders by the police it feels like another hit to the Black community. Another disappointment. Another reason to not like the cops. And another reason for a White man to be able to kill a Black man,” Riggins said.
Millions of people across the country have been protesting against the Trump administration through efforts like the Hands Off and 50501 movements. Many Black communities have decided on other forms of resistance and several people, like Riggins, are choosing to turn inward, by resting and leaning on their community for support.
“There is no protection for Black people except us, we’re the only thing protecting each other and right now that feels kind of disintegrating. My biggest opinion is to lay low right now,” Riggins said. “I don’t want to bring any extra attention to myself because I don’t have time to try to fight a justice system that was never meant for me in the first place.”

‘Police brutality shouldn’t just be personal to Black people’
While Riggins took pictures, Queue Wellington helped lead the march in West Jefferson, where more than 300 people protested in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Growing up Black in a rural, White, conservative and poor region, Wellington constantly saw how white supremacy and police brutality negatively impacted everyone.
“White people love to cling to power, but that power is white supremacy. As this country continues to lean overtly more into fascism and acceptance of police brutality, then that means Black people will keep dying, White people will keep dying and everyone will keep dying — largely by the hands of the police or people in power,” Wellington said.
After the summer of 2020, Wellington saw an increase in White people in their town attempting to unlearn anti-Black behavior, understand systemic issues and work in community with Black movements. Since then, they said those same people have faded away and that their actions were likely performative.
“There was a wave of White people trying to become more conscious or get more informed on things, but where are they now?” Wellington said. “Black people have always had to juggle it all at the same time: work, bills, lives and oppression.”
While Wellington feels that things aren’t better for Black Americans since the summer of racial reckoning, they do believe that at least more White people are grasping the reality of police brutality.
“If we can’t get a thousand White people to understand, maybe having one White person on board or seeing the reality of police brutality will change things or even create safer environments for Black folks,” Wellington said.
Wellington thinks this understanding could even be found in places like the Appalachian Mountains, where Stuart Mast, a White man, died while in deputies’ custody in a similar way to Floyd.
Several community members are outraged by Mast’s death, and people who once “backed the blue” are now questioning the system that police brutality has created.
“The fact that White people in my community are outraged over police violence feels oddly familiar. We should all be asking why folks are getting killed by the police. This murder has started to cause a divide between the police and White people here,” Wellington said. “Police brutality shouldn’t just be personal to Black people, but to everyone because it affects everyone.”

‘Our joy has to be non-negotiable’
In 2020, Monica Simpson and her community felt caught in the middle of challenging moments: Trump was finishing his first term and the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak.
As the executive director of SisterSong, a reproductive rights group based in Atlanta, Simpson joined other members to create mutual aid opportunities for those in need and help pregnant women get access to birth workers.
Then Floyd was murdered. When the news broke, Simpson was immediately reminded of the other Black men and boys who were murdered by White men, such as Trayvon Martin and Tamir Rice — and the list keeps going, she said. But it felt like the world had to keep moving forward. Simpson had to continue doing the work for her community.
“We were having to still hold our community in all the ways that we need to for the work that we do every single day,” she said. “We had to be on the frontlines at the same time.”
At that time, the country saw what the media called a racial reckoning and Simpson felt that it took away from the grief the Black community was feeling after Floyd’s murder.
In 2025, with Trump back in power and making more changes to disenfranchise marginalized communities, Simpson feels that Black communities did as much as they could to restore what Trump’s 2016 administration destroyed. Black-led advocacy organizations came together, despite their contradictory beliefs, to put forth the work necessary to help their communities and each other.
Overall, Simpson said the Black community knew a second Trump presidency “would be detrimental.” Ninety-two percent of Black women voted for Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election and mobilized their communities. During his first five months in office, Trump has made strides to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion programs and positions in the federal government, and many corporations have followed suit.
“I think we’re in more danger now than we were before,” Simpson told The 19th. “We’re in the same position of our rights, our bodies, our communities being under attack.”
To create a more inclusive future, Simpson said that the Black community must continue to work together across religions, political values and identities because “disrespectability politics … have kept us divided.” The Black community has to come together to advocate for their needs, which includes educating each other, reclaiming their culture and embracing moments of joy.
“We need all the Black joy as possible because our joy has to be non-negotiable at this time,” she said. “That’s a powerful and necessary part of how we make it through.”
