I was proud to be part of the No Kings protest, and glad to see such a large turnout at the Burlington waterfront. But I was uncomfortable with all of the Palestinian flags.
The point of this demonstration was to protest what is happening here. By including all these flags, it made demonstrators feel like they were also endorsing a position in support of Palestine.
There are many bad things happening in the world including a humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But if one polled the demonstrators, I doubt there is a broad consensus as to what the United States should do. And what about Ukraine? If we wanted to expand the demonstration to world events, why weren’t there any Ukrainian flags?

It is imperative that we continue to advocate and demonstrate for world peace. But, that is not why we showed up on June 14. We came to protest the unconscionable things happening in the United States, nicely captured in the slogan “No Kings”. For this protest, we should be waving American flags.

While educators say the changes are necessary to address disruptive post-pandemic classroom behavior, the policies are drawing criticism from some student and family advocates.
The Washington state Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction adopted the updated discipline rules on June 10.
Last August, the agency enacted an emergency version of the rules, “in response to ongoing confusion and challenges surrounding the interpretation” of existing policies set in 2019.
Those emergency rules provide the foundation for the permanent update, which will take effect July 11.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal said last week in an emailed statement to the Standard that the updated rules will keep limits in place on long-term suspensions and expulsions, maintain expectations for schools to communicate with families over student behavior issues and cut down on bureaucracy.
“Student behaviors have worsened due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, increased prevalence of cell phones, anxiety over local and global crises, and more, and the former rules created a disincentive to address classroom behaviors in the moment,” Reykdal said.
However, some student advocates have said the new rules undermine student protections and that Reykdal’s office did not seek enough community feedback.
“Talking with community partners, family groups, et cetera, I think everyone’s pretty much in agreement that it’s a rollback of student discipline reforms that were made in 2019,” said League of Education Voters Foundation Chief Engagement Officer Eric Holzapfel.
A nonprofit that conducts policy and research around equity in education, the League of Education Voters Foundation has opposed the discipline policy changes since the emergency rules were enacted last year.
In a letter sent out to supporters in March, the League of Education Voters Foundation warned that the new rules “could lead to increased exclusion from classrooms, disproportionately affecting students of color, students with disabilities, students in foster care, students experiencing homelessness, and other vulnerable students.”
Specific concerns cited by the group included the possibility of students being removed from class without support, loosening rules around alternative discipline, weaker state guidance on when to exclude students from class and weaker parent notification requirements.
Derick Harris, executive director of the Black Education Strategy Roundtable, also voiced criticism in an article published last month by Public News Service.
“This appears to me to be some rollback to a bygone era of zero-tolerance policy … Which we know within the Black community is a streamlined pathway from the school to the prison,” Harris said.
Developing the rules
The emergency rules implemented last August changed the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction’s discipline policies by providing definitions for discipline, corrective action, classroom exclusion, and emergency removal of a student from school.
Under these rules, teachers can exclude students from the classroom for a maximum of two days at a time if their district’s local policy allows for it.
The emergency rules also removed a provision requiring educators to “identify other forms of discipline that school personnel should administer before or instead of administering classroom exclusion, suspension, or expulsion.”
This provision isn’t in the new permanent rules, either. But Katie Hannig, a spokesperson for the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, said Wednesday that “the updated rules do not remove the requirement for educators to consider alternative disciplinary actions prior to classroom exclusion.”
She pointed to a different part of the rules that says, “Except in emergency circumstances, the teacher first must attempt one or more alternative forms of corrective action.”
The primary difference between the emergency and permanent rules is that under the new permanent rules, schools must collect data on disciplinary actions taken at each school and submit it to a statewide database.

OSPI collaborated with the Association of Washington School Principals, the Washington Association of School Administrators, the Washington State School Directors’ Association and the Washington Education Association when crafting the 2024 emergency rules.
Washington Educators Association Soundview Council President Filma Fontanilla described the rules as “a step forward.”
“Educators need additional resources to support students in meeting behavioral expectations and to address their unmet needs. WEA members spoke out and OSPI heard us,” Fontanilla said in an emailed statement.
Concerns about public input
The Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction began the permanent rulemaking process in October 2024 and filed proposed permanent rules based on the emergency rules in January.
There were opportunities for public comment on the proposed permanent rules between late February and early March of this year, including at four in-person meetings in the Tri-Cities area, Spokane, Federal Way, and Vancouver. The process to enact the emergency rules did not require the agency to seek public comment.
While League of Education Voters Foundation staff attended OSPI’s public hearings and participated in the public comment period earlier this year, Holzapfel said the nonprofit still found the state agency’s community engagement lacking.
“We’re really concerned about the lack of public hearings that there were, the lack of announcement around them,” Holzapfel said. “They weren’t really communicated to local schools or parent groups or student groups in the area.”
The four public hearings were each held from 4 to 6 p.m., which Holzaphel said limited in-person access to parents and students.
The League of Education Voters Foundation had a meeting with OSPI staff about their concerns on May 29.
Holzapfel said the group’s main ask was to “start this process over” and bring more voices into the process, including young people who’ve faced disciplinary action.
“Let’s bring in parent groups, let’s bring in student groups, and let’s have a holistic discussion on what our values are, what the intentions are of these rules,” he said.
While a second meeting has been scheduled, Holzaphel said that agency staff have indicated the permanent discipline policies will go into effect unchanged on July 11.
“We are committed to monitoring the implementation of the updated rules closely and making adjustments as needed,” Reykdal said.

The administration in Washington is targeting immigrants in blue states for deportation. The state of Vermont should do everything in its power to protect these two people, who are our Vermont neighbors.  If the “Unity” part of Freedom and Unity is to mean anything, we need to stand together with all Vermonters when they are under attack.

After years of insisting it would soon move to an all-electric lineup of cars and light trucks, GM is tapping the brakes on EVs and accelerating investment in U.S.-built, fossil fuel-powered vehicles the automaker has admitted are a major contributor to global warming.
What gives? Three factors: less-than-anticipated consumer demand for EVs, President Donald Trump’s trade war and the president’s distaste for cars that don’t run on gasoline.
The Detroit automaker announced on June 10 that it will spend $4 billion over the next two years to shift some production to two U.S. factories from Mexican plants and convert a Michigan plant from planned EV production to build gas-powered vehicles.
And last month, GM nixed a plan to spend $300 million to build electric vehicle motors at its Tonawanda, New York engine plant. Instead, it will invest $888 million in the 87-year-old factory to make V-8 gas engines. The company said the investment is its largest ever in an engine plant.
Included in GM’s new investments is the idled Orion Assembly plant in Oakland County that was being retooled to build full-size electric pickups. GM recently abandoned that plan. The sprawling plant will now build gas-powered SUVs and pickups.

The announcement came as a huge relief to state and local officials who faced the prospect of potentially losing a massive assembly plant that once employed thousands of workers.
Oakland County Executive Dave Coulter said GM’s Orion investment “is fantastic news and a powerful tribute to the enduring legacy of auto manufacturing in the state.”
GM’s news release did not cite any new jobs being created from its $4 billion plant investment. Spokesman Kevin Kelly said the company will announce more job details as it gets closer to product launches in the plants.
The automaker still plans to add the 2,350 new jobs it announced in 2022 for the Orion EV conversion, Kelly said.
GM isn’t completely walking away from electric vehicles, which are needed to address climate change.  It offers 13 EV models with more in the pipeline.
The automaker said it sold 62,000 EVs this year through May and surpassed Ford to become a distant second to Tesla in EV sales.
But EV sales have lagged far below what automakers and analysts had believed would occur by now.  GM has all but abandoned its goal of selling only electric vehicles by 2035.
Consumers will largely dictate how soon GM completes its total transition to EVs, GM CEO Mary Barra has been saying in recent months.
But the automaker’s big U-turn on EVs also reflects the enormous pressure the White House is exerting on the highly regulated auto industry.
Trump has been strong-arming automakers, foreign and domestic, to build all the vehicles they sell here on U.S. soil by slapping punishing tariffs on their imported vehicles.
He and the Republican-controlled Congress also have proposed measures that would likely cripple the nascent EV industry. Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” moving through Congress would eliminate the $7,500 consumer tax credit on EVs and dump the Biden-era battery production tax credits.
Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. recently said the loss of battery tax credits would imperil the automaker’s $3 billion investment in its under-construction Marshall battery plant, which is expected to employ 1,700 workers.
A new report by Bloomberg NEF has cut 14 million battery-powered vehicles from its sales forecast through 2030, citing Trump’s anti-EV policies.
Automakers are being whipsawed between Trump’s actions toward the industry and those of his predecessor, President Joe Biden.
Biden attempted to push the industry to rapidly switch to battery-powered vehicles by offering them billions of dollars in incentives to make the conversion.
He set a goal of having 50% of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. being electric by 2030 and enacted tough tailpipe emission standards that would have hastened EV production. The Trump administration is rolling back those measures.
GM was all-in on Biden’s EV plans and now publicly supports many of Trump’s moves to reshape the auto industry.
Barra recently told the Wall Street Journal that Trump’s tariffs can “level the playing field” for domestic and foreign automakers. And she successfully lobbied the president to revoke California’s right to ban gas-powered vehicle sales by 2035 and set its own tailpipe emission rules.
GM, which once supported California’s emission standards, and other automakers opposed California’s EV ban, saying the deadline would be impossible to meet.
The Wall Street Journal’s conservative editorial page has criticized Barra for shifting with the political winds on tariffs and EVs. One of its columnists said Barra’s backing of Trump’s economic agenda questions her commitment to EVs.
I think that’s a bit unfair. GM for decades has been working to phase out the internal combustion engine with new technologies, including EVs and future hydrogen-powered vehicles. Its EV sales are growing.
Captains of industry also know it’s bad for business to publicly tangle with a president, particularly one as vengeful as Trump.
But I hope Barra is privately trying to convince Trump that EVs can help save the planet and work toward his goal of having a fully made-in-the-USA auto industry.
An annual report on the most American-made vehicles has just been released by Cars.com. And guess what? Six of the top 10 are EVs.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-723504579-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-23 07:05:38.648847

President Donald Trump’s recent budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2026, a preliminary plan released in early May and known as “skinny” because a more robust ask will follow, outlines a 44% cut to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, including a 43% reduction in rental assistance programs that support more than 9 million Americans.
Trump also wants to consolidate federal housing aid, which includes programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing, into block grants — or finite amounts of money that states would administer. The proposal also would cap eligibility for many aid recipients at two years, and significantly limit federal oversight over how states dole out housing aid to low-income, disabled and older renters.
The approach tracks suggestions outlined in the Heritage Foundation playbook known as Project 2025, in which first-term Trump advisers and other conservatives detailed how a second Trump term might look. The chapter on HUD recommends limiting a person’s time on federal assistance and “devolving many HUD functions to states and localities.”
To that end, Trump’s new housing aid budget request would put states in charge, urging them to create new systems and removing federal regulatory certainty that residents, landlords and developers rely on for low-income housing.
Trump’s request also proposes new rules, such as a two-year time limit on the receipt of Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8 vouchers, for households that do not include persons with disabilities or older adults. The vouchers, federal money paid directly to landlords, help eligible families afford rent in the private market.

Trump’s allies call the changes responsible, while detractors worry about rising homelessness among those who now receive aid.
Among the nearly 4.6 million households receiving HUD housing assistance in the 2020 census, the average household was made up of two people, and the average annual income was just under $18,000, according to a department report last year.
In testimony to Congress this month about the proposed fiscal 2026 budget, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that HUD rental assistance is meant to be temporary, “the same way a treadway facilitates the crossing of an obstacle.”
“The block grant process will empower states to be more thoughtful and precise in their distribution and spending of taxpayer dollars,” Turner said.
The current budget reconciliation package, the tax-and-spending bill named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, doesn’t address individual Housing Choice Vouchers or send federal housing aid back to states. However, it would offer tax credits to developers of affordable housing and expand areas that could qualify for additional favorable tax cuts. That bill passed the House and is now undergoing consideration in the Senate.
Trump’s hopes for next year
The president’s fiscal year 2026 budget request serves as an outline of the administration’s vision for next year’s federal spending.
Congress — specifically the House and Senate Appropriations committees — must draft, negotiate and pass appropriations bills, which ultimately decide how much funding programs like rental assistance will receive.
Trump’s budget request provides sparse details on how much housing aid the federal government would give to each state, and how it would oversee spending. Housing advocates and state agencies are concerned.
“A big piece of the proposal is essentially re-creating rental assistance as we know it, and turning it into a state rental assistance block grant program,” said Kim Johnson, senior director of policy director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

Experts say any resulting aid cuts would disproportionately affect families with children, older adults and individuals with disabilities, many of whom rely on rental subsidies and support to remain stably housed in high-rent markets.
“It would completely change how households might be able to receive rental assistance of any kind,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the center. “It combines five of these programs that millions of people rely on, cuts the funding almost in half, and then leaves it completely to states to decide how to use that funding.”
That’s a shift most states can’t afford, say housing advocates.
A state-by-state analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows the highest rates of housing assistance are in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, along with a few blue states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.
“There’s no way to cut 43% of funding for rental assistance without people losing that assistance or their housing security,” said Johnson, of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And it’s not just urban centers that would be hit; rural areas of Mississippi and Louisiana also have high rates of federal housing aid.
“A rural community who solely relies on federal funding would be even more impacted,” Johnson added.
While state housing finance agencies proved during the pandemic that they can rapidly deploy federal funding, Stockton Williams, executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies, warned that the budget’s shift to block grants would require sufficient funding, a clear transition plan and strong oversight to ensure success.
Housing authorities are requesting further guidance from the feds and members of Congress, and more detail is needed on how any block-grant process would work, Stockton wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline.
“There is still a risk of overregulation and micromanagement with a block grant,” he wrote. “That said, for any type of new block grant to the states to work, there would need to be a transition period both to ensure states can build the necessary infrastructure and oversight and to test and train new systems with the private sector, local government, and nonprofit organizations that would interact with it.”
In New York City, which operates the nation’s largest housing voucher program, officials didn’t outline what steps they would take if Trump’s proposed cuts become reality, but a spokesperson said the plans would hurt residents.
Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, believes the most innovative aspect of the Trump proposal is the introduction of time limits on housing assistance, a mechanism not currently used in HUD’s rental programs.
But he cautioned that a blanket two-year time limit — especially if applied to existing tenants — would be “a recipe for chaos,” particularly in high-need areas such as New York City. Instead, he supports a phased approach focusing on new, non-disabled, non-elderly tenants.
“Block grants would allow states to move away from one-size-fits-all and apply rules based on their own housing needs,” Husock said to Stateline in an interview.
Affordable housing advocates disagree.
“If passed, the president’s proposed budget would be devastating for all federally assisted tenants,” said Michael Horgan, press secretary for the New York City Housing Authority in a statement to Stateline. “Block grants, program funding cuts, and time limits will only worsen the current housing crisis.”
A recent analysis of 100 metro areas by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that households using housing vouchers are more likely to live in higher income areas than those with other federal rental assistance.
“There is a high share of these households using [other] federal rental assistance in higher-poverty areas,” Gartland, the center’s researcher, explained, noting that programs such as the Housing Choice Vouchers are a rare but essential tool for expanding housing mobility.
“If you’re cutting the programming by 40%, you’re just putting additional strain on that program and just limiting that potential.”
For housing providers, uncertainty is growing
For property owners and landlords, the proposed shift in federal assistance and housing aid to the states isn’t just a policy question, it’s a business risk.
Alexandra Alvarado, director of education at the American Apartment Owners Association, said many smaller landlords are closely following proposed changes to the voucher program.
“Section 8 is a stabilizing force, especially for mom-and-pop landlords,” she said. “Many have had loyal tenants for years and rely on that steady income.”
According to Alvarado, landlords — especially small operators — have come to view housing vouchers not just as a public good, but also as a reliable business model where rent is often on time and predictable.
But with the proposed changes placing administration in the hands of state governments, landlords fear a breakdown in consistency.
“If the administration is serious about shifting responsibility to states, landlords will need a lot more clarity, and fast,” Alvarado said. “These programs are supposed to offer certainty. If states run them inconsistently or inefficiently, landlords may exit the market altogether.”
The transition itself, she added, may be destabilizing.
“You’re turning an ecosystem upside down. Change too many parts of the system at once, and you risk unintended domino effects.”
While developers may benefit from new tax incentives in the budget, Alvarado said that doesn’t offset the instability small landlords fear.
“Most mom-and-pop landlords don’t want to evict or raise rent, especially during hard times,” she said. “They just want to provide stable housing and be treated fairly.”

Its supporters are trying to preserve some remnants.,"Bridgette Edwards poses with Karl Turk, the Jobs for America's Graduates specialist who has become a ""father figure,"" during a June 2025 visit to her chosen Indiana State University. (Courtesy photograph)Bridgette Edwards is going to college.
The 18-year-old graduated from Cloverdale High School last month despite a “rocky” start. After two years enrolled in career success classes with roots in dropout prevention, she’s gained a “family” of classmates, a “father figure” of a teacher and a vision for her future.
It’s “surreal,” she told the Capital Chronicle.
“Freshman-year me would have never thought that now I’d be going to Indiana State University and going to pursue my dreams,” Edwards said. “I just got an apartment for myself and all that. She definitely would have probably slapped me in the face, like, ‘You’re lying to me; what are you talking about?'”
Edwards is among thousands of Hoosier students participating in the Jobs for America’s Graduates (JAG) program. After undergoing a massive expansion, Indiana now hosts 250 sites — the nation’s largest network, according to the Department of Workforce Development (DWD). The agency oversees JAG in Indiana.
But JAG is expected to shrink to 30 or fewer sites by the end of the year.
Within just six months of hitting the 250-site goal, the program’s dedicated state funding was eliminated. Federal dollars shared by other agencies were deemed “unavailable.”
That’s left administrators, parents, teachers and students in the lurch — and trying preserve some remnants.
“This is ending the JAG program as we have come to know it in the state of Indiana,” Indiana Workforce Alliance Chair Tony Waterson said. The organization represents the 12 local workforce development boards that administer JAG in Indiana.
“Now, can it be reinvented? Yes. Will it sustain in some fashion? Most likely, (but) on a much, much reduced scale,” said Waterson, who is also president and CEO of board Southern Indiana Works.
Joining JAG
The model dates back to 1979 in Delaware, but former Gov. Mitch Daniels brought it to Indiana in 2006 to address the state’s “growing dropout crisis,” according to a DWD timeline.
JAG participants often face challenges that make it more likely they won’t complete high school or successfully transition into what lies after graduation. They may be low-income, first-generation, struggling with transportation, lacking workforce experience or marketable skills, and so on, per the national organization’s annual report.
In its first year, the program served 217 students at 12 schools.
It’s educated 45,000 since then. And it was set to serve more.
The expansion, which was fully implemented this year and doubled program sites from 125 to 250, was expected to impact 10,000 students annually.
Participants take elective, for-credit classes taught by specialists who also provide advice and other support. They meet multiple times each week, building close relationships.
“When we first got into our class, … you had your friends, but you didn’t really know everybody. But once we got to the end of the year, everybody was like a family,” Edwards said.
She recalled career association days featuring healthy student debate alongside visits from working professionals and educational institutions.










People are nice about it, right? Like, 'Oh, here's some options.' But we're not really going to be able to go to a private foundation and ask for $30 million annually for the foreseeable future, right? ... That's just not something that's realistic.


– Indiana Workforce Alliance Chair Tony Waterson


She’d long harbored dreams of becoming a nurse, but a school resource officer’s presentation prompted a new dream. Now, Edwards will enter college studying criminology and criminal justice, with the goal of becoming a forensic scientist or police officer.
JAG, she said, “made me understand more of what I wanted to be for the rest of my life.” She’s also learned how to manage a credit card, present herself professionally to adults and more.
That’s thanks to specialist Karl Turk, whom she called “a father figure to me.” Edwards’ biological father died when she was 11.
But employees like him are in jeopardy.
There are “close to 300 JAG team members whose budget just went from $27 million to, you know, zero,” Waterson said. Some roles may be retained, but “there’s going to be a loss of jobs.”
“Every JAG specialist is touching, you know, 40 to 60 kids. And so now you’re impacting them and their lives as well,” he added. “… It’s a tough day, you know, tough week, tough month, tough budget cycle.”
Dedicated funding dropped
DWD previously received $8 million per year for JAG via a “dropout prevention” line item in the state’s biennial budget.
Gov. Mike Braun kept that in his version of House Enrolled Act 1001.
House Republicans scrapped DWD’s line item and instead included “dropout prevention” under the lengthy list of ways the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE) could spend an $86 million “Freedom and Opportunity in Education” fund.
Republicans finalize $44 billion budget, while Democrats point to missed opportunities

“When JAG funding was eliminated in DWD’s budget, it did not get moved to IDOE,” spokeswoman Courtney Bearsch said in a statement to the Capital Chronicle.
The Senate GOP maintained this in later versions of the budget.
But, with just a week to finalize the legislation, fiscal leaders received a grim revenue forecast — and embarked on major cuts.
“You know, when you’re all of a sudden hit with a budget that says you’re going to have little over a billion less each year, a lot of stuff got caught in the crossfire,” Braun told reporters last week.
The fund was allotted $50 million in the final version. That’s the same amount of money IDOE got for literacy and a similar list of other efforts in the last budget. And, like most agencies, it was hit with a 5% budget cut and directed to withhold additional dollars.
“Due to significant budget constraints, the IDOE will also not be able to utilize state funding to sustain JAG,” DWD Chief Workforce Officer Katie Rounds wrote in a late May program update.
Indiana’s fiscal year – and JAG’s line item funding – ends June 30.
Funding flow set to a trickle
The line item isn’t even the largest source of funding cut from JAG.
A collaboration with the Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) was set to direct an additional $23.1 million in federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) dollars to fund the expansion, former Gov. Eric Holcomb announced in August 2023. That goal became reality in December 2024, per DWD.
The agency spent $13.3 million from TANF on JAG in the last program cycle, but FSSA is closing the spigot in August.
Rounds wrote that the TANF money is now “unavailable” for JAG.
That came as a shock to Waterson and his fellow workforce development board leaders.
“It was a question we asked repeatedly as we ramped up from 125 to 250: was the funding secure into the future? … And we were assured that that funding was secured,” he recounted.
To pull off the expansion, workforce development board members met with students, parents, teachers and administrators at middle schools, high schools and higher educational institutions.
“They signed and bought into the idea of it,” Waterson said. “They said, ‘Okay, we trust you.’ We hired staff.”
“We wouldn’t have done all that had we thought that this was even a possibility,” he added.
Students who’d joined in an initial round of the expansion would’ve been entering their second year of JAG come August, while those part of a later round would’ve gotten started at that point.
“We’ve told these these kids that, you know, you’re committing to us for two years when you do this — actually, three years, because there’s a follow-up period,” Waterson continued. “And now we’re saying, ‘Wait, no, we can’t.'”
Another slice of federal funding contributed by FSSA, typically worth $1.5 million annually, also won’t come JAG’s way. The Vocational Rehabilitation Pre-Employment Transition Services dollars supported disabled student participation for at least five years, according to DWD, including $2.2 million in the last program cycle.
“For that money to be available, you have to have … non-federal matching funds,” Waterson explained. “That gets dicey if there’s no state allocation.”
JAG’s only intact source of public funding may be federal legislation that expired five years ago. Initiatives under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunities Act (WIOA) operate through annual appropriations, according to bipartisan group Center Forward.
But WIOA Youth money also comes with complex requirements — and deep uncertainty about how Congress will fund it going forward.
That leaves private and philanthropic dollars, which added more than $1.2 million to JAG in the last program cycle.
“People are nice about it, right? Like, ‘Oh, here’s some options.’ But we’re not really going to be able to go to a private foundation and ask for $30 million annually for the foreseeable future, right?” Waterson said. “That’s just not something that’s realistic.”
Looking forward
JAG and other efforts hit in last-minute cuts could “be reconstituted,” according to Braun.
“That is going to be part of — on every agency, every program, we’re going to make sure that it’s being run well, (and it) may end up needing more resources if it’s been starved of it,” he said.

But potential aid in the future won’t stave off closures now.
They’ll likely occur in two waves, according to Waterson: most programs that were supposed to begin in August won’t, and most of those that do will shut down after the first semester.
In the meantime, he and other workforce development board leaders are regrouping.
“We are trying to find ways to salvage programming and salvage service to young people, either through alternative partnerships or alternative funding mechanisms,” said Edmond C. O’Neal III, president and CEO of Northeast Indiana Works.
O’Neal’s board is also rethinking how it structures program delivery.
Instead of assuming that one JAG specialist equals one site, he said, “I’d prefer to try to leverage those … people to service as many kids as we can.”
Five specialists, for example, could travel to handle 15 sites, although that introduces logistical challenges.
“It sucks,” Edwards said of JAG’s dim prospects.
“I just don’t think a lot of people are really seeing the good things that come out of it; they just see the academic value,” she added. “Even the students that people may think are quote-unquote ‘a lost cause,’ even those kids, it helps them a lot, getting out of trouble, learning their value of life.”

DeSantis’ veto pen.
  Patt Maney via Florida House
  Ileana Garcia via Florida Senate
The $1 million proposal was included in the Appropriations Committee on Criminal and Civil Justice budget chaired by Okaloosa County Republican state Rep. Patt Maney and Miami-Dade County Republican Sen. Ileana Garcia. Their insertion of the funding comes a year after Ron DeSantis vetoed a $2 million request to continue the program, and two years after an initial $1 million pilot program for free calls was enacted.
“Thank you to Chair Garcia, Chair Maney, and committee staff for restoring funding for the prison phone calls program,” said Graham Bernstein, who as a member of the Florida Student Policy Forum at the University of Florida researched the idea and brought it to local and state public officials a few years ago. 
“OPPAGA (the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability) reports and other evidence shows that this policy reduces recidivism by helping inmates who demonstrate good behavior stay connected with the outside world, saves the families of the incarcerated money, and lowers taxpayer spending on re-incarceration.”
In Florida’s correction system, inmates may only make collect calls, for which vendor ViaPath Technologies charges $13.5 cents a minute. As part of that contract with the Department of Corrections, they are allowed two free five-minute phone calls per month.
As Bernstein notes, independent studies have shown the benefits of allowing inmates to keep in contact with loved ones. A 2006 report from the Urban Institute found that within five years of release, incarcerated people with strong family connections were 25% more likely to cease criminal activity. A 2005 report on incarcerated mothers’ contact with children found that telephone calls, even more than physical visits, related to positive maternal perceptions of relationships with children.
“We should not punish the family for the sins of a single family member,” said Konstantin Nakov, who worked with Bernstein on researching the high costs of prison phone calls while at the Florida Student Policy Forum. “Children should not be punished for the crime their parent committed. This appropriation aims to reconnect a bond that may have been severed by incarceration by assuring that the families of those who are in prison are not drawn into poverty to make phone calls.”
Karen Stuckey is a prison reform advocate. She worked with then Broward County Democratic state Sen. Lauren Book on a proposal during the 2022 session requiring the Department of Corrections to provide inmates phone calls free of charge. Her bill didn’t acquire a House sponsor and died without being heard in any committee.
“Access to a parent in prison is difficult, high price of email, phone calls and travel, yet we know how important it is for children to have a bond with their parents,” said Stuckey, who had to deal at one point in her life with escalating phone bills as both her son and husband had been incarcerated in Florida prisons.
“We’ve had productive discussions with the Governor’s Office of Policy and Budget on this matter and hope that the Governor will support the Legislature’s decision,” Bernstein said.
The budget sent to his desk is slated to begin July 1, the start of the 2025-2026 fiscal year, although he is expected to veto certain line items before then.

The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics this month, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.
In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.
In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.
“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister 10 years ago today in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson has found a new leader for the Health Care Authority, which administers Medicaid for nearly 2 million people and is the largest purchaser of health care in the state.
Ferguson announced Wednesday that he had selected Maryland Deputy Health Secretary Ryan Moran, who oversees Medicaid and health care financing in that state. Moran’s first day is Aug. 18 and he will earn an annual salary of $251,208.
“I look forward to advancing the work and mission of the agency in such a critical time for health care nationally and am committed to ensuring those we serve receive access to integrated, person-centered care,” Moran said in a statement.
Ferguson said in a statement that Moran’s passion and experience make him a great choice. 
“His expertise will help us provide equitable, high-quality health care to the people of Washington,” Ferguson added.
Moran joined the Maryland Department of Health in April 2023 and is deputy secretary for Health Care Financing and Medicaid director. He will continue in those positions until August, Maryland Matters reported.
In February, he stepped in as acting secretary when the former health secretary left amid several controversies. Moran held the post until April, when Meena Seshamani took over as secretary.
Moran previously served as chief executive officer for Whitman-Walker Health System in the District of Columbia and as an assistant vice president for MedStar Health, which has 10 hospitals in Maryland and Washington, D.C., according to Ferguson’s office.
He holds a doctorate in public health from Johns Hopkins University and is a board member of the National Association of Medicaid Directors.
Moran will arrive as Washington, like Maryland and other states, is preparing for the likelihood that the Trump Administration and Republican-controlled Congress will reduce federal funding for Medicaid. 
Washington officials have said as many as 194,000 residents could lose Medicaid coverage under legislation passed by the U.S. House of Representatives that is pending in the Senate. Ferguson has said Washington would lose about $2 billion in federal Medicaid funding over the next four years under the bill.
About two dozen Washington state Republican lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Drew Stokesbary, urged the 12-member congressional delegation to avoid cuts that would imperil the state’s Medicaid program, known as Apple Health.
And Moran will begin work as the Health Care Authority ponders a response to the unauthorized sharing of protected health information for the state’s Apple Health enrollees with the Department of Homeland Security. That data could potentially be used to track down immigrants without legal status.
As of this spring, nearly 2 million Washington residents were enrolled in Apple Health, including over 850,000 children.
“This is an unethical use of protected health information,” authority officials said in a June 13 statement. “We would never support the use of data submitted for health care purposes being repurposed by federal agencies seeking to unjustly target specific groups of individuals.”
Moran will replace MaryAnne Lindeblad, a veteran authority leader who has served as interim director since director Sue Birch retired when Ferguson took office.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ryan-moran-hca-director-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-23 07:05:38.648847

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana is in the midst of redesigning its public higher education ecosystem. In recent years, state leaders have pursued reforms aimed at making institutions more accountable, efficient, and closely aligned with workforce needs. These efforts respond to a growing and legitimate public concern: is higher education delivering what Indiana and its taxpayers need?
What’s often missing from the conversation, however, is the recognition that not all higher education institutions are built the same — or should be treated the same. Indiana’s two- and four-year institutions serve different missions and student populations. Policy that ignores these differences risks unintended consequences for institutions, the students they serve, and the state’s postsecondary attainment goals.
Ivy Tech taps Kentucky school superintendent as new leader

Consider Ivy Tech Community College, the state’s unified community college system. It fulfills two essential missions: preparing Hoosiers for high-wage, high-demand jobs in current and emerging industries, and offering an affordable, seamless pathway to four-year degrees. Nearly 70 percent of Ivy Tech’s 200,000 students attend part time. About 25 percent care for a dependent, and 40 percent are the first in their families to attend college. More than 90 percent live in Indiana and attend their local campus, and most stay in Indiana after graduation.
As the state’s open-access institution, Ivy Tech is built to meet learners where they are while helping employers address talent shortages. Its mission and student body require a different operating model than other public colleges and universities.
For example, Ivy Tech does not have a tenure system. Most faculty are part-time, on short-term contracts, and often still work in the fields they teach — keeping instruction highly relevant to industry needs. Ivy Tech is also non-residential, with facilities focused on classrooms, labs, and essential student services.
This model limits revenue streams that other institutions rely on. Ivy Tech doesn’t generate income from student housing, dining, or parking. It doesn’t have lucrative athletics programs or collect research royalties that support many public universities.
Keeping to the mission
And, in the face of statewide funding reductions, Ivy Tech has continued to prioritize affordability. In 2023, it introduced a simplified tuition model that eliminated mandatory fees—saving students money but reducing institutional revenue by $5.6 million annually.
When it became clear that textbook costs were a barrier to learning, Ivy Tech used its statewide scale to negotiate better prices. Now, students pay a flat, per-credit-hour fee for required textbooks — helping them plan financially and saving them more than $65 million since the program began. This shift cost Ivy Tech $4 million in annual commission revenue, but it put student success first.
These reforms are producing real results. Nearly half of all credentials awarded by Indiana’s public colleges last year came from Ivy Tech. Since 2016, completions have more than doubled. Over 80% of graduates leave without student loan debt, and more than half earn above the state median wage within three years. These outcomes are not only boosting individual prosperity — they are strengthening Indiana’s workforce and tax base.

Enrollment growth and expanding partnerships further underscore Ivy Tech’s value. Companies like Stellantis and Entek cite the College’s workforce pipeline as a factor in their investment decisions. Looking ahead, Ivy Tech is positioned to help Indiana grow talent in industries like semiconductors, biotechnology, biopharmaceuticals, and clean energy.
As national organizations like the Lumina Foundation call for 70% of Americans to earn a degree or credential beyond high school, institutions like Ivy Tech will be critical to reaching that goal. Especially in a state where many learners are working adults or place-bound, Ivy Tech’s reach and design make it indispensable.
Indiana’s higher education system must evolve, but that evolution must be informed by mission. As state leaders push for results, they must also account for how institutions are structured to deliver them. Treating all colleges the same risks undermining the very progress reforms aim to achieve. Ivy Tech’s model — student-centered, cost-conscious, and workforce-aligned — is not an exception to the system. It is where higher education should be going if we’re to win the future.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A federal magistrate judge in Nashville has denied the government’s motion to detain Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an immigrant living in Maryland who was wrongfully sent to a Salvadoran prison by U.S. immigration officials.
Federal prosecutors immediately filed notice they intend to appeal the decision. Both the decision by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes and the notice of appeal were filed Sunday.
In denying the government’s motion to keep Abrego detained, Holmes acknowledged that if he is released he will likely be taken into custody immediately by  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Abrego, who has previously been referred to in the government’s legal filings as “Abrego Garcia,” informed the court he goes by “Abrego” as his last name.
Nevertheless, Holmes wrote, “due process demands that every person charged with a federal crime be afforded a presumption of innocence unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and that deprivation of an individual’s liberty prior to trial can occur only in carefully limited circumstances with all the procedural safeguards afforded by the Bail Reform Act.”
“Abrego, like every person arrested on federal criminal charges, is entitled to a full and fair determination of whether he must remain in federal custody pending trial. The Court will give Abrego the due process that he is guaranteed.”
The judge set a June 25 court date to review the conditions for Abrego’s release.
Abrego was brought to Nashville from El Salvador on June 6 to face human smuggling charges connected to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop. He was pulled over for speeding with nine Hispanic men in the back of a Chevrolet Suburban. He was neither arrested nor charged in the incident.
But a recent Department of Homeland Security investigation opened into the three-year-old stop gave rise to the charges he now faces.
Abrego entered “not guilty” pleas to the charges in an appearance in federal court on June 13.
Prosecutors argued that Abrego should be detained because his crimes involved minor victims, he is a flight risk and could potentially intimidate witnesses. Abrego is not charged with any crimes related to child victims.
Holmes dismissed federal prosecutors’ arguments that Abrego’s alleged illegal transport of immigrants from Texas to destinations around the country for payment involved a teenager as lacking clear evidence.
Abrego’s deportation to a notorious Salvadoran prison that U.S. officials acknowledged was in error then refused to return him, has sparked national scrutiny to Trump administration immigration crackdowns.

This story by Liberty Darr was first published in the Other Paper on June 19.
The Vermont Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the developer looking to build on the 7-acre slice of land next to South Burlington’s Wheeler Nature Park.
The decision issued last month affirms the Vermont Environmental Court’s decision that also favored the development following a six-day trial last summer.
But appellants James Leas and two other neighboring residents, Alan Luzzatto and Jeanne Zagursky, have not given up the battle to protect the property from development. Earlier this month, they filed a motion that requests that the court restore the case to the calendar for resubmission of briefs and arguments, which they say the court misapprehended in its decision.
The project calls for 32 mixed-housing units directly adjacent to Wheeler Nature Park, an area in the city that has long been designated as an area of high public value. The parcel sits at the intersection of Dorset Street and Park Road in South Burlington, part of a larger area that itself was once the subject of a lengthy court case.
Although the project’s developers won development review board approval in 2021 and Act 250 approval in 2022, the project was quickly appealed by a group of 125 nearby neighbors from the Inverness, Glen Eagles and Villas at Water Tower Hill homeowners’ associations and the Neighbors Committee to Stop Neighborhood Blasting. That decision was then appealed to the Supreme Court in September.
Key issues for the appellants include their contention that the scenic view of the Green Mountains over the nature park would be disturbed, as would the wildlife from the blasting of rock needed to build the homes. Overall aesthetics and undue traffic burdens were also mentioned as concerns.
They argue the development would “demolish” the nature park and ultimately “destroy” the “last traditional Vermont view of the Green Mountains from those recreation paths” adjacent to the property.
However, the environmental court sided with the developer last summer, finding that the project complies with Act 250 criteria for aesthetics, noise and traffic, adding that the project is consistent with the characteristics of the residential area where the development is planned to be.
But residents contend that city plans and reports have called for this land to be preserved in perpetuity, and they say it should be.
The 110-acre Wheeler Nature Park has had years of legal history since it was first acquired by the city in 1993. The parcel at the heart of this latest court battle was first created in 2015, the result of a settlement with landowner JAM Golf that included swapping these 7 acres for 22 acres that have been conserved forever as part of Wheeler Nature Park. A second amended agreement between the parties was reached in 2017.
The land swap was approved by city voters in 2011, although the vote, according to former city attorney Jim Barlow at a council meeting in 2015, was not legally binding and only considered a “good faith” gesture on the part of the city.
That agreement created specific zoning for the parcel and ultimately laid out specific development guidelines.
But neighbors throughout the court case have claimed that this 2015 agreement between the landowner and the city was “improper.”
Appellants in their most recent motion bring up nine points — or as they call them, “a stack of errors” — they hope to reargue in court.
“We believe review of the points of law that the court overlooked or misapprehended would affect the result,” they wrote.

In March, Smith took the helm herself. 
She hopes to provide more stability in leading the agency which has seen growing scrutiny over the last several years from nearly every direction — including lawmakers, judges, advocates and the media.  
Children’s Division is Missouri’s child welfare agency and is responsible for overseeing foster care, working on frontline child abuse and neglect investigations and managing calls to the child abuse and neglect hotline.

There are over 11,000 Missouri children in foster care, as of May, which is down from a peak of over 14,000 in 2021. The state continues to take kids into care at a rate higher than the national average, and is slower to reunite families than the national average. 
Children’s Division is acting under a performance improvement plan with the federal government over issues ranging from failure to provide timely permanent placements for kids to caseworkers failing to provide sufficient engagement with parents. 
Lawmakers over the years have also raised concern about missing foster kids, unlicensed boarding schools and severe understaffing.
In a brief sit-down with The Independent last week, Smith said she wants to bring Children’s Division back to the basics, which she defines as ensuring safety for children. She highlighted her long experience in the agency, beginning as a frontline child abuse and neglect investigator.
She took over from Darrell Missey, who was outspoken about what he felt was a needed course correction for the agency that was taking too many kids into foster care and keeping them there too long. Missey spent his career as a judge before leading Children’s Division, and his vision reflected a national trend toward family preservation efforts.
Smith, on the other hand, said she doesn’t see reducing the number of kids in foster care as an especially valuable metric. She highlighted several policies during the 30-minute interview, including: 

She supports increasing Temporary Alternative Placement Agreements, which provides removal of children from the home for no more than 90 days into relatives’ care. The parent or guardian voluntarily enters into a TAPA with the Children’s Division, and it can only be done when the child is not in imminent risk. The practice has been criticized nationally and in Missouri as a type of “hidden foster care,” but proponents argue it helps keep kids safe without the trauma of foster care.
She sees the juvenile office as an important check on Children’s Division’s power, ensuring kids are only being removed when there’s a legally-supported reason. The juvenile office is an agency whose role is unique to Missouri’s child welfare system.  Some legal experts have called it unconstitutional. The juvenile office, within the judiciary branch, prosecutes child abuse and neglect cases side-by-side with Children’s Division, and it is responsible for petitioning the court to remove kids, generally upon Children’s Division’s request.
She noted that there are currently no foster kids residing in offices, a practice that has drawn criticism, but there are several staying in hotels because they don’t have anywhere else to go.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
 What do you think you bring to the role having spent decades in the agency? 

Carrying a caseload as a frontline investigator really helped me understand. I remember the manila folders where I had files for each family, and I would carry those around and try to make sure — have I seen all the kids on this one? Have I seen all the kids on this one? And kind of triaging.
You could be down in Laclede County in Lebanon, and then get a report in Moniteau County and be in California, Missouri. That’s an hour and a half, two hours.
And so just knowing all of those factors, then you have to learn your partners, and every one of those circuits I needed to know law enforcement and courts and juvenile offices and city and county police officers, schools and so just the importance of having those relationships is one of the things that I learned that I think adds value to getting to see the full picture.
 Have the first three months on the job been what you expected?

I think it is more [than I expected], very honestly.
Having stepped away from Children’s Division for a couple of years and worked at Family Support Division, and then having an opportunity to work with some of our residential services, there are just different pieces.  We have more team members than we did two years ago. We have different-sized caseloads than we had a couple years ago. And so families, I think, coming out of COVID, have more unique sets of circumstances in some areas with the service array available. 
And so just being able to understand all that, to know how to help team members, has just been a little bit more challenging than I expected. It is definitely worth all of the time and effort though, that everybody’s putting into it.
 Do you think that Children’s Division deserves the scrutiny and reputation that it’s gotten over the last few years? 

I think there’s a lot to Children’s Division. Being in it for so long, it’s complicated, and it’s a space that, we respect families’ privacy, and we can only share certain things, and there’s a lot that we can’t share about the work that happens. And that’s really hard sometimes, because you want to be able to share all the complicating factors that are happening and the ins and outs of different pieces. But we can only talk about how the process should work in a best case scenario. 
And I don’t think we should necessarily talk about case specifics, because that is a family’s right to privacy. A child’s right to his or her information being kept close to the vest for Children’s Division, but then having the opportunity to be transparent with our stakeholders about what’s happening, what the pain points are and using those systemic things and trends to be able to work with them to create some change. 
Because I do think that lack of stability in the Children’s Division director role does play a part in the practice that people see and the partnerships. I think I’ve had nine (directors) since I started Children’s Division, and you know, I’ve heard this from Children’s Division team members like, ‘we’re just going to wait it out. There’ll be somebody else coming in with a different philosophical view.’ Or stakeholders that aren’t sure that you’re going to stay so they don’t take the time to really get to know you or what practice should look like.
Because we’re not adding anything new or different. It’s just following the policy and tools that we have already been provided by the legislators, and really helping support our team. And so I do think that in regard to the scrutiny, some of it is just building that trust factor. And that’s a really big part of our executive team, and I know the department as a whole, is being able to build trust with stakeholders.

 You mentioned philosophical differences. What do you see as the main differences between you and former director Darrell Missey? 

The director’s role is really hard as I mentioned. You know, being in this spot, everybody comes in with kind of their plan about how to fix the broken system, or how to help support kids and families better. 
And I don’t think that anybody would ever enter into this space and take on this role if they didn’t feel like they could make a difference. And so, for me, I think making sure that we are training really the basics, the back to basics. 
We have a workforce that really wants to know at the end of the day what their job is from day to day, and not as much of the philosophical, the ‘why’ behind certain practices. They’re not in it for the Social Work degree, in most cases, they are here trying to keep kids safe on a day-to-day basis.
And they want to know the practical tools and what they need to enter into the system, when they should notify the court, when they should reach out to law enforcement. 
So just having that expertise, coming from Children’s Division, I think that gives me just a little bit different lens, because I’ve worked in every single program area. And so being able to connect those pieces and know what the hand-off looks like, I think that gives me a little bit different flavor than some previous directors. 
 Where do staffing issues stand? 

The last time that I checked, we had around 52 vacancies statewide, which is really amazing, actually, for Children’s Division. We’re still at around 26% turnover statewide. And of that, 41% of that is our front line workers.
We really hear training is the biggest issue. And so that is one of our main priorities, is revamping the training to make it more practical. We are interested in shortening up the length of time as well that team members are in the initial training now, there’ll be some trainings that, once they get in and get comfortable and kind of know their role, some specialized trainings that we’ll be able to provide.
 Do you see training as potentially helping remedy some of the federal issues outlined in the Performance Improvement Plan, such as family engagement?

If you’re not meeting with families, how are you moving the needle towards permanence here, or identifying safety threats? I don’t think we can hang our hat there and not do any other work around things, but I do think solid training is going to set us up for a lot better success.
 I’ve heard you say in other interviews that reducing the number of kids in care is not a particularly valuable metric of progress. How should progress be measured?

To me, creating a culture that kids are safe whether they’re in the home, or if there’s a temporary alternative placement agreement in place, that they’re safe in that placement. Or if we have some intensive in-home services or if we may recommend to the juvenile office for removal and place them with a family member or another placement — that we’re really looking at safety no matter what placement the youth is in. 
And so, I think that a good metric for us would be: If we’ve had a touch with a family, are we thoroughly assessing safety and having them in the least restrictive setting possible, depending on what the allegations are, and then are we having another touch with that family later on? 
 Is the way I characterized your thoughts on lowering the number of foster kids accurate?

I think it’s an important metric, but I do think you’re accurate. I think that, it’s really looking at how many calls do we have to the hotline that year? Of those, how many were alerted to the field? Are we seeing kids? So what’s our response time to making sure that we’ve assessed the safety of kids? How fast or thoroughly are we giving families closure? So when are those reports closed? Are we meeting our monthly visits with families…how quickly are they going to permanency? 
And then how many kids do we have in care as a metric, but it’s more so, is it that they’re staying in care longer, or are we getting permanency in a timely manner? And so kind of that whole scorecard of our organizational health as an agency. So I wouldn’t drive that on just one metric unless I knew that my number of critical incidents and retouches with our system had gone down as well.
 Do you think that Missouri relies too heavily on foster care? That the portion of kids in care is higher here than in other states and people say neglect is often confused with poverty — do you think that’s an issue?

I think we’re lucky in Missouri to have what I would call kind of a bifurcated system. It’s something that a lot of other states don’t have. Children’s Division cannot remove a child. We would recommend removal to the juvenile office. So the juvenile office that’s receiving that referral, they’re making sure that it’s legally sufficient and that we should be recommending removal. 
And we have those [referrals] denied from Children’s Division where, Children’s Division might think that there’s a safety threat, the child can’t remain in the home. And the juvenile office might look at it and help us understand why that’s not a legally sufficient avenue. 
They’ve been really great partners to us in that space, but having that other look to make sure that you know whatever the concerns are, do meet legal standards, I think helps make me feel better, especially with our turnover rate, that the kids that are in care are actually there for a reason that is legally supported.
 So you see the juvenile office as an important check on Children’s Division’s power?

Yeah, and not a lot of other states have that. I mean, they would still go through a hearing in a lot of other states within certain timeframes depending on that state. 
But for Children’s Division to have that check on the front end, I think, is something that’s really valuable to us. And so we pull those numbers to look at different circuits. What does removal look like in our partnership with the juvenile office, and I think that’s really important.
  (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
 You mentioned the temporary alternative placement agreements. In previous years, there’s been some concern — lawmakers have called them uncounted foster kids. Do you have any plans to make data surrounding TAPAs more transparent?

Definitely, that is something that we’ve been messaging, especially with our juvenile office partners, to make sure that they know that our circuit managers can provide them a listing of TAPAs. I mean, they should be notified, but we were hearing from some pockets that they weren’t receiving those notifications. And so we want to make sure that they know that they can continually get a list. 
We’re also working on how we could make kind of a public-facing dashboard with that, you know, that’s something that Director Bax, I think, is really big on — the transparency piece. 
So figuring out how we can get not just that data, but any of our data that we get a lot of requests for, or that there’s interest in, that we’re making sure to just try to make that as available as possible to, media partners, local counties — sometimes people are interested and they want to know what’s happening in their circuit — and so just trying to make that available.
 Why do you think those temporary placements are a tool that the state should rely on more?

Depending on what the concern is, it might be a safety threat that we would be able to mitigate within 30, 60, days, and be able to have supports wrapped around the family and, for the child to go home without entering Children’s Division custody. 
And so if that can safely be done, we should definitely be utilizing the TAPA. 
It just gives a little bit more formality to what in the old days, it was called a diversion. And I remember diverting a youth from a placement and kind of doing my investigation or assessment, and then there was no policy or procedure at that time, back in 2006, to close the case. And it’s like, okay, well, everything’s safe now, and you just closed it and so, but then that leaves everybody wondering, when can the child go back home? So this process of having a TAPA just really gives, I think, more support to the family.
 What about the federal Family First Prevention Services funding? Why do you think Missouri has lagged in spending it and what timeline is there now? 

I think that probably the stability in leadership plays a part in that, right? 
When you have multiple directors, just that transition, getting a spend plan, or getting that money out the door — I think that’s played a part of it. And just the ability for everyone to understand, since it was a little bit newer, how to do it, I think played a part.
 Is it true that a certain amount of money expires in October?

That’s correct. I think it was $10 million in transition funding that we got 2018, 2019, somewhere in there that will expire if it’s not expended by October. 
And so that is something that we’re trying to see what we’re able to get out the door by October in a meaningful way to help kids and families. That’s something that we’re definitely looking at, and was on our kind of first quarter plans to look at that and see what we can do.
I hate leaving money on the table. And so if we’re able to utilize that money here in Missouri, you know, let’s do it and let’s get it out the door.
 Are you hopeful about utilizing it in time?

I’m optimistic that we’ll be able to get it out the door. Coming in, in the eleventh hour, it kind of doesn’t set me up for the best success as a team for that, but I think we’re going to do our best. This exec team has a lot of support, and we’re going to try to do our best around that. 
 Regarding the problem with children staying in offices and hotels and residential treatment out of state, what kind of steps are you taking to alleviate those issues? And do you have a sense of how many kids are in those situations?

We definitely don’t have any kids in offices. 
We are utilizing hotels. Any time there’s a kiddo in a hotel, we are asking those to be sent up so we can try and help and support to make sure that that doesn’t happen proactively. 
That’s a priority. Is getting kids that are placed out of state and residential back into Missouri, and we’re excited about that, working with a lot of partners around what we need. 
So this is an issue around higher-acuity youth that people, legislators and stakeholders have been talking about for years.
And so I think we’ve admired the problem enough. I think we know what the problem is. And so how do we jump into some solutions to find them appropriate placement and supports here in Missouri, and to wrap services around them.
It was just Friday that I think at least three of us on the exec team were on a call for numerous hours with partners to try and strategize on how to help. The hospitals have been great partners to us, and so, trying to problem-solve and strategize on getting a youth some supports — and in some areas, there’s just not a lot of supports that are offered. And so how do we help make sure we can do that when there’s nothing in the area for that youth in that family. 
It’s something that takes more than just Children’s Division leaning in to help — hospitals, Department of Mental Health, Department of Health and Senior Services. Children’s Division doesn’t offer services. We work with others to get family services, and so we rely a lot on that provider network. Just working with our residential providers and acute and sub acuity settings to try to make sure that they feel that their programming is equipped enough to handle higher acuity youth, is something that almost everybody has come to the table wanting to help. 
And so we’re just really excited to see what action steps those individuals take to help Children’s Division and our contracted providers find spaces for these youth.
 It’s no secret that DSS has had trouble with its technology being old. I’ve encountered issues getting accurate data through Sunshine Requests, and I know others have had data issues, too. What do you think the roots of those problems are, and how do you plan to address them?

The department has made some efforts on bringing individuals on board that have a lot of IT knowledge. And so we’re excited that they’re in place and can help us in that space. 
And so we’re excited to have some IT team members on staff to be able to help us with this, because once we figure out the system and how that’s going to work, then the quality of data will help us be able to help kids and families better, and to be able to intelligently talk about the problems in a better way than we are able to today, to, media and partners.
I like the idea of sharing the data that we have now, whatever is available when we can that protects families’ privacy, because it’s at least a starting place. And that’s what we’re working with today. And so what we have today is what we’re going to use today, and then hope that it’s better as we go along. 
 Anything else?

Overall, I’m really excited to see over the next few months, and I would say, especially in a year — where Children’s Division is at in a year with our policy and practice and new training.
I think we’re going to be in a vastly different space than for people feeling comfortable in their work, and that’s what I’m most excited about, because when people feel comfortable and stakeholders trust us, then it’s only going to equal good things for kids and families.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061325_sarasmith4-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-06-23 07:05:38.648847

(Photo: Getty Images)Tennessee is prepared to provide the U.S. Department of Agriculture with a trove of sensitive personal data on low-income recipients of federal food stamp aid, a spokesperson for the state’s Department of Human Services said.
The Trump administration made the 50-state data request on May 6. It seeks the names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers and total dollar value of benefits received for each individual enrolled in SNAP, or Supplemental Nutritional Aid Program, over the past five years. 
The letter seeking the data of millions of food stamp recipients across the nation said the federal government intends to use the information to “ensure program integrity, including by verifying the eligibility of benefit recipients.”  
SNAP recipient data has historically been kept by state governments and private vendors contracted to process payments.
USDA pauses request for personal data of SNAP recipients while lawsuit proceeds

More than 687,000 Tennesseans – or about one in every ten state residents – received the benefit as of April, according to data posted by the Department of Human Services. SNAP provides a monthly cash benefit loaded onto a debit card to be used for food purchases only. 
The federal government’s request, made in tandem with efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to cut spending across the federal government, stemmed from an executive order by President Donald Trump to stop waste, abuse and fraud in public spending. 
A lawsuit filed by advocacy groups on May 22 challenged the Trump administration’s authority to demand the data. That litigation remains ongoing. 
The Trump administration has since posted a message to states that its request has been temporarily halted until “requisite procedural safeguards have been met” but notes federal officials will be working with state agencies and their payment processors to “prepare for the eventual transfer of the data discussed in the (May 6) letter.”
Some states have outright refused to comply with the request, while others — such as Tennessee — have signaled they will provide recipients’ personal information. 
“Tennessee has received the request and is prepared to comply within the law,” Danielle Cotton, a spokesperson for the Tennessee Department of Human Services, said via email.

,Missouri Independent,2025-06-23 10:50:32+00:00,Missouri Independent,No one knows better than Josh Hawley that ‘work requirements’ are Medicaid cuts,Bridgette Dunlap,,,,,https://missouriindependent.com/2025/06/23/no-one-knows-better-than-josh-hawley-that-work-requirements-are-medicaid-cuts/,U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley is presenting himself as the rare Republican willing to fight for low-income Americans who will lose their health care or food assistance if his party makes massive cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. He has been rewarded with much credulous reporting suggesting he is sincere about that.     But as Missouri’s senior U.S. […],"U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley speaks to reporters at the governor's ham breakfast at the Missouri State Fair in Sedalia on Aug. 15, 2024 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley is presenting himself as the rare Republican willing to fight for low-income Americans who will lose their health care or food assistance if his party makes massive cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. He has been rewarded with much credulous reporting suggesting he is sincere about that.    
But as Missouri’s senior U.S. senator and former attorney general, it’s fair to expect Hawley to know what is happening on the ground here: an abject failure to administer federal benefits in compliance with current law. 
There is absolutely no possibility that Missouri can handle additional red tape like the “work requirements” in both the House and Senate versions of Republicans’ “Big Beautiful Bill,” yet Hawley has endorsed them.
Missouri just isn’t capable of enhanced eligibility requirements. A lawsuit brought by disabled Missourians who were denied SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, proves this. 
One plaintiff with cancer and COPD, lacking internet access, transportation — and, let’s not forget, food — used her prepaid cell phone minutes sitting on hold for days trying to get an application. When she gave up and paid for a ride to a benefits office, she got an application but couldn’t complete the required interview due to lack of staff. So she spent more days on hold before having her application denied for failure to complete the interview that she couldn’t get.
That lawsuit was filed when Hawley’s fellow senator from Missouri, Eric Schmitt, was our attorney general. Instead of fixing the problem, the state has defended the lawsuit for three years. 
When the court found that Missouri was not complying with the law, current Attorney General Andrew Bailey appealed a non-appealable order that merely requires monthly progress reports on call wait times. In January of this year, the lowest daily average call wait time was 58 minutes and the highest average was 2 hours. The maximum wait time was 5 hours, roughly 21,000 calls were dropped and 14,134 callers gave up (or ran out of cell phone minutes, or had to pick up their kids, or had to go to work, etc). 
On the Medicaid front, Missouri was investigated and offered support by the Biden Administration to deal with our worst in the nation, legally non-compliant wait times for enrollment. 
Individuals submitting their renewal information — online, in person, by fax, or even certified mail — regularly lose their coverage automatically because the state fails to process their documents in time.
A woman who already had coverage through MO HealthNet, Missouri’s Medicaid program, went months without prenatal care because she was unable to reach anyone to tell them she was pregnant.
When the pandemic freeze on Medicaid disenrollments expired, Missouri made a mess of the eligibility review process so families learned at the pediatrician’s office that their children had lost their health insurance despite still being eligible. Children who went without medications for manageable conditions like asthma ended up at emergency rooms. 
Now imagine everyone has to navigate a dysfunctional system every six months to keep their health insurance as both versions of the bill would require. Or even once a month – as the bills would allow. 
You have to take time off work to prove you are working. Or you have to use up time and cell phone minutes to try to prove you can’t work and qualify for an exemption. In a system as broken as Missouri’s, many people can’t jump through those hoops even when they treat it like a full time job.
If Missouri can’t or won’t run it’s SNAP program properly under current law – where the federal government pays all of the benefits and 50% of the cost of administering those food aid dollars that go straight into our local economies – there is no way food insecurity here won’t get significantly worse and our economy won’t take a serious hit with Republicans’ planned cuts.  
Those proposed cuts include states losing at least 5% and up to 25% of their SNAP dollars depending on their “error rate” of under and over payments to households with SNAP.  Missouri’s most recent error rate is 10.2%, which means we would lose 25% of our funding for being over 10%, like the majority of states. And the bill would also cut funding for administrative costs which will inevitably make our error rate worse. SNAP is an optional program, and I wouldn’t put it past our legislature to end it all together and let people starve.
As to Medicaid, instead of allocating the funding needed to run MO HealthNet properly, our legislators blame leadership issues or technology problems. Our legislature has done nothing to prepare for what the proposed Trump cuts would do to us, nor what the DOGE impoundments are already doing. They just keep passing tax cut after tax cut. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Given we are not currently capable of running our Medicaid or SNAP programs, there is no possibility that we can manage added expensive red tape.
But that’s the goal. Republicans know, because it has been widely documented, that work requirements don’t work even in more functional states. They don’t increase employment because people with Medicaid who can work are already working. 
(I am setting aside the larger undiscussed issue of why working full time in the U.S. is not enough to afford health care, unlike in peer nations.)
The idea that there is $880 billion, or even a fraction of that, in “fraud, waste, and abuse,” in Medicaid is ridiculous. The savings Republicans are counting on would come from deliberately making it too burdensome for the struggling people these programs were intended to help to continue using them. 
Look at Arkansas. The state implemented a work requirement and 18,000 people lost their insurance in the few months before a court determined the requirement had been illegally implemented.  
Georgia enacted a program in lieu of Medicaid expansion that requires monthly eligibility paperwork. It has enrolled only 3% of Georgians with qualifying incomes, and the money spent on verifying eligibility has dwarfed that spent on providing actual medical care.  
Republicans are counting on this happening on a much larger scale to offset their tax cuts. It’s an incredibly wasteful and dangerous strategy.  
We burn money on processes to root out non-existent “fraud.” Then, when the people least equipped to navigate those processes can’t do so, they will lose their preventative health care and end up sicker and resorting to more expensive care at hospitals that are required by law to treat them regardless of ability to pay. Then all our premiums go up.
In Missouri, cuts will exacerbate our existing shortage of healthcare providers as more rural hospitals shutter due to lack of funds.

Hawley acknowledged that Missouri’s rural hospitals are in trouble when he opposed a different provision inthe House bill, which would curtail a Republican-created and very popular state tax used to get federal Medicaid dollars to hospitals. (He has since caved on the House’s curtailment, and now only opposes the Senate’s significantly more drastic one.) 
Rural Missourians will have particular difficulty navigating the work requirement due to lacking internet access, transportation, and job opportunities. And you know what makes it harder to keep a job? Losing your health insurance so you can’t manage your health conditions.
Despite there being no universe in which Missouri becomes capable of administering additional eligibility requirements anytime soon, Hawley doesn’t even object to Republicans moving the implementation deadline up from 2029 to next year. This is not a serious proposal for a functioning eligibility process. It’s a plan to take insurance from eligible people on purpose.
When Hawley was asked last week about people “inadvertently losing coverage,” he said: “We can sort that out.” How? If it’s so easy to sort, why didn’t Hawley or Schmitt sort it out when they were state officials or since?
Hawley is portraying himself as an advocate for the people by using the Trumpian tactic of telling us that up is down and a cut is not a cut.

As the executive director of Hyacinth Foundation, New Jersey’s oldest and largest HIV service provider, I am deeply alarmed by the Trump administration’s proposed federal budget for the next fiscal year.
The plan would slash more than $1.5 billion from core HIV prevention and treatment programs — an unprecedented rollback that threatens to unravel decades of bipartisan progress in the fight against HIV. These aren’t abstract numbers. They are direct hits to the infrastructure that helps people stay healthy, stay housed, and stay alive.
Among the most dangerous proposals are the complete elimination of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Division of HIV Prevention (nearly $800 million in funding) and the zeroing out of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS, the only federal housing program specifically serving people living with HIV. These cuts would gut the very programs that keep HIV transmission rates low, provide outreach and education, and ensure that those living with HIV have access to stable housing. The Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program is also under attack, particularly part F, which funds dental care, clinician training centers, and the Minority AIDS Initiative.
These proposals are not just cruel but shortsighted. HIV remains a serious public health issue, with approximately 32,000 new diagnoses each year in the United States. In New Jersey alone, more than 39,000 people are living with HIV. At Hyacinth, we serve thousands of them every year across seven cities, including Newark, Trenton, Plainfield, and New Brunswick. The majority of our clients are Black and Latino, LGBTQ+, and low-income — communities that already face systemic barriers to health care and housing. For these New Jerseyans, federal programs are lifelines.
Our state has made real progress. Between 2018 and 2022, HIV incidence in New Jersey dropped by 12%. That progress was not automatic. It was the result of sustained investments in prevention, outreach, and support. It was the result of Medicaid expansion, which now covers nearly half of Americans living with HIV. It was the result of the Ending the HIV Epidemic initiative and the dedicated community-based organizations that make federal dollars go further through testing, education, case management, and advocacy.
But now, Medicaid has become a target marker and is actively being threatened by proposals to impose work requirements or limit eligibility. At the same time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s most recent estimates show that 2.2 million Americans could benefit from PrEP, the daily pill that prevents HIV infection. Yet this budget does nothing to expand access. That’s not just bad health policy — it is fiscally irresponsible. Every prevented infection saves hundreds of thousands of dollars in future treatment costs.
This budget represents a broader pattern of federal disinvestment in public health, and in the HIV community in particular. It turns back the clock on decades of work — work that advocates, health care providers, and people living with HIV have done to demand dignity, equity, and care. Earlier this year, Hyacinth staff joined more than 600 advocates in Washington, D.C., for AIDSWatch 2025. We met with members of Congress to share stories from the frontlines and make clear that our communities cannot afford to go backward.
The Trump administration’s budget proposal sends a dangerous message: that the lives and health of people living with HIV — many of them Black, brown, queer, and poor — are expendable. We know better. We’ve seen what progress looks like when we invest in people’s futures, and we’ve seen the devastating consequences of doing the opposite.
We hope Congress will reaffirm our national commitment to ending the HIV epidemic in New Jersey and across the country.

Maryland's Department of Natural Resources is planning to cut patches of trees along the trail, stirring resistance from local conservationists. (Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)Driving down Route 113 between Snow Hill and Pocomoke City, the trailhead for the Blue Bike Trail is easy to miss.
There aren’t any signs or hiking blazes, but nestled in the woods is a grassy parking area, and the beginning of a 0.7-mile walking trail in the Pocomoke State Forest.
The trail may be short in length and unassuming from the roadside, but a commercial logging plan proposed by Maryland’s Department of Natural Resources has brought the lesser-known trail into the limelight.
The department plans to cut patches of trees from a 45-acre tract beside the trail. But a group of naturalists, birders and other community members are fighting the plan, arguing that the tract represents a rare mature forest on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, with a host of benefits to people and wildlife.
As Joan Maloof, a Berlin-based conservationist who founded the nonprofit Old Growth Forest Network, studied the plan for 2025, the land in Pocomoke State Forest stood out.
“This particular one: It’s 97 years old, and it sounds like it has some big trees, mixed species,” she thought to herself. “I want to go check it out.”
The plot was established in 1927, though DNR says the trees are varying ages. Some were planted after clearing. Some grew naturally. But walking through the forest, Maloof saw something unique.
“I go check it out, and I realize: ‘Oh, my God, this is such a beautiful forest, and it’s right on a recreational trail,’” said Maloof, who is also an emeritus professor of environmental studies and biology at Salisbury University.
Maloof spearheaded an effort to send comments to DNR, pushing for two areas, totaling about 69 acres, to be removed from the logging plan, which designated some 1,700 acres for cutting and thinning.

The state issues logging plans each year for its state forest acreage. And with any cut, the department strives for balance, including between the needs of the ecosystem and the desire to support the local logging industry, said State Forester Anne Hairston-Strang. The department believes the cut in Pocomoke achieves that balance, she said.
“We want to save the bay. We keep a lot of our land rural,” Hairston-Strang said. “Want to keep our land rural? We need a viable rural economy, and so [there’s] this balance between our ecology, the social impacts for jobs and the economic impacts, where we’re using, what the land grows.”
The pushback about the Blue Bike Trail seems to have caught the state’s attention. The area is still on DNR’s list to be logged this year, but the state is slow-walking the cut.
“We’re not rushing into any harvest,” Hairston-Strang said. “We’re going to talk to people. If it needs to go through the work plan process again, it can. We’re not rolling any machines in.”
At the very beginning of the Blue Bike Trail, rows and rows of thin, and therefore relatively unremarkable, loblolly pines dominate the landscape on either side.
But then, the forest transforms into something altogether different. Thicker trees begin to crop up beside the trail: oaks, sassafras, beeches and more.
That’s about where hikers see the first strand of pink tape encircling a tree trunk, delineating the beginning of the proposed logging area.
“I immediately recognized that it was a special tract of forest,” said Bronwyn Betz, a Berlin resident who is also opposed to the cut. “And I know from hiking around here that sometimes that’s not the case. Sometimes you get a lot of pine, and it’s just not as ecologically valuable.”
DNR notes that the Pocomoke State Forest includes several designated “Old Growth Ecosystem Management Areas,” totaling 4,623 acres. In those places, DNR is aiming to nurture the forest and avoid cutting, with the goal of eventually bringing the tracts into “old growth” status. Five additional acres of the state forest are already considered old-growth.
The area proposed for cutting, which DNR calls the “Tarr tract,” is not in either of those designated areas, Hairston-Strang said.
“We don’t want to just provide mature habitat. We have a big commitment to it. We like our old growth. We like our big trees,” Hairston-Strang said. “We’re just looking to provide some of the other end of the age spectrum, too, because we really are seeing habitat declines.”

A goal behind the cut is stimulating the growth of the understory, Hairston-Strang said, growing an additional habitat type in the Pocomoke forest. That’s part of the reason why DNR selected patches of the Tarr tract for cutting.
“If we just select a tree here and there, you’re probably not going to generate the kind of light levels that will really cause that understory response,” she said. “Some people will walk up to this and say, ‘Oh, it’s a clear-cut.’ And they don’t see the careful retention of some individual trees.”
Even if it is not a clear-cut, Maloof argues that the tree removal will do too much harm to the overall ecosystem — and to the public’s enjoyment of it.
“That’s not good enough. We want you to just not. It’s only 45 acres,” Maloof said. “Please listen to the people.”
She fears that DNR ceded too much to the logging industry, which may have sought to log more of the thicker trees, as opposed to the thinner loblolly pines.
DNR argues that it follows best practices for cuts. Maryland State Forests are also certified as sustainably managed through Forest Stewardship Council and Sustainable Forestry Initiative, Hairston-Strang said.
“We pay for people to come out and criticize us every year, and we do both office and field audits, so they’re out in the field and looking at sites,” Hairston-Strang said.
The department is hoping creating clearings in the forest could also attract more deer and turkeys, since the area is a hunting location that allows disabled hunters to shoot from their vehicles using the trail, Hairston-Strang said. And that it will reduce fuel for potential wildfires.
Dave Wilson, an Eastern Shore birder who also serves on Maryland’s Critical Area Commission for the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays, said he’s walked the trail since the 1990s.
“It was always really good for forest interior-dwelling species — songbirds that require large contiguous areas of woods,” said Wilson, who recently sold his 30-year-old birding trip company called Delmarva Birding Weekend.
That includes black-and-white warblers, scarlet tanagers, prothonotary warblers and more, Wilson said. But he’s also spotted other species, such as red-shouldered hawks and Eastern screech owls. He worries that if patches of trees are removed from the area, destroying certain nesting habitats, many of the beloved bird species wouldn’t return.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Wilson said that he considers the Tarr tract one of the few pieces of state-managed land on the Lower Shore that presents a good opportunity for birding.
“Most of what they manage, they just cut every 30 or 40 years for loblolly pine monoculture, and there’s really nothing living in there,” Wilson said. “It’s like a cornfield from a biodiversity standpoint, and there’s thousands of acres of that. And one of the reasons we’re up in arms about this — is because we feel like that needs to change.”
Betz said the Pocomoke State Forest is something of a “hidden gem,” compared to the more well-known Ocean City-adjacent hiking trails, such as those on Assateague Island, which hosts both state park and national park land.
She first visited the trail after it appeared on the logging plan, and quickly decided it was worth fighting for. Bright white mountain laurels bloomed among a diverse array of trees, creating a rare environment.
“I know they say they’re going to selectively cut, but when you have these beautiful mountain laurel shrubs and different things — damage is going to happen to things, no matter what they say,” Betz said.
She brought a group of young 4-H students to the trail, and a few of the students penned letters pushing back against the cut, she said.
“Many of us have grown up camping, hiking and biking in these woods. We do not want this beautiful trail to be logged,” wrote her 15-year-old son, Ewan. “There are many species that will lose their homes if this plan is not stopped.”
Betz said she hopes that DNR will not only opt against cutting along the trail, but put up signage along the roadside, so that the trail gets more use from local residents and visitors alike.
“I had a hard time finding it — and then I had a hard time finding it a second time,” she said.
Betz said she understands the desire to uplift local logging companies and mills. But the trail also has an economic value as-is, thanks to the ecotourism it’s capable of attracting — and already attracts, she said.
“You really can’t put a dollar amount on it,” Betz said. “It actually probably brings in way more money than people would think.”

(Courtesy of the Yellowstone Caldera Chronicles)Yellowstone National Park has over 1,000 miles of trails and nearly 300 designated backcountry campsites, allowing people to venture beyond the main roads and boardwalks. The Yellowstone backcountry includes amazing forests, grasslands, mountains, rivers, waterfalls, thermal areas, and good opportunities to view wildlife.
For those venturing into the backcountry for more than a day, a clean and safe water supply is an important consideration. Water chemists who work in Yellowstone are often asked if the water in the backcountry is safe to drink. Let’s break down three broad water types in Yellowstone so that backcountry hikers and campers can make the best decision when choosing a water source.

Thermal water should not be used as drinking water. First, off-trail travel in thermal areas is prohibited, and the ground in thermal areas is often dangerous to traverse.
In addition, thermal waters can have microorganisms that are known to be harmful, such as Naegleria (a brain-eating amoeba), and can contain elevated concentrations of arsenic and fluoride. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s maximum contaminant level for arsenic is 0.010 mg/L, and for fluoride is 4.0 mg/L. The arsenic concentration in Yellowstone thermal waters is often 1 mg/L, but concentrations as high as 17 mg/L have measured — that’s about 2,000 times higher than the maximum contaminant level.
In addition, fluoride as high as 57 mg/L has been measured in Yellowstone thermal waters. Other nasty chemical constituents that are known to be elevated and may cause adverse health effects include antimony and mercury.
So for a lot of reasons, stay away from thermal water. It is not good for your health.
Non-thermal waters from rivers and creeks in Yellowstone are typically derived from snow and rain and are well suited for drinking after onsite treatment. Cool non-thermal waters may contain microorganisms such as E. Coli or parasites such as Giardia that should be removed by filtration or sterilized by chlorination, iodination, or boiling before drinking. There are many miles of non-thermal rivers and creeks in Yellowstone.
But what about discharge from thermal features that flows into pristine rivers and creeks, creating mixed waters?
Chemical investigations indicate that most material contributed by thermal runoff tends to remain dissolved in solution when mixed with river water and is readily transported downstream. Because of dilution, the concentrations of the nasty chemical components, including arsenic and fluoride, are often substantially less than the thermal waters.
But in some cases the concentration of arsenic and fluoride in mixed waters, especially just downstream from thermal areas, can still exceed the maximum contaminant level set by the EPA. Most backpacking filtration systems will readily remove particulates, including microorganisms, but they may not remove chemical components like arsenic and fluoride. Boiling kills microorganisms but would not lower arsenic and fluoride concentrations.
Fortunately, over 140 years of study of water in Yellowstone provide an indication of where mixed waters may be hazardous. As you might expect, it’s mostly in the vicinity of the park’s major geyser basins — especially those along the Firehole and Gibbon rivers.
  This is a Map of Yellowstone National Park lakes, rivers, and streams, with colors indicating the amount of arsenic in the water. The Maximum Contaminant Level defined by the Environmental Protection Agency for arsenic in drinking water is 10 micrograms per liter (µg/L). In the vicinity of major geyser basins, especially on the Firehole and Madison Rivers, arsenic levels far exceed the MCL (orange and purple areas on map). (Map courtesy of the Yellowstone Caldera Chronicles)
In most Yellowstone backcountry areas, there several options for obtaining safe drinking water. When looking to top off your supply, ask yourself “where does the water come from and is there is a thermal area upstream?” Whenever possible, choose a river or stream without thermal waters draining into it.
Enjoy the Yellowstone backcountry, and stay safe!

(Photo courtesy of Fair Share America)Over the next three weeks, a band of advocates in a bright green bus is traveling across the U.S. with a message aimed at members of Congress — and at the voters who live in their districts.
To the voters, the message is that they will be hurt by the Republican mega-bill taking shape in Washington — a bill that would extend tax cuts enacted in 2017 that primarily benefit the wealthy and pay for them by slashing Medicaid and other federal programs that critics of the measure argue broadly benefit the public.
To U.S. senators and representatives, the message is: Vote against the measure, or face the wrath of voters in 2026.
The bus trip was launched by  Fair Share America, a coalition of groups focused on  beating back attempts to extend the 2017 tax cuts, one of the signature pieces of legislation from President Donald Trump’s first term. The organization is made up of unions, organizations favoring progressive taxation, and progressive social justice and policy groups.

Fair Share America’s executive director is Kristen Crowell, who lives in Cedarburg, Wisconsin. In 2022 she helped lead a campaign in Massachusetts when voters approved a constitutional amendment that created a 4% surtax on earned income over $1 million.
“That increase is now generating $3 billion annually that is dedicated for education and transportation,” Crowell told the Wisconsin Examiner.
The Boston Globe reported that the campaign to pass the Massachusetts “millionaires’ tax” raised $27 million, nearly twice as much as the $14 million raised by business-backed opponents of the measure. Crowell said the campaign succeeded by appealing to voters on the issue of fairness.
“We know that when we ask the wealthy to pay a little bit more, to pay their fair share, we can fund the investments that our neighbors and families and communities deserve — and really importantly, right now in this moment, they need in order to to get ahead,” Crowell said in an interview.
Opposition group launched in 2024
The 2017 tax cuts expire at the end of this year. With that date on the calendar, Fair Share America launched in September 2024 to oppose renewing them.
“We started organizing before we knew the outcome of the election and were handed a different reality than we might have hoped for,” Crowell said.
Since then, the organization has helped “lead the pushback at the state level to make sure that constituents and the public understand what’s happening behind closed doors in Washington, D.C., and to really bring the fight to key districts and geographies across the country where lawmakers, in particular the GOP members of Congress, have shut out their constituents,” she said.
The bus trip started on Saturday in Peekskill, N.Y., stopped in Philadelphia on Sunday and will hit four more cities across Pennsylvania on Monday. Stops in Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Iowa follow. After that, the bus will double back on its route for three Wisconsin stops, in Racine and Oshkosh on Monday, June 30, and La Crosse on July 1.

The schedule will continue through the middle of July, stopping in Minnesota, Missouri, Colorado, Arizona and Nevada before concluding in Bakersfield, California on July 14.
The tour isn’t the start of the organization’s campaign. Fair Share America and its partners with other advocacy groups have been holding town hall meetings in 33 states across the country, Crowell said — including one in Racine in April that featured former Social Security commissioner Martin O’Malley.
Crowell was at the Racine event, to which the local member of Congress, U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil (R-Janesville) was invited but didn’t show up. “Over 200 people came [from] across the political spectrum.” Crowell said.
At that town hall and other such events across the country, she’s seen energetic opposition to the new Trump administration as well as the priorities of the current Congress, she said.
“Fair Share America’s not speaking to one side of the aisle vs. the other,” Crowell said. “This is a populist moment.”
Public opposition to budget bill
A poll on behalf of three of the coalition’s member groups found that even before they were given information about details of the GOP budget reconciliation bill, the American voters surveyed had a negative opinion of it.
According to the pollsters 38% of those surveyed said they support the bill, 46% said they oppose it and 16% said they don’t know enough to have an opinion.
Fewer than one-third of voters surveyed — 30% — have heard a lot about the bill. Another 40% have heard “just some” about it, and the remaining 30% said they’ve heard little or nothing about the measure.
The more people heard, however, the less they liked it, according to the report from the polling firm, Hart Research. Opposition increased among all groups after pollsters told people about various details — its changes to Medicaid and to SNAP federal nutrition aid, for example.
“By being in the rooms and town halls and knocking on doors here in Wisconsin, that is what we are hearing and seeing,” Crowell said.
With its slogan, “Stop the billionaire giveaway,” Fair Share America’s bus tour aims to amplify the bill’s cuts to programs that benefit the public and to center the message that its tax cuts favor the wealthy.
Congressional Republicans “have not engaged with their constituents” in Wisconsin and elsewhere about the reconciliation bill, Crowell said. Fair Share America’s goal is to break down the details in terms that people will understand and respond to.
“When you tell them what’s at stake, what’s coming down, they are furious and they want to know how to get in the fight,” Crowell said. “They want to know how to organize their three or four neighbors. So it is incumbent on all of us to shed light on the horrors of this reconciliation bill and do everything it takes to get the word out.”
Funding values and priorities
In Wisconsin, Republican Sen. Ron Johnson has said he opposes the bill and has threatened to vote against it, criticizing it for not making deeper federal spending cuts. 
While that’s the opposite of Fair Share America’s agenda, “voting ‘No’ is voting ‘No’ at the end of the day,” Crowell said.
She is skeptical that Johnson will follow through on his threat, however.
“When push comes to shove, I don’t think Sen. Johnson is going to cross the White House or cross GOP leadership. I expect him to fall in line,” she said. “But we’re here to push back and say, ‘Absolutely not. We will hold you to that No vote and we do want you to understand what the stakes are for your constituents.’”
While the campaign’s goal is to stop the bill, there’s a second message regardless of the outcome, Crowell said.
“We are building a movement that is strong and durable and it crosses partisan lines,” she said. “If they in fact do go ahead and pass this, there will be hell to pay for those members who abandoned  and threw their constituents and their communities under the bus.”
Crowell said her more than two decades of activism started when, as a working mother, she opposed Milwaukee public school budget cuts. Her daughter, who was in kindergarten then, is now 29.
She went on to organize with “We Are Wisconsin,” the grass-roots coalition that sprang up in reaction to Act 10 — the 2011 law stripping most collective bargaining rights from most public employees, introduced and signed by Scott Walker in his first term as governor.
Act 10 was billed as a “budget repair bill.” Crowell said that working against it she saw clearly the connection between government budgets and policy.
“If progressives want to really win … and fund the things that we care about, we have to compete for what happens in the budget process,” Crowell said. “We have to compete for a fair and just tax code. We have to compete for the revenue that funds all of the issues that we care about, whether that’s health care or climate or education or child care.”
A budget “can be used either to fund our priorities and reflect our values or attack the things that we deeply care about,” Crowell said. With the federal budget reconciliation bill, “we’re watching the GOP members of Congress do exactly that — looking to further harm our communities through advancing this budget.”

More than $2 billion were wagered last year at gambling establishments in the Equality State. Now, politicians are talking about tax hikes and experts are studying the implications of gambling’s rise.
The post Politicians, experts try to keep up with gambling’s meteoric rise in Wyoming appeared first on WyoFile .","On Tuesday afternoon, 13 horses started their run at a racetrack outside Valparaiso, Chile, hooves pounding the dirt on what in that hemisphere was a 52-degree winter day. 
Some 5,500 miles to the north, a WyoFile reporter making his first bet on a horse race sat within the cool interior of a former diner in Laramie, watching the horses run on television. He hit on a $10 bet on a horse named Viene Puelche, named after a warm Chilean wind. After collecting from the teller, he walked into the heat of the Wyoming summer $6 richer. 
In the grand sums of money changing hands in Wyoming’s horse-race betting industry, the paltry bet was a snowflake in a blizzard. 
In 2024, the total “handle,” or sum of bets placed in the state’s burgeoning horse-based gambling industry, was more than $2.1 billion, according to a report compiled by the Wyoming Legislative Service Office. Each Wyoming adult would have had to bet more than $4,500 that year, if the gambling load was distributed equally and not swelled by tourists. 
And it’s a figure that has ballooned over the last decade. In 2013, the first year machine gambling based on horse races was legalized, the industry’s total handle was just $8.3 million. 
That growth has come with a proliferation of gaming facilities, like the converted diner in Laramie, in most Wyoming towns. And it’s increasingly drawn the attention of state legislators, who after years of letting the industry largely grow under its own momentum, this month decided to draft legislation that would increase its tax burden and strengthen regulatory authority for local government officials, who say they’ve been handicapped in controlling the growth of gambling within city limits. 
Local elected officials around the state are fielding growing complaints from their constituents, Dr. Mark Rinne, the president of Cheyenne’s city council, told WyoFile. His city, in particular, has seen heavy growth of gambling facilities, but Rinne said the Legislature left the city council little ability to weigh in on where they can and can’t be established. 
“We’re the ones getting the grief, but we had no input in the decision,” Rinne said, adding that his constituents have asked, “‘Don’t we have enough of these?’” 
Also lurking beneath the industry’s growth is an uncertain impact on the financial well-being of people and communities. Over two legislative committee meetings this past month, testimony from gaming industry regulators and questions from lawmakers made clear the state does not have a clear grasp on whether problem gambling was sharply on the rise, alongside the proliferation of gaming machines. There was some evidence to believe that it remains low, officials from the gaming commission said.

The state has a program that allows people to ban themselves from online sports betting, or horse-based betting, if they feel they’re out of control. Since that program began in 2021, 20 Wyomingites have exercised that option, Sara Beth Lyon, the Wyoming Gaming Commission’s responsible gaming liaison, told WyoFile. 
But, she said, it’s clear that doesn’t really capture the problem. “It’s not the best metric,” Lyons said, but “it is what we have right now.” The gaming commission is launching a study this summer to both try and assess whether gambling addictions are on the rise, and study the best ways for Wyoming to treat them, she said. 
Another, albeit anecdotal, marker comes from Adelaide Wilson in Buffalo, the head of the Wyoming chapter of the National Council on Problem Gambling. The group is a nonprofit that receives some funding from the industry — mainly through sports betting giant Fanduel — but otherwise seeks money from donors and government programs.
She didn’t have data on how many calls to her office, or Wyoming’s other self-help lines for mental health and addiction issues writ large, have increased, she said. But based on Wilson’s voicemail inbox, it feels like problem gambling in Wyoming is on the rise, she said. 
In the last few days, someone had called to say he’d confessed his damaging gambling habits to his wife and was now looking for help, Wilson told WyoFile on Friday. Another person called to say they’d learned their spouse had lost $40,000 betting over a recent weekend — it wasn’t clear on what — and they didn’t know what to do.
“Those calls are increasing,” she said. “The reality is where there is gambling, there is going to be a problem at some point.” 
Wilson’s group stays neutral on whether gambling should be legal, she said. National studies suggest the majority of people play without developing a problem, and also attribute more problem gambling to the proliferation of online sports betting than machine gaming. 
But one frightening statistic for Wyoming, which has grappled for years with a high suicide rate, is the link between gambling addiction and people taking their lives. Around 7% to 30% of people in treatment for gambling addictions have made suicide attempts, according to the National Institute of Health. “Suicidality … appears to increase alongside the severity of gambling related problems,” the NIH website reads. 
Industry officials say they’re committed to combating gambling addiction in the state. The biggest existing program for raising awareness of resources for problem gamblers, for example, is likely one funded by the Wyoming Lottery, through a portion of its unclaimed prize money.
Live races and slot machines that aren’t 
What’s driving betting’s rocket-like growth trend in Wyoming isn’t live horse races in Chile, or those at three tracks in Wyoming that draw in, alongside gamblers, equine enthusiasts and citizens looking for a fun weekend activity. 
It’s the gambling machines that support those races. 
On Tuesday, the handful of before-noon gamblers inside the converted diner weren’t watching the television screens. Instead, they were seated in front of the glowing, pleasantly chiming screens of what look distinctly like modern-day Las Vegas slot machines. But under Wyoming law, it’s not quite a slot machine. It is, instead, a terminal for placing a bet on a historic horse race.  
That distinction can be difficult to make out. Put money into the machine, press the button, and a reel of images rotates until they align into a winning combination. Just like a slot machine. The result, however, is not random. Instead, it’s dictated by the results of a real horse race run sometime in the past. Gamblers can handicap the games based on anonymized stats about the horses and jockeys, according to industry officials.

On some machines, however, the handicapping option is more complicated than on others. On a machine in Laramie reviewed by a WyoFile reporter, for example, the player had to toggle between screens and evaluate those stats to pick winners for 10 races. He had to do so before a two-minute timer ran out. Far simpler to just hit the button and spin the wheel.  
Of the roughly $2.1 billion handle in 2024, only $6.6 million was bet on live horse races, whether at Wyoming’s tracks or on the races broadcast from tracks around the world, according to the Wyoming Gaming Commission’s annual report. The rest of the money circulated in the 2,939 historic horse racing machines located in 45 off-track betting facilities around the state. As the numbers imply, some of those gambling locations hold large numbers of machines, and inside they look like a small casino floor. Larger facilities can look like a casino from the outside, too, at least according to photographs on the website for the big Horse Palace Swan Ranch facility, near the Colorado border in Laramie County.
“The historic horse racing industry props up and allows live horse racing to exist,” University of Wyoming economics professor Alex Sprecht told WyoFile. “It’s helped bring horse breeders, trainers and others in the industry to Wyoming who may not have come otherwise.”  
In 2018, two Wyoming horse racing companies commissioned an economic impact study that suggested the industry had brought 454 jobs — both direct employment and through economic ripple effects — to the Equality State. 
For decades, there have been three tracks in Wyoming, near Evanston, Rock Springs and Gillette. But for a long time before historic horse racing was legal, those tracks were somewhat listless. There were no races run in 2010, and just four days of racing in both 2011 and 2012, according to the LSO’s memo. With revenues from the gaming machines, race operators have invested in the facilities, increased the prize purses and revved the sport into a much higher gear. 
This summer, the state will see 54 days of live racing, if all go off as scheduled. Energy Downs in Gillette runs races on weekends from mid-May through the end of June. When that track wraps up, Wyoming Downs outside Evanston takes over, running races into mid-August. Sweetwater Downs, outside Rock Springs, then holds races until the end of September. 
Wyoming will soon host a fourth race track. A much-hyped new facility outside Cheyenne, Thunder Plains, is nearing completion. 
The Legislature legalized historic horse racing with the intention of propping up the state’s horse-breeding and racing industry. That’s been successful. The question lawmakers are grappling with now, as local officials begin to raise concerns about machine gambling facilities proliferating rapidly and widely, is how far they should let the industry go. 
“Horse racing is getting better and better, purses are going up, dollars are going up, everything is going up,” Sen. Mike Gierau, a Jackson Democrat, said at the Legislature’s Capital Financing Committee on June 12. “But what also is happening is we’re getting machines everywhere in our communities.”
That committee voted to draft bills that would double the tax on companies collecting online sports bets from Wyomingites, from 10% to 20%. Wyoming’s tax is lower than that of many states today. Separately, the committee also voted to draft a bill to add another 1% tax to the total handle of historic and live horse racing — that $2.1 billion figure. Today, the state collects 1.5% of that handle — while operators are also required to pay another 0.4% into a fund to boost the state’s racehorse breeders. 
Most of that tax goes to local governments, with the money remaining over a certain amount directed into the state’s savings accounts. In 2024, the state pocketed more than $5.2 million. Cities and towns received nearly $10 million and counties a little more than $11 million.  

A screenshot of a map presented to lawmakers by the Wyoming Gaming Commission shows which counties’ voters have legalized “pari-mutuel wagering,” a category of gambling that captures both betting on live horse races and the historic horse racing machines. (screenshot Wyoming Gaming Commission presentation)
Lawmakers on the committee voted to raise the state’s tax rate to 2.5%. A representative for one of the companies behind horse-based gambling’s rise in Wyoming spoke against the measure in the committee, and the industry’s resistance is likely to grow.
Though Wyoming’s Legislature is famously tax-adverse, and perhaps more so now than at any moment in recent memory, increasing taxes on gambling companies could generate interesting discussion, the economist Sprecht said. Many gamblers are likely visitors to the state, he said, though it’s not clear how many. And plenty of Wyomingites aren’t gambling. 
“The tax isn’t going to impact a large portion of Wyoming taxpayers, which is going to make it more politically attractive than a property or sales tax,” Sprecht said. Wyoming lawmakers are doing what state politicians do from time to time, he said — which is to allow an industry to grow with low regulatory and tax burdens, but then squeeze it for revenue once companies have established themselves and made investments. 
“I think the state of Wyoming has been quite generous to the players in this space,” the finance committee’s Senate chairwoman, Cheyenne Republican Tara Nethercott, said before the votes to introduce tax increases. 
Lawmakers on the Select Committee on Capital Finance and Investments discussed earmarking funds from increased taxes on gambling for highway maintenance, as well as substance abuse and mental health treatment — including gambling addiction. 
Who is gambling, and at what cost to themselves?
Because it’s the state’s largest city, or because of its proximity to the Colorado front range, Cheyenne is emerging as a hotbed of gambling’s growth in Wyoming. The capital city’s coffers have benefited from that activity — Cheyenne collected $1.8 million in revenue from historic horse racing in 2023, and Laramie County collected $2.36 million. That year, the county saw around $416 million in betting on historic horse racing, according to a study by the Wyoming Institute of Population Health, a public health division of Cheyenne Regional Medical Center. 
The study sought to get a sense of whether that revenue was coming at a cost to people’s lives and well-being.
The public health study found that gambling is widespread in Laramie County — around 43% of survey respondents said they participate in the growing gaming industry. Researchers did not survey the extent to which problematic gambling was growing or not in Laramie County alongside the number of historic horse racing machines. Instead, they applied national studies on the prevalence of gambling to the county’s population. 
That data suggests around 12% of gamblers are problem gamblers to some degree. The problems are most prevalent among young adults ages 18-29, and online betting is proving more problematic than in-person gambling on machines. 
In Laramie County, such gambling venues were “disproportionately concentrated in lower-income neighborhoods,” the study found. That appears consistent with the socioeconomic realities of problem gambling, the problem-gambling council’s Wilson said. 
Those who can least afford to lose are often those most enraptured by the possibility of winning, she said. For people on the financial edge already, it appears that “if they get that big win, it will solve their problems,” she said.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)As tornado warnings popped up across the Oklahoma City metropolitan area during rush hour earlier this month, it became abundantly clear that somebody didn’t know – or didn’t care – that it was smack dab in the middle of tornado season across much of the central and southern United States.
Because why else would federal officials choose a peak period for tornado outbreaks to perform routine and needed maintenance on weather radios?
In case you don’t have one, weather radios live in tens of thousands of Oklahomans’ homes and can be programmed to alert them to imminent severe weather threats. The devices typically are battery operated or have access to backup power, and they are connected to a broadcast network that receives updates directly from the National Weather Service.
My weather radio lives in my bedroom and is programmed to send a piercing alarm whenever there’s a tornado warning in Oklahoma County. The last time it went off, it was the middle of the night and I was sound asleep. It scared the bejesus out of me, but it was my first inkling that an area of circulation had suddenly cropped up and was bearing down on my home, and I needed to move to a safe spot.
In winter months, the radios collect dust, but in a state that sits firmly within Tornado Alley, during the spring and early summer months the radios are lifesavers.
That’s why it was so appalling to learn that at National Weather Service headquarters, who apparently lives in a weather-free bubble, decided that early June was the appropriate time to perform “mandated” computer upgrades affecting the operation of weather radios across large portions of Oklahoma and North Texas. 
To add insult to injury, these updates were scheduled to last three days but wrapped up a day later than planned.
As far as I’m aware, the federal government didn’t disclose until the day before that their planned upgrades would knock a critical lifeline out of commission for four days. The National Weather Service in Norman, which was one of 20 offices across the country affected by the planned outage, serves places like Wichita Falls, Texas, and Stillwater, Ponca City, Enid, Lawton, Ardmore, Chickasha, Altus and Woodward.
And of course, it didn’t take more than a day after the announcement for Murphy’s Law to kick in full force, when Mother Nature decided to unleash holy hell upon us mere mortals.
All four days, we faced a barrage of severe weather. Tornadoes dropped from the sky. Winds whipped. And thunder roared. A June 3 storm dropped two tornadoes and brought severe thunderstorm and flood warnings.
Luckily for us all, that particular day’s severe weather happened in daylight when Oklahomans were awake and alert.
After the first storms, the National Weather Service in Norman said the weather radios seemed to work for the “bulk” of the severe weather, and they didn’t receive any complaints. But I’d be willing to bet that’s because most Oklahomans still didn’t know their weather radios were inoperable. 
The Friday after maintenance was supposed to be completed, someone told me their weather radio didn’t sound a warning. Other people told me they didn’t even know their radio wasn’t operational. Another reached out to ask why officials weren’t making these upgrades in August or November when our state is generally not amid tornado season.
Historically, the first week of June has been dangerous, according to the interesting recaps on the National Weather Service Norman’s website. On June 3, 1993, CD-sized hail fell through the roofs of schools and homes. In Blackwell, over 1,000 windows were destroyed. The storm also caused $70 million in damage to farmers’ wheat crops. 
On June 4, 1973, there were eight recorded tornadoes. On June 5, 1991, thunderstorms dumped up to 7 inches of rain in Osage County, forcing evacuations. And on June 6, 1994, a tornado crossed Interstate 40, overturning cars, tractor-trailers and injuring two motorists.
The fact that nobody died this year due to this abhorrent planning is a miracle.
But this should be a warning for the leaders who apparently make decisions in a vacuum about how important it is to appropriately schedule technology updates and actually examine historical weather trends before making critical decisions like this. 
Because this latest decision doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence that people sitting in the National Weather Service’s headquarters in Maryland know what they’re doing or care about the safety of millions of people.
Oklahomans and those living across the central and southern United States deserve peace of mind that they will always have access to warnings that could save their lives.

Jim Pillen remains confident in his preferred policies to grow Nebraska and cut costs, even as the speaker of the Legislature has again identified the state budget as the “biggest challenge” for 2026.
Many of the budget tweaks likely to be pursued in 2026 could respond to changes in federal government funding or state revenue projections, but Pillen said state lawmakers, combined with past policies, will make up the difference.
In a post-session interview with the Nebraska Examiner, he said his cabinet, too, shares his business mentality to improve services while decreasing costs, and he remains committed that state government must be run differently.
“Feel real good about where we sit and that as long as people don’t start thinking there’s money to spend, we’ll be in real good shape,” Pillen said.
Federal changes possible
The state is projected to end the next two fiscal years, beginning July 1 and ending June 30, 2027, with a positive balance of $4.15 million, which includes a built-in spending cushion. That comes after the Legislature approved sweeping nearly $300 million dollars in cash funds or interest from state agencies and $152 million from the state’s rainy day fund to close a more than half-billion-dollar deficit.
The state plans to spend about $5.5 billion a year in general funds over the next two years, which is more than the state expects to collect in tax revenues in either year.

Much of the looming 2026 conversation also could revolve around fiscal projections for the two fiscal years after, those beginning July 1, 2027, and ending June 30, 2029. Current projections show the budget’s structural imbalance growing by the end into a hole of $129.1 million.
Arch encouraged state lawmakers on the last day of the 2025 legislative session to consider budget dynamics ahead of the 2026 session. He suggested watching for possible congressional changes that could shift more costs to the state, and for the next state revenue forecast in October from the Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board.
Pillen said he was pleased that President Donald Trump approved a federal disaster declaration for Nebraska’s March blizzard for more than $64 million, while other states were denied. Pillen said if costs for SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) benefits or Medicaid are shifted to Nebraska, the state is prepared to find “wasteful” state spending to balance its budget.
He also said that in the case of more SNAP responsibilities falling back on Nebraska, the program would be run more as Nebraska wants the program to be run, not how the federal government wants it.
“We’re prepared if we don’t get more money from the federal government,” Pillen said. “That’s our job. That’s what we have to be ready for.”
Nebraska passes $11 billion two-year budget, closes major projected deficit for now

‘Sleight of hands’
State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha has described the two-year budget lawmakers just passed as “based on a number of sleight of hands.” She said it “is not actually balanced. We’re just making it look like it’s balanced.”
DeBoer compared the dynamics to the fairy tale “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” where the ruler is naked but his subjects pretend he is wearing extravagant clothing.
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, on the other hand, suggested lawmakers should have considered deeper spending reductions and agency cash fund sweeps to prepare for possible federal cuts.
“It’s not about tightening our belt, as it is, we might be having to lop off limbs in order to help pay for our budget,” Hansen said of possible future budget years.
‘Run a government like a business’
Pillen said the state’s “very robust economy” means he won’t “speculate” on the out-year projections, which he noted are based on conservative revenue projections. He said the state’s pro-business policies should result in growth for the state and make a difference.
  State Sen. Wendy DeBoer of Omaha. Jan. 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Fiscal year 2028 is the first year of full implementation of a recent income tax cut for corporations and all Nebraskans making more than $18,000, dropping rates to 3.99%. State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature’s Appropriations Committee, has described that January 2027 implementation date as a “pinch point” for the state budget.
Pillen said 2029 is “a long way out” — it would be halfway through Pillen’s second term in office if he is reelected in November 2026.
“If you’re talking $129 million in the great big scheme, that’s a really small percentage, I think it’ll be made up,” Pillen said. “If it’s not, obviously, we know how to run a government like a business. If there’s other sources, other things we need to do to not spend money, we’ll be able to do it.”

Minidoka National Wildlife Refuge staff will host a native plant station at the event that will enable visitors to learn about the refuge, native plants and how they benefit pollinators, according to a National Park Service press release.

Native plant seeds and planting materials will be available for members of the public to take home and plant in their yards. Visitors will also be able to view interpretive exhibits and learn about the native plants that existed in the area during the Pliocene era three to four million years ago that provided habitat for now-extinct creatures such as the saber-toothed cat, mastodon and ground sloth as well as more familiar animals like horses, beavers and birds, the press release said.

This is the first time that the National Park Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, both agencies of the U.S. Department of the Interior, have collaborated to host a public event at Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument.

“We are excited to work with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to help the public understand the importance of native plants in supporting wildlife, today and pre-historically, and how landscapes, plants, and the wildlife they support have changed over time,” said Michael Irving, chief of interpretation and education for national monument, in the press release.

Native plants that grow near the open water and wetlands at the Minidoka National Wildlife Refuge, located about 12 miles northeast of Rupert, draw wildlife species from miles around, including birds such as geese, loons, and herons, and animals such as mule deer, foxes, and bobcats.

“The Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument preserves one of the world’s richest sites for Pliocene-aged fossils,” the press release said. “The fossils found here represent hundreds of species of plants and animals; some are unlike any species living today, while others are the ancestors of species still found in the Hagerman Valley.”

The National Park Service is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the designation of the Hagerman Fauna Site National Natural Landmark, which was designated in May 1975 in recognition of its internationally significant collection of fossils from the Pliocene era.

To commemorate the anniversary, the park service and the Idaho Museum of Natural History are hosting fossil exploration events at the Thousand Springs Visitor Center from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. July 16 and Aug. 20 and at the Idaho Museum of Natural History, located on the Idaho State University campus at 698 E. Dillon St. in Pocatello, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on July 2 and Aug. 6.

Participants will be able to see and learn about fossils and engage in hands-on activities.

Before traveling to the Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument, visitors are encouraged to check current conditions by viewing the park website at https://www.nps.gov/hafo/index or calling the park Visitor Center at 208-933-4105.

(Photo: John Partipilo)On June 30, the nearly 60,000 names of businesses that received over $1.5 billion in tax refunds last year will disappear from the state’s website. 
These names include some of the state’s largest corporations, such as FedEx and Brown-Forman, the parent company of Jack Daniel’s, as well as those connected to lawmakers, like Lee Company, the HVAC business owned by Gov. Bill Lee’s family.
The public database doesn’t specify the amount a company is set to receive, but provides ranges that top out at $10,000 and above. Transparency advocates have called this inadequate.
“To say something is above $10,000 is not transparent, because it could be $10,500 or $100,000,” said Deborah Fisher, executive director of the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government.
Officials won’t say which companies benefit from $1.2B tax refund. Property records provide a clue.

Lawmakers approved the tax refund and a $4 billion cut after officials from the Lee administration said that the state faced a potential lawsuit over the way it collected the revenue. No lawsuit was filed. 
State Sen. Brent Taylor, a Memphis Republican, said he didn’t file for a refund through his funeral services business, but thought the transparency approved was enough. 
“It was the taxpayer’s money to begin with, they sent it to the government, and the government decided they didn’t need it, so they’re giving it back to the taxpayer,” Taylor said. 
 As part of the legislation, Tennessee published the names for 30 days, after which they will disappear. Below is all the information published in a database created by the Lookout.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s campaign finance watchdog group has requested an investigation into a former state staffer’s secret political action committee to determine whether it involved criminal activity.
Registry of Election Finance Chairman Tom Lawless confirmed the agency formally asked the Williamson County District Attorney’s Office to reactivate a 2020 request for a probe of Cade Cothren, a former aide to one-time House Speaker Glen Casada, and the Faith Family Freedom Fund PAC. The investigation is expected to look at Casada’s possible involvement as well.
Bill Young, executive director of the Bureau of Ethics and Election Finance, said he understands the DA’s Office, headed by Stacey Edmonson, is reviewing the request, which was made in a conference call.
Lawless previously told the Lookout that the investigation should commence now that a trial of Casada and Cothren is complete. They were convicted on nearly 20 charges each in connection with a kickback conspiracy scheme. Sentencing is set for Sept. 12 in federal court.
“The actions need to be open to the public because transparency is absolutely essential,” Lawless said.
The registry board subpoenaed Cothren in January 2022 in connection with an investigation into the Faith Family Freedom Fund PAC, which was accused of illegal coordination with the campaign of state Rep. Todd Warner in his race against incumbent Republican Rep. Rick Tillis, a political foe of Casada. Warner, whose home and office were raided by FBI agents the same day they hit Casada, Cothren and now-former Rep. Robin Smith in January 2021, defeated Tillis in the 2020 Republican primary. Cothren refused to comply with the subpoena.
​​The registry’s decision to subpoena Cothren, Casada and several other people came after a former girlfriend of Cothren’s testified that she formed the political action committee at his request so he could run it secretly. She said Cothren, whom she thought she loved at the time, also told her to ignore calls from the registry.

June 2, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Two years after a motion-filled and filibuster-riddled 2023 session, Nebraska lawmakers in 2025 settled into a new rhythm as stall tactics again dominated legislative debate.
Throughout the 89-day session that concluded June 2, Nebraska lawmakers filed 347 motions, according to legislative records. It’s the second-highest tally for any session except 2023, when a record 1,160 motions were filed throughout the 88-day session. Similar to that year, State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha again filed the most motions.
In 2023, Cavanaugh filed 437 motions (38% of the total filed). In 2025, she filed 80 (23%).

The extent of filibustering also has changed — the procedural effort to extend debate to time limits as set by the speaker of the Legislature. At those limits, 33 votes are required to enact “cloture” to advance legislation, instead of the usual 25.
Since 2023, it has been more routine for legislative opponents to file all three kinds of filibuster motions ahead of debate — to recommit to committee, to bracket (or delay debate) to a set date or indefinitely postpone (or kill a bill). 
Motions to reconsider those motions and various amendments also are common. Introducers have more frequently filed these “kill” motions to their own bills because they get the chance to introduce the motions and speak ahead of opponents trying to stop their proposals from advancing.
A total of 24 measures reached cloture votes in 2025, the second most in a “long” session behind only 2023, which had 58 separate votes held for cloture motions. This year, four bills fell to filibusters, compared to one in 2023.
In 2025, 47 of Nebraska’s 49 lawmakers had a bill reach the governor’s desk, whether on its own or after being folded into various legislative packages, including the budget. The two exceptions: State Sens. Rob Clements of Elmwood and Loren Lippincott of Central City. 
Clements, chair of the Appropriations Committee, played an instrumental role in ushering several budget bills to passage, which ultimately faced no line-item vetoes from Gov. Jim Pillen over a gubernatorial attempt to trim $14.5 million in general fund spending, most of that to the Nebraska Supreme Court. Lippincott also serves on the Appropriations Committee.
The state will end with a final positive budget balance of $4.15 million for the next two fiscal years. Lawmakers started with a projected budget deficit of $432 million in January.
Speaker John Arch of La Vista has already warned senators to pay attention to changing fiscal dynamics, including in Congress, ahead of the 2026 legislative session, which begins Jan. 7.



2025 statistics — from 89 days in session

715 bills introduced, an average 15 per senator. An additional 18 constitutional amendments and six policy-based resolutions introduced.


347 motions filed, about one-fourth (23%) from State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha (80). State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha followed with 29 motions.


Top bill targeted: LB 316, from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha, seeking to ban most consumable hemp and other tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products (22 motions). The runner-up was LB 258, from State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln, seeking to weaken voter-approved minimum wage provisions (17 motions).


Top senator targeted: State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of Omaha (55 motions). The runner-up was State Sen. Bob Hallstrom of Syracuse (33 motions).


24 bills were forced to maximum debate limits, or cloture. Four efforts to end debate failed: moving the state’s allocation of presidential electors to winner-take-all (LB 3), reducing the state’s inheritance tax (LB 468), adding property tax relief by expanding sales taxes (LB 170) and providing clearer regulatory guardrails to medical cannabis (LB 677). Two more bills were pulled before they reached maximum debate, because they likely lacked the 33 votes needed to stop a filibuster — one to legalize online sports betting (LR 20CA) and the other to ban most consumable hemp or THC products (LB 316).


204 bills passed — 177 laws and 27 accompanying appropriations bills. Two bills were vetoed.


One constitutional amendment passed — to ask voters in 2026 whether to extend lawmaker term limits to three four-year terms. They can currently serve up to two full terms (LR 19CA).

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) A court has ordered the cattle and beef marketing company Agridime to pay $103 million in restitution after operating as a Ponzi scheme that cost North Dakota investors an estimated $40 million.
Meanwhile, a North Dakota-led group seeking to buy the company has missed a court-imposed deadline, making the future of the company unclear. 
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced the federal court order against Texas-based Agridime and its co-founders Joshua Link and Jed Wood on June 16. 
Link was ordered to pay more than $815,000 and Wood to pay nearly $1.5 million. 
The agency says Link and Wood received more than $161 million from over 2,000 customers from 2021 to December 2023 in at least 14 states.
Investors were promised high rates of return by investing in cattle that Agridime would later process and sell as beef products to consumers. 
The company used money from new investors to off previous investors, with a court ruling determining Agridime operated as a Ponzi scheme. 
Agridime attracted cattle investors despite red flags

North Dakota officials last year estimated 149 people in the state, many of them ranchers, were owed about $40 million by Agridime. Some ranchers also were owed money for cattle they delivered to Agridimed but were not paid for. 
The order does not name Taylor Bang, a Killdeer, North Dakota, man who earned more than $6 million in commissions as a sales agent for Agridime, according to the North Dakota Securities Department. 
The Securities Department issued a cease and desist order against Bang in December 2023. That is the same month that the Securities and Exchange Commission took control of Agridime as it investigated its operations. 
The company has continued to operate under the control of a court-appointed receiver as American Grazed Beef, taking online orders for frozen meat products.
A group of investors led by Wylie Bice of Killdeer had a plan to purchase the company and use profits to help repay investors. 
But the investor group failed to close the deal by May 14, a date selected by the judge who approved the sale, according to an update from the receiver on the Agridime website. 
The update said there was “an issue with obtaining funding from the closing of another transaction.”
Bice, who lost money in the Ponzi scheme, did not return phone calls seeking comment. 
A court document shows that the investment group in March had provided $150,000 in earnest money to help keep the company going. The investment group provided more money after missing the sale deadline. 
The May 21 status report concludes that the receiver  anticipates seeking approval from the court in the coming weeks to pursue claims against the purchaser. The receiver also will seek “authority to winddown the operations of American Grazed Beef and sell the remaining assets of Agridime.”

Tom Murphy, a rancher from Killdeer who also lost money investing in Agridime, said Friday he still doesn’t know how much of his losses might be covered by court-ordered repayments. 
“It sounds like we might get like 15 cents on the dollar,” Murphy said. 
Link, one of the Agridime cofounders, in a June 1 Facebook post, disputed that the company operated as a Ponzi scheme and accused the federal government of not allowing the company due process.
He maintained the company was still viable when federal authorities stepped in. 
Murphy said he and many neighbors had stopped receiving payments from Agridime by that time. 
He called Link’s comments “grasping as straws.”

(Photo courtesy of AmeriCorps)Over the last couple of months, funding for AmeriCorps and Vista programs has been drastically cut in Idaho and in the rest of the United States. These funding cuts have an immediate impact on the lives of those individuals who relied on AmeriCorps positions to help pay the bills. Beyond the immediate chaos that this defunding has created, eliminating AmeriCorps and Vista will impoverish our communities in many ways, well into the future.
Terminated AmeriCorps grants by Trump, DOGE totaled $1.9M in Idaho

As part of my role as a medical anthropologist at Idaho State University, I was the director of the Hispanic Health Projects between 2000 and 2009. During that time, we had AmeriCorps funding for dozens of students and community members to work on health-related projects in American Falls, Aberdeen and Pocatello in southern Idaho. Our focus at the Hispanic Health Projects was on using community based, participatory research to create locally appropriate and effective health interventions.
So now, 20 years later, what were the effects of AmeriCorps and Vista on the lives of individuals who participated with us at the HHP? From this perspective, one of the greatest advantages that I can see is that AmeriCorps and Vista positions helped students complete their university degrees at ISU.
The 20 hours a week of work done under these programs was focused on learning about community health issues. It paid some of the bills for the students, and it also gave them experience in working with health care professionals in the communities where they lived. Students going through the Hispanic Health Projects went on to become community members who continue to contribute to southeast Idaho and beyond, every day.
Working in AmeriCorps and Vista gave these students a way to create a vision for improving the health and well-being of their communities.
Students going through the AmeriCorps program are now working as physician assistants, dental hygienists and physical therapy assistants. Some went on for their master’s and Ph.D.’s in various health-related fields like public health and psychology. Some work as health professionals and some are involved in teaching at universities.  Some used their stipends, which were flexible at that time, to fund the education of their children through part of their college experience, thus, helping the next generation to succeed.
These young adults are now making a truly positive impact on their communities. The effects have been long-lasting.
Many of the AmeriCorps/Vista students at the Hispanic Health Projects spoke Spanish as their first language, and many of them had worked in agriculture and related forms of labor before coming to ISU. Other students learned Spanish as they engaged with the Hispanic community members both at the Hispanic Health Projects and in the rural communities around Pocatello.
The learning went the other way, too as those who spoke more Spanish became increasingly proficient in English. We created a bi-cultural atmosphere where all could thrive.
We worked on many topics over the years: diabetes outreach and screening, women’s health checks, school-based programs targeting mental health and teen pregnancy and, also, the very successful Salsa Aerobics program that served many women in American Falls and Aberdeen for years.
Students participating in the Hispanic Health Projects learned to identify local health problems and then to create culturally appropriate interventions that made our communities a healthier place. This work, funded by AmeriCorps and Vista positions made a positive, long-term impact on our rural, agricultural communities.
Cutting these programs is a profound mistake, the funding should be reinstated.

The protest was one of over 1,000 planned across the country. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Most of the lawsuits Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser has filed against the Trump administration have resulted in court orders pausing or permanently halting certain executive actions implemented by President Donald Trump.
Since Trump’s inauguration, Colorado has joined nearly two dozen lawsuits alongside other Democratic-led states challenging Trump’s actions. So far more than half of those cases have seen judges grant preliminary injunctions requested by Weiser and other attorneys general. That has led to court-mandated reversals of Trump executive actions that sought to change requirements for federal funding, cut federal agencies and their staff, and change citizenship and voter requirements, among other issues. 
“In nearly every case that has had a ruling so far, we’re winning. That’s because these actions are plainly illegal and harmful, and the courts are taking notice,” Weiser said in a statement to Newsline. “One judge, in the case of the president’s clearly unconstitutional order to overturn birthright citizenship, said it was the most unconstitutional action he had seen in 40 years on the bench. More recently, the judge in the case challenging the administration’s termination of certain National Institute of Health grants said he had never seen such palpable racial discrimination.”
While some judges have issued permanent injunctions, others have issued partial or preliminary injunctions as the various lawsuits continue to make their way through the court system.

Other cases are waiting for a judge to issue a ruling while others still need to go through a preliminary injunction hearing.
Here are the court cases that have seen a judge rule partially or fully in favor of plaintiff Democratic states including Colorado.
Birthright citizenship 
Multiple judges, including one overseeing a case Colorado is a party to, have blocked the Trump administration from enforcing an executive order to end birthright citizenship in the U.S. as cases challenging it are resolved. 
Weiser and a coalition of other attorneys general filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts on Jan. 21 claiming that action violates 14th Amendment and a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The suit seeks to invalidate the executive order and stop any attempts to implement it. 
Section 1 of the 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, reads, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”
Tariffs
A judge with the U.S. Court of International Trade granted a request from states to permanently block Trump’s move to implement tariffs through four executive orders without approval from Congress. 
The lawsuit asked the court to declare that Trump acted beyond his legal authority and contrary to law when he issued orders implementing tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which does not grant the president the power to impose tariffs. It also asked the court to enjoin federal agencies from maintaining the tariffs. 
“As the court explained, the law does not give the president unbounded power to impose vast tariffs on goods from nearly every country in the world,” Weiser said in a statement. “We brought this lawsuit because this was yet another example of the administration acting as though it’s above the law. And this lawless action harmed the State and Coloradans by creating economic chaos and driving up prices at a time when so many are stretching to meet budgets.”
The Federal Reserve projected tariffs Trump has initiated will lead to inflation. 
Public health grants
A Rhode Island judge granted a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit Weiser and other Democratic-led states filed challenging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s move to abruptly terminate $11 billion in grant funding, citing the end of the COVID-19 pandemic as reason to stop the funding.
Colorado was at risk of losing up to $229 million in grant funding as a result of the cuts that would have affected public health programs such as immunization distribution, training for local public health agencies on infectious disease, lab services and replacing aging lab equipment. 
“I’m pleased the court agreed with me and my fellow state attorneys general that HHS and Secretary Kennedy cannot arbitrarily defund public health and behavioral health programs,” Weiser said in a statement. “If allowed to stand, this inexplicable, illegal action will cause deep harm to Colorado’s ability to deal with challenges ranging from fighting infectious diseases to fighting substance abuse.” 
Freeze on federal funds
The Office of Management and Budget issued a sweeping freeze on all federal funding on Jan. 27. 
Colorado and over 20 other states filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island on Jan. 28 arguing the freeze is unlawful. 
Weiser said in a statement that the action violates the separation of powers and is “causing massive harm” in Colorado, affecting health care, education and public safety. 
A Rhode Island judge issued a preliminary injunction in states included in the lawsuit on March 6, and wrote in a 45-page decision that the proposed freeze undermined “the distinct constitutional roles of each branch of our government.”

DOGE data privacy
A New York judge extended a temporary order blocking the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, from accessing Department of Treasury systems. 
Weiser joined a coalition of attorneys general in filing a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to stop DOGE from accessing private taxpayer data. 
The suit followed news that a team of DOGE employees accessed sensitive Department of Treasury data through its payment infrastructure. 
The attorneys general said Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent illegally provided DOGE access to the Department of Treasury’s central payment system and “Americans’ most sensitive personal information, including bank account details and Social Security numbers.”
The lawsuit seeks an injunction prohibiting expanded access to Treasury Department systems as well as a declaration that the administration’s actions were unlawful and unconstitutional.
In a separate case filed by another group of Democratic attorneys general, a judge in Washington, D.C., ordered that a restraining order prohibiting DOGE from accessing federal agency data is not warranted.   
AmeriCorps
A June 5 order from a Maryland judge granted a request from 24 states, including Colorado, to reinstate AmeriCorps grant programs and National Civilian Community Corps members, but declined to reverse the Trump administration’s reduction of the program’s workforce.
AmeriCorps is an independent federal agency that supports community service programs throughout the U.S. A lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court of Maryland says the orders to reduce its workforce have effectively ended AmeriCorps’ ability to function, with 85% of its staff on administrative leave. 
“The illegal cuts to AmeriCorps threaten Colorado communities that rely on program volunteers to provide services to military veterans, older Americans aging in place, people dealing with substance abuse, and wildfire mitigation support,” Weiser said in a statement. “As the judge says in the opinion, ‘these volunteers represent the best of us.’ The mass closure of AmeriCorps programs, removal of national service corps members from service, and the termination of federal funding makes no sense.”
Defunding medical research
The National Institutes of Health announced on Feb. 7 it would no longer pay research universities and medical schools a previously negotiated percentage for indirect costs. Weiser and 21 other attorneys general filed suit on Feb. 10 alleging those cuts were unlawful. 
Filed in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts, the suit says the Trump administration’s proposed unilateral 15% reimbursement rate would lead to an inability to facilitate biomedical research. The NIH is the primary source of federal funding for medical research. The attorneys general said the cap violates the Administrative Procedures Act. 
According to a news release from Weiser’s office, the move would cut nearly $90 million in research funding across three university campuses in Colorado. 
A Massachusetts judge granted a preliminary injunction on the funding caps in a 76-page decision on March 5 after she extended a temporary block on Feb. 21.  
The Association of American Medical Colleges and the Association of American Universities also filed lawsuits against NIH over the change. 
Gender-affirming care
A federal judge temporarily blocked a Trump order that threatened the funding of any medical institution that provided gender-affirming care to minors, saying it “blatantly discriminated against trans youth.” 
The lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington intends to block federal agencies from enforcing the executive order, which also threatens criminal charges against medical providers who provide gender-affirming care. It argues the executive order violates the equal protection guaranteed by the 5th Amendment by singling out transgender individuals for mistreatment and discrimination.
Colorado hospitals that provided gender-affirming care to minors abruptly canceled scheduled appointments for transgender children, citing the order and the potential consequences for their funding.

A Maryland judge in April ordered the Trump administration to reinstate probationary federal employees across various agencies.
Weiser and a group of 20 attorneys general sued the Trump administration claiming mass layoffs of probationary federal employees are illegal and cause irreparable harm to their states.
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court of Maryland, says the firing of approximately 24,000 probationary government employees who worked for various federal departments violated laws and regulations regarding “reductions in force.” 
U.S. Department of Education
A Massachusetts judge ordered a preliminary injunction to prohibit the Trump administration from dismantling the U.S. Department of Education and must reinstate terminated employees. 
Weiser and 20 other attorneys general filed a lawsuit looking to stop the “effective dismantling” of the government agency that supports students and schools across the country after the department announced it would cut about 50% of its workforce. 
The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court of Massachusetts, says the cuts to the department’s workforce are illegal and unconstitutional, as the department is an executive agency authorized by Congress. 
Colorado received over $1.2 billion from the federal government in 2024 for school programs, according to Weiser’s office. 
Elections executive order
A Massachusetts judge issued a preliminary injunction to prevent certain provisions of Trump’s March elections executive order from being implemented.
The order requires proof of citizenship to register to vote and vote, requires all ballots be counted on Election Day, and threatens federal funding for states that don’t comply, among other changes. 
The Constitution grants states the right to oversee their own elections, with Congress permitted to regulate certain aspects of voting. 
Voting rights advocates and the Democratic National Committee have filed separate lawsuits challenging the legality of Trump’s order, too.
Dismantling federal agencies
A May order from a Rhode Island judge granted a preliminary injunction to prohibit DOGE from dismantling certain federal agencies. 
Weiser and 20 other Democratic attorneys general filed a suit in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island challenging a Trump order attempting to dismantle federal agencies created by Congress. 
While Trump has taken several actions attempting to cut down other federal agencies, the lawsuit is focused on the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the Minority Business Development Agency and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The order Trump issued on March 14 orders the agencies “to eliminate every one of their programs and components not mandated by statute.” 
Other case updates
While a Massachusetts judge granted a temporary restraining order reversing the U.S. Department of Education’s move to freeze $600 million in grant funding for K-12 teacher training programs, the Supreme Court issued an administrative stay to allow the freeze to continue as the case continues.
The judge who issued the restraining order said he saw “no reasoned explanation articulated” for the program terminations. The freeze threatens $2.8 million for a program that prepares teachers to work in rural Colorado communities that have a hard time hiring and retaining teachers. 
Federal funding for the Teacher Quality Partnership and Supporting Effective Educator Development grant programs goes to state universities and other teacher training programs around the country. On Feb. 7, the department immediately terminated the distribution of these grants, which were approved by Congress. 
In a lawsuit Colorado joined that argues the Trump administration’s attempt to freeze wind energy development harms states’ efforts to diversify affordable, renewable energy sources, a Massachusetts judge ruled that the case can continue after the administration tried to get it dismissed.  
A judge also issued a preliminary injunction from the bench in a lawsuit joined by Colorado that claims the National Institutes of Health has purposely delayed the review process for medical research grants that should have already been issued. A written order granting the injunction should be issued soon, according to Weiser’s office.
The agency has refused to pay for multi-year grants that were approved under previous administrations since Trump took office, citing disagreements over race and gender issues. Research institutions received letters alerting them that their grants were canceled in relation to “DEI,” “transgender issues” or “vaccine hesitancy.” 
In a case joined by Colorado challenging the U.S. Department of Transportation’s move to require immigration enforcement as a condition for a state to receive funding, a Rhode Island judge issued a preliminary injunction to stop the requirement. The lawsuit says attaching immigration enforcement as a condition to receive federal funding is beyond the federal government’s authority and is unconstitutional.

(Mike Chalmers for West Virginia Watch)Derek Gallagher, a teacher at Martinsburg High School in Martinsburg, West Virginia, isn’t one to sugarcoat hard truths. He just wrapped up his 15th year at MHS — covering psychology, AP psych, sociology, contemporary studies and leadership. And within minutes of meeting him, you realize he is anything but a traditional educator. Which is exactly how he prefers it. 

Originally from Pittsburgh, Gallagher arrived in the Eastern Panhandle to play basketball at Shepherd University — where he started from 2006-2010 — ultimately graduating with a degree in education. He also earned a master’s in curriculum and instruction from Shepherd while teaching at MHS after graduating. 
“When I first started teaching, it was a very traditional classroom: desks, chairs, chapter reviews, tests, notes, worksheets — the whole package,” he said. “I think I brought good energy, but that was all I knew. I thought that’s what worked — because that’s what I was told worked.” 
But a few years into teaching — and while pursuing his master’s — Gallagher started running into former students. He’d ask them about his courses, the material, the lessons. The answers often comprised vague memories, scattered impressions, no real retention.
“It really gave me pause,” he said. “These were good students — smart kids. But they couldn’t remember the core concepts. And I just thought, what are we doing in education if this is the result?”
It was a question he kept circling back to. He began looking more closely at what schools actually demanded of students. “They sit. They take notes. They regurgitate information. There’s not a ton of critical thinking — it’s mostly about finding the ‘right’ answer.”
Quoting philosopher and education reformer John Dewey — “You learn what you do” — he saw how disconnected the average classroom was from that principle. “We’re not doing. We’re pretending,” he said.
Around Gallagher’s fourth year, things began to shift. He enrolled in a course at Shepherd on the brain-body connection. The concept resonated deeply, especially with Gallagher’s background in athletics. Short bursts of high-intensity movement, he learned, weren’t just good for the body — they primed the brain for learning.
“They trigger the release of BDNF — brain-derived neurotrophic factor,” he said. “It’s basically Miracle-Gro for the brain.”
Even while still teaching in a traditional way, Gallagher began experimenting — adding in five-minute movement breaks before vocabulary lessons. For his master’s thesis, he tracked student performance. The results were clear: the group that engaged in high-intensity movement consistently outperformed the control group. 
“They remembered more. They engaged more. It was night and day.”
But Gallagher didn’t stop at movement. He started to examine everything — food, attention spans, addiction pathways, the pervasive glow of screens.
“We’re feeding these kids garbage — sugar bombs for breakfast, processed carbs throughout the day — and then asking them to sit still and pay attention. And on top of that, we give them screens and pretend it’s innovation.”
He cited a recent report showing how teens now average nearly nine hours a day on screens, with nearly zero regulation or structure around that time. 
“We’re not teaching kids to regulate dopamine — we’re helping them spike it all day long. And then we wonder why they’re anxious, distracted and disengaged.”
For Gallagher, it wasn’t enough to diagnose the problem. He wanted to rebuild the model entirely.
Quiet rebellion 
He started with subtle changes in the way he structured his classroom, built in movement, experimented with nontraditional methods. But the real catalyst, he said, was COVID.
“That’s when I saw the full dysfunction of the system. We were throwing a Band-Aid on a bullet wound. ‘Wear a mask. Stay six feet apart.’ But no one was talking about immune systems — about kids being vitamin D deficient, never moving, eating garbage and not sleeping.”
For Gallagher, the pandemic laid bare what had already been broken. 
“So I asked myself: What can I control?” He started holding class outside whenever possible. “That alone was a lightbulb moment — why do we have to be in a building to learn?”
What followed was a quiet but deliberate rebellion against the traditional classroom. Gallagher began rethinking not just what he was teaching, but how, where and why. He removed the rows of desks, opened the blinds to let in natural light, and turned off the fluorescents. “The modern classroom doesn’t have to be the default. Frankly, we’re not getting connection.  We’re just getting compliance.” 

He also credits a rare stroke of fortune: an administration open to new ideas. “That’s not always the case,” he said. “If I’d been in a different county or a different state, this might’ve gone nowhere. Which would be extremely unfortunate because kids are really struggling today.”  
And it’s not because kids are broken, he affirmed. “It’s a natural response to the environment we’ve created. We can’t keep teaching like it’s 1992 — or even 2005. Everything about their world is different now. We’ve got to teach like we know that.”

 Shift in consciousness

A decade and a half since he arrived at Martinsburg High, two things at this point ring undeniably unique about Gallagher’s approach to education: the garden and the workouts.  
Just beyond the edge of an ancient MHS tennis court, a once-forgotten patch of land has been transformed into something quietly radical: a living, breathing classroom. It’s part garden, part training ground, part sanctuary — and for Gallagher, it represents everything the modern education system has forgotten.
“We’re obsessed with convenience and immediacy,” he said. “And in some ways, that’s fine. But it also robs us of something deeply human — the process.”
The garden, he explained, is the perfect antidote to that mindset. A student drops a seed into the soil, and over time — with care, water, weeding and patience — it becomes food. But more than that, it becomes a mirror. “Learning is a process. Fitness is a process. Growth — literal or figurative — is a process,” he said. “And when you grow food, you’re participating in something ancient. You’re connected to the earth. You’re taking care of something outside yourself.”
He points out that gardening isn’t just about nutrition or sustainability — it’s also about healing. “For kids battling anxiety or depression, it’s incredibly grounding. You’re not fixated on your own stress. You’re thinking, ‘What does this plant need?’”
Every class Gallagher teaches spends time in the garden. If the weather holds (winter notwithstanding), they’re outside. Lessons are delivered from picnic tables or folding chairs, sometimes scribbled in chalk across the tennis court. A whiteboard lives in the garden shed. The outdoor space is as functional as any indoor classroom — and intentionally more alive.
The results aren’t measured in harvest volume. “We’re not growing enough to feed the community,” he said. “We’re growing enough to think differently about food. At the end of the day, if you care about kids, you have to care about what we’re feeding them — body and mind.”
It’s a shift in consciousness he’s after. “When students pull Swiss chard from the earth and take it home to cook, or sauté radishes in a pan right there in the classroom, something changes,” he said. He describes students crowding around fig trees and tomato plants like “a swarm of locusts,” devouring produce on the spot. “It’s immediate. It’s real. And it sticks with them.”
But the deeper lesson, he said, is about reverence. Gallagher borrows from Abraham Maslow’s idea of “resacralizing” the everyday — making food sacred again. “In every major spiritual tradition — Buddhism, Islam, Christianity — food is sacred,” he said. “There’s a sense of gratitude and presence that’s supposed to come with eating.”
Over the past few years, the garden has evolved from a passion project to a full-fledged school asset. Gallagher and his students have secured more than $12,000 in grant funding to expand the space. What began as a modest plot has grown into an interdisciplinary zone for both nourishment and movement — a space utilized by an additional 10 teachers at MHS. 
“We built it out as a true learning space,” he said. “And it wasn’t just me. Multiple teachers here have taken part — especially Mr. Cook, our Agriculture teacher. He’s been an enormous contributor to the cause. They all understand that it’s not just about food — it’s identity work. It’s recovery. It’s building purpose in young people.”
And while many school garden programs fade away after their first season, Gallagher’s continues to grow. “Because it’s not performative,” he said. “It’s part of the rhythm of what we do.”
As a result, the momentum has been steady. And the support has followed. What began with four raised beds and a grant from the Eastern Panhandle Conservation District has grown into a fully realized outdoor learning space supported by local organizations like Freedom’s Run and the Martinsburg Rotary Club, as well as larger national organizations like CrossFit. Gallagher estimates the garden and its extensions have brought in nearly $30,000 in funding to date.

Soon, the land surrounding the site will boast a fitness trail. The “Les Smith Fitness Trail,” named in honor of a beloved teacher and coach who passed away in 2022, will wind its way through the outskirts of the school property. 
“It’s for the students, but also the community,” Gallagher said. “We don’t have a public fitness trail in Berkeley County. This could change the landscape — literally and figuratively.”

The whole human
The workouts began with a simple idea: five minutes of movement could be one of the most effective uses of instructional time.
“Short bursts of physical activity trigger neurological engagement,” Gallagher said. “Students come back sharper, more focused, more connected — not just mentally, but socially and emotionally. It builds community.”
That premise evolved into a larger initiative he now calls MAA — Movement, Awareness, Adaptation. Once a month, his classroom becomes a training ground for something far beyond physical fitness. These aren’t typical gym sessions. They’re tests of effort, will and reflection. And they’re entirely voluntary.
“But the wild thing is,” he said, “even students who don’t participate physically still walk away with something. They see their classmates push through these brutal workouts — see them struggle, adapt, overcome. And afterward, they’ll say, ‘That taught me more than any PowerPoint ever could.’ That’s real learning. That’s peripheral learning — the stuff that sticks without you even realizing it.”
The MAA sessions are open to all of Gallagher’s classes. On those days, the garden transforms again. Community members might even drop in to participate. And Gallagher himself joins, moving with his students, sweating alongside them.
“When they see me doing it, it shifts something. I’m not just preaching effort — I’m modeling it. They see that this isn’t about PE or punishment. It’s about the whole human being.”
While the workouts might look like a detour from traditional instruction — especially to an outsider peeking in on a day when the entire period is dedicated to movement — Gallagher insists that’s part of the problem. 
“We’ve boxed in our idea of what counts as learning. If it’s not a worksheet or a note-taking session, we assume it doesn’t ‘count.’ But real education isn’t always measurable in real time. That’s why this model works — it meets students where they are. It teaches them to rise.”

Expanding the vision 
Fifteen years into his career, Gallagher now finds himself in a position he wouldn’t have anticipated when it began: public facing. In multiple appearances before the Berkeley County Board of Education, he has laid out a case that is as data-driven as it is impassioned: the school system is failing its students — not just academically, but physically, emotionally and socially.
“West Virginia has long ranked near the bottom nationally in categories like obesity, childhood diabetes, physical inactivity and access to fresh food,” he said. 
According to the CDC’s State of Childhood Obesity, nearly 37% of children ages 10–17 in West Virginia are overweight or obese — nearly quadruple what it was just 25 years ago. Gallagher doesn’t need statistics to recognize the problem. 
“We have this data, and yet the food schools serve remains laden with sugar and processed carbohydrates,” he said. “A typical breakfast can contain as much as 64 grams of added sugar, with donuts, chocolate milk, juice and flavored yogurt all considered ‘in compliance.’ We are essentially fueling the problem.”
While districts spend millions on iPads and Chromebooks, he said, there is little to no investment being made in initiatives that encourage physical activity, outdoor learning or in-person connection.
In contrast, he added, a growing body of research points to the benefits of movement and time spent outside, “… both of which can reduce anxiety and depression while improving cognitive function.” 
Among his proposals: eliminate juice and chocolate milk from school menus, educate teachers on simple movement-based interventions to use in class, invest in outdoor classrooms and gardens, and establish a standing health and wellness advisory board to help guide district policy based on current health data and real-world outcomes.
Most notably, Gallagher developed a dual-enrollment course with longtime wellness advocate Dr. Al Bacchus titled Love, Wellness, Happiness, and the Self-Examined Life. The class would offer students three college credits through Blue Ridge Community and Technical College in Martinsburg and include longitudinal tracking to assess the long-term impact on participants’ health and well-being. Despite being approved by the college, the course was denied by the BCBOE.
“If we’re not pursuing research-based health and wellness programs in schools, then what are we doing?” Gallagher asked. “We have to stop spending millions on tech while ignoring the actual bodies and minds of our students. Their future physical, emotional, psychological and economic well-being depends on the decisions we make right now.”
When asked about the future, Gallagher doesn’t talk about retirement or accolades. He talks about legacy.
“I hope when I’m done teaching, I can hand this thing off to someone else who will carry it forward,” he said. “This is going to take decades. But if we keep fighting, if we stay focused on quality of life, I believe we’ll look back at some point and say we really changed something.”

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

– Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky



But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
Growing threats
In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
Language matters
Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
Security measures
Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

Deago Buck, who is of mixed race, was employed at Johnny Cash’s Bar and BBQ when he was beaten, gouged in the eyes and struck by the pole of a swastika flag, in an attack on a public sidewalk the hate group livestreamed.
Buck’s assault was not an isolated incident during the group’s time in Nashville. 
Members of the group assaulted a Jewish man, heckled young Black children, disrupted a Metro Council meeting and accosted numerous passersby while chanting “Sieg Heil,” “f— the Jews” and “white f— power” while throwing Nazi salutes, instances that were widely reported in local news media at the time
Brought by attorneys with the Southern Poverty Law Center, the suit alleges the group violated the federal Ku Klux Klan Act and accuses it of acts of battery, assault and harassment. 
The federal lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Middle District of Tennessee, seeks a ruling the group violated Buck’s rights and an injunction blocking the group from future violations.

Three Pennsylvania nonprofits share a uniquely focused mission on public health. Looming federal cuts to scientific research, they warn, could unravel decades of their work.  
While the Trump administration’s proposed funding cuts in biomedical research are  reverberating nationally, they are also causing grave concern in Bucks County, home to the Hepatitis B Foundation, the Baruch S. Blumberg Institute and the Pennsylvania Biotechnology Center (PABC), one of the country’s primary biotech incubators.
Leaders at the Doylestown-based organizations said sweeping spending cuts across multiple federal agencies threaten not only jobs and research, but advances in public health across the world.
“The drastic, arbitrary cut in National Institutes of Health (NIH) indirect cost funding would eliminate billions of dollars that support medical and public health research projects nationwide,” said Chari A. Cohen, president of the Hepatitis B Foundation.
 “We are the only nonprofit solely dedicated to finding a cure for hepatitis B and improving the lives of those affected worldwide,” she said.  Loss of the funding,  “would result in thousands of jobs being cut and we stand to lose an entire generation of the world’s best and brightest scientists,” she added. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Recognizing the statewide importance of the biotechnology industry, Gov. Josh Shapiro visited in February, designating $30 million to support the incubator. Scientists from around the world lease lab space for their research at the Bucks site. More than 100 small- to midsize research and pharmaceutical companies are PABC members.
Louis P. Kassa III, chief executive officer of the trio of institutions, said work done at the center has contributed $7.3 billion to the state’s economy over the past five years.
State lawmakers from both parties have also provided smaller grants over the years. “Pennsylvania has prioritized infectious disease elimination,” Cohen said. 
However, it’s federal money that’s the backbone of the southeastern Pennsylvania nonprofits, the executives said.
The numbers are stark. The Blumberg Institute currently holds 11 research grants and a multi-year contract with the NIH, which together provide salaries and benefits for 28 scientists and 10 support staff. If the funding is reduced or eliminated, the institute and the Hepatitis B Foundation could lose approximately $7.5 million in 2025 alone, said institute officials.
Additionally, the facilities are awaiting decisions on $10.2 million in pending NIH research grant proposals. That money supports research on the pathology of hepatitis B, clinical trials, liver cancer, and other related diseases. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1,797 people in the U.S. died from hepatitis B in 2022. 
Cohen described the proposed funding changes as “deeply alarming.” She noted that the CDC’s Division of Viral Hepatitis, based in Atlanta, has already been shuttered. “That division supported national surveillance and could track hepatitis A, B and C epidemics. It was the only one of its kind in the world,” she said. 
 “In my life, I never thought I’d see this,” said Cohen.

Beyond the funding cuts, the Trump administration is proposing sweeping changes to the structure of the nation’s public health apparatus. A significant revision involves replacing parts of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with a new entity. The Administration for a Healthy America would fall under the oversight of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The new agency would absorb several existing federal programs, including those addressing substance abuse, HIV prevention and mental health, while also slashing budgets and workforce sizes, the CDC reported.
“The Budget reflects needed reforms to put health care spending on a sustainable fiscal path and proposes policies to Make America Healthy Again,” HHS press secretary Emily Hilliard wrote in a statement to CBS News earlier this month.
According to the  agency’s data, the administration is proposing a $4.3 billion (or 53%) cut to the CDC’s budget and a 43% reduction in staffing. Trump officials argue the CDC has “exceeded its role” and should be refocused on “core functions.” 
Global initiatives to address HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria could end under the new policies and millions of dollars in NIH grants, including those long expected by southeastern Pennsylvania’s three nonprofits, would be eliminated. 
“The decision to terminate certain grants is part of a deliberate effort to ensure taxpayer dollars prioritize high-impact, urgent science,” Andrew G. Nixon, the director of communications for the Department of Health and Human Services, told ProPublica.
“Many discontinued projects were duplicative or misaligned with NIH’s core mission. NIH remains focused on supporting rigorous biomedical research that delivers real results — not radical ideology,” said Nixon.
Dr. Ju-Tao Guo, acting president and chief scientific officer of the Blumberg Institute, said loss of  federal financial support would harm important parts of his team’s work, which supplement the Hepatitis B Foundation’s research.
“What’s happening at the NIH is being called an effort to eliminate waste, but reimbursement of research facilities and administrative costs have always been closely monitored by federal officials,” said Ju-Tao Guo. “These costs support critical activities like patient safety, hazardous waste disposal, and research security.”
Cohen shared those concerns, calling the staffing and program reductions “deeply alarming.”
Adding to the uncertainty is a change in how federal funds will be distributed. The administration’s proposed 2026 budget eliminates $43 billion previously approved by Congress for hepatitis B prevention and replaces it with a $300 million block grant to states. That funding, according to the spending plan, would also have to cover tuberculosis and sexually transmitted infection prevention.
As Congress prepares to debate funding for the proposed new health agency and overall public health spending, scientists, nonprofits and research advocates across the country are pushing back. 
“These actions will impact our work here and abroad and profoundly impair our country’s ability to save lives and achieve the national goal of eliminating hepatitis B as a public health threat,” said Cohen.
 “It feels like an attack on innovation, on science,” said Kassa.

He poses in his Frankfort office, June 13, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)FRANKFORT — Dr. Steven Stack says Kentucky, which already struggles with poor health, is “on the cusp of having a significant backslide” if the federal government cuts programs like Medicaid and SNAP. 
Stack, who on July 1 will shift roles from the state’s public health commissioner to the secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, said Kentucky can become a healthier state over time, but that requires robust safety net programs. 
The “profound cuts” proposed to Medicaid by Republicans in Congress, he said, would push vulnerable people from “the edge of despair … into despair.” 
He’s also concerned that science is becoming less trusted and prioritized as the Trump administration cuts funding for research and widespread vaccine hesitancy has led to drops in childhood immunizations. 
In his new role, Stack will oversee a state agency that employs about 8,000 people and wields a multi-billion dollar budget. The cabinet manages Kentucky’s human services, which includes Medicaid, foster care, care for the aging, assistance for those with disabilities and more. 
Stack will bring to the secretary position a 20-year medical career, according to his official state biography. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Stack has been an adjunct professor at the University of Tennessee Haslam College of Business, served on the American Medical Association (AMA) board of trustees and worked as the medical director for St. Joseph East in Lexington, St. Joseph in Mt. Sterling and Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis. 
Stack is replacing Eric Friedlander, who is retiring. Dr. John Langefeld will replace Stack as the public health commissioner. 
Ahead of his transition, Stack sat down with the Kentucky Lantern in his Frankfort office for a 40-minute conversation about lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic, the politics of health, the direction the United States is heading — and what that could mean for Kentucky’s health infrastructure — and more. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Kentucky Lantern: Let’s start with the pandemic. What did you learn during COVID that you’re going to take into this new role?
Dr. Steven Stack: One of the things that I was grateful for was my background as an ER doc. In the emergency department, you have to make fast paced decisions in an information-poor environment, and you have to live with the consequences. I think that described COVID to a tee. We did that on a weekly, if not a daily, basis. We made high stakes decisions, and we had to do the best we could, and you had to communicate clearly what you were doing and why, and you had to own the consequences of those decisions. 
I don’t think it was the first time I learned the lesson, but I think that it made it very clear: Leadership is a privilege and an honor.  The other thing is: You learn that leadership can be lonely and it extracts a price, and so whenever you have to make decisions, there are some people who like the decisions and there are other people who don’t. 
COVID, being a once in a century pandemic, was of a scale and a magnitude that obviously changed all of our lives for an extended period of time, and I think gave me a much deeper, much richer appreciation for both the opportunity and the burden of leadership and the responsibility that is attendant to it.
KL: How did you avoid burnout? 
SS: I’m not sure I fully did. Burnout has a number of different elements, at least as I understand it. One is, did I avoid physical exhaustion? No, I didn’t. 
It was the first job I’ve ever had that was so hard for such an intensive period or a prolonged period of time that that caused me health impact. And so I don’t think I avoided the physical exhaustion; that facet of burnout, but I don’t think I got emotionally burnt out, and I don’t think I got mentally burnt out. 
It was important work in a time of crisis, and there was a lot of uncertainty, and a lot of people who were in need of someone to at least message clearly and reassuringly that while it would be difficult, we would get through it.

KL: What did you do for your mental health — then and also now — to help with this stress? 
SS: When I’m doing my best, I get up early in the morning, and I like to read books. I read history books to provide perspective. I do that because, in any moment in time, there are crises. 
Yesterday was full of multiple crises: a large jumbo jet crashing with one survivor, a new escalation in Middle East tensions. There’s certainly controversy related to protests occurring and the use of the federal government using state resources to play a role in that. So there are always crises.
I find it helps to read history a little bit and put in context that there have been crises before. There have been plenty of existential moments where the leaders of the time and the people felt ‘we’re at the precipice. It’s not clear that we won’t go over the precipice.’ 
That’s one of the things I tried to do during COVID, was to acknowledge the difficulty of the time. I had confidence during COVID we would get through it, and we would get through it together, just like the governor said, because that’s what has always happened in history. But getting through it didn’t mean that there wouldn’t be people lost along the way, and there wouldn’t be traumas and sorrows to accept and deal with.

KL: Health has become more and more political. We saw it during the COVID-19 lockdowns and when the vaccines came out. We’re seeing it now. How do we remove politics from health? Or — should we? 
SS: Everything’s politics. Politics is negotiating with your 3-year-old at home, whether they’re going to use the potty or not. Or it is negotiating with your teenager whether they can have access to the car or not to go out for the weekend. 
Politics determines our food sources. It determines what gets approved or supported for the foods we buy at the grocery store or how farmers are or are not supported. It certainly impacts the medications that we have access to or not. 
In the current situation, it raises real concerns about our politics reaching the point where science is taking a back seat to prove people’s personal preferences. I think that that’s very dangerous because while we’re always going to have different perspectives on different topics, it’s really essential that we try to adhere to some kind of structured approach, and ideally a transparent approach, to how decisions are made. 
Right now, we have a real challenge, because there’s an intense blurring of a magnitude we really haven’t experienced in recent years of science versus preference and beliefs. I am concerned that if we don’t find a way to kind of back that down a bit, that the public won’t have access to the very best choices, the very best options that they could have.
KL:  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. just fired the vaccine advisory board and has promoted information that’s not backed by science since taking over as U.S. Health and Human Services secretary. As you enter this new role, how can you lead with science if the federal guidelines aren’t based on science? 
SS: It gets difficult because we have long relied on federal institutions to be the aggregator across the states. 
There’s only one entity in the United States that can approve new pharmaceuticals. It’s the Food and Drug Administration. No state has the authority to approve a new pharmaceutical for marketing.
As a nation, we’ve got to find a way to lower the temperature on some of these things, and we also have to remind ourselves that a big part of our democracy is that we support all persons to have their opinion and to have their voice, and that while the majority gets the opportunity to make the decisions, there’s always an obligation to ensure the minority’s voice can be heard, can be safely expressed, and can have the opportunity to be persuasive, which requires the majority to be open to persuasion. Right now, we really don’t have that.

KL: These controversies aren’t just at the federal level. What about your cabinet’s relationship with the legislature? How will you approach the conversations around kinship care and foster kids sleeping in offices, for example? 
SS: I intend to do what I’ve done, I hope, up to this point: to be candid, to be honest, to be forthright about what I understand to be occurring and what I recommend should occur. 
Anyone who gets elected to a position has to be able to show to the people who elected them that they are advocating for and fighting for what those people want. So what happens at a legislative hearing — people need to look past the intensity of the moment and the words that are said. 
Even in these hyper political times, there is a lot of collaborative work that gets done behind the scenes, because, believe it or not, even if the legislature doesn’t like what the executive branch does, the legislature needs the executive branch to implement the things it wants to be done. So, if they create circumstances where it becomes impossible for the executive branch to actually do their work, it doesn’t just mean that the other party’s work doesn’t get done. It means that their work doesn’t get done. 
At the end of the day, government needs to come together in some form or fashion to make sure that the things that the legislature wants done have an executive branch resourced properly and capable of doing those things. It doesn’t always happen that way.
KL: Zooming out for a second, Kentucky has high rates of opioid use disorder, cancer — so many issues. Is it possible for Kentucky to ever be a healthy state? And if so, how could we get there?
SS: I think it’s possible for Kentucky to be a healthier state. 
There’s a ranking system — America’s Health Rankings — that comes out every year. Over the last five to seven years, Kentucky has gone from 47th to 41st. I give a lot of credit to the intentional expansion of Medicaid and the running of the state-based (health insurance) exchange, because while health insurance does not guarantee health — they’re not the same thing — not having access to health care causes people to live sicker and die younger. 
We have other headwinds that are really challenging. Kentucky is one of the poorest states in the United States. We have areas that face particularly difficult challenges. So the Appalachian region has a number of challenges. They have the loss of the coal industry, which increased unemployment and decreased employment opportunities. With these floods that have happened with climate change, they’ve been devastated multiple times because they don’t live in a flat area. They live in an area where you build in the valley, because that’s the only place there’s flat land. But then when the water comes, it floods out everywhere you are. 
KY still pays price for one of nation’s highest rates of opioid use disorder, says new report

Addiction is often a consequence, a disease of despair and a disease of despondency. And so when people don’t have jobs and they struggle to support themselves, they look for an outlet, and so often those drugs become part of that outlet. We have to address those fundamental things. 
In this administration, the governor frequently talks about economic development and talks about bringing in new employers. The way we get people off Medicaid, the way we get people to be more self sufficient and more resilient, not entirely, but in a large part is: Do we have well paying jobs where people can go earn a good living and then bring health insurance with it, so that they can have access to health care and support themselves and have productive lives? If we don’t focus on creating communities that are livable with job opportunities that bring health insurance with them, it’s very, very difficult.
Right now, there are profound cuts proposed to the SNAP program, significant cuts in different ways for the Medicaid program. Those things are going to take the most vulnerable among us and take them from being at the edge of despair, and thrust them into despair. 
I’m very concerned that the path we appear to be on is going to take a state like Kentucky that relies very heavily on those services and supports and thrust a large portion of Kentuckians into a very, very difficult and stressful position, which is going to be a massive headwind against improving our health outcomes.

KL: To close us out, what are your main goals for your tenure as cabinet secretary? 
SS: When I step in on July 1, I’m going to have two years and five months (until the end of the Beshear administration), pretty much, and it’s going to be during a time of major federal retraction in the support that it provides.
My goals are to support the governor’s initiatives, to try to make sure that, through the end of this administration, we continue to deliver on his commitments to the people of Kentucky.
My goal would be to support the people of Kentucky, to make sure they have the best that we can provide them with the resources available, to make sure they don’t go hungry, to make sure their kids show up ready for school. So (Beshear has) a push now for pre-K. It’s really, really important in those early years that children are resourced properly, that they don’t go to school hungry, and that they have access to structured environments that can educate and help form them and set them on a good path. 
A big part of my task is, how can I lead the team here, the team that I inherit, to perform at the very highest possible level, so that whatever the resources we have, we maximize those to the greatest good for as many people as we can serve. If we lose a lot of federal dollars, the reality is we won’t be able to provide the same amount of services. That’s the truth. 
If the federal government ships major costs to the state, the legislature is going to have some really hard choices. If the elected representatives of the United States House and Senate decide to cut money from the state, their counterparts at the statehouse are then going to be left with the decision: What do we pay for and what don’t we and what services will the people of Kentucky not get? 
In this case, the legislative branch, both federally and state, will ultimately be the ones who make those decisions and own the consequences. They have difficult choices to make, but those choices will have real consequences.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island now trails behind every other New England state in the latest national ranking of children’s wellbeing after sliding from 12th place to 19th.
The Ocean State had outpaced Maine in overall rankings last year in the Annie E. Casey Foundation’s annual KIDS COUNT Data Book, which looks at economic, educational, health, and family/community indicators. In the 2025 edition released June 9, Maine also dropped in the rankings but not as much as Rhode Island. Maine fell from 15th place in 2024 to 17th place.
New England states performed well overall: New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts placed first, second and third in the national rankings, respectively. Connecticut placed eighth nationally.
Rhode Island’s score was the result of dips in both economic wellbeing and health, according to a statement from Rhode Island KIDS COUNT, the local branch of the national nonprofit policy, advocacy and data organization. In the 2025 report’s national rankings, Rhode Island fell from 9th to 24th in economic wellbeing and from 6th to 16th in health.
“We know what kids need to grow up healthy and connected so they can thrive as adults: Stable homes, financially secure families, strong schools, nutritious food, meaningful relationships and opportunities to learn, play and grow,” Paige Parks, Rhode Island KIDS COUNT executive director, said in the statement after the report’s release.
The 2025 report largely relies on 2023 federal data, with multiyear averages used to refine some smaller datasets. 
But the national data suggests many Rhode Island families continue to face financial insecurity. Two categories dented the Ocean State’s economic wellbeing score significantly. It placed 36th nationally in the share of children in households where no parent has full-time year-round employment. It also placed 36th for its percentage of families spending more than 30% of their income on housing.  
Rhode Island fared better in the percentage of children living in poverty — defined as below $30,900 for a family of four — and placed 14th nationally.
The state maintained low rates of uninsured children, rising from 2% to 3%. Low birth weight held steady at 7.3% of live births. Rhode Island’s child and teen death rates rose from 15 to 23 per 100,000. The national rate for child and teen deaths also rose from 25 to 29 per 100,000, although each New England state recorded similar increases in 2023.
Approximately 33% of Rhode Island youth were diagnosed as overweight or obese in 2023, which placed the state 35th nationally.
Academic performance metrics
Educational outcomes remain the state’s weakest area overall, even as the state improved by moving from 29th to 28th nationally.
The state had 67% of fourth graders reading below grade level — only three percentage points worse than New Hampshire. Meanwhile, 74% of eighth graders were below grade level in math. 
Rhode Island placed 37th nationally, however, for the number of high school students not graduating on time, at 17%. 
Rhode Island did improve slightly in family and community metrics, rising four spots to 16th place in 2025. All four metrics improved at least incrementally from last year, with the highest-ranking place a fourth place slot for teen birth rates, at seven births per 1,000 girls ages 15 to 19. 
In her statement, Parks highlighted the urgency of investing in programs that support children’s long-term success. 
“Programs that meet these needs are smart investments, fostering long-term gains like employment and economic growth,” Parks wrote. “Investing in kids isn’t just the right thing to do — it’s a smart, future-focused strategy that benefits the whole state.” 
Some of the legislative priorities Rhode Island KIDS COUNT has backed in the soon-to-conclude legislative session include strengthening the RI Works Program, establishing baby bonds for newborns in RI Works, and expanding maternal and child mental health supports like MomsPRN and PediPRN.
A state profile for Rhode Island is available on the Annie E. Casey Foundation website, as is the full 2025 Data Book.

(Google Maps)Even though Colorado is ostensibly a “blue” state, many supporters of the Colorado charter school industry are solidly on board with President Donald Trump’s agenda for public education. Trump is aligned with the billionaire oligarchy and Colorado’s charter school growth has been funded by billionaires and corporate interests. The state’s charter school expansion is also fueled by ideological goals from arch-conservative groups closely allied with the Trump administration.
On Nov. 21, 2024, a Denver Public Schools board member described how “oligarchs created the conditions to expand charter schools in Black and Latino communities across Denver,” where almost one-fourth of the district’s’ students now attend charter schools. Thanks to the monetary influence of these billionaires in local and state elections, Colorado has one of the nation’s most favorable charter school laws and the second highest percentage of students in charter schools. 
Trump’s federal education budget to expand charter schools is being increased by $60 million to a record half a billion dollars. Trump’s executive order on school choice drew high praise from national pro-charter leaders like Fred Hess and Darryl Bradford, whose 50 CAN organization sponsors Denver’s Transform Education Now, an organization that backed the expansion of Colorado charter schools for decades. A recent proposal by Gov. Jared Polis and state Senate President James Coleman to increase more charter schools is also in accordance with this Trump priority.

Linda McMahon, Trump’s billionaire secretary of education, is promoting new conservative priorities on how schools deliver their education, and these goals are in vogue in many Colorado charter schools. The criteria for expanding charter schools places an emphasis on “patriotic and classical education.” This priority is directly associated with reports that “right-wing Christians are taking over the Charter school industry.”
In their exhaustive study “A Sharp Turn Right,” the Network for Public Education authors describe how charter classical schools signal “the creation of a new breed of charter schools that are imbued with the ideas of right-wing Christian nationalism.” The NPE report explains how “classical charter schools emphasize ‘values’ or ‘virtues,’ which stand as shorthand for quoted scripture. This is especially true of the latest crop of classical charters, which have opened since 2017, the first school year during the Trump Administration.” 
The NPE report identifies several Colorado classical charter schools and asserts that classical “schools have become weapons of the right as they seek to destroy democratically governed public schools while turning back the clock of education and social progress by a century.” Professor Derek Black describes this focus on patriotic and classical education as “labels through which conservatives have counteracted woke education (with) their own extreme right version of history & hero worship.”
According to data from the Colorado Department of Education, more than a third of Colorado’s 264 charter schools use “classical” or “core knowledge” curriculum, which coincides with Trump’s focus on both patriotic education and values-based education. The Classical Academy charter school in Colorado Springs highlights their essential mission to “nourish the soul” in their educational philosophy. Liberty Common school’s philosophy in Fort Collins describes how that school celebrates “capstones” representing the “highest order of virtue and character,” including “prudence, temperance, and patriotism.” Ridgeview Classical schools believe “that an American exceptionalism exists and is worthy of examination and reverence, and that through a proper understanding of one’s country, genuine patriotism is both possible and admirable.” 
The four Colorado Ascent Classical Academy schools and Golden View Classical Academy are part of the Hillsdale College K-12 education system, whose K-12 school program director Eric Coykendall, worked for the Claremont Institute, an organization that has backed Trump since 2016. At the Ascent Classical Academy of Northern Colorado school commencement in May, Bradley Birzer from Hillsdale College invoked both Christian virtues and the seven virtues taught at the school, stating it is “the virtues—through God’s grace—that keep us on the straight and narrow path of morality, dignity, and freedom.”
E.D. Hirsch, the founder of Core Knowledge, published articles decrying the country’s slide into an anti-nationalist mindset that has taken over the public schools. “My thesis,” writes Hirsch, “is that our young people’s low opinion of their own country has been intensified by the current disrepute of nationalism in any form in our schools and universities. This anti-nationalism has been a big mistake.”
Hirsch says the role of schools should be to foster “the right kind of nationalism.” The core knowledge curriculum is used in nearly 60 Colorado charter schools. 
Not all of Colorado’s charter schools adhere to Trump’s calls for patriotism, classical education, and conservative ideology connected to Christian values. However, the number that do align with this vision will soon increase. On June 17, even with vocal opposition from members of the community, the state-appointed members of the Charter School Institute authorized the approval of a new “classical” charter school, John Adams Academy, in Douglas County. This school will be part of the John Adams Academies charter network in California. Their board includes a chaplain, and its founder, Dean Forman, cites a culture of debauchery in public schools, prioritizes Christian beliefs in his blog and focuses on virtues and patriotism as central elements in his three California charter schools. 
Will Colorado charter schools, the Charter School Institute, and state legislators continue to align with the Trump vision for public education? It remains to be seen how widespread the impact of the new Trump education priorities will have on Colorado’s K-12 education system.

The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.

In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.

In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.

“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.
Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister 10 years ago today in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”

And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

(Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)This story was originally reported by Barbara Rodriguez of The 19th.  Meet Barbara and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
When it comes to vaccines, there are two kinds of parents coming into Dr. Megan Prior’s office in Washington, D.C., these days.
One set are parents who pepper the pediatrician with increasingly panicked questions about the future availability of vaccines and whether their children can get any shots early. Then there are the parents who feel vindicated in their decision not to vaccinate their kids, despite vaccines’ overall safety and record of disease prevention.
“It’s almost like I have these two groups of diverging patients, where some are really, really worried about their access and want to get things done as soon as possible,” she said. “And then others are sort of in this vaccine hesitant category.”
Both groups have been spurred by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Kennedy’s HHS shakeups could have huge implications for vaccine policy in America. Earlier this month, he fired all 17 members of a key vaccine panel and replaced them with a smaller group of people who in some cases lack relevant experience and who, like him, have been skeptical of vaccines. He claims the vaccine panel firings were aimed at addressing members’ conflicts of interest, even though they worked under a comprehensive policy.
Physicians who treat both children and families say they’re frustrated with Kennedy’s unprecedented firing of the panel known as the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) — and they’re concerned about what it might mean for the future availability of safe and effective vaccines.
For now, doctors are figuring out as a medical community how they can keep their patients healthy with evidence-based guidelines. They’re turning to each other — through membership in trusted organizations that are taking joint actions — and figuring out how to give patients reliable information amid uncertainty about the government’s next steps.
ACIP’s review of vaccines and subsequent guidance, under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, helps insurance companies determine vaccine coverage. A change to ACIP recommendations could have the ripple effect of making a vaccine more expensive to obtain, or more difficult to access through doctors’ offices and pharmacies. The new panel has not taken any actions yet, but its members are scheduled to this week. Vaccine experts say they’re watching closely to see what policy changes, if any, might emerge.
“If I were a mom, and I’m thinking, ‘What do I do for my kid right now?’ I want to be confident that my primary care physician, my family doctor or my pediatrician was making recommendations based on what we know from science and not based on what the insurance company will or will not pay for, or what politics is saying,” said Dr. Jen Brull, a longtime family physician who is now president of the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP). “I think it’s very safe to say that you can look to your primary care physician for that kind of recommendation, and that’s what you should be looking for.”
Prior, who has long used ACIP and CDC guidance on vaccines to answer questions from parents, said she recently downloaded a version of the current children’s vaccination schedule that includes recommendations made by the fired vaccine panel, “just in case there are any changes, so I can remember exactly how wording looked.” She is creating a list of trusted sources, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and AAFP, so she can monitor how they mirror or pivot from future government actions.
Other vaccine experts have announced their own initiative to protect the integrity of vaccine policy, information and access.
“Clearly, there’s a lot of us who are super interested in evidence-based science that will ensure that physicians and families have access to the right recommendations, no matter how politicized things get,” Prior said.
Around the same time that news about Kennedy’s ACIP firings broke, hundreds of doctors were gathered in Chicago for a key meeting of the American Medical Association (AMA), the largest association of physicians, representing more than 190 state and specialty medical societies. Within hours after the firings were public, Brull and representatives from several major medical groups drafted an emergency resolution that called on Kennedy to reverse his actions on the vaccine panel and also requested a Senate investigation into the firings. The resolution passed.
“The emotion in the room was that everyone who was there cared about this — but we wanted to make sure that the AMA, that our individual organizations, were speaking truth,” Brull said.
Dr. David Higgins, a pediatrician and spokesperson for AAP, said the recent dismantling of expertise on ACIP threatens a clarity that has developed over decades within the medical community when it comes to vaccinations.
AAP has been issuing vaccine guidance since 1935, nearly three decades before ACIP was created. To help reduce confusion, both entities officially began publishing harmonized guidance on vaccines in 1995. The consistency helped streamline care for families and reduced discrepancies as combination vaccines became more widely available, according to Higgins.
AAP still maintains its own expert review process for its vaccine schedule, and Higgins said the organization plans to keep issuing recommendations that are “grounded in science and committed to child health.” He worries about potentially conflicting recommendations in the future, and how that might raise public confusion and distrust.
“Parents we talk with are understandably anxious and unsure,” he said in an email. “Our parents and families have a lot of questions, and as pediatricians, we welcome those questions. Pediatricians want to partner with parents and meet them where they are with compassion, clarity, and credible information.”
Brull also wanted to emphasize that point from the lens of family physicians, who sometimes see generations of one family and can be a key source of evidence-based medical information, especially in rural areas with more limited health coverage options.
“My foundational advice to parents and kids who are old enough to have these conversations on their own is that the best thing most people can do is reach out and talk to their primary care doctor — whether that’s their pediatrician or their family physician, and have a conversation,” she said.
Prior, who shares her views on health policy news on social media, does not want to minimize the implications of ACIP’s new membership and what it could mean if they pull a safe vaccine from the immunization schedules for adults or children. She still distinctly remembers her constant worry about whether her young child could access a COVID-19 vaccine, and the transition to in-person schooling and re-entering more public spaces.
“If we live in a world where measles is incredibly common, where whooping cough is incredibly common, where these really infectious diseases are just part of our lives again, parents will have to go through those decisions again,” she said. “I think that piece of it makes me so frustrated. I know how frustrating it was to be a parent in COVID, and I do not wish that stress on anyone. It’s doubly frustrating that this stress we would be putting on ourselves is 100 percent preventable.”",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/RFK-JR-Getty-042225-1024x683.webp,,,2025-06-23 06:04:17.032566

[Editor’s note: North Carolina would join the list of most permissive states if Republican legislators were to override Gov. Josh Stein’s recent veto of Senate Bill 50 — a measure that would allow anyone 18 or older to carry a loaded concealed handgun without any permitting requirement.] 
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.

Every day across Kentucky, thousands of students fail to show up for school. Some miss a few days a month. Others are absent for weeks at a time. When the final tallies are made, many will have missed more than 10% of the school year.
This pattern, known as chronic absenteeism, is quietly eroding the futures of our children — and we cannot afford to ignore it.
Across the United States, over 8 million students are chronically absent each year. In districts serving our most vulnerable populations, that number is even higher. And while many still think of absenteeism as a discipline issue or a matter of personal responsibility, I see something else entirely.
As a family court judge, I’ve learned that chronic absenteeism is often the first visible sign that something much deeper is wrong in a child’s life. It may be illness, untreated trauma, housing insecurity or caregiving burdens at home. It may be depression, anxiety or a simple lack of transportation.
These are not just educational challenges — they are public health concerns.
That’s why we need to reframe how we think about absenteeism. When we treat it like a public health crisis — because that’s exactly what it is — we open the door to early intervention, stronger support systems, and meaningful, long-term solutions.
Far too often, students who are chronically absent fall behind academically and never catch up. This disconnect from school can lead to disengagement from peers, lower self-esteem, and in many cases, contact with the juvenile justice system. When children drop out, the consequences extend far beyond the classroom — they echo through our economy, our public safety systems and our communities for generations.
And we must recognize that this crisis is not hitting all children equally. Chronic absenteeism disproportionately affects Black, Latino, Indigenous, low-income and disabled students. These disparities are rooted in inequities in health care access, housing, nutrition and neighborhood safety. If we are serious about addressing absenteeism, we must be equally serious about addressing the systems that allow those inequities to persist.
The good news? We can change this.
School-based health centers, mobile mental health units, trauma-informed classrooms and strong family engagement strategies have all proven effective. Judicial diversion programs that prioritize rehabilitation over punishment can break cycles before they begin. Community-based partnerships can ensure students are surrounded by the support they need — not just to get to school, but to thrive while they’re there.
But to make real progress, we must stop treating absenteeism as someone else’s problem. It belongs to all of us. Schools alone cannot fix it. A solution will require action by public health officials, judges, educators, faith leaders and families alike.
We must ask different questions. Instead of “Why isn’t this child in school?” we need to ask, “What’s happening in this child’s life that’s keeping them from showing up?” That shift — from blame to understanding — can change everything.
I’ve seen what happens when we wait too long. But I’ve also seen what’s possible when we act early — with compassion, coordination and commitment. Every child deserves a chance to be present, to be supported, and to succeed. Let’s not wait until they’re in my courtroom to figure that out.

It stayed on overhead from 6:30 in the morning until 11:30 at night. Which was a surprise for the 34-year-old New Hampshire resident because he always thought of prison as a dark place, like in the 1999 movie “The Green Mile.” His cell wasn’t fully dark at night either. Guards with flashlights regularly checked on everyone held at the Wyatt Detention Facility.
Schmidt was housed among other Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainees apart from the larger inmate population held by the U.S. Marshals Service awaiting federal court proceedings. Yet he learned other ICE detainees faced serious charges, including murder, sexual assault, and drug-dealing. The mission of the Wyatt — a quasi-public maximum security facility in Central Falls, Rhode Island’s smallest city — is to “protect the public from people who pose a threat to society.”
Schmidt never committed any violent crime.
Instead, he got off a plane at Boston’s Logan International Airport on March 7 on his return from a 10-day trip to visit family and friends in his native Germany. Schmidt obtained his green card as a teenager and became a U.S. permanent resident. But for some reason, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents pulled him aside.
They aggressively asked him about past misdemeanors from 10 years ago when he lived in California — including a charge of drug possession that had been adjudicated. They asked about his annual income, where his parents lived, and what they did for a living.
He was held for hours, which turned into days during which he was denied the chance to speak with a lawyer, his family, or the German Consulate. At one point, Schmidt said he was strip-searched and thrown into a cold shower. He was given only a thin mat to sleep on and fed a cold cup of noodles. He collapsed after developing flu-like symptoms and was transported to Mass General Hospital, where he was handcuffed to the bed.
After being discharged from the hospital, Schmidt was taken back to the airport. On March 11, four days after his return from Europe, CBP agents came to get him.
“That’s the first time I went to Rhode Island,” he recalled in a recent interview at a coffee shop near his home in Nashua. “In hand shackles, feet shackles, in the back of an SUV going like 80 miles an hour.”
He speaks softly, with a faint accent, sometimes pausing to note the surreal facts of the 58 days he spent inside the Wyatt.
In a statement, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Rhode Island Current, “When an individual is found with drug related charges and tries to re-enter the country, officers will take proper action. In this case, the conviction was dismissed, and the individual was released.”
In several posts on the platform X , McLaughlin has called clips from news reports on Schmidt’s treatment by CBP at Logan “blatantly false,” “straight-up false,” and “flat-out FALSE.”
Schmidt is readjusting to life back home. He said the ordeal cost him tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees, lost wages from his job as a master electrician, and expenses for food, clothing, and phone calls home to his worried girlfriend. He is considering filing a lawsuit, though he doesn’t have details to share about that yet.
“This whole experience feels like a movie,” he said.

Not knowing why
Schmidt’s story is one of dozens of accounts of hyper-aggressive immigration enforcement since the start of Donald Trump’s second term. There’s the Canadian woman with a U.S. work visa detained by ICE for two weeks who wrote she felt like she had been “kidnapped;” the visiting scholar at Georgetown University with an academic visa held without charges at an ICE detention facility in Texas; the pair of Georgia newlyweds separated after the bride, an asylum seeker from Colombia, was detained by ICE.
According to the Syracuse University-based public records database, Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), 19,125 people were booked into ICE detention in March, when Schmidt was first detained. His case drew headlines because it initially made no sense.
New Hampshire’s Democratic U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan described the case as “very concerning,” while Massachusetts Democratic State Rep. Mike Connolly called Schmidt’s detention “outrageous” and “unlawful.” On X, a Canadian law professor’s post about Schmidt was shared more than 2,000 times.
His case also highlighted the Wyatt’s role at the center of a yearslong political firestorm. Several public officials, including Rhode Island General Treasurer James Diossa, previously the mayor of Central Falls, have called for its closure. State lawmakers have introduced bills to close it down or, in the case of active bills in the House and Senate sessions, to stop ICE’s ability to do business with Wyatt for civil immigration violations. Community members regularly hold protests outside the Wyatt’s walls to draw attention to people detained inside. Since Trump’s inauguration, there have been at least six such rallies.
One, on March 18, was for Schmidt. Outside the Wyatt, people chanted his name and held signs that read “FREE FABIAN” and “DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION.”
Schmidt heard them from inside. It gave him a surge of adrenaline. And a realization.
“Whoa,” he recalled thinking at the time. “This is bigger than myself.”
Schmidt spent his childhood traveling with his mother and stepfather, who worked as a tech consultant. He has lived in Denmark, South Africa, and England; he can read and write in four languages. When he was 16, his stepfather’s work brought the family to Palo Alto, California. His stepfather’s visa was for people with extraordinary abilities in their field — often called a “genius visa” — and granted Schmidt legal entry as a dependent. Schmidt rode horses, played football, and embraced his new home.
In 2022, he moved to Nashua to be closer to his mother, who had moved there. After a stint as a bartender, he found work as an electrical project lead at two affiliated companies: Greenerd Press & Machine Co., in Nashua, and Diamond Casting, in Hollis.
Ian Wilson, a process engineer at Diamond Casting, called Schmidt a crucial member of the company. “He’s upstanding, friendly, gregarious, and very energetic,” he said.

While bartending, Schmidt met and fell in love with Bhavani Hodgkins, who is now his fiancée. (Schmidt has an 8-year-old daughter from a previous relationship who lives with her mother in California.) He and Hodgkins have a black Lab named Django.
“This is where I’m from,” he said. “I love this country.”
Low-quality food, high fees
The Donald W. Wyatt Detention Facility opened in 1993 on the site of a former textile factory. At the time, it helped address a shortage in pre-trial federal jail space in New England. During the search for a suitable Rhode Island site, a few cities and towns opposed the facility. But long-struggling Central Falls saw an economic opportunity.
Shortly after the facility opened, then-Mayor Thomas Lazieh called the Wyatt “a win now and a much bigger win down the road.”
The ensuing years brought some payments from the detention center to the city; Central Falls received a total of $5.3 million in impact fees from Wyatt from 1994 through 2008, according to a 2012 joint legislative commission.
But Wyatt also brought escapes, lawsuits over detainee mistreatment, criminal charges against staff members and wardens, a receivership, and — most notably — the 2008 death of an ICE detainee involving medical neglect and mistreatment.
The death of that detainee, Hiu Lui “Jason” Ng, prompted ICE to withdraw from the Wyatt for a decade. In 2019, the agency returned, amid an outcry from community groups, the Rhode Island ACLU, and elected officials.
Today, the facility boasts a capacity of up to 730 adult male and 40 adult female detainees. According to a report in late March, the facility held 617 detainees for the U.S. Marshals Service (590 male, 27 female), and 116 detainees for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (112 male, 4 female). One of those male ICE detainees was Schmidt.
He was housed in 10-by-7-foot cells with thick, pneumatically locking steel doors. One cell looked out over Macomber Stadium, where Central Falls High School plays athletics.

The food was so bad, he said, he wouldn’t feed it to his dog. Breakfast was some kind of “oversalted…flour soup,” Schmidt said, along with a pinkish sausage of unknown origin, a dry piece of cornbread, and a serving of lukewarm milk. Lunch and dinner consisted of food that came from a can — chicken, green beans — and powdered potatoes that tasted like cardboard.
Schmidt’s account of the food provided at the Wyatt echoes a March report by the community organization Alliance to Mobilize Our Resistance (AMOR), which states, “In the first two weeks of March, AMOR received messages from 16 people detained by ICE who specified that they would not have enough to eat without help purchasing food from the Commissary.”
Schmidt was scared, sad, and depressed during his weeks at the Wyatt. He missed his daughter, his partner, his dog.
“Mentally, you have to learn how to block that out in prison or else you’ll ruin yourself,” he said. “You have to be able to be like, ‘OK, I’m not gonna miss my dog today.’”
In April, Hodgkins shared a note Schmidt wrote in a Facebook post: “Time moves differently in here. It drags, heavy and cruel…I haven’t seen the sky in weeks.”
After Schmidt was moved to the Wyatt, Hodgkins spent hours on the phone — with him, his family members, attorneys and others — trying to strategize how to secure his release and ensure his safety and comfort until then. She was forced to navigate the substantial financial burden of having a loved one detained at Wyatt.
To supplement the Wyatt’s food options, Schmidt needed to purchase food items from the commissary. He needed money to buy more toothpaste and soap because supplies issued to detainees didn’t last very long. Hodgkins created accounts so Schmidt could receive packages and communicate with her, via phone or video-chat.
“Every single thing that you do at the Wyatt Detention Facility requires (a) form of payment,” she said.
A receipt Hodgkins shared on Facebook shows, between March 12 and May 6, she spent more than $2,600 in deposits into the facility’s TouchPay system — deposits requiring fees ranging from around 6% of a deposit to more than 40%. In one instance, she was charged a $4.30 fee for a $10 deposit. The total fees, across 25 deposits, add up to more than $220. 
  A record of deposits Bhavani Hodgkins made into Fabian Schmidt’s commissary account shows the fees she paid during the 58 days he was held at the Wyatt Detention Center in Central Falls. (Screenshot)​​
Here, again, Hodgkins’ experiences aligned with conditions described in AMOR’s report, which says Wyatt contractors charge “exorbitant” rates for basic services, including phone calls, text messages, and food to supplement insufficient nutrition.
“In the first two weeks of March, 20 people detained reported to AMOR that calls were too expensive,” the report’s authors write. “During the same period, 43 individuals made new requests for Commissary help.”
As she navigated these new challenges, Hodgkins said she was dealing with waves of her own anger, anguish, and sadness. She was fearful for Fabian’s health and safety, that he would be deported, that they would lose the life they had built together.
Hodgkins rearranged her work schedule so she could make the 80-mile drive from Nashua to Central Falls in time to meet the facility’s strict rules that visitors arrive at least 30 minutes before visiting hours. During one visit, she saw an elderly woman with a walker turned away for arriving too late.
Hodgkins found the facility intimidating: a massive concrete building with small windows surrounded by tall razor wire fences. The “visits” were, in fact, a phone conversation with Schmidt while the two were separated by glass in a room lit by fluorescent lights. Once, when she washed her hands inside the facility, she noticed the water had a yellowish tinge.
“I really hope that no one has to go there to see their loved ones, because it’s truly horrible,” she said.
ICE did not respond to multiple requests for comment. When Rhode Island Current reached out to the Wyatt with detailed questions about the conditions both Hodgkins and Schmidt described, a spokesperson responded: “The Wyatt has no comment at this time.”
No problem with international travel in 2017
When protesters assembled outside the Wyatt on March 18 to call for Schmidt’s release, his lawyer, David Keller, said Schmidt’s past issues in California had been resolved and there hadn’t been any new official charges pressed against his client.
“Imagine yourself being charged with a crime, held, and not even knowing what the crime is,” he told reporters. “That’s essentially his situation.” (Keller was unavailable to comment for this story.)
About a week later, Schmidt finally learned the reason for his detention: a misdemeanor charge for drug possession from California that had already been resolved. Schmidt had pleaded no contest to the charge in 2015, despite disputing that the drugs were his; he was unaware that the controlled-substance conviction marked him in the immigration system as inadmissible. He said he was never notified of these implications of a no-contest plea, nor had he been stopped by CBP after an earlier international trip in 2017.
Once the immigration charges against Schmidt became clear, lawyers for Schmidt on both coasts swung into action. In California, a criminal attorney re-opened the drug case and was able to get it dismissed from the system. (Grounds for that dismissal: the substance Schmidt was charged with possessing had never been tested to confirm what it was.) In Boston, his immigration attorney worked to secure a hearing with an immigration judge.
The hearing finally happened on May 8. The judge dismissed Schmidt’s immigration case in minutes.










Time moves differently in here. It drags, heavy and cruel…I haven’t seen the sky in weeks.


– Note from Schmidt posted by Bhavani Hodgkins on Facebook


Schmidt and Hodgkins finally reunited outside of ICE’s Boston field office in Burlington, Massachusetts. The days since then have been joyful. Shortly after his release, Schmidt proposed to Hodgkins. He has enjoyed regular walks with his dog, cooking dinner with Hodgkins and reconnecting with friends.
But the couple’s life together is much different from the way it used to be. Schmidt estimates his time in custody cost him at least $65,000, between legal fees, lost wages, and the many costs of his Wyatt detention. An online fundraiser by his mother raised over $34,000. A second fundraiser launched by Hodgkins “to help aid other legal immigrants with injustice” is ongoing.
The emotional toll has also been steep. In the early days after his release, he couldn’t take a nap while home alone, afraid people might come for him while he was sleeping. Routine activities like a trip to the grocery store can now trigger waves of panic. He is wary about driving, fearful of being pulled over and detained again over a minor infraction.
“I have to be strong when he’s not, and I can’t show my fear as much because I don’t want him to get fearful,” Hodgkins said. “We’re going to spend the rest of our life healing from this trauma.”

The couple have embraced new roles as advocates for immigrants navigating an unforgiving system. They are calling for more transparency in the detention process, to spare others from the weeks of confusion they experienced. And they are speaking out against the heavy-handed response Schmidt faced for what was essentially a paperwork issue.
As dark as his experience was, Schmidt said he benefited from privileges many other ICE detainees lack. He’s a white man who speaks fluent English, with access to a top-notch legal team.
“I don’t even want to know what’s happening to other people,” he said.
Although the Wyatt holds immigration-related detainees, Hodgkins wants people to understand it is designed to hold criminals. She said the staff there had no interest in helping her with the logistics of visitation or keeping her partner comfortable and connected while inside.
“They’re not going to be nice to you,” she said. “They’re not going to be helpful to you.”
Schmidt went back to work in early June. When he was away, his projects were either put on hold, or his work had to be delegated to other people, Wilson, his coworker, said.
“I’m very relieved that he’s been released,” he said, “and very concerned for our judicial system.”
In a June 2 Facebook post, Hodgkins wrote about feeling anxious, even as Schmidt was excited about his first day back to work.
“No one prepares you for the fear and uncertainty that comes with being separated from a loved one under such traumatic circumstances,” she wrote.
“But today, we’re beginning to find our rhythm again.”

(Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)Could Virginia become part of a growing national movement to elect presidents based on securing the popular vote? 
Though America is in its 47th presidency (with many presidents serving multiple terms), just five times has a candidate won the popular vote but lost the election. Although the majority of Americans voted for the losing candidate in those contests, the winners garnered enough Electoral College votes to ascend to the White House. 
The most recent example of this came in 2016, when Democrat Hillary Clinton lost the presidency to Republican Donald Trump in 2016, despite winning the popular vote. In 2000, Democrat Al Gore was also defeated despite earning the popular vote, and lost to former President George W. Bush.
National Popular Vote, a bipartisan network of advocates nationwide, is examining whether the outcome of Virginia’s gubernatorial and House of Delegates elections could influence the state to join a growing coalition of states to support the popular vote. The organization has advocated for an interstate compact where participating states agree to honor whichever presidential candidate wins the national popular vote.
Any potential movement on the matter in Virginia would not get started until next year when the 2026 legislative session convenes. However it is a debate, typically led by Democrats, that Virginia’s legislature has explored before. 
An effort for Virginia to join the interstate compact cleared the House of Delegates in 2020 before falling in the state Senate. Lawmakers have also presented the measure again in subsequent years, but it has failed to advance. 
So far, 17 states and the District of Columbia have agreed to a compact modeled by National Popular Vote. The agreement outlines how states’ electoral colleges would award all of their votes to whichever candidate gets the most votes nationwide.
Currently, presidential candidates need to win 270 electoral college votes to win — and each amount of electoral college votes is apportioned by the population size of each state. Enough states have signed onto the NPV measure to account for 209 electoral college votes, and should Virginia join, it would add 13 more. 
Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger declined to weigh in on whether or not she would sign a bill to join the compact and staff for Republican nominee Winsome Earle-Sears did not respond by the time of this publication. 
The popular vote proposal is not without pushback. The electoral college process often receives fresh scrutiny each time a presidential election occurs — and particularly when it benefits a candidate who failed to win the popular vote. But the electoral college is meant to be the counterweight to states with larger populations; each state, large or small, has a different number of electoral college votes allotted to them. 
The conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation has defended the electoral college process. “Large cities like New York City and Los Angeles should not get to unilaterally dictate policies that affect more rural states, like North Dakota and Indiana,” the statement said. The Heritage Foundation has been a policy recommendation source for Republicans including Trump for the past several decades.
More than a rural/urban divide, sometimes electoral college debates fall along partisan lines too. 
National Popular Vote has bipartisan members, while groups like The Heritage Foundation support conservative and Republican candidates and coalitions nationwide. Cities like New York City and Los Angeles represent predominantly liberal-leaning large localities in large U.S. states, which proponents of the electoral college argue could carry too much weight without it. 
But former chairman of Michigan’s Republican Party Saul Anuzis said the idea of reform shouldn’t be partisan. He also serves as a National Popular Vote advisor. 
“This isn’t a Republican or Democratic idea — it’s a small-d democratic one,” he said.
Anuzis noted that presidential candidates focus on states that are considered swing states during election cycles, instead of engaging more deeply with voters nationwide. 
Though a politically purple state, having oscillated between partisan control of its legislature and governorship, Virginia has not been as frequent a campaign destination for presidential hopefuls as other states have been.
“When the compact kicks in, you’d see candidates campaigning for votes in Richmond, Roanoke and throughout Virginia, not just Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Arizona,” Anuzis suggested. “That’s how you rebuild trust and make elections feel like they belong to everyone.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods / Virginia Mercury)Many signs suggest a comfortable victory this fall for Democrat Abigail Spanberger against Republican Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia’s gubernatorial contest. Spanberger had $14.3 million in cash on hand this month compared to just $3 million for Earle-Sears, the current lieutenant governor. Spanberger, a former congresswoman, has led in early polls, including a whopping 17-point advantage in a Roanoke College survey in May. (Yeah, I know, many Virginians aren’t tuned in yet, so that barometer is shaky.)
Earle-Sears, meanwhile, is the standard-bearer for Donald Trump’s party in a state that’s voted against him three times in presidential contests. He’s tried to recklessly chop the federal workforce; some 341,000 federal workers lived here in 2023. Also, Black candidates have struggled to win statewide contests in Virginia – Earle-Sears’ own victory in 2021 notwithstanding.
No matter. Spanberger would be smart not to underestimate Earle-Sears. The latter has lost contests in the past, but she’s garnered her share of impressive victories, too. Few pundits thought she would unseat longtime Del. Billy Robinson in a Norfolk district in 2001.
I scoff at Earle-Sears’ television ad saying she’s not a “typical politician,” given she hews to the ultra-right party line on social and some economic issues. She faces a herculean challenge. Lots can change, though, between now and November. Spanberger should recognize that.

Please check to see if you’re immunized against measles, a disease that can kill. Virginia has had three confirmed cases this year, and an international traveler who landed at Dulles airport this month journeyed around the metro Washington area, The Washington Post reported.
“Measles is more than just a rash,” and up to one in five cases require hospitalization, Emily Rich, epidemiologist with the vaccine preventable disease team at the Virginia Department of Health, told me. Some people “even have fatal complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis.”
Health care officials recommend children get two doses of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. If you’re born before 1957, you should be protected, VDH says. If you’re not sure of your status, talk to your doctor or other health care provider, Rich said. VDH has a website where you can request immunization records. As of June 12, federal officials have reported nearly 1,200 confirmed measles cases nationwide.
It would’ve helped if Trump hadn’t given the reins of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., founder of an anti-vaccine group. That was a huge middle finger to all Americans.
  A homeless encampment in downtown Richmond. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)
I get it: Virginia Beach, the commonwealth’s largest city, has a duty to keep neighborhoods livable and safe by clearing up homeless encampments. I just wish the tenor of a recent news story had discussed more about the current conditions of people who had formerly lived in those makeshift places.
The city has cleared 100 such encampments since the spring of 2024. Those actions increased after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in Grants Pass v. Johnson last June, that municipalities can enforce bans on homeless people sleeping outside in public places. The fact that homeless individuals create so many encampments suggests the magnitude of the problem – and the lack of affordable housing.
A one-day tally in January found 327 homeless people in Virginia Beach; the number is almost certainly lower than the actual total because it depends on whom the volunteers can locate that day.
Pam Shine, the city’s homeless services administrator, said through a spokesperson that about 20 people formerly in these encampments “have connected to shelter” and 10 have been housed since April 2024.
To be fair, some 138 permanent supportive housing units are designated for Virginia Beach at SupportWorks Housing complexes (formerly Virginia Supportive Housing). There are also 88 single shelter beds and 40 shelter beds for families with young children at the city’s Housing Resource Center, which opened in 2018.

The state is sending Virginians cash this week. Yes, really.
A new law means unclaimed money automatically will go to the “rightful owners,” according to axios.com. Before, you had to file a claim with the state Department of Treasury’s Unclaimed Property Division to get money from misplaced bank accounts, uncashed checks, utility deposits and more.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed the bill into law in March, requiring the state to return unclaimed funds valued at up to $5,000 owed directly to you. Find out more at vamoneysearch.gov. In fact, if you’ve lived in several places, it’s a good idea to check those individual states periodically. Trust me on this.
You can start a nationwide search at missingmoney.com, which bills itself as the “official Unclaimed Property website of the National Association of State Treasurers.”

I thought for sure Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who explicitly warned protesters beforehand at “No Kings” rallies that they’d be arrested if they broke the law on June 14, would’ve publicly condemned a motorist who, police say, drove his SUV into a crowd in Culpeper that day as a rally was ending. ’Tis a puzzlement, his silence.
One person was struck, though police reported no injuries in the Culpeper incident. Police charged a 21-year-old man in the case.
The rallies nationwide protested President Trump’s authoritarian actions while in office this term. They drowned out the obscene, costly, sparsely attended parade that Trump hosted Saturday on his 79th birthday and the Army’s 250th anniversary.

Your food and drink orders in Virginia may start to look a little different.
Starting July 1, large food vendors across the state will no longer be allowed to use single-use expanded polystyrene, a plastic foam material commonly referred to by the brand name Styrofoam. That includes plates, cups, bowls, trays and hinged containers.
State lawmakers passed the ban four years ago, following the lead of others such as Maryland, New York and Washington, D.C. Implementation was delayed. Gov. Glenn Youngkin tried unsuccessfully to push it further through a proposed budget amendment earlier this year.
For now, it only covers food vendors with 20 or more locations in Virginia, including restaurants, grocery stores, food trucks and caterers.
The law also applies to schools and community groups that use food programs such as the National School Lunch Program.
Next July, the ban will expand to all food vendors in Virginia.
Advocates say Styrofoam, though cheap to purchase, is harmful to the environment and contributes to global plastic pollution.
The material breaks apart easily, allowing bits to get loose and become litter. It also takes hundreds, or even thousands, of years to decompose and can leach toxic chemicals.




Virginia Department Of Environmental Quality




State officials launched a “Foam Free Virginia” campaign in line with the legislation.
The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality recommends using reusable containers, paper products, recyclable plastic, foil or metal instead of polystyrene.
Food vendors are allowed to request a one-year exemption from their local government, demonstrating that they have no reasonable alternative and compliance would “cause significant economic hardship.”
People who violate the new law could face civil penalties of up to $50 per day, which would go into the state’s Litter Control and Recycling Fund or to the locality.
DEQ says people who want to file a complaint about ban violations should reach out to the locality where the food vendor is operating.",https://virginiamercury.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/styrofoam-1024x700.jpg,,,2025-06-23 06:04:17.032566

But there is a downside in the age of AI. (Photo illustration by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)My name is a catfish. Or, so I’ve been told. When you hear the name Jamie Jung, you might wonder if the face behind this article is a Korean girl or the great-grandson of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung. A name so mysterious, perhaps even AI would struggle to decipher my identity in my job application.
When the pandemic pivoted classrooms to Zoom, I hid behind a faceless black square, only two words revealing my name.. When calling attendance, many of my teachers would pronounce my last name with a German J as “Yoong” or refer to me with the pronouns “he” or “him.” Others would sound my name out phonetically “Jung” and refer to me as “she” or “her.”  
As much as I enjoyed the curtain of anonymity, I have come to recognize there is a downside.
Companies such as Microsoft and Amazon delegate resume screening to AI tools in order to sift through countless applications from job-seekers. AI tools continue to evolve but there should be more attention on the flaws in algorithmic analysis, such as oversimplification and evaluation bias.
In 2014, Amazon attempted to automate its hiring process by building a computer program that would review applicants’ resumes and spit out a list of the top candidates. The computers were trained to assess applicants by observing resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period. The problem? A majority of the applicants were men, which unintentionally taught the algorithm that male candidates were superior.
The impact of algorithmic bias is not limited to gender. A 2024 study from the University of Washington reported computer models favored white-associated names in 85.1% of cases and female-associated names in only 11.1% of cases. In 2017, the University of Toronto released a study that revealed applicants with Asian names had a 28% reduced likelihood of receiving interviews compared to applicants with Anglo names. 
This pattern of discrimination even within a recruitment process solely managed by humans establishes a foundation already tainted with bias. Despite the growing diversity of the American workforce, the lack of leadership opportunities given to underrepresented communities serves as evidence of the lasting effects of systemic discrimination. According to the National Library of Medicine, although 74% of health care professionals are women, only 33% of management positions were filled by women. Similarly, while Black employees comprise 14% of all U.S. employees, only 7% of managers are Black. 










When you hear the name Jamie Jung, you might wonder if the face behind this article is a Korean girl or the great-grandson of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung.


AI has the potential to revolutionize the workplace. Automating monotonous tasks within the hiring process allows employees to maximize productivity, and many human resource managers have recognized these benefits. 
But by analyzing existing demographics of the workforce, algorithms can deduce that “‘top”’ applicants who fit the standard are white men. As long as this foundation remains skewed, AI will continue to exclude talented applicants based on an outdated algorithm.
A survey by CareerBuilder states 55% of HR managers say AI will become a regular part of HR in the next five years. Although the prospects of an efficient recruitment process are appealing, managers must evaluate the current state of their workforce before integrating AI algorithms in order to provide a fair opportunity for all applicants. 
By prioritizing equal representation even before implementing AI, companies will be able to utilize algorithms with less worries about bias. The innovation of AI begins with human reflection and revision.
AI assumes that I am only what my name allows me to be, ignoring the scope of my accomplishments. I only started going by Jamie in my freshman year of high school, and I thrived under this new ambiguous identity: that year, I became the social media manager of two clubs, was selected to present a TEDx Talk, and was awarded “Freshman Writer of the Year” by my conservatory’s director. When I introduced myself in person the next school year, I was amused by the look of surprise on many of my teachers’ and classmates’ faces. It was clear I was not who they expected me to be. 
What’s in a name? According to AI algorithms, a name is the reflection of our identities and the face behind these words. I wonder if I had introduced myself as Jaehee Jung, or if I had turned on my camera to reveal my true identity, would I have had the opportunities I did? 
Maybe. My name is a gift I gave myself in search of belonging. Now I am searching to make this name my own. Not with recognition or achievements, but with the person I am behind the black square. And only I hold the power to decide when to turn it on or off.

(Jim Neuger/ Maine Morning Star)With the Maine Legislature mostly done with its work, Gov. Janet Mills is poised to sign hundreds of bills into law. But there are two measures to expand tribal rights in Maine that advocates worry may be bound for the veto pen.
One bill would prevent the state from being able to seize tribal land for public use — a protection granted to most other federally recognized tribes in the U.S. The other would give the Wabanaki Nations exclusive rights to operate internet gaming in Maine.
The bills represent the latest efforts to expand recognition of tribal sovereignty since the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act excluded the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, Mi’kmaq Nation, Passamaquoddy Tribe, and Penobscot Nation from many rights and protections guaranteed by federal Indian Law. 
So far, sweeping changes to the Settlement Act have failed because of Mills’ opposition (an omnibus bill has been carried over to next year, so there’s still potential for this to change). Instead, the governor, lawmakers and Wabanaki leaders have successfully made some targeted reforms. 
Still, it remains to be seen if these two — land seizure and gaming policy — make the cut, highlighting the real challenge the Wabanaki Nations are up against: a state government that refuses to see the tribes as inherently independent nations.
I had a flashback to my high school physics class when reading Emma Davis’ reporting on the debate around these two bills. Stick with me.
There’s a philosophical argument, known as Zeno’s dichotomy paradox, that essentially reasons that if you are trying to reach a specific destination, and you go halfway there, and you go halfway there again, and you go halfway there again, you’ll never actually arrive at your end point. You’ll always be an incremental distance away. I’m oversimplifying it, but this paradox was one of many that ancient Greeks would muddle over in pondering questions of space, time, motion, etc. 
That seems to be the approach Maine officials are taking to tribal rights.
During the Judiciary Committee’s April work session on the eminent domain bill, the Mills administration announced its opposition, despite some concessions made by the tribes and bill sponsors.
“It is impossible to know how the eventual location of these lands could impact public transportation needs in coming years, and certainly not decades into the future,” Meghan Russo, director of government affairs at Maine Department of Transportation, wrote in testimony, echoing other comments made by the governor’s counsel, Jerry Reid.
Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn) countered that it’s an issue the state shouldn’t be in a position of debating. 
“I fundamentally think of our relationship with the tribes as a government-to-government relationship,” Lee said. “We can’t take a part of New Hampshire. We can’t take a part of Greenland or Panama,” Lee added, referring to President Donald Trump’s desires to do so.
Maine’s relationship with the tribes cannot be based on the state’s needs. It must be based on mutual trust and respect.
Similarly, the gaming bill would grant the Wabanaki the rights provided in the federal Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, which codified that tribes have the exclusive right to regulate gaming on their lands, unless the state in which it operates prohibits such gaming under its criminal laws. 
But some lawmakers are nervous about the expansion of gambling, particularly without full control over its regulation. 
Mills has not vetoed these bills yet, though tribal leaders told Davis they are not optimistic.
The eminent domain bill passed the House 86-60 with 11 Republicans joining the Democratic majority, while the Senate passed the measure 20-12. The gaming bill passed the House 85-59 but barely squeaked through the Senate. Though a majority of lawmakers support these measures, it is not enough to overcome a veto.
With Mills’ approach, taking incremental steps toward sovereignty while refusing to step back and accept the totality of the landscape, tribal sovereignty for now remains an unreachable destination.

Bipartisanship is in precious short supply these days in politics and that makes it especially tragic when elected officials waste rare opportunities to advance it.
Unfortunately, that’s what’s happening in the North Carolina Senate.
In its original form, House Bil 805 was a commonsense proposal to crack down on the sexual exploitation of women and children. It passed 113-0.
Last week, however, Senate Republicans took this important bill and loaded it up with several deeply controversial and divisive items from the far right social agenda.
Among the changes: provisions designed to make it harder for transgender people to get the health care they need and a series of new burdens on public school teachers and librarians that will create banned book lists and allow parents to veto instruction in subjects (like evolution) they claim offend their religious beliefs.
The bottom line: The Senate amendments ruin an important bipartisan bill with divisive and ill-conceived changes. The House should reject them.

(Getty Images)Surprise ambulance billing may soon become a thing of the past in New Hampshire.
Over the past few months, several lawmakers have proposed competing bills meant to address the struggles of patients who ride in an ambulance and end up surprised with massive bills after the fact. One such bill, Senate Bill 245, has now been approved by the House and Senate and is headed to Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s desk. Ayotte will have the options of signing it into law, vetoing it, or allowing it to enter into law without her signature.
Balanced billing, also known as surprise billing, happens when the price of an ambulance ride exceeds what an insurance company is willing to pay, and so the ambulance provider charges the customer the difference. SB 245 bans that practice.
“That’s the one thing we could all agree,” Sen. Suzanne Prentiss, a West Lebanon Democrat and the sponsor of SB 245, said. “But how to get there is where we had disagreement.”
SB 245 also mandates the rate providers can charge for ambulance rides. Starting in 2026, ambulance providers will be reimbursed by insurers at 325% of the federal Medicare rate. After two years, the state Insurance Department will complete an actuarial cost study to decide whether the rate should change, taking into account inflation and market factors.
SB 245 beat out several other bills targeting the same issue. House Bill 316, for example, also banned balanced billing and set a rate providers could charge. However, HB 316 incorporated an actuarial cost study previously commissioned by the Insurance Department to set a rate of 202% of the federal Medicare rate.
“The fundamental problem in this whole issue is that the Legislature’s mission is to get rid of balanced billing,” Rep. John Hunt, a Rindge Republican and the sponsor of HB 316, “That is maybe counterintuitive to what is the ambulances’ mission, which is to get private insurance to pay for the shortfall.”
Hunt said getting insurers to pay that shortfall “was a nonstarter; it was never going to happen.” So instead he worked to come up with a rate he believed was fair for both the insurers and providers by basing it on the actuarial study. 
Hunt believes municipalities should be supporting their public ambulance providers with more tax money. He also says ambulance providers should start charging patients who they treat but don’t transport.
When Hunt’s proposal, HB 316, passed the House in March, it was met with opposition from ambulance providers and some lawmakers who argued it wouldn’t pay enough to support the ambulance rides. They also argued the study used to derive that number was flawed because it didn’t properly take into account differences among communities.
“In 235 cities and towns, it’s done different ways,” Prentiss said. “Sometimes the government provides it. Sometimes a private sector provides it. Sometimes volunteers. Sometimes it’s paid career. All of these things make a big difference in what it costs you to do business.”
She said there’s “mismatch” in the field where insurers do not have such wide variety in their own work.
“So I can’t blame them 100%,” she said. “I just think there’s like these two worlds trying to come together.”
That’s why Prentiss feels action is needed to set the rates. She also hopes her bill can encourage more providers to become in-network with insurers.
Prentiss, who herself works for an ambulance provider outside of her duties as a state senator, also deemed HB 316’s rate too low and set the rate in her bill at 325% indefinitely.
Hunt thinks 325% was too much.
“As far as I’m concerned, they plucked the number out of thin air,” Hunt said.
Prentiss served on an advisory committee for the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in 2023 and 2024. She said she came up with the rate based on her work there looking at what other states have done.
Backers of the two bills ultimately came to a compromise. They amended SB 245 to make 325% the rate for ambulance billing for two years instead of indefinitely — at which point the actuarial study determines a new rate — and they added a provision from HB 316 creating a commission to monitor the rates and the system as a whole.
“It sucks because we’re giving you guys (ambulance providers) this windfall for the next two years,” Hunt said. “At the end of the day, our mission was to get rid of balanced billing. That was the bogey that we were going after.”
He added that the rate in SB 245 is “125% more than (providers) deserve, but that was the compromise to get rid of balanced billing.”
Prentiss is happy with the compromise.
“I’m really proud of it,” she said. “I think the insurance industry came to the table. I think the Department of Insurance came to the table. I think that House Commerce, who initially had a completely different position, they came to the table. Everybody had to give something on this to get to go, and it’s going to be interesting to watch the next two years, but we’re all tied to this. And again, the common goal everyone could agree on was prohibiting balance billing and stabilizing the EMS system, but we had to do something. This has been going on for too long.”
Hunt, meanwhile, offered some advice to ambulance providers: “You guys have a huge windfall and all I can say is don’t blow it. Don’t start giving each other raises and doing all kinds of things because you’re getting this windfall, because clearly 325 (%) is way over the top.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ambulancenight-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-23 06:04:17.032566

(Photo by Anna Claire Vollers/Stateline)HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Mike Leslie, 66, sits at a desk beneath the buzz of fluorescent office lights, his fingers hovering over his new laptop keyboard. He smiles, eyes crinkling beneath a worn baseball cap. It’s a place he never imagined he’d be sitting.
Before last year, he’d never used a computer.
For most of his life, Leslie hadn’t needed one. He spent 36 years in pipe manufacturing near his North Alabama hometown, in jobs that included welding, driving forklifts, mixing concrete and running crews as a foreman. The work was hard and physical, but he didn’t mind.
Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Layoffs followed.
Leslie found himself looking for a job to make ends meet, at an age when more affluent men might think of retiring. He was no longer suited for manufacturing work. But he also lacked experience with the technology that now powers even the most basic tasks in nearly every modern workplace, such as the internet, email and Microsoft Office.
“A lot of people think old people are obsolete, but they’re not,” he said. “There’s a lot of knowledge in their heads. They just need the opportunity to get it out and learn new things.”
His life’s unexpected second act began in late 2023, thanks to an obscure state-federal initiative called the Senior Community Service Employment Program. For people ages 55 and older with low incomes, it provides paid part-time work at local nonprofits and government agencies such as libraries, senior centers and the Red Cross. Its on-the-job training is meant to prepare participants to transition into permanent jobs.
But 700 miles away in Washington, D.C., Congress is considering axing the funding for the very program that has made this new chapter of Leslie’s life possible. In his budget for the coming fiscal year, President Donald Trump has recommended eliminating this and some other programs that fall under the Older Americans Act, a landmark 1965 law that provides social and meal services for older people. The U.S. House also proposed eliminating the employment program’s funding, while the Senate proposed keeping it.
At this point, experts say, anything is possible.
Advocates fear that the loss of this program, which serves about 50,000 older adults nationwide, could affect not just participants like Leslie, but also stretch further into communities, removing tens of thousands of employees from local libraries, city recreation facilities and senior centers.
Isolated and unsure
Sitting at home post-layoff, Leslie felt isolated and unsure about what to do next. A friend told him about the job program, and he eventually decided to apply. He got in.
Medicaid cuts may disproportionately affect Black, Latino doctors and their patients

Now he helps manage the fleet of vehicles at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, a multicounty agency based in Huntsville that provides support services to older Americans and people with disabilities. As part of the program, he enrolled in a digital certification program that provided him with a laptop, prepaid internet access and a 10-week education course that taught him the basics of the Microsoft Office suite, email, internet, social media and other skills.
For Leslie, it’s been a foothold into a workforce that felt like it had moved on without him.
“You’ve got purpose,” he says, “getting up every morning, coming to a job you like.”
He’s a favorite around the office, where everyone calls him “Mr. Mike.”
In April, he wore a three-piece suit to the officewide celebration where he received a graduation certificate for acing his digital skills courses. He made his co-workers cry as he told them about how the program had given him his confidence back.
‘Lost in D.C.’
On a recent Wednesday afternoon, in a conference room not far from Leslie’s desk, some of his managers at the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments, known as TARCOG, were sitting around a table discussing what to do.
It had been a chaotic few months. TARCOG is responsible for administering many services for older people, from Meals on Wheels to transportation, caregiver support to services that prevent abuse and exploitation.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration began to dismantle the federal agency responsible for overseeing such services, while his proposed federal budget recommended cutting or freezing spending on them, including the employment program.
Michelle Jordan, TARCOG’s executive director, had been fielding questions from local leaders who were aghast that Meals on Wheels might be canceled. Across the country, national and local advocates at similar agencies sounded the alarm. In some states, local groups like TARCOG have reported delays in receiving federal funds they were promised.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration reversed course and recommended that most of the programs for older adults continue under a new federal agency.










These are people who worked hard all their lives. But they can’t pay the heating bill. They have to decide between medicine and groceries.


– Nancy Robertson, former executive director of the Top of Alabama Regional Council of Governments


But a few of the Older Americans Act programs would be left without funding. One of the largest is the senior employment program.
“These are real people, and I think that gets lost in D.C.,” said Sheila Dessau-Ivey, who directs the aging programs at TARCOG. “They just see programs and dollars, and say, ‘Well, we don’t need these.’ But those dollars are actually attached to a human life.”
The Senior Community Service Employment Program is a tiny fraction of the size of budgetary behemoths such as Medicaid and Medicare. Its budget is about $400 million and it serves about 50,000 older people nationwide each year. Eighty-six of those slots — including Leslie’s — are in the five-county swath of North Alabama served by TARCOG.
To qualify under the nationwide Senior Community Service Employment Program, a person must be at least 55 years old, unemployed, and have a family income of no more than 125% of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that’s currently $19,562 a year. Veterans are given priority in the program, as are people with disabilities, rural residents, people over age 65 and those experiencing homelessness. Funding comes mainly through the U.S. Department of Labor.
“We’ve had workers who were homeless when they started this program,” Jordan said. Past research found about 3 in 5 participants nationally reported being homeless or at risk of homelessness.
“You forget there are people living with us, sitting next to us in church, going to the grocery store with us, who just don’t have those skills or that confidence,” she said.
And it has an outsize impact on other vulnerable groups. In 2019, about two-thirds of participants were women, and about 44% were Black, according to research. A majority of participants reported having a high school diploma or less.
“These are people who worked hard all their lives, but they can’t pay the heating bill,” said Nancy Robertson, TARCOG’s retired former executive director, who’d come into the office to lend her experience to the group discussing how to advocate for funding.
“They have to decide between medicine and groceries.”
The program participants aren’t the only ones that would be hurt by the loss of the program, she said.
Participants can stay in the program up to four years. While they’re there, they provide more than 40 million hours of work to public and nonprofit agencies across the nation. The agencies and community groups that hire the participants — with salaries paid by the program — would lose those employees. An employee working in a small-town library, for example, might be the only reason the library is able to remain open for certain hours.
In Huntsville, the local senior center would lose 14 of its employees if the employment program closes. Across town at a community rec center, a beloved 91-year-old receptionist would lose the job she trained for.
Congressional chaos
The U.S. population is aging rapidly. In 2003, about 1 in 7 people in the U.S. labor force was 55 or older. By 2023, that share was nearly 1 in 4. One of the looming challenges for lawmakers and community advocates is how to keep older people healthy and thriving.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

As Republicans consider adding work requirements to programs like Medicaid, cutting funding for a work program designed to help older people doesn’t make sense, said Marci Phillips, director of public policy and advocacy at the National Council on Aging, a nonprofit organization focused on issues that affect older adults.
“If people age 55 and older have to show they’re working to qualify for Medicaid, but [lawmakers] are cutting the federal program to help workers age 55 and older, there’s a disconnect there,” she said.
Some lawmakers question the usefulness of the program. In 2019, only about 38% of participants who exited the program were employed a few months later, according to a 2022 study. That share was below the U.S. Department of Labor’s goal of 42%. Median earnings were also below federal goals.
Phillips said the program shouldn’t be judged by the metrics that are used to measure whether a traditional workforce development program is succeeding.
“These are older adults who have to work, but the realities of their health and their caregiving situations aren’t changing,” she said. “It’s a standard that doesn’t really recognize the population we’re trying to serve.”
Programs that are funded under the Older Americans Act are discretionary, meaning Congress can’t cut or eliminate them in the reconciliation bill that’s currently before the Senate and that has generated public outcry over potential cuts to programs including Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.
Trump has recommended eliminating funding for the employment program, but ultimately its fate lies in the hands of Congress.
The U.S. House is scheduled to take up the appropriations bill that provides funding for these programs the week of July 20. The Senate’s plans are less certain, as its members remain focused on Trump’s reconciliation bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. And it’s conceivable, Phillips said, that Congress may instead pass a continuing resolution, a temporary measure that keeps the government funded at current levels.
For his part, Leslie would like to travel to Washington to testify before Congress. If anyone understands the needs of older Americans, he figures, it’s them.
“Society looks at older people as not useful, but if you look at the people in Congress, they’re old folks too,” Leslie said. “If you’re old, why would you not want another older person to have something, to learn something?”
Future possibilities
Leslie is studying to earn his license as a private investigator. It’s a job he’s always wanted, and now he feels like he has the skills he needs to chase that dream.
He’s also trying to organize a workshop this fall to be held at his church, Beaver Dam Primitive Baptist, where he hopes he and some of his TARCOG co-workers can share about services and programs available to help older adults.
“We’ve got 26 churches in our association, so we’ve reached out to all of them, saying there’s these things you need to know about,” Leslie said. “If I had known about some of this stuff when my dad was living, he may have had a better quality of life.”
He doesn’t know if his own program will be one of those still available by then, but he’s hopeful.
He believes the biggest reward has been less tangible than the modest paycheck and newfound computer skills, but more profound: The sense that his life has opened back up, full of possibilities.
“Senior citizens have a purpose in this world, and we can’t think that because they’re old we can just throw them away,” Leslie said. “They’ve still got knowledge. I think we should give them every chance to succeed.”

The state recently contracted with a new investment firm to invest Legacy Fund money into in-state private infrastructure. (Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota plans to invest up to $150 million of Legacy Fund money in-state into land, infrastructure, agriculture and natural resources as part of a new agreement with investment firm GCM Grosvenor.
The Legacy Fund is a trust fund for the state made from oil tax revenue. The fund, which as of March was valued at nearly $12 billion, is meant to create a source of reliable income for North Dakota even after the state’s energy industry tapers off.
The Legislature made a commitment during the 2021 session to invest more Legacy Fund dollars in-state, with the goal of making money for North Dakota while also stimulating its economy.
The state has set a goal of investing $600 million into North Dakota equity. The partnership with GCM Grosvenor to invest $150 million is part of that. The money is expected to go largely to private infrastructure, including for the energy and technology industries, according to the state Retirement and Investment Office, which administers the Legacy Fund.
“All North Dakotans will benefit through increased opportunity, a broader tax base, and a stronger foundation for future growth,” Rep. Jonathan Warrey, who chairs the Legacy and Budget Stabilization Fund Advisory Board, said in an announcement this month.
Legacy Fund in-state investment program poses tricky transparency questions

A 2024 poll conducted by the North Dakota News Cooperative showed support for in-state investment of Legacy Fund dollars, with 68% of voters surveyed saying they want Legacy Fund investments to be made “within the state of North Dakota.”
The state anticipates it taking about three years for GCM Grosvenor to invest the money.
GCM Grosvenor is an investment firm based in Chicago. The State Investment Board already works with the firm, as it manages some other Legacy Fund investments.
“Because the investment strategy is project-focused rather than company-focused, there is no requirement for GCM Grosvenor to establish a North Dakota office,” Retirement and Investment Office Executive Director Jodi Smith said in an email to the North Dakota Monitor.
The state has already committed $250 million of the $600 million for a very different purpose: private capital investments. That money — which has gone to North Dakota companies in sectors including health care, construction, energy and more — has been managed by firm 50 South Capital since 2021. According to the Retirement and Investment Office, 50 South has committed $111.5 million of this money so far.
The state expects it to take until about 2030 for the state to invest the full $600 million.
North Dakota also puts Legacy Fund money into public infrastructure through loans issued by the Bank of North Dakota. These fixed-income investments commonly go to road improvements, according to the Retirement and Investment Office.
The in-state investment program is managed by the Retirement and Investment Office and is overseen by the State Investment Board, which Gov. Kelly Armstrong chairs.

Ohio Senate Bill 1 goes into effect Friday. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine signed S.B. 1 into law on March 28 after it quickly passed the House and Senate earlier this year. 
S.B. 1 creates post-tenure reviews, puts diversity scholarships at risk, sets rules around classroom discussion, and creates a retrenchment provision that blocks unions from negotiating on tenure, among other things. The law affects Ohio’s public universities and community colleges.

Higher education institutions have already been feeling the effects of the law before it’s even gone into effect.  
The new law is making things more difficult for faculty and administrators, said University of Cincinnati American Association of University Professors President Stephen Mockabee.
“We’re spending time figuring out how to comply with all these state mandates, rather than focusing on research and teaching,” he said. 
The biggest short term effect higher education institutions are seeing from S.B. 1 having a hard time attracting quality candidates — ranging from full-time faculty to graduate student positions, said Sara Kilpatrick, executive director of the Ohio Conference of AAUP. 
“We are seeing to a very high degree people withdrawing their name from consideration if they did apply for a position in Ohio,” she said. “I’m hearing this on a regular basis from people that are involved in those search processes.” 
Ohio State University History Professor Chris Nichols said he knows graduate students who were offered fellowships, but turned them down because of the new law.
“Any little thing could tip the balance for them,” he said. “If they’ve got an offer from Michigan and an offer from (Ohio State), Michigan is more hospitable right now, so that’s where they’re going, even if all other things are equal.” 
The University of Michigan’s astronomy department had 435 graduate school applicants this year compared to Ohio State’s astronomy department, which only had 269 graduate school applicants this year, said Laura Lopez, an Ohio State astronomy professor.
“We are comparable PhD programs, so I think their greater applicant numbers are an indication of how S.B.1 or other legislation is impacting our pool,” she said.
Mockabee said all of their job candidates have asked about S.B. 1.
“It’s not going to make it any easier to recruit,” he said. “In the long term, my concern is that we won’t be able to retain people that we’re going to see a brain drain in Ohio.” 
Some of Ohio’s public universities have started making decisions because of the new law. Ohio University announced it will close the Pride Center, the Women’s Center and the Multicultural Center. 
The University of Toledo is suspending nine undergraduate programs. Kent State University is closing its LGBTQ+ Center, Women’s Center and Student Multicultural Center. 
“With multicultural centers being dismantled and the LGBTQ+ centers being dismantled, and the censoring of topics that we’re going to be allowed to talk about, it’s just going to totally change the dynamic of campuses and classrooms,” said Kali Barcroft, a Miami University sophomore. 
She looked at colleges out of state and ultimately chose to stay in Ohio to be close to family, but admits things would be different if this new law had been in effect.
“If (S.B. 1) was happening when I was still looking at colleges, I would be in North Carolina,” Barcroft said. 
The bill also has had a chilling effect on what courses faculty plan on teaching this fall.   
“(Faculty have) said they don’t want to teach a class like African American history because they’re afraid it might be too controversial right now or some of our new hires aren’t proposing new classes that might cause some backlash,” Nichols said. “There’s no doubt we have a chilling effect happening on classes that are proposed.”
Some faculty and staff at universities are afraid to speak out publicly against the new law, Nichols said. 
“I think some of our most vulnerable people are feeling very at risk, and they really don’t want to stick their heads up,” he said. 
State Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, introduced the bill in January at the start of the General Assembly. 
“Without the very best educational system, we will not have a properly trained workforce, and without a trained workforce, we will not have a robust economy here in Ohio,” Cirino said in April during a City Club of Cleveland forum. “This law will not be ignored. It will be welcomed.” 
Members of Youngstown State University’s chapter of the Ohio Education Association are trying to get a referendum on the Nov. 4 ballot to stop S.B. 1. They have been collecting signatures since May and plan on submitting them to Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose this week.  
About 248,092 signatures are needed — 6% of the total vote cast for governor during the last gubernatorial election. The signatures must be from at least 44 of Ohio’s 88 counties. 
LaRose will then need to verify the signatures before the measure is referred to the Ohio Ballot Board to determine the language that would appear on the November ballot.

(Screenshot photo courtesy of The Ohio Channel)Recent hearings on two different resolutions related to Ohio’s support of a convention to amend the U.S. Constitution showed the strong but mixed opinions that surround the issue.
The Ohio Senate General Government Committee heard from a national group that’s leading the movement to start a constitutional convention, as well as individuals who say the idea is experimental and possibly dangerous.
The committee was reviewing Senate Joint Resolution 3, which would apply for a constitutional convention to limit federal power.
A constitutional convention can only be held if 34 state legislatures approve an application for such a convention by invoking Article V of the Constitution. The application must have a specific purpose in mind, such as a balanced federal budget or congressional term limits.
Republican state legislators have introduced bills to bring Ohio into the fold of states with applications, which currently sits at 19.
The Senate bill reviewed recently and its companion bill in the House look to amend the constitution with measures that “impose fiscal restraints on the federal government” and “limit the power and jurisdiction of the federal government,” while another set of companion bills in the Ohio House and Senate specifically support congressional term limits.
A constitutional convention has not been held in the history of the United States, and while numerous states have approved applications over the years, a single issue has never garnered enough support to bring about the convention of states.
Those that support the idea say the Constitution included the concept of a constitutional convention so that it could be used, and the time has come for states to bring together delegates to help stem what they see as an overbearing federal government.
“I’m personally convinced that a convention of states is the only way to prevent a meltdown of our federal government and the ruination of our federal government,” said Broadview Heights resident and Cuyahoga Community College media and journalism professor John Kerezy.
Citing a quote from Abraham Lincoln about the “good old ship of the union,” Kerezy said “that ship is in great danger right now,” and if the Senate resolution to limit federal power isn’t passed, “its failure is imminent.”
Responding to a comment from the committee’s chair, Republican Sen. Kristina Roegner, that “several state senators and (House representatives) have expressed a concern that calling for a convention of states won’t really make a difference,” Kerezy said the concept has “the virtue of never having been tried.”
“Why would you knock something down if it’s never been tried,” Kerezy said. “Everything else is just hot air.”

Michael Farris, the cofounder of Convention of States Action, a leader in the movement to gather a convention together, dismissed concerns from opponents who said the Constitution is silent on how the convention would be controlled and that a lack of control could lead to delegates deciding on subject matters outside of the stated purpose.
“The Republican National Convention cannot nominate the Democratic candidate for president, nor can it pass laws for France,” Farris said. “The convention is limited to the subject matter.”
He also said simple math can prove that the convention of states wouldn’t have the power to make permanent change unilaterally.
“Anything that comes out of the convention has to be ratified by 38 state legislatures … so 13 chambers say no, the answer is no,” he told the committee.
 ‘A dangerous objective’
A Republican former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and current president of the Delaware, Ohio-based American Republic Policy, Dr. Alan Keyes, called the push for a convention “a dangerous objective.”
Keyes said, under the Declaration of Independence in particular, the U.S. has been successful in its mission to be a country that “did not involve the elevation of a king, it involved the elevation of a whole people in a way that would allow that people to govern itself in matters of mutual interest and defense.”
“What exactly is being achieved by a constitution convention,” Keyes asked, “except that we’re going to hand to a group of people the power to do something else that goes beyond that, and that targets … the fact that not everybody in our nation today believes in in government of, by and for the people, but they would seek to overthrow it.”
Springboro resident Robert Tuttle argued that delegates to a constitutional convention could easily lump the measures they want under the umbrella of limiting federal government power, measures that could include a national popular vote or a reproductive freedom amendment.
“’The right to reproductive freedom shall not be abridged,’” Tuttle said. “That’s a limitation on the federal government, so that could be proposed.”
The majority of public opinion supporting legal abortion and nine states having passed abortion-related state constitutional amendments should come as an important example as to what the unintended consequences of a convention could be, according to Tuttle.
“I would suggest that if you’re pro-life, you don’t want to be anywhere near this thing,” Tuttle said. “Because you can bet your bottom dollar that that will be proposed and it has a decent chance of ratification in the states.”
 Delegate appointments
Potentially looking to address some of the concerns critics have of a convention’s lack of procedure, Senate Republicans also introduced Senate Bill 112, which would establish an appointment procedure for a constitutional convention.
The bill had a hearing in Senate General Government the same day as the the convention resolution itself.
The bill requires the General Assembly to appoint an odd number of delegates using a concurrent resolution or a majority vote in a joint session.
Delegates would be qualified under the bill if they are 25 or older, a registered elector have been a U.S. citizen and an Ohio resident for at least five years, and do not hold federal or statewide office.
The resolution appointing the delegates must contain a delegate’s “commission” and “the scope of the delegates’ authority,” while still allowing the General Assembly to give additional instructions in separate resolutions.
Part of the “convention conduct” required of delegates under the measure would involve “criminal prohibitions” if delegates vote to “take certain actions” or if they accept “certain gifts.”
An advisory committee would also be empaneled to answer delegate questions, “monitor the delegation” and report “perceived violations,” while also having the authority to investigate whether a delegate has “exceeded the scope of the delegate’s authority.”
Bill opponent Barbara Burkard noted the criminal penalties part of the legislation as a part of her opposition to the “faithful delegate pledge.”
“That’s just plain ridiculous,” Burkard told the committee. “Delegates to an Article V convention will have the highest authority in our nation, and they can not be legally charged for decisions they make in a convention because Article V gives them that right to make those decisions and the authority to do so.”
She also scoffed at the idea that Ohio legislators should authorize a pledge of “faithfulness” to delegates, when she said they themselves have fallen down on similar pledges.
She brought up the race for House Speaker in 2023, when former Speaker Jason Stephens took up the gavel. Stephen gained the speakership after a dramatic change of vote from many in the GOP caucus, and a collaboration with Democrats to see Stephens take the seat over former state Rep. Derek Merrin, whom the GOP caucus had voted to support before the formal vote.
“Why should these legislators tell delegates to sign a pledge of faithfulness when they themselves fail in the faithfulness category,” Burkard asked.

Ford/Maryland Matters)Andrew Friedson officially announced plans Sunday to seek the Democratic nomination for Montgomery County executive, becoming the fifth Democrat to get in the race for the June 2026 primary.
Friedson, who unofficially said he would run more than a week ago, addressed several hundred people who turned out on a hot Sunday evening in Cabin John Regional Park. Supporters touted the Montgomery County Councilmember as the only candidate to present a brighter future for the state’s largest jurisdiction, with more than 1 million people.
“When I was first getting into politics on a campaign, what really struck me is that Andrew listens. He still does, and that’s one of [his] greatest qualities,” said Marko Rivera-Oven, executive director of The Upcounty Hub, a nonprofit that operates a food pantry. “I believe that Montgomery County will be better if Andrew Friedson is our next county executive.”
Several others also praised Friedson, including former Maryland Democratic Party Chair Susan W. Turnbull, who has led several national Jewish organizations, and Sen. Majority Leader Nancy King (D-Montgomery).
Sen. Brian Feldman (D-Montgomery), who chairs the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee, introduced Friedson, whom he called a “point person” on the Maryland ABLE Act, which allows Maryland families to invest money for individuals with disabilities. The act was signed into law in 2016, the same year Friedson worked as a senior policy adviser for the Maryland Comptroller’s Office.

On a lighter note, Feldman recalled that Friedson worked in his office for one session when Friedson attended the University of Maryland, College Park. After graduating in 2008, Friedson went to graduate school at Johns Hopkins University, where he was a student in a class taught by Feldman.
“If you like him, and you’re going to support him, everything that he has done in elective office, [just] give me credit. That’s all because of me,” Feldman said to laughter from attendees.
Friedson made history in Montgomery County when he was elected in 2018 as the youngest councilmember ever, at age 32.
Prior to his work on the council, he was the interim executive director of the Maryland 529 College Savings Program and served on the Maryland Small Business Development Financing Authority in 2016 and 2017.
Friedson, now 39, said his priorties include providing affordable housing, supporting businesses and ensuring the county executive works with the public schools superintendent “but holds the school system accountable for the public tax dollars that we spend.”
Friedson said the coalition he’s building is about family.
“We don’t win by shouting from our mountain tops as loud or more loudly than the other team is shouting from theirs,” he said. “We make the case by proving that government can work, starting at the local level and getting the little things right, so we can get trust from people that we can do the big things.”
So far, at least two of Friedson’s County Council colleagues, both members of the class of 2018, like Friedson, are seeking the Democratic nomination for county executive.
At-Large County Councilmember Evan Glass plans to use the county’s public financing option. Glass, who was the first openly LGBTQ+ member of the council when elected in 2018, would become the first as county executive, if elected.
County Council Vice President Will Jawando (D-At-Large), also elected that year to the council, has the backing of current County Executive Marc Elrich (D). Elrich’s is term limited and cannot seek a third term.

Without directly saying Friedson’s name, Elrich said at Jawando’s campaign announcement last month that residents shouldn’t support a candidate with millions of dollars from developers.
In January, Friedson already had $1 million cash on hand.
“I am extremely proud of the overwhelming support that we have received from everybody in our community, and we saw it here today at our kickoff with a diverse crowd,” Friedson said in an interview with reporters Sunday. “I’m not focused on what other people are saying. I’m not focused on the attacks. I’m running on my record and other people should run on theirs.”
At least two other candidates have announced bids or officially filed paperwork to seek the Democratic nomination in the June 2026 primary election.
Celeste Iroha, a registered medical assistant, was the first person to announce in March, according to Bethesda Today. Another candidate seeking the Democratic nomination is Mithun Banerjee, a landlord from Silver Spring who filed his candidacy last month.
As of Friday, Iroha and Banerjee were the only two people to file documentation for the seat. According to the state Board of Elections, no Republicans have filed for the seat.
The candidate filing deadline is 9 p.m. Feb. 24.

The allegations include distributing drugs with Chinese and Korean labels from firms not registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, drugs that were labeled in the clinic and drugs prescribed for a clinic’s owner, but put into its stock. The clinic stopped using one drug when patients said “it burned,” a board of pharmacy inspection report said.
The suspensions bring to more than 10 the number of such licenses the pharmacy board has suspended this year on similar allegations. As markets boom for lucrative GLP-1 weight-loss drugs as well as those for other cosmetic procedures, observers have said it’s created a wild-west atmosphere among the clinics that sell them.
The weight-loss drugs are similar to Ozempic and Wegovy, and as demand for them has soared, so have shortages and concerns that the people most in need can’t get them. There are also worries that improperly formulated drugs might be used and that the unscrupulous might be cashing in. 
The drugs carry an average annual list price of $12,000, according to the Peterson KFF Health Tracker.
On Tuesday, the pharmacy board issued an order to summarily suspend the drug-distribution license of Enbody in Shaker Heights after a June 5 inspection.
“The inspection revealed Enbody was in possession of illegal drugs,” the order said. “These drugs were purchased from illegitimate entities that are not licensed wholesale drug distributors or drug manufacturers in the United States and do not have Food and Drug Administration (FDA) manufacturer registration. These drugs are counterfeit and/or ‘For Research Use Only’ and these drugs are not FDA-approved medications.”
Among the drugs listed were tirzepatide, semaglutide, liraglutide and retatrutide, all weight-loss drugs that diminish appetite. 
“Enbody purchased dangerous drugs direct from multiple unlicensed manufacturers in China and from the Amazon website,” the report said.
Inspectors also found drugs labeled “for research use only.”  In January, the board suspended licenses to distribute dangerous drugs held by clinics in Cleveland, Cincinnati, Dayton and Columbus. It accused them of giving patients weight-loss drugs that were labeled “for research use only” and that came from “an unlicensed out-of-state-seller.”
At Enbody, inspectors also said they found vials of bacteriostatic water purchased off of Amazon, but not through its pharmacy. It’s supposed to be a sterile solution for use in injecting drugs. But an official at the clinic said she stopped using it because patients said “it burned,” the report said.
The board of pharmacy also suspended:

Hyperbaric Therapy of Dublin — Inspectors said they found unapproved drugs, including mistletoe extract, curcumin, and oak extract. They also said that “drugs prescribed to the clinic’s owner, Christopher Dodson, had been ordered and shipped from a 503A compounding pharmacy. These patient-specific dangerous drugs were then being utilized as office drug stock.”
Dermatology, Laser and Vein Center, Montgomery — Inspectors said they found the cosmetic drug liporase, which isn’t approved by the FDA and was purchased from a supplier not licensed by the board of pharmacy. An invoice said three vials had been purchased, and the person running the clinic claimed they were never used. She said two had been destroyed, but could produce no record of their destruction, the report said.
Zinni Family Practice, Canfield — Inspectors said they found several different cosmetic skin drugs that weren’t FDA approved, seven expired drugs of other types, and problems with documentation and storage.

Meanwhile, the FDA seems to be undermining its own mission to ensure that drugs are safe. Last week, the news organization ProPublica reported that for more than 12 years, a secretive group within the agency has at times overruled inspectors of overseas “factories with mold, foul water, dirty labs or fraudulent testing protocols.” The internal group allowed those factories to ship drugs to the United States anyway, the story said.

Santiago/Getty Images)A month of gun violence is prompting new calls for firearm safety regulations. But with a GOP-controlled legislature, some Ohio advocates say they may need to take the laws into their own hands, through a constitutional amendment.
In Ohio, a toddler discharged a gun after finding it in a couch. A third grader brought a loaded firearm and threatened classmates, and mass shootings remain unsolved.
Over the past week, all across the state, shootings killed, wounded, and terrified dozens.
Two weeks ago, roughly 70 shots were fired during a car meet in Cleveland. Seven people, aged 18 and 19 years old, were shot and survived.
Last week, Cleveland had three overnight shootings, leaving two people dead and at least five injured. The youngest victim was a 13-year-old, who survived.
Last week in Akron, a 15-year-old boy was killed, and the police are still looking for the shooter.
Last week in Columbus, an 18-year-old was killed and seven others were injured, local police said. At least one other person died from a shooting this week.
This week, a 14-year-old was shot in Akron on Wednesday. Another man was shot in Downtown Cleveland early Thursday morning.
These are just several examples, not an exhaustive list. Gun violence typically also increases in the summer months, police say.
“It’s completely unacceptable that nobody is doing anything about it,” Columbus-area mother Michelle Heym said.
She is frustrated by the inaction to help protect Ohioans and her kids from tragedies.
Heym is originally from Connecticut but moved in 2015, two and a half years after being traumatized when her daughters were on lockdown during the Sandy Hook massacre.
Then, four years later, she dealt with the fear of the deadly 2019 mass shooting in Dayton. Since then, she has gotten more involved in advocacy against gun violence.
“I immediately wanted to get involved somehow to stop the gun violence in schools,” Heym said.
And Democratic lawmakers agree with her. They have been proposing safety regulations for years, like red flag laws, universal background checks and requirements to lock up guns so kids can’t access them.
The bills rarely, if at all, get serious consideration in the Ohio House and Senate, both dominated by gun-rights Republican Supermajorities.
“How many funerals will it take before this legislature does its job?” state Rep. Cecil Thomas, D-Cincinnati, said during a press conference on Democratic bills to address the violence.
Because the legislature hasn’t acted on gun reform, some cities are attempting to create ordinances that better protect their populations. Both Columbus and Cincinnati have several gun safety regulations, but the state and Columbus are now in a legal battle.
While the Dems haven’t been successful with passing legislation through the General Assembly, they have won at the ballot box.
In 2023, voters overwhelmingly protected access to abortion, legalized marijuana, and kept majority rule for voting.
“I think what we have seen on a number of issues, when we have a legislature that is out of touch with where most Ohioans are — and we saw it with the reproductive freedom and I think we see it with this issue of addressing gun violence and common sense reforms — the people eventually do rise up,” House Minority Leader Allison Russo said.
She said that it “wouldn’t be surprising” if reform were proposed in the next few years.
Back in 2023, Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb brought up an idea for a constitutional amendment after a mass shooting.
Heym, now the Ohio legislative lead for Moms Demand Action, said she wants this to happen. She offered ideas of expanded background checks and safe storage.
“There are people at Moms Demand Action that have, in the past, entertained constitutional amendments and even supported constitutional amendments in Ohio,” she said.
But it would face uphill challenges, with GOP leaders saying this would go against the Second Amendment.
“Requiring someone to always store their firearm in a safe place, in storage, is going to be ruled unconstitutional,” state Rep. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania, said.
Williams is a supporter of responsible gun ownership, and he does have locks for some of his guns. The issue is also personal to him, as he said his best friend’s 2-year-old daughter accidentally shot and killed herself with her father’s gun.
“I understand that these situations occur, but that doesn’t mean that you can violate the constitutional rights of every other law-abiding citizen,” he said.
He said one bad actor doesn’t reflect the majority, and the better way of fighting gun violence is through the back end, like raising criminal penalties.
“Getting the repeat offenders off of the street, getting the firearms out of the hands of felons,” he said, mentioning his bill, H.B. 5, increases penalties for violent offenders in possession of a firearm while they are under disability for previous felony convictions.
It passed out of the House in a bipartisan fashion, with some Democrats joining the Republicans on a 71-24 vote.
Being reactive to violence isn’t enough, Heym said.
“Hopefully, the people will rise up,” she said.
Other gun safety advocacy groups informed us that they would also support a constitutional amendment.
The Fraternal Order of Police of Ohio also stated that they would want to review the details and can’t comment yet, but would consider or support any measures that make communities safer and allow police to do their jobs.

Thompson Federal Courthouse on June 13. (Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A federal magistrate judge in Nashville has denied the government’s motion to detain Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an immigrant living in Maryland who was wrongfully sent to a Salvadoran prison by U.S. immigration officials.
Federal prosecutors immediately filed notice they intend to appeal the decision. Both the decision by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes and the notice of appeal were filed Sunday.
In denying the government’s motion to keep Abrego detained, Holmes acknowledged that if he is released he will likely be taken into custody immediately by  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Nevertheless, Holmes ruling said “due process demands that every person charged with a federal crime be afforded a presumption of innocence unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and that deprivation of an individual’s liberty prior to trial can occur only in carefully limited circumstances with all the procedural safeguards afforded by the Bail Reform Act.”
“Abrego, like every person arrested on federal criminal charges, is entitled to a full and fair determination of whether he must remain in federal custody pending trial. The Court will give Abrego the due process that he is guaranteed.”
Abrego, who has previously been referred to in the government’s legal filings as “Abrego Garcia,” informed the court he goes by “Abrego” as his last name.
The judge set a June 25 court date to review the conditions for Abrego’s release.
U.S. says Abrego Garcia’s lawsuit over deportation is moot, must be dismissed

Abrego was brought to Nashville from El Salvador on June 6 to face human smuggling charges connected to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop. He was pulled over for speeding with nine Hispanic men in the back of a Chevrolet Suburban. He was neither arrested nor charged in the incident.
But a recent Department of Homeland Security investigation opened into the three-year-old stop gave rise to the charges he now faces.
Abrego entered “not guilty” pleas to the charges in an appearance in federal court on June 13.
Prosecutors argued that Abrego should be detained because his crimes involved minor victims, he is a flight risk and could potentially intimidate witnesses. Abrego is not charged with any crimes related to child victims.
Holmes dismissed federal prosecutors’ arguments that Abrego’s alleged illegal transport of immigrants from Texas to destinations around the country for payment involved a teenager as lacking clear evidence.
Some photos and body camera footage from the 2022 traffic stop are no longer available, Holmes notes, and much of the government’s case is build on second- and third-person hearsay.
Two of the witnesses cooperating with the government are members of the smuggling organization Abrego is accused of being part of: One received early release from a federal smuggling conviction and expects to get a work permit in exchange for his testimony, the other currently faces federal charges but hopes to be released, and has requested deportation deferral, in exchange for his testimony, Holmes said.
A third witness is closely related to the first two, and has requested deportation deferral in exchange for her cooperation. Her family is affiliated with a separate gang, the 18th Street or 18 Barrio gang, Holmes’ ruling says.
Holmes also questioned the government’s claims that Abrego is a member of the MS-13 gang, which she said “consists of general statements, all double hearsay,” from two of the cooperating witnesses. One said Abrego was “familial” with purported gang members and the other said she “believed” he was in the gang.
Those statements were countered by the third witness who “specifically repudiates” any suggestion that Abrego was a gang member, saying that “in ten years of acquaintance with Abrego, there were no signs or markings, including tattoos, indicating that Abrego is an MS-13 member.” Evidence that Abrego is a member of MS-13 is “simply insufficient,” Holmes wrote.
Abrego’s deportation to a notorious Salvadoran prison that U.S. officials acknowledged was in error then refused to return him, has sparked national scrutiny of Trump administration immigration crackdowns.

Meanwhile, Kansans have work of their own to do for the state. (Air Force Tech. Sgt. Brittany A. Chase/Department of Defense)So, the United States is at war again.
Those of us who lived through the Middle Eastern quagmires of the early 2000s can all too easily recall the mixture of fear and dismay that accompanied watching American forces head to foreign lands. For those of you too young to remember, I fervently hope this particular war winds up with the least amount of carnage possible for Americans, Israelis and Iranians.
Here’s the real challenge in grappling with times like these. When it comes to American foreign policy and the actions of those in Washington, D.C., deciding our nation’s response to foreign threats, there’s not a great deal that any one of us can do. There is also the risk that our leaders use foreign conflict as a distraction from vital matters at the state and national levels.
Right now, today, Kansans cannot decide what Iran does or how the Pentagon behaves. We have a critical role in deciding what happens to this state, however, and I want to write about a handful of other issues facing us today. These are real. These are pressing.
Don’t forget them as commentators slobber over the latest batch of “WAR!” headlines, chyrons and social media posts.

Medicaid threat
More than 1,500 Kansans have died because of the failure of Republican lawmakers in Kansas to expand the state’s Medicaid program.
Kansas Reflector editor Sherman Smith reported earlier this month that Republican lawmakers in Washington, D.C., could add to that shameful toll. They plan cuts to the existing, skimpy program: “A new analysis of cuts contained in the GOP’s ‘big beautiful bill’ under consideration by Congress shows that 13,000 Kansans would lose enrollment in Medicaid, and the state would lose $3.77 billion in federal funding.”
Online outlets Politico and The Hill have highlighted U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran’s alarm over potential program cuts, writing that he and a handful of other Republican lawmakers had “raised concerns” and “drawn public red lines.” That’s a welcome contrast to our state’s other U.S. senator, Roger Marshall, who can’t take a step without putting his foot in his mouth.
Senators will face enormous pressure this week as Majority Leader John Thune tries to push through President Donald Trump’s legislative centerpiece.
The potential coverage loses matter. Our senators’ votes matter.
The lives of Kansans matter.

Local elections
Kansans won’t vote on their state or federal lawmakers in 2025. We will, however, vote for municipal officials.
Take a look at this information page of Secretary of State Scott Schwab. The deadline to register or update your information for the primary is July 15, with advance voting beginning the next day. Primaries will be held Aug. 5
The deadline to register or update personal information for the general election is Oct. 14, with advance voting starting the next day. The general election takes place Nov. 4.
I know that local elections don’t see the kind of excitement or coverage or late-night thrills of presidential contests or even midterms. But they arguably make more of a difference in our daily lives. Local officials set property taxes and allocate services. They chart the courses for school districts and a multitude of other public programs. If you don’t know about the issues in your city or town, there’s still time to reach out and learn.
You’ll be standing up for yourself and your neighbors.

Big amendment
A constitutional amendment changing the selection process for Kansas Supreme Court judges will appear on the August 2026 ballot.
You will hear an awful lot about the vote in months ahead. Kansas Reflector has already run a column from a retired judge on the subject. You can read the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas’ take on the situation here. Lawmakers passed a ban on financial contributions to amendment campaigns from “foreign nationals” to tilt the playing field on just this issue.
Someone else making his voice heard over the weekend was Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson, who shared this statement from the state GOP on Saturday.

I am deeply appreciative that the Kansas Republican Party voted unanimously to endorse the constitutional amendment providing for the direct election of our Kansas Supreme Court. On your primary ballot next August, we need all hands on deck to pass this once in an lifetime… pic.twitter.com/SURc2stwX5
— Kansas Senate President Ty Masterson (@sentymasterson) June 22, 2025

Kansans already cast regular retention votes for members of the Supreme Court. But the popular-vote plan would clear the way for big money interests to back hard-right candidates. Those justices might just be more willing to let lawmakers ban abortion and cut funding for public education. Not that Republican lawmakers would ever want to do such things, of course.
As you can see, Kansans have a lot to pay attention to over the next 14 months or so. We haven’t even gotten to the 2026 general elections.
War coverage will continue. I’ll watch and read it, along with the rest of you. But let’s keep an eye on those local needs, issues and principles.

(Stock photo from Getty Images.)In 2019, GM closed the Lordstown Complex, where I worked for 30 years. Donald Trump, president at the time, promised revival but delivered nothing.
With the rise of EVs, Lordstown got a glimmer of hope. Lordstown Assembly stayed closed, but GM formed a new company, Ultium, which opened a massive EV battery facility right around the corner, buoyed by federal subsidies for the emerging industry.
As the U.S. Senate debates Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the people of Lordstown, Ohio, have a simple message: don’t shut us down again. I am the proud leader for the United Auto Workers in Region 2B, which covers Ohio and Indiana, and I hope the U.S. Senators representing our states will hear that message. 
It is time for the Senate to stand up for our members and the working class. America must preserve clean energy and manufacturing tax credits that have given communities like Lordstown a lifeline.
These credits helped make it possible for the UAW to organize the first union battery cell manufacturing facility in the country at Ultium. There is also a new StarPlus Energy Gigafactory in Kokomo, Indiana, a joint venture between Samsung and Stellantis. 
This plant was estimated to create and support 2,800 good union jobs with two facilities, with one on hold now because of the current policy uncertainty. 
Just recently, workers at the StarPlus battery facility also voted to be recognized by the UAW, following in the footsteps of the workers at Ultium Cells in Lordstown. 
GM is planning on building another battery plant in northern Indiana, and the companies, workers, and communities need to have stability moving forward. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Our contracts at these facilities have helped set a new standard for wages, benefits, and health and safety in EV battery manufacturing for workers everywhere. And we’re just getting started. 
These targeted energy and manufacturing tax incentives have enabled billions in private investment, and hundreds of thousands of jobs are at stake. The advanced manufacturing tax credit is driving major growth in the battery supply chain, and we are organizing across the country to create tens of thousands of union battery jobs. 
Meanwhile, the consumer electric vehicle tax credit has boosted demand for the batteries our members produce in Kokomo, Lordstown, and across our nation.
We’re witnessing a domestic manufacturing renaissance, and when these new jobs have the benefits that come with collective bargaining—better wages, safer working conditions, health care, retirement security, and a voice on the job — they lead to the kind of family-supporting careers that built the American Dream.
Unfortunately, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would devastate this progress and harm workers, and the Senate has so far failed to fix the bill. 
This misguided legislation would gut the very tax credits that are benefiting our workers and bringing manufacturing back to America. The clean vehicle tax credit would be essentially eliminated, and the advanced manufacturing tax credit would be severely restricted. 
Analysis suggests that repealing clean vehicle tax credits alone could reduce electric vehicle (EV) sales by as much as 40% by 2030, and could result in the idling of existing assembly plants and the cancellation of many planned EV battery manufacturing facilities.
The irony is stark and painful: thousands of battery workers have just voted to unionize, ensuring their jobs are high-quality and family-supporting. Now congressional Republicans are voting to kill those very same jobs. 
They’re choosing to undermine American manufacturing in favor of what exactly? Tax cuts for billionaires and corporations?
This isn’t about party politics — it’s about our economic future. And the UAW has long said there is room for improvement in the design of these credits. 
Too many companies taking the money are guilty of paying substandard wages and benefits, illegal union busting, and dangerous working conditions. 
Subsidies like these need strings attached to protect workers; we can do better than corporate giveaways. But gutting the whole thing isn’t the answer. 
Instead of kneecapping the credits, Congress should improve them: most importantly, by making wage and benefit standards a prerequisite for receiving the advanced manufacturing tax credit. 
The choice is clear: support policies that create good union jobs, or let other countries take the lead in building the industries of the future. 
The working class deserves leaders who will fight for our economic interests, not legislators who would rather slash taxes for the wealthy and greedy corporations while raising energy prices, sabotaging domestic manufacturing, and kicking millions off their health care to boot.  
When our government invests in good, American jobs, workers, and communities win. Now it’s time for our Senators to decide if they’re on our side.

(Photo courtesy of Upland Grassroots)The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency restored two of the three Maine-based grants for forever chemical research that it terminated this spring.
Without explaining why, or first considering the researchers’ appeals, the EPA notified teams led by the Mi’kmaq Nation and the University of Maine that their grants have been reinstated this month, however the agency has yet to notify the Passamaquoddy Tribe about whether their grant will be restored. 
After Maine Morning Star reporting revealed conflicting agency stances on the terminations, Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine requested EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin address the inconsistencies by May 30. Pingree has yet to receive a response. 
Pingree told Maine Morning Star she was pleased to see the grants restored but that they shouldn’t have been terminated in the first place. 
“Unfortunately, this is just one example of a much broader problem,” Pingree said. 
Pingree pointed to other proposed cuts to environmental programs, such as a 55% funding cut to the EPA budget and the elimination of other PFAS grants that support cleanup and prevention efforts in vulnerable communities. “While I’m glad funding for this project was reinstated, we’re still fighting to protect the many others that remain on the chopping block,” she said.
The researchers also expressed cautious optimism as they plan to forge ahead.
Despite saying PFAS contamination is a priority, EPA cut millions in funding for research in Maine

“Because of this whole situation, I don’t feel as totally sure about [the funding] as I did when we first got the grant,” said Chelli Stanley, co-founder of an organization committed to cleaning contaminated land, Upland Grassroots, which is part of the research team headed by the Mi’kmaq Nation. “But of course, we are just going to go forward and do all of our work, I’m sure maybe at an accelerated pace in some ways, just to do as much testing as we can.” 
In May, the EPA terminated all of the four-year grants it had awarded in September for research into reducing per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances, otherwise known as PFAS, in the food supply, including to the three Maine-based teams. The three grants for Maine projects amount to almost $5 million. 
The termination notices read, “The objectives of the award are no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”
However, the agency later gave conflicting responses about why it terminated the grants. 
In a statement to Maine Morning Star, the EPA Press Office equated the grants to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion measures. 
“As with any change in administration, the EPA has been reviewing all of its grant programs and awarded grants to ensure each is an appropriate use of taxpayer dollars and to understand how those programs align with administration priorities,” the EPA Press Office wrote. “Maybe the Biden-Harris administration shouldn’t have forced their radical agenda of wasteful DEI programs and ‘environmental justice’ preferencing on the EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment treating tribes and Alaska Natives as such.”
However, Zeldin publicly stated the grants were important and already congressionally appropriated. In the weeks leading up to the terminations, the agency also named combating PFAS contamination as a priority.
All three of the Maine-based research teams appealed their grant terminations. However, in the emails the EPA sent the UMaine and Mi’kmaq Nation teams, the agency said the reinstatement decisions were made by agency leadership unrelated to their appeals. 
UMaine had formally appealed the termination on June 5, but the EPA wrote in a June 6 email, “The reinstatement was directed by agency leadership on June 4, 2025, prior to the issuance of a decision on a dispute filed by the University of Maine on June 5, 2025.”
The Mi’kmaq Nation filed their appeal earlier and received an email on June 5 acknowledging receipt. On June 18, the team received another email notifying them that their grant had been reinstated. But that email stated that the restoration was directed by agency leadership prior to the issuance of a decision on the dispute, and that the dispute was now moot. 
While acknowledging receipt, the EPA did not respond to requests for comment regarding why agency leadership reinstated these two grants, or whether the agency intends to reinstate the Passamaquoddy Tribe’s grant.
Citing Maine Morning Star reporting, Pingree presses EPA on PFAS grant terminations

For Stanley, the reinstatement underscored the power elected leaders can yield to push back on cuts, noting Pingree’s letter to Zeldin. 
“I do feel like in this case, the representatives and senators can play a big role,” Stanley said. 
Bryan Berger, associate professor of chemical engineering at the University of Virginia, which is working in partnership with the Mi’kmaq Nation on its grant, said for him the termination and subsequent reinstatement illustrated the convoluted political fault lines within federal research funding. 
“I was shocked when it happened just because of how it’s a topic that I think really is very non-political,” Berger said. “I have friends who are very conservative to very liberal and everybody agrees that nobody wants perfluorinated chemicals in their food and water.”
Berger said he was heartened that Zeldin seemed to want to prioritize PFAS research when Pingree had questioned him on the terminations during an appropriations subcommittee hearing on May 15. But at the same time, Berger said, “What he was saying seemed to be the antithesis of what was happening.” 
However, Berger added, “I think to be a scientist, you have to be relentlessly optimistic.”
A scientist’s work constantly grapples with struggle and failure, he explained, “so if you’re not an optimist, you can’t do this job.”

A year into her first term in office, New Jersey Assemblywoman Sadaf Jaffer decided not to run for reelection.
The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Many State Capitols Have Security Holes

Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”

Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
 Language matters

Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
North Dakota man charged with threatening official after email citing Minnesota shootings

Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
 Security measures

Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

Don Bacon, R-Neb., is the current owner of an IOU worth millions of dollars. The chit is the result of his vote for the small-minded, unattractive and unpopular bill working its way through Congress, part of which will cut funding for Nebraska Public Media (NPM).
Full disclosure: In the past I have contributed several op-ed pieces for Nebraska Public Radio and have twice been a guest on “All About Books,” discussing one book I read and another I wrote. I have been a financial supporter of Nebraska Public Media.
Bacon said the House Speaker assured him that money lost in the massive bill would be restored later. His optimism is noteworthy (or perhaps naive) in a place where the only sure thing these days is that nothing is a sure thing. We’re teeter tottering on tariffs, immigration and war, with policies seemingly changing based on the latest news cycle.  Or worse, whims.
Right instincts
The congressman’s instincts were right. Cutting funds to NPM would especially hurt the rural parts of the state. That’s where, according to NPM leadership, the loss of funds — even though only a percentage of the networks’ total budget — would have the greatest impact. 
His colleague, U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., said he voted for the bill because its “spending priorities (were) overwhelmingly supported by the American people at the ballot box last November.” Last I checked, 49.8% of the vote is anything but overwhelming.
Even though Bacon’s vote matched his concern, hearing him raise it from the majority seats was an outlier in a Congress on the verge — at least in practice — of abdicating its role as a co-equal member of the republic’s three branches of government. 
The push to defend PBS and National Public Radio has been a goal of those now pulling the levers of government for some time. As far as I can tell, it has nothing to do with fiscal mismanagement, poor performance or any nefarious practice.
Content fight
It’s simply about content, which apparently doesn’t match the administration’s world view. Curiously, in the Media Bias Chart, an ongoing research project from Ad Fontes, both NPR and PBS rank near the top of all media outlets for their lack of bias. You can see the research here.
Getting accurate news is an increasing problem. Misinformed, disinformed or uninformed people are serious drags on a dynamic democracy. One solution is accurate reporting from credible news sources such as those at the top of the Media Bias Chart, including PBS and NPR. 
Another is the introduction in schools of thinking and reasoning skills, learning to sift fact from fiction that is being sold either by mistake or devious scheme.
The Nebraska Legislature adjourned earlier this month after passing a law that limits cell phone use in schools and another requiring schools to address discrimination and antisemitism issues. Other educational bills were left on the table, including some that are best left there. 
Smart news consumers vital
Still, as the government moves to defund a source of information it apparently doesn’t like, schools can remain bulwarks against disinformation. They can also serve as a counterbalance to a new information eyesore: the rewriting of American history.
Along Highway 395 in California’s Sierra Nevada range is a sacred obelisk, its bright white a contrast against the stark environment of high desert just west of Death Valley. The monument is part of the Manzanar National Historic Site, commemorating Camp Manzanar where 10,000 Japanese Americans — nearly all U.S. citizens — were interned during World War II.
I once stopped at Manzanar on the way home from a fishing trip to Mammoth Lakes, in part because of its historic past and in part because my friend, Mitz Sasahara, was a child there. I found an eerie, unsettling silence at Manzanar, perhaps because I knew a little of the toll it took on Mitz and his family.
Now, however, the government has installed two signs at Manzanar, which, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, “encourage visitors to report any depictions of U.S. history that ‘inappropriately disparage Americans past or living’ or fail to highlight the ‘beauty, abundance or grandeur.’” Similar signs are now posted at every national park.
Nevermind deputizing tourists as amatuer snitches. Are we now downplaying, diffusing or even dismissing what is our history? Perhaps the Nebraska Legislature or state education officials can’t write a curriculum that teaches our kids to challenge disinformation or the rewriting of history. Perhaps Nebraska Public Media will be hamstrung in its ability to bring us the facts. 
Nevertheless, in a democracy, demanding the truth is not simply our right. It’s our responsibility.

Getty Images.The next generation of Georgia youths may be able to decipher those birthday cards from grandma without any help from a grown-up.
That’s because Georgia’s new English language arts standards, which take effect in July, will include an emphasis on handwriting, and particularly cursive. The standards will address handwriting starting in kindergarten and move to cursive in third through fifth grade. The previous standards did not have an explicit place for handwriting.
“We want to ensure that our students, when they graduate from the state of Georgia, have all the skills they need,” said April Aldridge, deputy superintendent of teaching and learning at the Georgia Department of Education. “In the world we live in, that means we have to have a varied degree of skills and we need to know when to use the skills in which situations.”
“The skill of handwriting, I wouldn’t say that it’s an antiquated skill because I think most of us use handwriting at some point in our lives every single day, whether it’s in formal or informal situations, so I think it’s just one of the tools that students need to be proficient in,” she added.
While some parents may embrace it, others parents question whether incorporating cursive lessons into English class is the best use of instruction time.
Some said students would be better served by using their instructional time to learn to type or become more savvy with technology.
Brittany Klein, a parent of children in the Cherokee County School System, said she taught her daughter cursive during the COVID-19 pandemic and her son learned it in school, but don’t ask either of them to write in cursive today.
“I am not opposed to cursive,” she said. “I just think if they aren’t going to use it regularly it’s a wasted skill. My kids aren’t even in high school yet and they completely forgot.”
But Sarah Welch, an English language arts program specialist with the Georgia Department of Education, said there’s a greater benefit to mastering handwriting than signing on the dotted line or interpreting grandma’s birthday wishes.
When kids are fluent writers, they can dedicate more brain power to expressing their thoughts instead of moving their pencils.
“If they’re putting so much emphasis on forming the letters and writing the words, that’s taking away their ability to really focus on organizing and expressing their ideas clearly,” Welch said. “And so the research actually shows that cursive handwriting – which is faster than print – really, it enhances their writing fluency. It also supports spelling, but aside from that it really frees up their cognitive resources to let them dig into those higher level reading and higher level writing tasks and being able to organize and express their thoughts because that’s where their minds can go.”
Reinhardt University education professor Debby Pinion, who teaches teachers about reading and dyslexia, said she thinks the new standards will be good for all students but could be especially helpful for children with dyslexia.
That’s because unlike writing block letters, which involves a lot of picking up and putting back down your pencil, when you write in cursive, each word is its own discrete unit.
“With cursive handwriting, it’s a continuous motion until the end of the word,” she said. “So students who are having trouble with position and writing then have an easier time because it just flows per word instead of a manuscript, which is just one letter at a time. So they don’t have to stop and think, ‘which way do I go? Where are the lines? What do I do?’”
“The key word is fluency,” she added. “Just like when we read fluently, that’s not really how fast, but really how smoothly we read. And the same thing is for writing. It helps with fluency so that you’re not starting and stopping, which then impedes your thought process when the object of the game is to write something. So if how we’re writing decreases the flow of our brain fluency, then that’s a problem for students with dyslexia. But cursive handwriting, like any strategy that is used for a child with dyslexia, helps all children. It raises all the ships in the sea.”

For the second year in a row, marchers wore yellow ribbons and held signs calling for the return of the hostages from Gaza. 
Those whom Hamas and other terrorist groups are still holding were top of mind for all, especially as former hostages recounted the abuse and torture they suffered in Hamas’ terror tunnels. While celebrating the release of American Edan Alexander, who was the last living American hostage, the bodies of four dead Americans, Itay Chen, Omer Neutra, Gadi Haggai, and Judi Weinstein Haggai, are as of this writing still being held by Hamas, presumably as bargaining chips. [Israeli forces recovered the remains of Judy Weinstein and Gad Haggai on June 5.–Ed.]
I mention these names because we’re seeing a resurgence of nonsense and falsity from “pro-Palestinian” groups, who want us to believe that this war comes from Israeli aggression or “colonialism.” They tell us that peace is possible if only Israel would disarm, which would spell an end to Israel at the hands of an irrationally hostile and antisemitic Arab world. 
It’s worth remembering that on October 6, 2023, Israel wasn’t at war. The aggressor and catalyst on October 7 was Hamas, not Israel. That aside, the “pro-Palestinian” position shows a complete ignorance of history. To ask Israel to do anything less in the protection of its citizens is easy if you aren’t the one whose brother is being tortured in a tunnel, if it isn’t your mother’s remains being held by terrorists and if Hamas were not sworn and committed by its Charter and its actions to the murder of all Jewish people. 
War is terrible and never prosecuted perfectly, but Hamas and its proxies and allies are not properly in a position to call the shots or make demands. It will take very talented negotiators to find a path to peace, if peace is even possible in the face of the Palestinian Authority’s ongoing bounties to terrorists who kill Jews and Hamas’ foundational raison d’être of eliminating Israel as the world’s only Jewish state, which is the meaning of the chant “Free, free Palestine.” This is a harsh reality that is hard for us as Americans to appreciate.
For everything we know about October 7, it was worse. Most Americans haven’t yet been told or have come to terms with the fact it wasn’t just Hamas who attacked, but it was also Palestinian supporters, who came over the border and committed vile and brutal atrocities. 
Palestinian civilians, who had elected Hamas,  looted and burned entire neighborhoods, kidnapped infants and senior citizens, and raped and murdered their way through Israel’s south. Much like the Nazis, Hamas documented their atrocities. Survivors have given testimony, and the world has seen evidence of the complicity of teachers, doctors, journalists, and others – including some U.N. staff! – in the planning and the attack. 
There is no justification. There is no excuse. No accusation of an “open air prison” or “colonialism” will work here. No Jews have resided in Gaza since 2005. The world has generously supported Gaza through UNRWA for 75 years. Collectively, we’ve spent billions to create a fully functional and economically independent region for Gazans. Even Hamas’ most effective talking point, the death toll figures, are starting to unravel. The deep dive by the Henry Jackson Society is worth reading to get the facts straight.
As is true in all wars, there are innocent victims in Gaza. Gazan children have had their futures sacrificed by the very adults who should be protecting them. Hamas didn’t make any provision for evacuating them from what they knew would be a war zone, never brought families into the shelter of tunnel networks and underground cities which they had built with foreign aid, and steals humanitarian aid meant to feed and care for the populace. 
But Hamas’ influence over news media reporting from Gaza results in highly skewed reporting, as they ensure that the people’s anguished faces appear with every news article while they at the same time are willingly sacrificing those people. It’s abhorrent. Where are the “pro-Palestinian” groups on this? If they were really pro-Palestinian, they would condemn Hamas and terrorism, recognize Israel’s right to exist, and chart an honest path forward for the next generation. However, these radical groups have a very different agenda from supporting Palestinian people.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Monique Lacroix of Carver County said going to rallies and speaking in front of elected officials might make her uncomfortable, but the moment mandates action. 
“This is the time to put yourself out there and do what you can,” Lacroix said.
Lacroix was at a “Defending Democracy Summit” at a south Minneapolis church Sunday, hosted  by We Choose Us, a pro-democracy coalition with about 40 partners across the state.
Barely a week after the assassination of Democratic-Farmer-Labor Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark, and the shooting of DFL state Sen. John Hoffman and Yvette Hoffman, Minnesotans are grappling with how to support democracy in a time of political violence and what analysts call “democratic backsliding.” 
Speakers at the south Minneapolis event Sunday had no shortage of examples of threats to democracy. 
They highlighted the Trump administration’s deportations without due process; his attempt to unilaterally overturn birthright citizenship, which is the law of the land due to both the Constitution and longstanding legal precedent; his deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles; and the usurpation of Congress by restricting federal funds appropriated by the legislative branch. Speakers mentioned censorship and tacitly or explicitly forcing schools and companies to scrub their identities of diversity, equity and inclusion practices
Budding activists like Lacroix, who is interested in a county-level project bringing together elected officials and law enforcement, were joined by Attorney General Keith Ellison, Secretary of State Steve Simon and Rep. Emma Greenman, a Minneapolis Democrat — all known for policies that encourage voter turnout and fight disenfranchisement.
Ellison discussed his office’s ongoing lawsuits against Trump’s policies. For every Trump administration edict, it seems, Ellison has joined a lawsuit among his fellow Democratic attorneys general. The count is up to more than two dozen now. 
“I’m prepared to sue Trump as much and as long as he is prepared to break the law,” Ellison said. “I want you to know that I’m not tired, not worn out. We got plenty of gas in the tank, and we will keep going on this for however long it takes. If he tries to nationalize our National Guard, we will be in court.”
Simon told the crowd he’s currently in defense mode, as thousands of eligible Minnesotans  would face challenges to their voting rights if the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act winds up becoming law. It has passed the U.S. House but not the Senate.  
Because the law would require documentary proof of citizenship, Simon said some residents in expansive northern counties will face an hours-long trek to jump a new bureaucratic hurdle.
“They’re going to have to take half or more of a day off work to go register to vote,” Simon said.
Two voting rights scholars at the Brennan Center for Justice wrote that the bill “would devastate voter registration while disenfranchising tens of millions of eligible American citizens.” 
Greenman was instrumental in helping the DFL trifecta pass expansive voting rights legislation in 2023. Lawmakers extended the franchise to people released from prison but still on parole or probation. 
She delivered an optimistic message that though fear is contagious, so is courage.
“What we’re talking about is taking control of our communities, taking control of our families, our bodies, our collective decision making,” Greenman said. 
But despite Greenman’s optimism, the reminder of loss hung heavy in the summer air, all three elected officials had known Hortman for years, if not decades.
The Hortmans were killed in their Brooklyn Park home in the early hours of June 14 because of Melissa Hortman’s leadership and her support for abortion rights, authorities say. The suspect, 57-year-old Vance Boelter, was captured on June 15 after a 43-hour manhunt. He is also accused of shooting Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in their Champlin home. The couple survived their injuries and are recovering. Boelter remains in custody. Authorities say he had a list of targets, all of them advocates for abortion rights or actual abortion providers. 
“It is clearly an act of political violence that is able to fester in the current political climate, rise of authoritarianism and division,” said Lilly Sasse, co-founder and director of We Choose Us. “I think that added an extra layer of seriousness to (today) and the charge in front of us to take action and do something — and do it together.”
While the We Choose Us summit began with public speeches from state officials, the bulk of the agenda comprised private discussions about what a thriving democracy looks like and how to achieve it. Sasse said the thread between local, state and federal powers are clearer than they seem, and building relationships with everyone from county commissioners to congresswomen is a crucial element for success.
Sasse told Sunday’s attendees that rather than being quiet for a moment of silence, Melissa Hortman would have wanted residents to step up and take action. Which is similar to what the Hortman children have sought to encourage.

In denying the government’s motion to keep Abrego detained, Holmes acknowledged that if he is released he will likely be taken into custody immediately by  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Abrego, who has previously been referred to in the government’s legal filings as “Abrego Garcia,” informed the court he goes by “Abrego” as his last name.
Nevertheless, Holmes wrote, “due process demands that every person charged with a federal crime be afforded a presumption of innocence unless proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and that deprivation of an individual’s liberty prior to trial can occur only in carefully limited circumstances with all the procedural safeguards afforded by the Bail Reform Act.”
“Abrego, like every person arrested on federal criminal charges, is entitled to a full and fair determination of whether he must remain in federal custody pending trial. The Court will give Abrego the due process that he is guaranteed.”
The judge set a June 25 court date to review the conditions for Abrego’s release.
Abrego was brought to Nashville from El Salvador on June 6 to face human smuggling charges connected to a 2022 Tennessee traffic stop. He was pulled over for speeding with nine Hispanic men in the back of a Chevrolet Suburban. He was neither arrested nor charged in the incident.
But a recent Department of Homeland Security investigation opened into the three-year-old stop gave rise to the charges he now faces.
Abrego entered “not guilty” pleas to the charges in an appearance in federal court on June 13.
Prosecutors argued that Abrego should be detained because his crimes involved minor victims, he is a flight risk and could potentially intimidate witnesses. Abrego is not charged with any crimes related to child victims.
Holmes dismissed arguments that Abrego’s alleged illegal transport of immigrants from Texas to destinations around the country for payment involved a teenager.
Abrego’s deportation to a notorious Salvadoran prison that U.S. officials acknowledged was in error then refused to return him, has sparked national scrutiny to Trump administration immigration crackdowns.

Massie also criticized Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson for not calling the House back from vacation last week to consider a bipartisan war powers resolution filed by Massie and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California. 
“I think I represent part of the coalition that elected President Trump,” Massie said Sunday on CBS News “Face the Nation.” 
“We were tired of endless wars in the Middle East, and tired of wars in Eastern Europe. And we were promised that we would put our veterans, our immigration policies, and our infrastructure first.”
Massie said Iran posed “no imminent threat to the United States” and that Congress should have been briefed on the president’s plans before bombing attacks were launched on three nuclear sites. “The reality is, they don’t have a missile that can reach the United States. They’re not near to getting a missile that can reach the United States.”
Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell commended Trump’s decision to enter the conflict that began June 12 when Israel launched air and drone strikes on Iraq, killing generals and scientists and bombing nuclear and other military installations. Iran has responded by firing missiles at Israel.
McConnell, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, said “seizing this opportunity is not an escalation toward war — it is a prudent response to the warmongers in Tehran.” 
“Israel’s bold response to the war thrust upon it by Iran’s proxies has created a unique opportunity to cripple Iran’s nuclear ambitions and strike a lasting blow to its hegemonic aggression,” McConnell said in a statement.
McConnell said the United States’ “interest in denying Iran a nuclear weapon, in standing with our ally, Israel, and in reestablishing credible deterrent power is undeniable and urgent.”
Barr, who is running to succeed McConnell in the U.S. Senate, wrote on X that critics of  Trump’s “bold and decisive action to defend the United States from a nuclear Iran are dead wrong. Apparently, they want to write Article II completely out of the Constitution. The President acted fully within his constitutional authority.”
On Saturday night after the White House announced the offensive, U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie posted on X: “Tonight, President Trump made a difficult decision that I believe was correct. In the end, Iran can never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon. May God bless our troops in harms way.”
Republican U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers also applauded Trump’s action, posting on X that the president’s “bold military action has eliminated the growing nuclear threat from Iran, after decades of diplomatic attempts from previous administrations have failed. Disarming a nation that aggressively chants ‘Death to America’ from developing a nuclear weapon to annihilate us, is a victory for America and all our allies.”
Last week, Republican U.S. Sen. Rand Paul told reporters he hoped Trump would not get involved in Israel’s war against Iran. 
The lone Democrat in Kentucky’s congressional delegation, Rep. Morgan McGarvey of Louisville posted on X: “The Constitution is clear. No president can declare war. On behalf of all Louisvillians, especially the brave men and women stationed abroad, I will fight to hold the Trump administration accountable for its decision to engage in direct military action against Iran without congressional authorization.
“Congress has yet to receive a classified briefing with evidence proving that tonight’s strikes were necessary to protect our national security. Congress and the American people deserve answers. My constituents do not want to be dragged into another endless war in the Middle East.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2218658900-1024x729.jpg,,,2025-06-22 15:59:54.408198

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakotans are being held prisoner by their indecision about where they want to build their next prison.
After all the debates and accusations, it’s hard to know what to think about the project. It’s difficult not to be cynical watching lawmakers get all hopped up about spending $600 million. We’re supposed to think that’s a bargain because the original plan called for spending $850 million. So even at more than half a billion dollars, there are concerns about the new place being built on the cheap. 
Much of this consternation originates in the way the prison project was initially handled during the Kristi Noem administration. Neighbors of the Lincoln County project weren’t made aware that state land in their county was under consideration until plans were announced for the new prison. When they found out about it, their concerns didn’t matter to Noem, who was known for a my-way-or-the-highway approach to getting what she wanted. That initial secrecy in the governor’s office led to so much protest from neighbors, and so much rancor in the Legislature, that the original site is now deemed too politically toxic to host the prison. 
Prison group stuck between local opposition and limited space

As a taxpayer, and as a lifelong believer that government should be conducted in a transparent manner, it has been heartening to watch Gov. Larry Rhoden’s Project Prison Reset work group conduct public meetings as they have struggled to figure out the best, most politically palatable solution to South Dakota’s prison problem. It certainly hasn’t been pretty, but it has been a lesson in transparent government.
The work group has conducted a series of hearings about the project site. When they finally make a decision, they should hold some more hearings, this time to figure out how South Dakota managed to invest more than $50 million in the original prison site without having the official OK from the Legislature. Because officials jumped the gun, taxpayers are left with $50 million in plans and infrastructure improvements that may never be used for a prison and possibly never be used at all. 
The work group has yet to decide what the best location is for the new prison. Many sites have been considered, but the three still standing are locations in Mitchell and Worthing or sites where the Department of Corrections already has prisons or land in Sioux Falls and Springfield.
While the Worthing site may be, well, worthy, it’s also in Lincoln County. The opposition of Lincoln County residents has already killed one viable prison site. It may be in the best interests of the work group to consider that the toxicity at the original site extends to the entire county. 
Like the original Lincoln County site, most other sites in the state, no matter how viable, run the risk of upsetting the project’s neighbors as well as those folks who just like to be upset about something. 
There is already a not-in-my-back-yard movement in Mitchell, reminiscent of what happened in Lincoln County. 
“They didn’t tell us about it until after the fact,” Mitchell resident Barbara Stadler told South Dakota Searchlight at a recent community forum, in reference to Mitchell city leaders’ initial pitch to the Project Prison Reset task force.
The work group runs the risk of inspiring that kind of response with any new prison site they consider. That leaves the group with the choice to build new prison facilities on sites already run by the Department of Corrections. It’s hard for neighbors to make a NIMBY complaint about a new prison project when the prison is literally already in their backyard. 
As consultants have explained, building on or near current prison facilities is not the best choice. It may, however, be the most palatable choice for South Dakotans and the choice most likely to earn the endorsement of the Legislature.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PXL_20240925_235057555-scaled-e1729719711486-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-22 12:07:09.802468

That sector still exists in some form, however, many of today’s cannabis consumers are “middle American” adults, employed, own a home, vote regularly, pay their taxes and are involved in their communities.
That is the general profile of adult cannabis consumers across the country and in Des Moines, according to a recent survey by Consumer Research Around Cannabis/The Media Audit.
The Media Audit, the parent company of Consumer Research Around Cannabis, is an international research company serving 80+ local markets in the U.S. and Canada for more than 20 years. It started gathering data about cannabis use and attitudes in 2016.

Although the sale of adult recreational cannabis is illegal in Iowa, the survey found 16.2% of all adults age 18+ in Des Moines said they used or bought cannabis during the past month, or the statistical equivalent of approximately 140,000 adults. The smallest percentage in the following table, monthly usage in Des Moines, is still substantial – and suggests a pent-up market. Unleashing the recreational cannabis market in Des Moines and all of Iowa would likely generate jobs and significant taxes for the state — money now escaping across the borders.

The survey data from Des Moines and 42 other markets was aggregated and showed 24.1% of adults 18+ used or bought cannabis during the past month. (Local factors affect these percentages and comparisons.)

For 15 years, Jonathan Caulkins, H. Guyford Stever professor of operations research and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College, has been studying cannabis legalization. He is also the author of several books on the topic and a member of the Commission on the North American Opioid Crisis.
Caulkins’ research fine-tunes the results of the Des Moines survey from Consumer Research Around Cannabis. “From 1992 through 2023, the most recent year for which we have released data, the trend has been towards an enormous increase in the number of people who are using cannabis daily or near daily. They account for 80% of recreational cannabis sales. They dominate the market,” Caulkins said.
In states like Iowa that haven’t legalized adult recreational cannabis, Caulkins expects when they do, the middle of the market will be blue-collar high school graduates, adults 25–40 who are employed but not affluent.
He has also seen a gender trend as more states allow the sale of recreational cannabis. “As cannabis has become more legal, the male/female use gap has become noticeably smaller. When it was an illegal action or a risky action, there was a much bigger gender gap, but that gap is declining. Use by men is increasing with legalization, use by women is increasing even more,” he said.
Cannabis consumers in Des Moines also align with the 43-market survey when comparing gender and income. Millennials at 42.3% and Gen Xers at 35.5% account for three-quarters of the adult cannabis consumers in Des Moines who bought or used cannabis during the past month. These percentages are slightly more than the 43-market survey at 41.5% and 28.2%, respectively. The 33.8% of cannabis consumers in Des Moines with household incomes of $35,000 to $75,000 is also slightly more than the 43-market survey at 29.6%.
The Consumer Research Around Cannabis data also profiles cannabis consumers at a more granular level. The “household profile” category shows which three were the largest purchasers or users of cannabis during the past year, or 33.8% collectively.

Affluent, no children at home: $75,000+ household income
Affluent white-collar worker: Family income $100,000+
Affluent Boomers: $100,000+ household income

Comparing cannabis purchasers and users in Des Moines with the 43-market survey by their employment status and occupation reveals some contrasts. The data indicates that many in Des Moines are working and contributing to the local economy.

Voting is a meaningful measure of civic responsibility. Millennials at 22%, Gen Xers at 54.4% and Baby Boomers at 12% who purchased or used cannabis during the past month voted in local, state and national elections, compared to 33%, 32.1% and 24.6%, respectively, in the 43-market aggregate survey.
This particular data point may have ramifications for future legislative efforts to legalize adult recreational cannabis sales in Iowa. While the Iowa Legislature’s majority Republicans have rebuffed Democrats’ proposals to legalize recreational marijuana, advocates suggest time may be on their side if an increasing body of citizens support legalization with their votes.

Cory Booker speaking in at the Florida Democratic Party ""Leadership Blue"" gala in Hollywood on June 21, 2025 (Photo by Mitch Perry/ Florida Phoenix)DAVIE — Is there any way for the Florida Democratic Party to break on through next year in races for governor and U.S. Senate after two consecutive statewide routs at the ballot box? The math would indicate it will be very difficult.
That’s likely why the party chose Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear as one of two keynote speakers at its annual Leadership Blue gala on Saturday night at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel in Hollywood (which actually is in Davie), the party’s biggest fundraising event of the year.
Beshear has proven that a Democrat can win in a red state, a formula Florida Democrats are desperate to figure out as GOP party registration numbers continue to increase each month. Beshear won re-election as governor in Kentucky in 2023 by five percentage points, while Donald Trump won that same state by 30 points.
“I’m living proof that if a Democrat can win in Kentucky, Democrats can win in Florida,” he proclaimed early in his speech.
He went on to say that Trump won the presidency last year because he convinced the last group of undecided voters that it was better to focus on lowering costs and addressing inflation than on “culture war issues.” That hasn’t exactly played out that way during the president’s first five months back in office, Beshear said. “It’s the opposite of what he’s doing right now.”
Beshear’s name has appeared on shortlists of potential Democratic presidential candidates for 2028, as has the event’s other keynote speaker, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker.
Earlier this spring, Booker spoke for 25 hours and five minutes on the floor of the U.S. Senate, setting a new record for the longest speech in Senate history.
He only went 30 minutes on Saturday night, but it was a performance. It began with him calling for the house lights to be put on so he could see all 1,000-plus attendees, and then he waded into the audience, ultimately standing atop a table to address the crowd.
“These are really, really scary times,” he said at one point. “And if you say you’re not, you’re not telling the truth. These are frightening times.”
Speaking to the Phoenix before the formal festivities began, Booker was asked whether he was concerned about the Democratic Party’s brand, which has declined to its lowest level in decades according to multiple public opinion polls.
“Leadership is about serving people,” he responded. “I think we should be less concerned about the Democratic Party and more concerned about the American people. I’m happy that my colleagues are looking not at what’s going to help the party, we’re fighting to preserve people’s healthcare. We’re fighting to protect people’s food stamps. Or their meals on wheels programs. This is the time to focus on the American people, leave the party and the partisanship for the elections coming up.”
He attacked the president, saying Trump was “coming to cut and gut vital programs for people here in Florida, and we need to do everything we can to stop him while at the same time showing there’s a different way to go.”
Bombs in Iran
Less than an hour into the event, Trump announced on social media that the United States had dropped bombs on Iran’s nuclear sites. While undoubtedly some Democrats were sharing the news at their tables via alerts on their cellphones, the incident was not publicly mentioned from the dais.
Booker told the Phoenix that he was supportive of Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine’s war powers bill, which would require a vote by Congress before the military could become involved in Iran.
“I’ve been very clear on supporting Kaine’s efforts that the president cannot declare war in this case without the clear constitutional mandate to come before Congress,” he said less than two hours before Trump made his announcement. “We should be debating that in the Senate. In the meantime, we need to be doing everything that we can to protect and support our ally Israel.”
Focusing on ‘core issues’

Beshear said in his speech that it was important for Democrats to talk to people, not at them. They can regain the faith of the American people, he said, by placing a “relentless focus on the core concerns of hardworking Americans.”
“Better jobs,” he said. “More affordable and accessible health care. Safer roads and bridges. The best education for our children and communities where people aren’t just safe, they feel safe. I believe that spending 80% of our time on these core issues shows that we are dialed in and we are going to deliver.”
In perhaps a nod to 2028, he made sure to highlight what he’s accomplished in his two terms as governor of Kentucky. That includes signing legislation just days after he was initially elected in 2019 restoring the right to vote for more than 140,000 Kentucky felons who had committed nonviolent offenses. He also acted to remove a Confederate statue, and he signed legislation restricting the controversial practice of conversion therapy (which the Kentucky GOP-controlled Legislature later overturned).
Despite his optimism, the reality in Florida is stark when it comes to the power Republicans have built up over the past five years. The GOP now enjoys a 1.3 million-voter advantage in party registration, their highest in state history. They also continue their supermajority status in both chambers of the Florida Legislature, and have held all statewide offices since Florida Democratic Party chair Nikki Fried left her leadership of the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services in 2022 to run for governor.
Fried gave a 20-minute speech sandwiched in between Beshear and Booker’s addresses, in which she was candid in assessing the party’s branding and performance in recent years. “We know we are the underdogs,” she said. “We are up against a 30-year Republican machine. But we also know that change doesn’t happen overnight. It happens when we organize. Every single day.”
‘Brand is broken’
“Our message is sh*t,” she added, as some members of  the crowd laughed, with some applauding.  “Our brand is broken. But quitting, hiding, waiting, or whining will not fix it. What will? Showing up.”
She added that voters up and down the state needed to see Democrats “not just when the ballots drop, but every damned day.”
South Florida U.S. Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Jared Moskowitz also gave speeches.
As is the case every year at Leadership Blue, Saturday afternoon was filled with various panel discussions — this time on school board races, voter registration efforts, and what people need to know about the mass deportations of undocumented immigrants taking place. However, unlike most other Leadership Blue events, the press was barred from attending any of these sessions.
Meanwhile, the Republican Party of Florida will hold its major summer gathering — the Florida Freedom Summit — on Aug. 2 in Orlando.

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.
But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
 Language matters

Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
 Security measures

Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

Biologists say Vermont’s loon boom is entering a new phase, which may mean lower levels of nesting success as the population levels out.

Vermont’s adult loon population is at an all-time high, but scientists have noticed a recent decrease in the number of chicks surviving.
In 2024, Vermont saw a record-breaking 123 nesting pairs, 11 of which landed at first-time nesting sites. Out of the 125 loon chicks that hatched in 2024, 65% survived through the end of August, slightly below the 2004-23 average of 76%, according to the Vermont Center for EcoStudies. 
Eric Hanson, a biologist for the Vermont Loon Conservation Project, said the three main reasons for less chick survival are competition, habitat loss, and predation from eagles and other wildlife.
Flooding in Vermont in recent years has contributed to habitat loss and affected nesting success. Twenty-one nests were flooded in the summers of 2023 and 2024, a stark contrast to the one flooded nest reported during the drier summers from 2020 to 2022, according to the center’s 2024 loon season summary.
Nesting loons make their homes in smaller lakes when larger lakes are taken by other pairs of loons with established breeding grounds there. These sites tend to have more marginal habitat, often lacking protective features like marshes or islands. Nests built there are more exposed to predators, such as eagles and snapping turtles. Adults must also leave small lakes to feed in bigger areas where fish are plentiful, and the additional time spent away from their young can lead to their neglect, according to the season summary.
A higher presence of adult loons also creates territorial conflict, resulting in “turf battles” between loons that could prevent a pair from nesting, Hanson said. Chick casualties can also occur during these encounters.
However, lower nesting success rates are part of a natural process as the loon population begins to level out, he said.

“Loons overall are doing really well, and we don’t need to see success all the time,” Hanson said. 
Vermont Fish & Wildlife Department Biologist Jillian Killborn said this new phase is a balancing act on the landscape. After years of great success in increasing the loon population, slower growth and productivity is to be expected.
“With any wildlife population, there’s natural checks and balances that are built into populations when they start to get too high or exceed carrying capacity on the landscape,” Killborn said. Now, scientists are figuring out how many loons will remain in Vermont long term and where, she said.
Despite the drop in chick survival rates, Vermont loon chicks do better than those in eastern Maine, New Hampshire and the Adirondack region, according to preliminary data from the Vermont Center for Ecostudies.

Since 1983, volunteers and biologists have been gathering on the third Saturday of July for LoonCount Day, a survey of adult and nesting loons in water bodies statewide. On July 19, Hanson said he expects more than 200 participants to visit 175 lakes in Vermont to tally the number of birds. These efforts are important for tracking loon health, nesting success and the identification of emerging threats, he said.
“We’re just trying to hit everything,” he said. “We’ve expanded that out as loons start to land on smaller ponds compared to what they used to do.” 
In tandem with LoonCount Day, the Vermont Loon Conservation Project at the Vermont Center for Ecostudies organizes an annual loon monitoring program, during which volunteers take regular trips to lakes throughout the summer season to post signs in nesting areas and keep tabs on new and known nesting pairs.

The nesting signs respectfully ask boaters to give the loons a little space since they are highly territorial, especially during breeding season. If humans get within 10 feet of their nest and the birds feel it’s threatened, they’re more likely to abandon it, Hanson said. 
In attempts to curb disruptions along ecologically sensitive shorelines, Vermont passed one of the most protective statewide wake sport regulations in the country in April 2024. However, Hanson said kayakers and people fishing in boats close to the shore create more harm for loons than far-off wake boats.

“If we can give them that little bit of space, they’re more likely to hunker down and watch you go by,” he said. 
In addition to shoreline disturbances, recreational fishing poses another serious threat to loon survival. After a period of decline, loon deaths due to lead poisoning from ingesting tackle have risen again over the past six years, Hanson said. Ingestion of lead tackle, monofilament fishing line and fishing hooks remains the cause of more than half of loon deaths in Vermont.
Vermont banned the use and sale of small lead sinkers in 2007, but despite the ban’s initial success, loons are still ingesting poisonous tackle, according to Hanson and Killborn. To address the issue, the Vermont Loon Conservation Project partnered with lake associations and the Fish & Wildlife Department last summer to install lead tackle and fishing line collection sites at around 30 public boat access sites, which they plan to add to this year.

Responsible fishing, boating and recreation are vital to loon health and survival, Killborn and Hanson said. As Vermont’s loon population stabilizes, they emphasized that the next phase of conservation will depend on how well humans learn to share the landscape.
Either way, Killborn said loon numbers are increasing at a sustainable rate, and overpopulation is not yet an issue. “I’m not sure if we’ll ever get there, depending on conditions,” she said.

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Many State Capitols Have Security Holes

Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.

“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”

Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
 Security measures

Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

Esteemed choreographer, activist and educator Katherine Dunham was born in Joliet, Illinois. For more than 30 years, she directed the Katherine Dunham Dance Company, the only self-supported black dance company in America at the time. 
She was often called the “Mother of Black Dance.” In the 1940s, Dunham’s troupe traveled across America, even performing in the segregated South. After discovering that African Americans were not allowed to buy tickets to one of her shows, she refused to perform. 
She received a standing ovation after a performance in Louisville, Kentucky, but following the performance she made an announcement that she would never perform there again because the manager would not allow black and white people to sit next to each other.

In this time of hardship, our administrators must show real leadership by cutting executive perks to save middle-class jobs.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Ellen Kaye and Claire Whitehouse: Amid federal chaos, will Vermont employers retain good jobs or reward their executives?.","This commentary is by Ellen Kaye and Claire Whitehouse, co-presidents of UVM Staff United. It is signed by 11 Vermont higher education and health care unions, listed below the text of the commentary.


On Tuesday, May 20, the dean of UVM libraries eliminated three frontline positions at the Dana Health Sciences Library, along with two other positions that are currently unfilled, leaving these suddenly unemployed workers and their library colleagues in disbelief and shock as the remaining staff scrambled to find ways to keep Vermont’s only medical library open to the UVM community, health care providers, patients and the public. And a week later, UVM’s associate controller laid off two employees performing essential regulatory work in the treasury services department.
UVM blamed these layoffs on the rising cost of health care, the federal government’s threats to higher ed funding, and, in the case of the libraries, the astronomical cost of journal subscriptions and databases. Yet UVM has chosen to retain many expensive budget line items, including raises for executives exceeding those negotiated by our unions, and we have heard that a multimillion dollar library redesign is in the works.
Our unions ask: why do our institutions cut good jobs and public services instead of addressing the root causes of rising costs? 
Across Vermont, too many of our institutions are responding to the rising cost of health insurance by eliminating jobs and reducing services Our state legislators just passed education reform bill H.454, which aims to reduce the rising tax burden of public education. Vermont’s health insurance premiums, which are the highest in the country, are a major driver of increasing education costs.
Earlier this spring, the city of Burlington laid off 25 employees in response to a budget crisis in part caused by the doubling of the city’s estimated employee benefits expenses. Investigations by the VT Health Care 911 coalition suggest that the primary cause of these runaway costs are UVM Health Network’s lopsided priorities: growing upper management jobs beyond industry standards while decreasing the number of employees engaged in direct patient care. 
The real question is: why do our public institutions and lawmakers choose to cut good Vermont jobs instead of acting together to rein in costs? Fixing the structural deficiencies of a broken health care system is challenging, but not impossible.
In the short term, we can start by confronting bloated executive compensation and bonuses at the UVM Health Network. In the longer term, we can commit to working together to enact a single payer health care system that more efficiently and effectively provides care for all. 
The cruelty and chaos of our federal government makes it critical for Vermont employers to do all they can to retain jobs. We have already seen many job losses in our state caused directly by Trump cuts: from federal jobs to federal contractors to the potential loss of programs like Northlands Jobs Corps. In addition to the Library and Treasury layoffs at UVM, several of our grant-funded colleagues have lost their jobs in the last month due to non-renewal of funding. 
Vermont cannot address the root causes of these federal cuts alone, though our legislators and our people power play an important role in facing down these threats. At the same time, it is essential that we pull out all the stops to keep decent jobs funded by state, municipal and private dollars.
To do this, employers and employees alike must come together to fight against corporate excess in statewide issues like health care premiums, and in industry-specific issues like the cost of journal subscriptions. And in this time of hardship, our administrators must show real leadership by cutting executive perks to save middle-class jobs.
At UVM, we are hopeful for an opportunity to change course. UVM will welcome Marlene Tromp as its next president on July 1. President Tromp has a choice: continue to opportunistically cut decent Vermont jobs and balance the budget on the backs of dedicated UVM workers, or invest in the people who make UVM work: in our expertise, our institutional knowledge, and our teaching and scholarship.
President Tromp can choose to put UVM back on track as a public good for all Vermonters, serving students and residents. Our unions call on her to make the right choice, and serve as a model for employers across Vermont.

A common whispered statement is, “Another flood and we’re outta here.”
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Dan Jones: Gov. Scott, why do you want your capital city to become a ghost town?.","This commentary is by Dan Jones. He lives in Montpelier, where he has twice unsuccessfully ran for mayor.


Gov. Scott, your capital city is in dire shape. Montpelier’s flood ravaged downtown lives in fear of the Winooski rising again. Its infrastructure is wearing out fast, while the customers for its downtown have vanished and its local government lacks the resources necessary to address these multiple challenges.
So imagine, if you will, future visitors coming to our state capital and finding a crossroads of boarded up stores and restaurants, graffiti tagged on the downtown windows and a pervasive sense of sad despair. Is that the face you want your state capital to show the world?
This specter is far from the image that the city has recently enjoyed. “One of the best small towns in New England.” “One of the best towns for shopping.” Montpelier has long basked in these accolades promoting the glory of its charming warm community. This quaint visual facade projected a desired image of beautiful Vermont, where one could simply find the good life. Today things are changing fast, and it is time you paid attention.
I invite you to walk down the quaint Main Street of Montpelier today. Spend some time talking to the small merchants along the way. You’ll be surprised at the underlying apprehension they share.
All of them have endured overlapping crises for the past six years which have left them fearful and fragile. They condemn your failure to bring back state workers and a faltering economy make grim prospects. A common whispered statement is, “Another flood and we’re outta here.” In my discussions with business owners, I’ve heard people saying that they expect a number of other businesses to close later in the year.
Most of these folks don’t have the energy or the resources to rebuild and restart yet again. Of course, lots of Vermont towns face future destruction from their placement by rivers. The main difference is that Montpelier is your state capital. If you can’t help it become a showcase for how Vermont creatively responds to the certain knowledge of future disasters, how will those you want to attract have any confidence that Vermont cares for resilient innovation?
I fear you are trapped between a couple of your Vermont values. You are certainly the proponent of thrift, with lean budgets and trusting the private sector to fix things. Then, you give lip service to protecting our landscape and our citizens, but without commitment to actually doing anything concrete. 
Our perilous times are demanding visionary leadership, rather than partisan game playing. Climate change is real. Legislators, I know, bemoan your lack of vision and leadership while tussling with how to make policy in the face of your do nothingness. 
We are seeing the economy contracting rapidly as we sink more deeply into these times of continuing and overlapping crises. Some of us are hoping that perhaps our leaders could talk a bit more honestly about what is probable on the horizon.
In hopes that your administration could start attending to the threats facing our capital, let me briefly list some that seem evident, but maybe they aren’t.
The downtown lives in fear of another flood and without some serious aid (no longer coming from the feds) the next wave of water will wash away most of our restaurants and businesses. We need immediate attention to floodproofing our buildings. That will mean major foundation and support work, not just tiles and flashing. Antique buildings will require a lot more attention than newer structures built with flooding in mind.
Since you failed to demand state workers return to town after the Covid lockdown created remote work, once-predictable customers are not coming down to shop and eat. That, coupled with disappearing Canadian visitors and economically strapped tourists, means our merchants’ confidence in their businesses is failing.
Your state office complex takes up almost half of the most valuable real estate in our downtown, yet you pay a Pittance in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT). When I tried to bring up the city’s failure to get more during the last mayoral election, Mayor McCullough brushed me off saying they tried and didn’t get much.
So perhaps our less-than-persistent capital city’s leadership is also to blame for this failure. However, since all the state’s water, sewer, roads, etc. are provided by the city, it seems consideration is due. By the way, without rapid attention and support, the wastewater treatment plant, which also serves the state offices, is at risk from the next flood.
For a future that would create flood resistant housing and commercial spaces, there are places near the capitol that would provide significant opportunity. Without the long hoped for public monies and investment opportunities, we now need a more “Vermont way” approach that can train local labor, use local materials and start showing how to make a truly meaningful response to the ongoing decline.
The time is now to decide, do you want people in the future to say “when times got tough, there was Phil Scott,” or will they be asking (as many legislators do now) “when times got tough, where was Phil Scott?”

Biologists at the DNR’s Atlanta field office were first alerted to the bear’s predicament in 2023 through trail camera photos showing a cub with his head stuck in the lid. He proved elusive over the next two years, occasionally appearing in trail camera photos before disappearing after a day or two.

However, a Hillman resident captured the bear on their trail cameras in late May, and with their permission, DNR biologists set up a baited enclosure trap. The bear was safely caught on June 2, and anesthetizing the creature, they cut the lid off its neck and collected measurements and other data.
The DNR wasn’t able to determine how the young bear got its head stuck in a five-inch hole in the lid, nor where the lid came from, however a statement from the department noted the lid is similar to those on 55-gallon drums hunters use to bait bear, or that store materials like chicken feed that can attract bears.

While bear baiting is legal in Michigan, bait containers can only be used on private land and holes in those containers must have a diameter or one inch or less, or 22 inches or greater. The DNR encourages landowners to recycle or crush containers like empty cheeseball tubs, and to follow the Association of Fish & Wildlife Agencies’ “BearWise” advice on securing their garbage.

“Container openings of a certain size can result in bears and other wildlife getting their heads or other body parts stuck in them, leading to injury or death,” Cody Norton, the DNR’s bear, furbearer and small game specialist said in a statement.“It’s important to remember that the opening diameter is more important than the size of the container.”
According to the DNR, the bear weighed 110 pounds, which is standard for a young bear that is still growing. Apart from significant scarring and an abscess on its neck, the bear seemed healthy and was released once the anesthesia wore off.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/immobilized-bear-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-22 07:58:55.080516

(Photo by Steven Garcia/Getty Images)A year into her first term in office, New Jersey Assemblywoman Sadaf Jaffer decided not to run for reelection.
The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.

Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

– Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky


But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”

Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
 Language matters

Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”

“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”

Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”

That, famously, has not always been the case.
Through much of the early 2000s, the preeminent issue facing legislators each session was whether education would be fully funded. There were knock down, drag out fights about education funding.
Most times it didn’t happen. From 2005 until 2024, education was fully funded once.
But in 2024, legislators fully funded education and did it again this year in the special session that was held late last month.
When referencing the full funding of kindergarten through 12th schools, most times educators, policymakers and advocates are referring to the formula that provides for the basics of operating a local school district. The basics include items like staff salaries, utilities, transportation, textbooks and other items needed to operate a school district.
Starting in the 2003-2004 school year, the Mississippi Adequate Education Program incorporated the formula that determined how much money each school district needed to meet those basic needs.
The MAEP arrived at that dollar amount through an objective formula developed by education experts and put into law by legislators.
But after the MAEP was developed and passed into law, many legislators and more than one governor balked at fully funding it. They said it provided too much money for public education. There were multiple efforts to rewrite or even replace the funding formula.
Finally, in the 2024 legislative session, House Speaker Jason White, R-West, and his leadership team offered a new formula that would provide as much or more money for the schools than MAEP for at least one year. But the proposal removed the objective funding formula, leaving it to the whim of the legislators what full funding was each year.
Many educators and advocates balked at the idea of leaving the definition of full funding to lawmakers – many of whom had a history of wanting to underfund education. Some feared legislators would offer the big pot of money the year the MAEP was replaced, but in later years reduce the money, pulling the old bait-and-switch.
But a funny thing happened on the way to rewriting the Adequate Education Program. Senate Education Chair Dennis DeBar, R-Leakesville, backed by Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, insisted that objective criteria be used in the new formula to determine full funding.
House leaders and Gov. Tate Reeves, wanting desperately to say they replaced the MAEP, yielded and agreed to the objective criteria for the new, simply named Mississippi Student Funding Formula.
In essence, the new funding formula is a lot like the old funding formula with objective parameters and a mandate for the Legislature to fully fund it, though the Supreme Court has ruled that legislators do not have to follow the law and fully fund MAEP. Supreme Court members would presumably reach the same conclusion with the new funding formula.
But legislators would look hypocritical to make a big deal of passing a new formula to replace MAEP and not fully fund it.
This year, we can give lawmakers the benefit of the doubt and say that they are excited about fully funding education.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/06164830/Ms.-Dept.-of-Education4.jpg,,,2025-06-22 07:58:55.080516

Vermont Country Store owner Lyman Orton will showcase more than 250 paintings of everything from covered bridges to clotheslines in a new wing under construction at Manchester’s Southern Vermont Arts Center.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Historic trove of Vermont art set to go public in a permanent home.","A new wing at Manchester’s Southern Vermont Arts Center, illustrated here by the Richmond-based Birdseye architecture and building company, is set to open next summer.
MANCHESTER — Over the decades that Vermont Country Store owner Lyman Orton has amassed what Yankee magazine has called “the largest private collection of 20th-century Vermont art in the world,” the 83-year-old has hung his paintings at home, the office, seemingly everywhere but a single, permanent site.
Then Orton gathered them two years ago for a state tour that began at Manchester’s Southern Vermont Arts Center.
“This collection should end up here,” he recently recalled thinking about the arts center, “so my kids don’t sell it at a yard sale.”
Orton assured he’s just joking about his three sons, the third generation to run the family’s multimillion-dollar retail and catalog business. But he’s serious about wanting a place to share his more than 250 paintings in perpetuity. That’s why he’s breaking ground on a two-story addition to the arts center that’s set to open next summer.
“We are aligned with Lyman on the vision that this should be a public resource,” Amelia Wiggins, the arts center’s executive director, said of showcasing the collection. “We know the beauty of this area is such a draw, and art that captures it compels both locals and visitors.”
The new 12,000-square-foot wing is expected to cost $8.5 million, with related sitework raising the project up to nearly $10 million, according to a state land use permit. The building will be funded by a $14.5 million capital campaign that’s hit 90% of its goal.
“We’re not just constructing galleries, we’re creating space for freedom of expression and bold ideas,” said Bob Van Degna, president of the arts center’s board of trustees and, along with Orton, a top project donor.

‘What’s the story behind it?’
The wing now under construction is a full circle moment for Orton, who was 5 years old when his parents founded the Vermont Country Store in the nearby town of Weston in 1946.
Orton grew up in the unplugged days before the interstate and internet as artists working with oils, watercolors and woodblock ink “came up from down country” to capture the landscape and lifestyles of Vermont.
“They didn’t just pass through,” he recalled in an interview. “They started living here, painted what they loved.”
A group calling itself the Southern Vermont Artists displayed its work on the lawn of Manchester’s Equinox hotel and inside the gym of the nearby Burr and Burton Academy before purchasing the property that would become the arts center in 1950.
Turning 20 a decade later, Orton started his own collection, not knowing he was seeding a lifelong mission to “repatriate” Vermont art sold and scattered over the decades across the country and around the world.
When choosing pieces, Orton has looked for artists such as Luigi Lucioni, whose oils and etchings appear in the Smithsonian American Art Museum; Kyra Markham, an actress, painter and printmaker who was briefly married to the son of architect Frank Lloyd Wright; and Ogden Pleissner, nationally recognized for his Life magazine work and sporting scenes.
But Orton has ultimately focused on the art itself. Take Rockwell Kent’s 1926 depiction of Sunderland’s Union Church. Many see the canvas for its creator, whose works are displayed at the National Gallery of Art. Orton has appreciated it for memorializing the place his great-grandfather helped build.
“I look for paintings that have a ‘there’ there,” he said. “What is it? Where is it? What’s the story behind it?”

‘Art accessible to everybody’
When the collector debuted the traveling show “For the Love of Vermont: The Lyman Orton Collection” in 2023, he grouped both minor and master works into themes such as “Making A Living,” which pictured sugaring, slate quarrying and sawmills, and “Coming Together,” which portrayed families, fairs and ice fishing.
Amid paintings of barns and covered bridges, Orton has an affinity for depictions of clotheslines, be it Leo Blake’s circa 1940 “Summer Laundry” or Mitzi Goward’s “Out to Dry.”
“There is nothing more consistent with a Vermonter’s heritage of practicality, frugality and common sense than hanging the washing outside,” he said of the latter work. “Sunshine and the breeze are free.”
Similarly, Orton traded discreet museum labels for large-print signs more familiar in a school or senior center.
“That makes the art accessible to everybody, not just experts and Chardonnay sippers,” he said.
The traveling show included a postscript requesting “new, corrected or missing information” about the people and places illustrated but not necessarily identified in the art. In response, visitors from Manchester, Vermont, to Manchester, England, offered dozens upon dozens of comments.
“One woman left a card that tells it all,” Orton recalled. “She said, ‘Dear Lyman, I had to drag my husband to the show — and then I had to drag him out.’”
The state tour went on to attract crowds at the Bennington Museum, Montpelier’s Vermont Historical Society and the Manchester Community Library. But each location could only squeeze in a fraction of the full collection.
“It’s 250, 300, 400 paintings,” Orton said of the ever-changing total. “I’m not being coy. I bought 15 paintings in the last two months, just because things happen to come up. But because there’s so much art, it creates the opportunity to have a scheduled rotation.”
The Southern Vermont Arts Center is expecting to exhibit about 75 works in the new wing and keep the rest in a climate-controlled storage space for future viewing.
The addition, designed by the Richmond-based Birdseye architecture and building company, will include a second general exhibition gallery and a patio for outdoor events. But Orton’s collection promises to be the main draw.
“By being the highest bidder on the dozens of artworks of Vermont that Lyman Orton saw go up for sale at local country auctions, he made himself every Vermonter’s heir,” author Anita Rafael wrote in the collection’s 2023 catalog. “By keeping the art of Vermont in Vermont, it is tacitly being passed down to all Vermonters.”

The Sunnymede project and extensive legal fees have inspired controversy in town.

This story by Clare Shanahan was first published in the Valley News on June 19.
HARTLAND — Vermont’s highest court ruled in favor of a farm store planned on Route 5 near the Interstate 91 interchange, paving the way for the project to move forward.
In a split June 13 ruling, the Vermont Supreme Court rejected an appeal from the Hartland Planning Commission and upheld a lower court’s decision that the proposed 9,000-square-foot Sunnymede Farm Store is permitted under Vermont’s Act 250 and the Hartland Town Plan.
Plans for the project include a two-story, barn-style farm store, deli and bakery with a 46-space parking lot on a property two miles from Sunnymede Farm. Both the 600-acre cattle and maple operation and the store property are owned by Florida real estate developer Aubrey Ferrao.
“My client is very pleased, but is also saddened that the good people of Hartland had to pay for this completely senseless appeal,” James Goss, an attorney representing Sunnymede, said in an email statement about the ruling Wednesday.
Ferrao bought the 17-acre farm store property in 2018 and the District 3 Environmental Court awarded Sunnymede an Act 250 permit for the project in 2023.
Shortly after the permit was issued, the Hartland Planning Commission and Two Rivers Ottauquechee Regional Commission filed an appeal that Vermont Superior Court Judge Thomas G. Walsh denied last summer.
The two planning commissions argued that the development constitutes “strip development” that extends construction along highways and contributes to sprawl outside of village and town centers, so it does not comply with Act 250. They also argued that it does not align with the town and regional plans because it is in a rural area.
Walsh argued that the development “makes efficient use” of space and infrastructure so it doesn’t constitute strip development. He also said that no provisions in the planning documents use strict enough language to deny the project.
After the first unsuccessful appeal, the Planning Commission forged ahead alone, appealing the Vermont Superior Court decision to the Supreme Court.
The commission’s decision to file the second appeal prompted some backlash and confusion from others in town, including the Selectboard, the Valley News reported at the time.
With no zoning code, development in Hartland is largely guided by state law and the town and regional plans. In its second appeal, the Planning Commission argued again that the farm store should not be allowed under Act 250 or the town plan.
The Supreme Court found that the project constitutes “strip development,” a change from the lower court ruling, but argued that because it is “agricultural in nature and unlikely to attract other commercial development” it is still allowed under Act 250, Vermont Supreme Court Associate Justice Nancy J. Waples wrote in the decision.
The other piece of the Planning Commission’s argument was that the farm store is not allowed under the Hartland Town Plan because it is in a designated rural area.
Under the Town Plan, only “low density residential development” is allowed in rural areas, the Planning Commission argued. But, the plan also describes the area around I-91 as a “‘Rural business area’ and encourages further business development there,” according to the court ruling.
Because this language “is so internally inconsistent with the rest of the town plan,” it doesn’t provide clear guidance and can’t be enforced, Waples wrote.
The Planning Commission is “obviously disappointed” in the decision, but “we consider the case over with now so we’ll have to move on,” Vice Chairman Dan Jerman said in an interview.
For its part, the Selectboard did not issue a response to the ruling as a group, Selectboard Chairman Phil Hobbie said in a Thursday interview.
But, in his opinion, “the writing was on the wall when our regional planning commission, Two Rivers, decided not to make the appeal once they lost the first appeal.”
The town spent a total of $28,000 for both Sunnymede appeals, Hobbie said.
Lengthy legal process
The Sunnymede project and extensive legal fees have inspired controversy in town.
Early this week, Planning Commission chairman Dave Dukeshire resigned via email after posting about the project in the Hartland Listserv.
On Tuesday evening, other Planning Commission members “firmly” requested in an email that Dukeshire not post again until the Planning Commission could discuss the issue at an upcoming meeting because he had caused “inflammatory Listserv replies at a time when the HPC is trying to approve a new town plan and create a bylaw.”
Two hours later, Dukeshire resigned.
Moving forward, the Planning Commission and Selectboard are taking some of the lessons from the lawsuit into account as they update Hartland’s town plan.
The two groups and the regional planning commission are also planning to work together to write a set of unified development bylaws that will help to formally regulate some portions of the town plan, including for housing projects.
A contract with Two Rivers to work together on the plan was finalized in early June.
The town plan was originally set to expire in May but when a new town plan was not ready, the Selectboard voted to readopt the 2017 Town Plan in the interim.
“We did not want to leave the town vulnerable,” Hobbie said of the readoption of the old plan. Work on a new plan is ongoing and slated to be finalized in the fall.
Ahead of the May deadline, the Town Plan was “very close” to being ready for Selectboard review, but there were outstanding questions with the lawsuit still pending, Jerman said.
“We didn’t know how far we needed to take the town plan, so rather than pass something and invest all the time and possibly make a mistake if we got an adverse court ruling we decided to just put the other plan in place,” Jerman said.
Now, the Planning Commission is “wrestling” with how to include clearer language in the land use portion of the plan — a point that the Supreme Court said was lacking — and add language that will let them write other land use regulations in the future that they can enforce, like the unified bylaws or a zoning code, Jerman said.
As for the farm store, there is “no definite timeline” for construction yet because a “great deal of preliminary work” such as hiring contractors and other vendors for the project has to be done before breaking ground, Goss, the store’s attorney, said.

Elise Coyle is a reporter with the Community News Service, part of the University of Vermont’s Reporting & Documentary Storytelling program.
Ryan Farrington eyed the green and red bocce balls between the rails of his specially designed ramp, a device that looked like part of a roller coaster track. 
With his family by his side, the Rutland athlete pushed each ball down the ramp and watched them shoot across the grass as he tried to get as close as possible to the target.
“He is quietly observing, but he loves every second,” said his mother Michele Farrington. “It’s great to get to be a part of a team.”  
Ryan, whose speech is limited, nodded in agreement from his wheelchair.

The sentiment was echoed by players, coaches and organizers alike during the Special Olympics Vermont Summer Games last weekend. For two days, 12 delegations from across the state gathered at St. Michael’s College to compete and celebrate with athletes like Farrington. 
“We get to put the athletes’ talents on display,” said Susannah Kelley, a bocce coach and board member for Special Olympics Vermont. “More importantly, what we get to see is the teamwork that comes together and then, of course, the sportsmanship.”
The organization brought together some 500 delegates this year for the event, which is free for both athletes and attendees. 
Following the opening ceremony Friday, the Games kicked off with basketball and bocce competitions Saturday morning.  
Several bocce courts lined the field, with tents for each delegation set up on either side. Volunteers worked to track scores and organize the games, while athletes competed in teams of two to four. 
Brothers Matthew and Ben Spinney were at the Games playing bocce for the Chittenden County delegation.

“I have fun, and everybody gets gold medals,” said Ben. 
Jessie Huntoon, an assistant coach for the Central Vermont delegation, was standing by as athlete Jerry Weston faced Farrington on the bocce field.  
Huntoon has been involved with Special Olympics Vermont for over a decade. She initially began as an assistant for day programs before helping house athletes.  
“I fell in love with the people,” Huntoon said. 
She lives with athlete Rachael Skinder. The two go to concerts, Broadway shows and more. 
“We have a blast,” Huntoon said. 
Camaraderie at the games was not limited to bocce. On the basketball courts, teams competed together in hopes of winning gold. 
Athlete Jeremy Flemming from the Windham Wizards has been playing basketball for almost 30 years. 
“I love having fun with the team and being a leader,” Flemming said.

Jeremy and the Wizards went on to win their division. But winning wasn’t the only important part of the event. 
“I’ve seen athletes go from not wanting to socialize to dancing and meeting friends,” said Rhonda Mercier, head of the Franklin County Maple Leafs delegation.
The Special Olympics can also fill a gap for athletes with disabilities after high school. 
The national org runs a sports-centered program called Unified Champion Schools, which tries to make K-12 schools welcoming for all students. Farrington, the Rutland athlete, has been playing bocce for almost a decade and began in elementary school as part of the program. 
Kelsey Conway, a vice president at Special Olympics Vermont, has worked at the organization for over six years and seen firsthand how the Games can benefit athletes and volunteers alike. 
“The perspective on life that our athletes have is so inspiring and really, really helps to put things into perspective,” Conway said. “You’re with a whole bunch of people who are just happy to be there and happy to be living life.”
Special Olympics Vermont will meet again in St. Albans for the Fall Games on Sept. 14.

(Photo by Delaney Nolan for Louisiana Illuminator)NEW ORLEANS – Every morning, to avoid getting sick, Jessica Baudean must take a long trip across the Mississippi. Baudean, who is disabled, lived in a tent near Tchoupitoulas Street until she received housing support in 2022, and now lives with her partner in an apartment in Avondale.
Beaudean and her partner, Terry Asevado, are methadone patients. Once heroin users, they now take a prescribed daily dose of methadone – a synthetic opioid medication which relieves them of their withdrawal symptoms and cravings. Baudean and Asevado say it’s changed their lives and allowed them to function. 
But to get the medication, the couple must travel for hours every day. If they can’t get a ride through Medicaid, Baudean must climb into her wheelchair and have Asevado push her 1.4 miles to the nearest bus stop. Then they spend an hour taking two buses,crossing the river to reach the only clinic on the city’s East Bank which is allowed to give them their medicine. If they arrive even a minute past noon, they miss their dose. If they miss a dose, they may be denied the next one. And if they’re arrested?
“Poor Terry,” sighs Baudean. “I know he’s still going to be sick right now.”
As the Trump administration cracks down on immigrants and hikes tariffs on Mexican imports, largely in the name of fighting the fentanyl crisis, a look at the experience of local people wrestling with substance use disorder suggests different approaches could be more effective.
Louisiana has among the highest overdose death rates nationwide. It’s also embattled by repeated disasters, internal migration and displacement, and poor public health support. And examples of effective drug policy under similar pressures can be found in a surprising place, far from the Gulf South: Ukraine.

Prison here, prison there
In a corridor within Strizhavka Detention Center, a medium-security prison complex in Vinnytsia, Ukraine, Iana Romaniuk smacks the glowing blue button of a vending machine. Inside, a sterile syringe tumbles to the bottom. 
“There are clean needles, lubricants and condoms” – and no cameras, explains Romaniuk, who works with Free Zone, an organization providing harm reduction services in Ukrainian prisons. 
“It’s new, installed 10 days ago,” she adds, with a hint of pride. 
Romaniuk, an unassuming woman with glasses and straight brown hair, spends her days advocating for the men in this sprawling prison complex and attached hospital. Though far from the frontlines, the specter of war hangs overhead. Security guards forbid photos of an old sign written in Russian, the language of their invaders.
The vending machine at the facility in central Ukraine is just part of one of the world’s most effective harm reduction networks, still going – and growing – after three years of war.

Harm reduction is a public health approach that emphasizes minimizing the negative physical and social impacts of risky behavior. It aims to inform and support, rather than punish, drug users. It can mean supplying clean needles and naloxone, which can reverse an overdose. And it involves testing for HIV, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and other diseases. 
In Strizhavka, about 3½ hours southeast of Kyiv, more than 25% of the 400 inmates receive opioid substitution therapy, or OST, just like Baudean and Asevado back in Louisiana. Here, a doctor distributes it in tiny paper cups from a pump bottle.
Since the prison began offering inmates free, clean syringes, it has seen zero new HIV cases. The prison even has a program that trains interested inmates to be social workers. Trained inmates support their incarcerated peers and can potentially work in addiction recovery after their release. 
The radically different approach is striking because, though 5,000 miles apart, Ukraine and Louisiana wrestle with similar public health challenges. Ukraine has among the highest HIV and intravenous drug use rates in Europe, trailing only Russia. Louisiana has the fourth highest HIV rate in the U.S., the fifth highest rate for drug overdose mortality and disproportionately high levels of hepatitis C, a viral infection commonly spread through sharing needles.
“Louisiana is very unique with its positioning,” said Ellis Lee, a former employee of New Orleans’ Syringe Access Program (NOSAP) at Crescent Care. “We have so many viral illnesses, historically, in part because we’re a port city.”
To grapple with the crisis, Louisiana has made some policy updates in recent years. New Orleans’ City Council decriminalized fentanyl test strips in 2021, and Narcan has helped slow overdose deaths. But drug policy in the U.S. South – and in Russia – has remained largely punitive, while Ukraine’s has grown steadily more progressive – partly in reaction to Russia’s approach.
The contrasts are many. Hypodermic needle exchanges exist all over Ukraine and are rapidly expanding. In Louisiana, needle exchanges are only allowed in East Baton Rouge Parish, New Orleans, Shreveport and Alexandria. NOSAP is the Gulf South’s largest needle exchange, serving over 2000 people in six months. There are no syringe exchanges in Louisiana prisons. 
The results speak for themselves. Before the war, Ukraine had seen an 81% reduction in AIDS mortality since 2010, according to the Ukrainiain Public Health Center, and drug overdose rates fell in 2021. 
Meanwhile, drug overdoses in Louisiana rates more than quintupled between 2017 and 2022 – from 401 to 2,376 – and hepatitis C infections are increasing, based on numbers from the state health department and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Since the war began in February 2022, Ukraine’s harm reduction networks have successfully pushed the government to expand services in light of the crisis. That’s partly how, as one incarcerated person put it, “civilization came to this place.”

‘The best way to torture somebody’
Beaudean’s partner, Terry Asevado, was arrested this spring in Jefferson Parish for bringing contraband into a correctional center. He’s still in jail because they can’t afford his $10,000 bail. Baudean said she knows he’s suffering because the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office does not facilitate prescribed methadone for people in jail. Baudean remembers a time she was arrested and cut off from her medication.
“I wanted to kill myself, straight up, but I didn’t have the guts to do it,” she recalls. 
Baudean remembers weeks of sleeplessness, being unable to hold down food or water, throwing up bile, finding all noise excruciating. 
“It’s the best way to torture somebody. Get them addicted to some stuff, and then put them in a room and lock it.”
Federal and state regulations permit jailed patients to receive methadone, but parishes would need to coordinate with the local methadone clinic to do so, according to Traci Perry, Louisiana’s State Opioid Treatment Authority. Gretna’s methadone clinic is run by Behavioral Health Group. They say they’ve never been contacted by Jefferson Parish Corrections, nor by CorrectHealth, the company that provides medical services for the jail.
“We would look forward to the opportunity to begin a relationship with them, so they can best serve our patients,” said Michelle Peres-Tenorio, BHG’s program director. 
Most correctional facilities bring in an outside contractor to provide medication-assisted treatment services, Peres-Tenoria added. The treatment typically involves a non-methadone medication for “a very limited amount of days,” followed by only over-the-counter medication, she said. “The staff is typically not educated on methadone treatment.”
A JPSO public information officer told the Illuminator the department has no policy on the matter and referred questions to CorrectHealth, which did not respond to queries.

Mobile outreach testing
Harm reduction also entails making sure people can get testing and treatment for illnesses associated with drug use. That’s why, inside a van parked near a Kyiv methadone clinic, behind sheer peach-colored curtains, Mykolai, an addicted man who declined to share his last name, folded himself into a seat at a tiny plastic table. Leaning in, Valeriy Timoshenko, a social worker with the Ukrainian harm reduction organization Convictus, helped him prick his finger. Mykolai pinched a plastic dropper to carefully take a few drops of blood, releasing them onto two HIV and hepatitis testing strips laid out before him.
“You’re living with a partner, so I can give you one to take home,” Timoshenko told him. The results of the tests – HIV and hepatitis – take a few minutes to appear. “If your results are positive, I will describe where you should go to get free treatment.” 
Mykolai, a 38-year-old former landscaper, handed Timoshenko a card. Printed on the card is a QR code that Timoshenko can scan to see how often Mykolai has gotten tested and some of his medical history. The card also qualifies Mykolai to receive a small payment – 100 Ukrainian hryvnia, equal to about $2.40 – for being tested. Mykolai also got five cards to hand out to friends, slowly building a kind of self-testing network.
Mykolai looked down, his expression neutral. The HIV test was negative, but he’d tested positive for hepatitis C. 
Louisiana does have some mobile outreach testing units. Some groups, like Below Sea Level Aid, also offer incentives when they can. But while Ukrainian police are forbidden from approaching the clinic or Timoshenko’s van, “police used to stake out NOSAP,” said Below Sea Level Aid founder Jack Waguespack, which he said deters the group from parking its testing unit outside clinics.

War, storms, and displacement
Already, there has been some exchange of expertise between Ukraine and Louisiana.
On a February afternoon, Velta Parkhomenko, project manager of the NGO Club Eney, a woman-focused harm reduction organization in Kyiv, sat before a screen as chatter from a sobriety meeting filtered in from the next room. Parkhomenko and another Ukrainian harm reduction worker were meeting online with two of their peers from Louisiana, who asked their names not be disclosed for fear of reprisal at their workplace. Talking excitedly through the screens, they ticked through some policy differences in their respective homes.
Perhaps the biggest: prescription parity.
In Ukraine, where about 20,000 people receive opioid substitution treatment, patients can go to government or private clinics for methadone prescriptions, get them filled at any pharmacy, and then take home a 10-day supply. Thanks to advocacy efforts, patients were given 30-day supplies during certain periods of the war.
“That is not how that works here,” one Louisiana worker said, startled enough to laugh. Patients “have to fight really hard to be able to even just get a seven-day take home” supply, they said.
Methadone is among the most controlled substances in the U.S., meaning it’s under restrictions that make acquiring it especially difficult for patients. In the event of a natural disaster, it has to be transported to impacted areas under armed guard.  
Just one methadone clinic exists on Orleans Parish’s east bank, serving more than 900 OST patients. 
Clinics are meant to hand out extra take-home supply before storms, but adoption of that policy is up to the discretion of clinics, and has not been widespread, according to sources familiar with the issue. During evacuations, there is no protocol in place for ensuring an OST patient has continued access to medication, nor gauging need – unlike, say, dialysis patients. 
Louisiana’s State Opioid Treatment Authority, part of its state health department, makes decisions about methadone dosing sites and transportation during declared emergencies, which then require approval from federal officials.
The divergence in policy is notable since Ukraine and Louisiana are both deeply familiar with displacement and evacuations.

Sitting in her office in a quiet apartment block in Kyiv, Tatiana Lebid wears a pink headband and sparkling eye shadow. She’s the founder of VONA, an organization for women who use drugs, as well as a recovering addict. 
She lists the effects of the war on her country, many of which will sound familiar to those who lived through Hurricane Katrina and other major storms: post-traumatic stress disorder, the destruction of medical facilities, a “brain drain” that’s reduced the number of health care workers, and a spike in domestic violence. Lost documents, displacement, unemployment and increased police encounters with curfews in effect are also commonplace, she said. 
Lebid herself was shaken last year when a drone dropped bombs just behind her apartment block. She recalled leaning out her window to try and see the damage, certain the bomb had destroyed her car. It was spared, but she has felt the fear that has driven millions to flee Ukraine. 
A major part of VONA’s work is to ensure people forced to flee can continue receiving treatment and support. They help Ukrainians replace lost identification documents and refer users to nearby OST clinics using a simple tool: a telephone hotline.
Lebid’s colleagues field calls from every region in the country, from prisons, and even from Ukrainian soldiers on the frontlines. OST recipients were exempt from being conscripted into the military until March 2024, though some still are not draft eligible because of their HIV or tuberculosis status. 
Bodhan Protsenko, manning the phones, says the beginning of war saw a dramatic uptick in calls: 50-70 per day, up from eight before the war, he said. 
Protsenko pays special attention to the soldiers’ calls. He served a year and a half on the frontline and knows how hard it can be. Lately, he’s seen an uptick in soldiers using opiates. He isn’t surprised – the drugs can help with stress and sleep, he said.
‘I understand how to do this in a smart way’
Back in Strizhavka, Romaniuk leaves the vending machine behind and enters a small office. Yellow light falls over the wallpaper. Outside, an inmate chops firewood.
Advocates say prisons are where the need for harm reduction services, like clean needles, are most needed. Syringes on the black market can cost a hundred times more what they cost outside prison, which leads to reuse and illness. HIV rates are 25 times higher for the incarcerated. 
Needle exchange programs in Ukraine count more than 900 incarcerated clients and some 20,000 syringes replaced as of this spring. Before beginning its exchange program a year ago, the Strizhavka prison used to see a handful of new HIV cases each year. This year, they’ve seen none.

Oleksandr Lushnia, sitting against the wall and smiling shyly, is one of the prison’s incarcerated people who’ve been trained as addiction social workers. A former construction worker, he was put in prison about three years ago for stealing a bicycle. 
“Before this program, people could take dirty needles from trash bins – broken, dirty needles. Or they’d pay money to get clean needles, which meant they had to do different harmful things,” Lushnia said. “Now, people get infections less. I feel good. I understand how to do this [manage addiction] in a smart way, and tell other people how to.”
Lushnia took eight lessons in social work over one month, and was trained in how to administer Narcan and treat overdoses. He hopes to continue working in addiction recovery once released. Out of more than 400 inmates trained through the program, 77 have become certified social workers within the prison program.
And the war has only spurred Ukraine to bolster its efforts.
In fall 2022, Russian forces entered and occupied the southern city of Kherson, including the prisons there. Soldiers cut off OST, which is banned in Russia, for all inmates – then flaunted the decision on Russian state media. 
In response, Ukraine stood firm – and in fact further expanded OST services, from three prisons to 10, now serving more than 500 people.
Now, there are fears U.S. policy on opioid addiction treatment could become more regressive under the Trump administration. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., head of the Department of Health and Human Services, has talked about “healing farms” or work camps for people with addiction, similar to the system once used in Soviet Russia.
Baudean would like to see Louisiana, instead, draw some lessons from Ukraine – like having more clinics, staffed by more counselors with lived experience of addiction, like Parkhomenko. There are formerly addicted people “that really changed their life, and they did the right thing and turned it around,” says Baudean. “So why don’t we hire the ones that did, to teach the ones that can’t?”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Ukraine_0407-2-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-06-22 06:58:06.050290

Potentially jeopardizing them further is a federal proposal around habitat loss.,"Editor’s note: We now offer an audio version of our Sunday features. To access, click on the player above.
“There’s a piping plover here somewhere,” said Corrie Folsom-O’Keefe, reacting to a faint peeping on a recent foggy, cloudy, on-and-off-rainy afternoon along Sandy Point Beach in West Haven.
And then after a pause: “Yeah, right there,” she said. “Oh, these ones might have chicks. There’s a pair here that had three chicks.”
The tiny white, black and gray shore birds move fast, darting up and down the beach. “These guys are maybe 14-ish days old right now,” continued Folsom-O’Keefe, who is the director of bird conservation for Audubon Connecticut, the state office of the National Audubon Society.
Piping plovers are a federally designated endangered species, meaning they are protected under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act, ESA, enacted in 1973, which is managed jointly by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in the Interior Department, and the National Marine Fisheries Service, in the Commerce Department.
Piping plovers are also probably the best known of the approximately one dozen federally endangered or threatened animal and plant species in Connecticut.
Folsom-O’Keefe said there are just over 2,000 pairs of piping plovers along the Atlantic coast — that’s Florida to Maine. In the current nesting season, there are roughly 80 pairs in Connecticut, and about a dozen of them have been spotted nesting along Sandy Point Beach.

To keep piping plovers safe during nesting season on Connecticut beaches, state officials and wildlife groups put fencing and a string perimeter around nests with signs warning the public. But with storms and sea level rise, tides can still flow inside the enclosures, as this shows with a tide line intruding beyond the fencing. Credit: Jan Ellen Spiegel / CT Mirror
This year, as in every spring-summer breeding season, Audubon and environmental groups working with the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection have fenced the birds’ beach-level nests and erected perimeters with string to keep people from disturbing them — an act that is punishable under federal law.
But the fencing is no match for the impacts of climate change, which is causing rising sea levels and more intense storms. 
The evidence is clear this day. The residue from earlier high tide lines — wrack lines, as they are called — sits just outside some of the fencing around the nest, even pushing though it in spots, jeopardizing the habitat these birds need to breed.
Folsom-O’Keefe said a number of high tides and storms destroyed some nests right before Memorial Day. 
“The birds do re-nest, but then we have to re-setup 40 to 50 enclosures, which is this enormous amount of effort,” she said.

Potentially jeopardizing the birds further is a proposal by the Trump administration that in effect would mean loss or destruction of habitat would no longer constitute “harm” to wildlife under the ESA.
The law prohibits what’s called the “take” of an endangered fish or animal. The law specifically says: “The term ‘take’ means to harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or to attempt to engage in any such conduct.” 
The administration summarizes the change it wants to make this way:
“The existing regulatory definition of ‘harm’ which includes habitat modification, runs contrary to the best meaning of the statutory term ‘take.’ We are undertaking this change to adhere to the single, best meaning of the ESA.”
“What the Trump administration seeks to do is to strip endangered species of habitat protections almost completely,” said Noah Greenwald, endangered species director at the national Center for Biological Diversity. “That’s quite concerning, because habitat destruction is the main cause of species extinction. You just really can’t protect and recover endangered species without protecting the places where they live.”
Indeed a recent article in The Conversation by two professors, Mariah Meek, a biology professor at Michigan State University, and Karrigan Börk, a law professor at the University of California Davis, provides the data to back that up. It cited a U.S. study from 2019 that showed that habitat loss or degradation caused far more species to be listed as endangered from 1975 to 2017 than any other factor, including outright killing. And it cited another global 2022 study that determined “habitat loss threatened more species than all other causes combined.”
The professors wrote: “Habitat protection is the single most important factor in the recovery of endangered species in the United States.”
Nearly 358,000 comments were filed during the comment period on the proposed change, which ended May 19. The Center filed comments, pointing out, as have others, that the Supreme Court has weighed in on the definition, ruling that habitat loss is valid.
DEEP also filed comments opposing the definition changes, saying it could reverse the conservation successes the state has achieved.
The letter reads in part: “Removing the protection under the ESA of critical habitat will only serve to further imperil populations. Further, removal of protection of habitat will also affect many other species that utilize said habitats, potentially leading to population declines in other species and listing under the ESA.”
It also noted: “Rescinding the current definition of ‘harm’ would also undermine habitat protections for all migratory birds and other game and non-game species that share habitats with listed species. Habitat modification is the most significant threat to nearly every migratory bird species in North America.”
Folsom-O’Keefe notes that many beachfronts along the Connecticut shore are narrow, which means limited space for birds like piping plovers with specific habitat needs. They have to nest above the high tide line. They need a sandy area with limited vegetation and a slope, but a shallow one. And they need to be fairly isolated without humans bothering them.
“Some of these species are so range-restricted that if we really want them to be able to recover, we have to protect not just the habitat where they are now but the habitat where they might be down the line,” Folsom-O’Keefe said.
If conditions push them out of their current locations, “where are they gonna expand to?” she wondered.
“I think the short answer is, ‘It’s complicated,’” said Jenny Dickson, DEEP’s Wildlife Division director, who signed the comments letter. “There’s a lot of nuance to it, so it can be really challenging to sort out.”
But she agreed that one event like a storm or flood or even a full-moon high tide can be devastating.
“That’s the challenge whenever you’re working with threatened and endangered species. There is already an incredibly delicate balance in trying to keep many of those species in existence. So one thing can dramatically change it,” she said. “But absolutely for those species that tend to be very specific in their habitat requirements, that habitat can be everything.”
The list
What most people know about nationally endangered and threatened species is most likely the big-name animals like polar bears, wolves, North Atlantic right whales, bald eagles and California condors. None of them are in Connecticut.
The federal list is in two parts — one from Fish and Wildlife and the other from Marine Fisheries. The Fish and Wildlife list contains more plants than animals.
The federal list for Connecticut is also in two parts — Fish and Wildlife and Marine Fisheries. 
But Connecticut has its own endangered species list based on the state’s determination. It is enormous, because it includes “species of concern,” as well as those that are endangered or threatened, and cross-references the federally designated species. The biggest category by far on the state list is plants. There are also a lot of moths.
The list is supposed to be updated every five years, but the current one is from 2015. Due to COVID, the 2020 update was never done. A review is underway now for the 2025 update. Any changes to criteria for federal species listing will not have an impact on how Connecticut evaluates species for its own list.
The state Natural Diversity Data Base, essentially a program that does environmental review for impacts to state-listed species, will also be reviewed as required by legislation passed this session, with the goal of updating the existing process to be more efficient, transparent and predictable. A report is due in February.
Not all the species on the federal list for Connecticut or the state’s own list are there due habitat-related stress. Most notably, bats are being decimated by a disease called white-nose syndrome. There are two on the federal list, the Indiana and northern long-eared bats, both endangered. The state lists eight.

Birds seem to get the most public attention, and habitat tends to be their key issue.
Besides piping plovers, there are two others on the federal list. Rufa red knot is a threatened species here. Roseate terns are endangered seabirds with three colonies in New England that constitute the bulk of the roseate tern population in the Western Hemisphere, according to Folsom-O’Keefe of Audubon CT. One of the colonies exists on two islands in Long Island Sound: Falkner, off Guilford, home to 30-50 birds, and Great Gull Island in New York’s portion of the Sound, with around 2,000. There are a couple more Massachusetts islands with populations.

Their habitat needs are an island that’s uninhabited and unforested and high enough above sea level so it’s not going to get flooded all the time. The birds also need plenty of food — in their case, fish, most commonly one called a sand lance.
“I think that really speaks to the habitat impact,” Folsom-O’Keefe said. If something catastrophic like an oil spill were to affect one of the islands, the population could drop dramatically. “It’s important to also protect other habitat,” she said. “The recovery plan for roseate terns is actually to try to get them to establish on additional islands.”
Another federally endangered species in Connecticut for which habitat plays a critical role is the dwarf wedgemussel. It’s a freshwater mussel that has faced habitat loss mostly due to the quality of some of the freshwater streams where it historically occurred, said DEEP’s Dickson.

Other endangered species include the puritan tiger beetle, which is only found along the Connecticut River and in Maryland. Its habitat is the sandier areas along the Connecticut River where it consumes other small invertebrates, acting as a control on them. The Atlantic and shortnose sturgeons are others, the former being a more-than-200-million-year-old species, feared extinct due to overfishing a century ago. In the last few years, however, Atlantic sturgeon juveniles have been found in the Connecticut River, leading to the assumption they may be spawning and perhaps living there again.
And then there are turtles: nine on the state list, six of which are listed federally. Some have aquatic habitats that may connect through multiple states. While habitat maintenance is important, they also bring up concern over what has emerged as a prime Trump administration tactic — non-enforcement of all manner of environmental laws and regulations already on the books.
“That is very concerning for us,” Dickson said. Connecticut environmental conservation police have to enforce federal law, but their powers are limited. And the state laws they can fully enforce generally are not as effective as federal laws.
“That lack of enforcement at the federal level is important, because if it’s an issue that might span state lines, that gets incredibly complicated, because we can only work within our jurisdiction. The federal special agents can work across state borders,” Dickson said.
For instance, bog turtles, which are federally listed, occur in Connecticut and New York in connected wetland habitats that are rare and very specific to that species. “If something occurs in New York that has the potential to impact the turtles in Connecticut, there’s a challenge there,” Dickson said. “We can’t address something that might happen across our borders.”
“Habitat is everything for that species.”

The politics
But wildlife, and really all life, exists in ecosystems in which changes have cascades of impacts. If warming oceans due to climate change sends certain fish into cooler waters, what happens to the birds that may feed on those fish? Or the marine mammals that may feed on them? If they follow the food source, will the habitat they need exist?
If inland wetland and aquatic habitats dry up, where do the species that live and spawn in them go, if they can even go anywhere?
“Those are some of the things that we do try to look at,” Dickson said. “What are some of the unintended consequences of other changes that are being made? If you change this thing over here, well, what does that do over there?”
The situation with the ESA also raises questions about whether the Trump administration will be proactive at any level on endangered species protection. The Center for Biological Diversity has petitioned to have a Connecticut-based bird, the saltmarsh sparrow, added to the federal list.

That bird nests in salt marshes, but sea level rise often floods the nests, preventing the species from reproducing. An Audubon CT project in Stratford has installed higher mounds for the birds to use. It seems to be having some success, but it’s unknown how it will fare long-term as global temperatures continue to rise.
According to Greenwald, the Fish and Wildlife Service had said it was going to list the sparrow, but now, “I don’t expect that the Trump administration will move forward on it without us litigating,” he said.
He said the ESA is only one among several longstanding environmental laws the administration is looking to neuter — such as the Clean Air, Clean Water and National Environmental Protection Acts — along with individual rule rollbacks including on limits to chemical and insecticide use and more permissive toxic emissions that could harm wildlife.
Such efforts may compound the impact on species that may already be struggling from conditions caused by climate change and other factors like disease.
“It’s just a wholesale attack on environmental protections across the board,” Greenwald said. 
While loosening of many environmental regulations has been a goal of the Republican party for decades, many view the Trump endgame to be a glide path towards more oil and gas drilling, mining, logging and other land uses without tough or even any environmental restrictions to slow or prevent them.
Connecticut does have a bit of a backstop, though, thanks to a few state laws, such as its own Endangered Species Act and a seabird and shorebird protection program.
Folsom-O’Keefe also points to the importance of local regulations in some communities, such as no fires on the beach, no ATVs on the beach, no dogs on the beach. 
“Those are all, I think, intentionally meant to protect people, but they also protect birds,” she said. “One thing we found is that a lot of the local police officers really know nothing about the birds at these sites. They don’t even realize they have federally threatened bird species here.”

So last summer, using money from its parent organization the National Audubon Society, Audubon CT piloted a program in Stratford to train police officers about the protected birds, their habitats and how violations of the local rules could affect them. For instance, if an officer sees a fire on a beach or an ATV, if it’s nesting season, the officer will know to check that as well.
This season, they’ve expanded the outreach, training and funding to West Haven.  
“Towns can look at what regulations that they have in place and maybe consider adding some more, or maybe upping the fines, or just enforcing it better,” Folsom-O’Keefe said.
If the Center for Biological Diversity’s Greenwald’s hunch is correct, that may be the only protection some of the birds get. 
“We don’t expect [the Trump administration] to make any changes or take the comments seriously. So I think that they’ll just plow forward with finalizing what they proposed,” he said.
Spokespeople for the Fish and Wildlife Service and Marine Fisheries both declined to comment on when a decision might come.
The Center is already laying the groundwork for a lawsuit. 
“We’re preparing legal action and fully intend to challenge in court and think that we have strong arguments,” Greenwald said. “But if they were to get away with it, we will really undercut how the Endangered Species Act has been implemented and how we’ve been protecting species for the last 40-plus years.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Piping-Plover-fledgling-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-22 05:57:36.301882

They pair each show with a location to bring layers of meaning to the stories devised from scratch, inspired by New Haven history. Sometimes that means highlighting historic architecture or outdoor space in city parks, as they did during The Library Project in 2012 or Thunderbolt in 2009, respectively.  Many times  it means transforming an underutilized location into a newly reimagined space, like CitySeed’s new headquarters at 162 James Street in Fair Haven. 
“This year’s home-grown production [at the Festival] is a quintessential New Haven story. It’s about pizza. Or maybe it’s a story about immigrants risking much to settle in a new place. Or maybe it’s a story about survival, or maybe it’s about family. Or maybe it’s a story about life. Watch the show and decide for yourself,” said Kevin Ewing, Interim Director of Arts & Ideas.

FAMILY BUSINESS: (A) PIZZA PLAY, follows the multi-generational story of the fictional Carbonizatto family’s pizza shop (from the Italian for “carbonized” — a knowing wink to the black-dusted fingers walking out of any apizza shop) from it’s immigrant beginnings in the 1920s through the early 2010s. This production explores New Haven’s pizza magic (la magia dell’apizza) with over 23 actors of all ages and an equal number of backstage technicians bringing this charming history to life. Set against the backdrop of the city’s evolving apizza culture, the play explores themes of identity, inheritance, and the shifting meaning of home. Blending historical research with personal stories, it examines how food traditions both preserve and transform a family’s legacy. Jes Mack, Director and Co-Writer of FAMILY BUSINESS: (A)PIZZA PLAY explained, “My hope is that you, the audience, feel the truths of what we share in Family Business. Not only about the Carbonizzatto family, but also what it truly means to our ensemble to be part of a family business in New Haven.”
For FAMILY BUSINESS: (A)PIZZA PLAY, the all volunteer company partners with CitySeed, the steward of New Haven’s farmer’s markets, and Sanctuary Kitchen, who through their culinary training program and social enterprise, provide professional development and employment for new residents of Greater New Haven.  “CitySeed provides wraparound support services to food entrepreneurs like the Carbonizattos – from restaurateurs to food truck operators to caterers to packaged goods creators. Among them is our own Sanctuary Kitchen, a social enterprise run by immigrant chefs. By engaging with the stories of the Carbonizatto family and Sanctuary Kitchen, you support our vision for the future of 162 James St., build economic opportunity and strengthen human connections through the shared language of food,” said CitySeed Executive Director Sara Miller. By radically transforming this old factory into a place of performance, A Broken Umbrella Theatre has enlivened the raw space and brings awareness to the awesome work of these immigrant entrepreneurs and the ways that they make lives in Greater New Haven richer and deeply delicious. Sanctuary Kitchen will be selling pizza-style concessions before and after all performances of Family Business in the lobby.

(Mark McCormick for Kansas Reflector)The Greenwood Rising Center in Tulsa features a James Baldwin quote on its exterior: “Not everything that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is faced.”
It’s built atop the site where one of the nation’s greatest Black surgeons had hunkered down during terrifying nights of violence, only to walk outside the following morning, his gifted hands raised, to be gunned down by a mob.
During a recent tour in Oklahoma, with members of the Church of the Resurrection, we saw monuments and markers of two of the deadliest acts of racial violence in American history — Tulsa’s Greenwood and the Osage murders.
Despite Baldwin’s quote, nothing’s really being faced on that corner. Not in nearby Pawhuska, where the Osage murders unfolded. Not in a country where neo-Nazis and white supremacists continue marching with renewed vigor.
We remain in a perpetual approach pattern, where we descend but never land on justice. We measure racial progress in America by the pace of white acknowledgement, and during current Juneteenth celebrations, we should remember that freedom isn’t a destination.
It remains an endless climb.
A couple of weeks ago however, Tulsa’s Greenwood district and Pawhuska marked destinations for the Adult Discipleship Ministry billed by the group’s leader and my dear friend, the Rev. Robert Johnson, as definitely “not a vacation.”
This “human rights immersion” trip, inspired by church Senior Pastor Adam Hamilton, sold out online in 43 minutes, which spoke to the earnest desires of the group to learn how discipleship must have social as well as personal expressions.
“You will be expected to engage in intense learning and discipleship-building exercises,” Johnson’s preparatory missive to the group read.
Johnson’s lovely wife, Linda, kept us on pace for all our stops.
We saw monument after monument in Tulsa.
We saw a statue of the iconic historian John Hope Franklin, the son of a prominent Greenwood lawyer who had written real-time notes of black, fiery, turpentine balls dropping from planes strafing the 36-BLOCK, Black business district.
We gathered around solemn black monuments in front of the Greenwood Cultural Center that offered a register of Black businesses destroyed. We paused over rectangular plaques embedded in the sidewalks in front of the only remaining buildings from old Greenwood.
We saw murals and remembrances under the Interstate 244 bridge that state and local officials drove through the heart of Greenwood, intent on strangling the vaunted business district. We saw the refurbished Mt. Vernon Baptist Church, burned in the massacre.
Our Greenwood tour guide, Kode Ransom, explained deeply and deftly what rarely garners mention in the massacre’s lore.
Ransom said that by 1933, Greenwood had rebuilt itself, only to have I-244 and urban renewal destroy much of what had been rebuilt. He mentioned that no white death toll existed, nor identification of a single white looter or rapist.

After a day and an evening in Greenwood, we moved an hour northeast to Pawhuska, the site of the Osage murders resurrected by David Gann’s book and the Martin Scorsese film, “Killers of the Flower Moon.”
The book and film detail the theft of wildly profitable oil rights from Osage people. The Osage selected the rocky, barren land as a barrier to white interest, but those hopes died, as did many Osage, when oil was discovered there.
Historians often teach the Greenwood massacre and the Osage murders in tandem since they occurred in roughly the same area, in the same era, each with white greed and envy fueling orgies of violence.
Outside the Osage Nation Museum, we saw still more monuments.
We saw a granite memorial for the Osage veterans with a giant feather in the center. Another monument rose from the ground like a huge headstone with etchings saying the petroleum industry had gifted the slab.
Another nearby featured a seated, majestic Chief Claremore, weapons in each hand.
The monuments — from Greenwood to Pawhuska — harkened Carl Hines Jr.’s words: “Dead men make such convenient heroes for they cannot rise to challenge the images we would fashion from their lives and besides, it is easier to build monuments than to build a better world.”
Bodies likely remain under a new baseball field in Greenwood. Many more bodies have not been discovered. Killers dumped still more in the cloudy brown Arkansas River.
Society’s response?
You can have all the museums and monuments you want, just don’t ask for justice. This process of misremembering and denial is designed to preserve the innocence of one group, at the expense of another.
It’s a pattern visible since the Confederacy’s “Lost Cause” narrative after the Civil War. Look closely, and there’s a bloody thread running from the Appomattox Courthouse to Greenwood, to a dozen other massacres, to George Floyd, to Jan. 6, 2021.
Deny the obvious and blame the victims.
“The Civil War wasn’t about slavery.” “The slaves were happy.” Calling the Civil War the “war of northern aggression.” “Black men (trying to prevent the lynching of a falsely accused man) started the Greenwood Massacre.” “George Floyd was a drug addict.” “Jan. 6 was a day of love.”
Then, attempt to erase evidence. Rip out newspaper accounts. Refuse to teach it in schools. Pardon participants. Never speak of what happened. When that doesn’t work, willfully misremember it.
When that doesn’t work, argue the pointlessness of rehashing the past, but eventually, while denying any culpability or remuneration, grudgingly grant the smallest modicum of acknowledgement: a monument. Then relax as grief and terror get monetized.
Wash, rinse, repeat.
This has remained true even of Juneteenth, the supposed date when Texas’ enslaved people learned about their freedom. But enslaved people knew already. It was the people who “owned” people who were learning they could no longer keep people hostage.
This is the cycle Pastor Adam, the Rev. Robert and Linda wanted to shatter with the human rights tour. On the trip back, I offered another James Baldwin quotation: “To act is to be committed, and to be committed is to be in danger.”
So no, freedom can’t be a destination.
It’s a perpetual climb because seemingly, there always will be resistance.

But there’s a lot of unfinished business on the transportation front worth remembering.,"The end of June has a sense of finality.  School wraps up, celebratory parties are held and everyone looks forward to the summer.  But there’s a lot of unfinished business on the transportation front worth remembering.
AMTRAK AVELIA: Whatever happened to Amtrak’s promise to have the new Acela trains in service “by the Spring?” The initial contract for 28 train sets was signed in 2016 with the first prototype of the sleek nine-car sets delivered for testing in 2020.  The plan was for all the new trains to be running between Washington and Boston by 2022.


Computer simulations found problems as real life testing continued. By 2024 the hope was for the new trains to be running by now.  But we’re still waiting.  Amtrak’s only explanation for the latest delays is “crew testing.” 
The new trains have been sighted in New Jersey (where maximum speeds of 160 mph are possible on short stretches of track) but I’ve not seen Avelia on Connecticut tracks… yet.
DIGITAL DRIVERS LICENSES: In September 2021 the Connecticut Division of Motor Vehicles and Gov. Ned Lamont announced that ours would be among the first states to allow smartphone users to show a digital version of their driver’s license on their devices.  To date, 17 states offer such options.  But still not Connecticut.
When I last asked DMV what was delaying the launch, their PR team gave me some boilerplate answer about “testing” and “security”… but no announced date for the launch.
How can California have solved those issues but we can’t?
WALK BRIDGE:  Built in 1896, this crucial rail bridge in South Norwalk has a history of problems.  In one year alone the bridge was stuck 16 out of 271 times it opened.  Now it’s undergoing a $1.5 billion rebuild, not just of the bridge but its supports and nearby tracks.

The IMAX theater in the adjacent Maritime Museum was demolished to make way, but work on the bridge structure itself is still years away.  The removal of the existing tower structure for overhead wires is scheduled to begin in 2026 with the new bridge (finally!) being finished in 2029.
DARIEN TRAIN STATION:  Last rebuilt in 2003, the station’s platforms were starting to crumble.  By 2018 it was clear that the Connecticut Department of Transportation would have to replace them. The $40 million contract called for first-of-their-kind heated platforms, obviating the need for corrosive salt to melt ice and snow.  Half of the platforms were removed and the station waiting room was closed.
But now, years later, construction delays and problems with the electrical system have slowed the work, initially promised to be done by now.  It’s hoped the first half of the new platforms may be ready later this summer.  Then the other half of the platforms will be demolished and rebuilt.  By March 2026 the work will (hopefully) be done and the station’s 1,800+ daily commuters will be able to use the new station platforms.
Engineering projects take time.  But with every ceremony celebrating the launch of a new project there are overly-optimistic promises of speedy completion.  The politicians take the credit while we just wait and grow more cynical watching the costs rise.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Darien-station-constructionequipmentguide-dot-com-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-22 04:58:48.157650

Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, prepares to shake hands with state Rep. Andrew Gray, D-Anchorage, after the conclusion of his speech to the Alaska Legislature on Thursday, March 20, 2025. (Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Less than an hour after President Donald Trump announced that the United States had bombed three Iranian nuclear facilities, Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan said he supported the decision.
In a written statement posted on the social media site X, Sullivan said he commends the president.
“The terrorist leaders of Iran have, in essence, been at war with the United States for decades — targeting, wounding and killing thousands of American service members for years,” Sullivan wrote.
Sullivan, a former Marine Corps officer, has repeatedly called for aggressive actions against Iran, particularly amid Iran’s support of anti-American militias during the Iraq War. Five years ago, he supported Trump’s decision to assassinate an Iranian general in Iraq.
Sullivan and U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, previously supported Trump’s decision in 2018 to withdraw from a diplomatic agreement intended to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.
International experts and Tulsi Gabbard, Director of National Intelligence under Trump, have said that no evidence has been produced showing that Iran is building a nuclear weapon.
Trump himself has said he does not believe Gabbard, and Sullivan, a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, spoke this week in that committee, implying that he would support military action in order to deter Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.
He reiterated that position after the Trump-ordered bombing.
“Making sure the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism never gets a nuclear weapon is part of the work of reestablishing deterrence against Iran, which was lost during the appeasement of the Biden Administration. This is difficult work, but critical for our national security. I fully support the President and his national security team in these critical efforts,” he wrote.
A spokesperson for Murkowski said she did not have an immediate comment.
Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, spoke about Iran during an interview Friday, one day before the Trump-ordered bombing.
During the interview, he said he had no special knowledge about what would happen in the coming weeks and months but viewed the situation as Iran’s to settle.
“I think the ball is at this moment in Iran’s court: Do they want to be a member of the international community or not? And what’s been made clearly, not just by the United States, but many of our friends and allies around the world, is that we cannot allow them to become a nuclear-armed nation,” Begich said. 
“We don’t need another nation, particularly a nation like Iran, to gain the ability to attack with nuclear weapons. We’ve already seen they have hypersonics and are willing to use those. A nuclear-tipped hypersonic would be very difficult to intercept, and it creates an asymmetric capability in a nation that has made quote, “Death to Israel” and “Death to America,” official policy. And when you have a nation saber-rattling like that on a regular basis, actively pursuing a nuclear weapon, it’s a dangerous situation, not just for Israel, not just for the United States, but for the entire world,” he said.

The audit question amounts to an act of constitutional vandalism, an example of the mischief that can result from Article 48, and why this seems a good time to consider amending the initiative process.
The post The century-old flaw that let Question 1 go the ballot   appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IT SHOULD NOT be surprising that, last year, 71 percent of Massachusetts voters endorsed the ballot initiative designated as Question 1. That measure granted the Office of State Auditor the authority to audit the state Legislature, without its consent, with the aim of enhancing legislative transparency and accountability.  
Who would be opposed to more transparency and accountability? The problem is that the law is almost certainly unconstitutional. It lays waste to the principle of legislative independence by undermining both the separation of powers and the constitutional grant of authority to each chamber of the General Court to control its internal rules and procedures.  
Nonetheless, state Auditor Diana DiZoglio continues to maintain that the voter-approved law grants her the authority to audit the Legislature as she might a state agency. She has submitted audit requests and complained in public about the failure of each legislative branch to respond; at the same time, the attorney general has yet to approve any kind of enforcement action on the auditor’s behalf. 
In our judgment, the audit question amounts to an act of constitutional vandalism, irrespective of the merits of the policies and sentiments that led to its approval. It is an example of the mischief that can result from the initiative process set out in Article 48 of the Massachusetts Constitution, and why this seems a good time to consider amending the initiative process to prevent future politicians and activists from accomplishing constitutional change “on the cheap” and thereby weakening (intentionally or not) the integrity of the oldest written constitution in the world. 
Proposed and ratified more than a century ago, Article 48 represented a progressive effort designed to close the distance between public opinion and public policymaking outcomes. Lawmaking through direct democracy was intended to allow the people to engage in a more dynamic form of lawmaking, one capable of meeting the needs of a rapidly changing world.  
But the framers of Article 48 did not seek to jettison the commitments that animate the original 1780 constitution—not least of which was the principle of separation of powers, which John Adams believed crucial to effective democratic governance.  
Article 48 therefore includes a list of “excluded matters”—constitutional provisions that cannot be changed by popular vote. Initiative proposals accordingly must be reviewed by the attorney general before being allowed on the ballot to ensure that they do not address “excluded matters.”  
The list of such matters reflects what the Article 48 framers saw, in 1918, as constitutional guarantees vulnerable to challenge at the polls on Election Day, where the constitutional checks and balances that safeguard representative democracy are not front and center. Excluded matters include those that seek to make a specific appropriation of money from the state treasury or that relate to the right to trial by a jury, the freedoms of speech and the press, or the right to peaceable assembly.  
At the time of Article 48’s adoption, neither legislative independence, nor the separation of powers that facilitates it, were thought to be particularly vulnerable. Both remain exceptionally resilient in Massachusetts.  
As a result, when the audit initiative came before the attorney general for review under Article 48, that office could not act on the measure’s obvious constitutional problem because the “excluded matters” do not specifically include the authority of each branch of the Legislature to control its own functioning.  
The framers of Article 48 could not have imagined the ways in which determined activists today can pull together support for initiative efforts far more quickly and easily than in 1918, and that such efforts might well be fueled by fundamental misunderstandings about how government works—if not outright misinformation. In such an environment, Article 48’s framers likely would have appreciated the need to protect a core component of John Adams’s vision for representative government in the Commonwealth—namely, that legislators should be beholden, first and foremost, to their constituents, and that executive branch officers should not have the power to interfere with the legislature’s basic functioning.  
There may well be other core principles in the Massachusetts Constitution that should qualify today as “excluded matters,” but the audit question directly implicates two provisions that are vital to legislative functioning and the separation of powers:  Part II, chapter I, section 2, article 7, which authorizes the Senate to “choose its own president, appoint its own officers, and determine its own rules of proceedings”; and Part II, chapter I, section 3, article 10, which provides the same for the House of Representatives.  
By amending the state constitution to exclude these provisions from modification or alteration through direct democracy under Article 48, the Legislature can be protected from efforts to impede the long-established ability of senators and representatives to represent the people of the Commonwealth.  
Indeed, the critical importance of these provisions to the functioning of the Legislature has been recognized by the Supreme Judicial Court. In a case called Paisner v. Attorney General, the court concluded that the authority of each house to manage its own affairs “is a continuous power absolute and beyond the challenge of any other tribunal.”  
In addition to providing the authority for lawmaking by initiative, Article 48 spells out the means by which the constitution itself can be amended, a process that turns on approval by voters and the Legislature.  
It is time to engage this process to secure the Legislature’s independence from the vicissitudes of proposals animated by the popular sentiment of the moment, rather than by the view embraced by Adams and the framers almost 250 years ago—that the people themselves stand as the best check on their elected representatives.

Tim Sheehy, a former U.S. Navy Seal and Montana’s junior senator, praised the Trump administration’s announcement Saturday it had bombed three nuclear sites in Iran.
“The right decision,” said Sheehy, a Republican from Bozeman, in a social media post. “Iran had every opportunity to give up their nukes. To the naysayers out there, this isn’t starting a war, this is ending one. Iran has been at war with America for 46 years. The Iranian people should rise up and put an end to this murderous regime.”
U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, also a Republican, reposted a social media message from President Donald Trump, adding four American flags. He posted a subsequent message on social media with the following:
“Thank you President Trump and the men and women of our armed forces,” Daines said in the post. “America, Israel and the rest of the world are safer tonight as a result of your bravery, courage and unrivaled skill. Iran is the world’s largest state sponsor of terror, has killed hundreds of U.S. service members, attempted to assassinate President Trump and calls the United States ‘Big Satan’ and Israel ‘little Satan.’ Stopping Iran’s pursuit of nuclear weapons is a major step toward achieving peace.”
President Trump said Saturday night that the United States attacked three nuclear sites in Iran, and all U.S. planes were outside Iran and on their way back to the United States, States Newsroom’s Washington, D.C. Bureau reported.
“We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan,” Trump said on social media.
“All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home. Congratulations to our great American Warriors. There is not another military in the World that could have done this. NOW IS THE TIME FOR PEACE! Thank you for your attention to this matter,” he wrote.
U.S. Rep. Ryan Zinke, also a former U.S. Navy Seal and Republican, and U.S. Rep. Troy Downing, a Republican formerly with the U.S. Air Force, did not have statements immediately posted to their social media sites and did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
An automatic message from a spokesperson for Zinke’s office said the spokesperson was out of the country with no access to email, and the Daily Montanan did not receive an immediate reply from the recommended contact.
Republican Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte did not weigh in on the bombing in a social media post reposting a message from the White House with the news, but he offered a message to soldiers, the president and country: “God bless our armed forces. God bless President Trump. God bless America.”
In a phone call, military veteran and Montana Senate President Pro Tempore Ken Bogner, R-Miles City, expressed concerns about the action and aftermath.
“As a Marine who fought in Iraq, I’ve seen firsthand the cost of war in the Middle East, both in lives, in taxpayer dollars, and long-term consequences,” said Bogner, who spent four years with the U.S. Marines Corps and was twice deployed to Iraq. “I don’t know why we need to get involved in this. Our involvement just opens up the possibility of another endless war. I don’t want Iran to have a nuclear weapon, but this is Israel’s fight. It’s not ours.”
In Montana, Malmstrom Air Force Base in Great Falls controls 150 nuclear warheads. Bogner said he doesn’t believe the decision will directly impact Montanans in the state, but it could impact those serving abroad.
“But if there are Montanans overseas on military bases, this could impact them if Iran wants to retaliate. That’s where I have concerns.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Capitol_Night-2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-21 21:58:39.827010

Jim Himes condemns attack,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/21/trump-iran-strikes-ct-himes/,"President Trump said U.S. military struck three sites in Iran Saturday, joining Israel’s effort to decapitate the country’s nuclear program.","TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — President Donald Trump said Saturday that the U.S. military struck three sites in Iran, directly joining Israel ’s effort to decapitate the country’s nuclear program in a risky gambit to weaken a longtime foe amid Tehran’s threat of reprisals that could spark a wider regional conflict.
There was no immediate acknowledgment from the Iranian government of any strikes being carried out. The country’s state-run IRNA news agency early Sunday reported an attack on the country’s Fordo nuclear site that activated air defenses. The agency did not elaborate.
The decision to directly involve the U.S. in the war comes after more than a week of strikes by Israel on Iran that aimed to systematically eradicate the country’s air defenses and offensive missile capabilities, while damaging its nuclear enrichment facilities. But U.S. and Israeli officials have said that American stealth bombers and the 30,000-pound (13,500-kilogram) bunker buster bomb they alone can carry offered the best chance of destroying heavily fortified sites connected to the Iranian nuclear program buried deep underground.
“We have completed our very successful attack on the three Nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz, and Esfahan,” Trump said in a post on social media. “All planes are now outside of Iran air space. A full payload of BOMBS was dropped on the primary site, Fordow. All planes are safely on their way home.”
Trump added in a later post that he would address the national at 10 p.m. Eastern time, writing “This is an HISTORIC MOMENT FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ISRAEL, AND THE WORLD. IRAN MUST NOW AGREE TO END THIS WAR. THANK YOU!”
Trump said B-2 stealth bombers were used but did not specify what types of bombs were dropped. The White House and Pentagon did not immediately elaborate on the operation.
U.S. Rep. Jim Himes, who represents Connecticut’s 4th congressional district, called the action “a clear violation of the Constitution” in a statement late Saturday. Himes said only Congress has the power to declare war.
“It is impossible to know at this stage whether this operation accomplished its objectives,” he said in the statement. “We also don’t know if this will lead to further escalation in the region and attacks against our forces, events that could easily pull us even deeper into a war in the Middle East.” 
Himes, who plays a key role in overseeing the intelligence community and threats to the U.S. as the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, said he was “continuing to closely monitor the situation and demand answers from the Administration.”
The strikes are a perilous decision, as Iran has pledged to retaliate if the U.S. joined the Israeli assault, and for Trump personally. He won the White House on the promise of keeping America out of costly foreign conflicts and scoffed at the value of American interventionism.
Trump told reporters Friday that he was not interested in sending ground forces into Iran, saying it’s “the last thing you want to do.” He had previously indicated that he would make a final choice over the course of two weeks.
Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned the United States on Wednesday that strikes targeting the Islamic Republic will “result in irreparable damage for them.” And Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei declared “any American intervention would be a recipe for an all-out war in the region.”
Trump has vowed that he would not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon, and he had initially hoped that the threat of force would bring the country’s leaders to give up its nuclear program peacefully.
The Israeli military said Saturday it was preparing for the possibility of a lengthy war, while Iran’s foreign minister warned before the U.S. attack that American military involvement “would be very, very dangerous for everyone.”
The prospect of a wider war loomed. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen said they would resume attacks on U.S. vessels in the Red Sea if the Trump administration joined Israel’s military campaign. The Houthis paused such attacks in May under a deal with the U.S.
The U.S. ambassador to Israel announced that the U.S. had begun “assisted departure flights,” the first from Israel since the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, that sparked the war in Gaza.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that Trump planned to make his decision on the strikes within two weeks. Instead, he struck just two days later.
Trump appears to have made the calculation — at the prodding of Israeli officials and many Republican lawmakers — that Israel’s operation had softened the ground and presented a perhaps unparalleled opportunity to set back Iran’s nuclear program, perhaps permanently.
The Israelis say their offensive has already crippled Iran’s air defenses, allowing them to already significantly degrade multiple Iranian nuclear sites.
But to destroy the Fordo nuclear fuel enrichment plant, Israel appealed to Trump for the bunker-busting American bomb known as the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, which uses its weight and sheer kinetic force to reach deeply buried targets and then explode. The bomb is currently delivered only by the B-2 stealth bomber, which is only found in the American arsenal.
If deployed in the attack, it would be the first combat use of the weapon.
The bomb carries a conventional warhead, and is believed to be able to penetrate about 200 feet (61 meters) below the surface before exploding, and the bombs can be dropped one after another, effectively drilling deeper and deeper with each successive blast.
The International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed that Iran is producing highly enriched uranium at Fordo, raising the possibility that nuclear material could be released into the area if the GBU-57 A/B were used to hit the facility.
Previous Israeli strikes at another Iranian nuclear site, Natanz, on a centrifuge site have caused contamination only at the site itself, not the surrounding area, the IAEA has said.
Trump’s decision for direct U.S. military intervention comes after his administration made an unsuccessful two-month push — including with high-level, direct negotiations with the Iranians — aimed at persuading Tehran to curb its nuclear program.
For months, Trump said he was dedicated to a diplomatic push to persuade Iran to give up its nuclear ambitions. And he twice — in April and again in late May — persuaded Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold off on military action against Iran and give diplomacy more time.
The U.S. in recent days has been shifting military aircraft and warships into and around the Middle East to protect Israel and U.S. bases from Iranian attacks.
All the while, Trump has gone from publicly expressing hope that the moment could be a “second chance” for Iran to make a deal to delivering explicit threats on Khamenei and making calls for Tehran’s unconditional surrender.
“We know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding,” Trump said in a social media posting. “He is an easy target, but is safe there – We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now.”
The military showdown with Iran comes seven years after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Obama-administration brokered agreement in 2018, calling it the “worst deal ever.”
The 2015 deal, signed by Iran, U.S. and other world powers, created a long-term, comprehensive nuclear agreement that limited Tehran’s enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.
Trump decried the Obama-era deal for giving Iran too much in return for too little, because the agreement did not cover Iran’s non-nuclear malign behavior.
Trump has bristled at criticism from some of his MAGA faithful, including conservative pundit Tucker Carlson, who have suggested that further U.S. involvement would be a betrayal to supporters who were drawn to his promise to end U.S. involvement in expensive and endless wars.

Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.”Flanked by Vice President J.D. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Trump said he hoped the strikes would be the extent of the U.S. offensive in Iran, but he warned he would authorize attacks on other targets if Iran did not end the war.“Iran, the bully of the Middle East, must now make peace,” he said. “If they do not, future attacks will be far greater and a lot easier.”Trump had first announced the strikes roughly two hours earlier on social media.“All planes are now outside of Iran air space.

He has failed to deliver on that promise. The risk of war has now dramatically increased, and I pray for the safety of our troops in the region who have been put in harm’s way,” Jeffries said in a statement.“President Trump misled the country about his intentions, failed to seek congressional authorization for the use of military force and risks American entanglement in a potentially disastrous war in the Middle East.”He said Congress must immediately be briefed in a classified setting.Warning from IranIsrael began bombing what it said were Iranian nuclear facilities last week, scuttling U.S. negotiations with Iran, which Trump repeated again Wednesday had been close.In a statement issued through a spokesman on state-run TV Wednesday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned the U.S. not to get involved.“Any form of U.S. military intervention will undoubtedly be met with irreparable harm,” the statement said, according to a BBC translation.Prior to the announcement, congressional Republicans were generally supportive of an aggressive posture toward Iran.Sen.

(USGS)PIERRE, S.D. – Over 100 state and local officials from the Midwest and West are asking the U.S. Senate to eliminate tax credits for carbon capture and sequestration as part of a federal budget reconciliation bill.
Established by Congress and then-President George W. Bush in 2008, the 45Q tax credits incentivize companies to capture carbon dioxide from processes such as ethanol production and sequester it underground, so it won’t contribute to climate change by acting as a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. The carbon can also be sequestered as part of enhanced oil recovery, in which pressurized gas is used to push more oil to the surface.
Opponents say the credits don’t work as intended.
“The 45Q tax credits really only make sense to the industries that are poised to make billions of dollars from them,” said North Dakota state Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo. “They are supposedly intended to reduce carbon emissions, but in fact, 45Q tax credits pay polluters for polluting and subsidize private oil production at the expense of the taxpayer.”

Companies receive up to $85 per metric ton for regular sequestration and up to $60 per metric ton for sequestration via enhanced oil recovery — though there is a provision in a draft portion of the Senate reconciliation bill that would raise the maximum oil recovery credit to $85.
The repeal effort includes officials from Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. A few of those officials held a virtual press conference Wednesday.
South Dakota state Sen. Joy Hohn, R-Hartford, described the tax credits as wasteful spending.
“We are concerned about preserving taxpayer dollars, and that’s the main gist of our conference today,” Hohn said.
Mathern said repealing the tax credits would put projects like Summit Carbon Solutions’ proposed five-state carbon dioxide pipeline “in dire danger.”
“And that’s really positive,” he said.
Summit’s project alone could qualify for more than $1 billion annually from 45Q credits. It aims to capture some of the CO2 emitted by dozens of ethanol plants and ship the carbon via pipeline to a sequestration area southeast of the oilfields in western North Dakota.
Earlier this year, South Dakota’s legislators and governor adopted a law banning the use of a legal process known as eminent domain to acquire land access for carbon dioxide pipelines. South Dakota regulators also rejected Summit’s project application, saying there was no path forward for the project under the eminent domain ban.
Those moves came after several years of anti-pipeline activism by landowners focused on property rights and the danger from potential leaks of toxic carbon dioxide plumes. The project has permits in other states, but some of those are being challenged in court.

Congressional Republicans are using the complex reconciliation process to move a budget package through Congress with simple majority votes in each chamber, avoiding the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster. The House recently passed its version of the bill without a repeal of the 45Q tax credits. U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, voted for the bill.
A spokesperson for Johnson sent a statement when asked via email if the congressman supports repealing the tax credits: “While Dusty wished the reconciliation bill was more conservative, he voted in favor of it when it passed the House. We’ll see what the Senate passes.”
A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, said Rounds met with a group of South Dakota lawmakers when they traveled to D.C. to voice opposition to the 45Q tax credits.
“Senator Rounds has long held the belief that many industry specific tax credits should not be perpetual, a belief which this group of landowners shares,” the statement said. “However, he has not had a chance to hear details of President Trump’s interest in this program. While many in South Dakota may oppose 45Q, it has been a popular proposal for other states for almost two decades and was included in the House-passed reconciliation bill.”
The office of Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, sent a similar reply that did not disclose his position on the tax credits.
“As congressional Republicans work with President Trump to pass legislation that will create long-term strength, safety, and prosperity for America, Sen. Thune appreciated the opportunity to meet with and hear firsthand from state legislators who have been on the front lines of this issue.”
Anti-pipeline activists are also concerned about a provision in an early draft of the House budget reconciliation bill that they said would have allowed federal regulators to approve natural gas and carbon dioxide pipelines over prohibitions in state law. That provision was removed before the bill passed the House. The rest of the statement from Thune’s office appeared to address that issue: “He understands their concerns, and he conveyed that the provision removed by the House is unlikely to be included in the final bill.”

(Photo by Dennis Schroeder/NREL)For decades, federal support for renewable energy largely excluded Alaska while building new energy opportunities and capacity in the Lower 48. Nonprofit cooperatives, which generate nearly all of Alaska’s power, didn’t qualify. Hydropower, which is an important energy source in many communities, also didn’t qualify, or received a lesser credit. 
Legislation passed in 2022 finally reformed these credits to work for Alaska. Today, the ‘elective pay’ provision allows not-for-profit entities like our electric cooperatives and governments to take the credit in cash, putting them on equal footing with the rest of the country. The new credit is technology-neutral, so hydro and geothermal can qualify. And the entire state of Alaska receives a 10% bonus on top of the 30% baseline.
As the U.S. Senate works on President Trump’s comprehensive budget reconciliation package – his ‘One Big Beautiful Bill’ – we urge Sen. Dan Sullivan and Sen. Lisa Murkowksi, as well as Rep. Nick Begich, to safeguard the federal investment tax credit and the production tax credit provisions. The House budget bill stripped the most important parts for Alaska before we can even benefit, and would drive up electric rates. Early Senate edits may soften some of these changes, but most Alaska projects won’t be able to access the incentives before they phase out. 
Depending on the final text, the Railbelt stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars, from the state’s proposed Dixon Diversion hydro expansion, planned wind farms, and solar on the Kenai Peninsula. That money will come from ratepayers instead — for example, as much as 3 cents more per kilowatt hour for a project using the production tax credit. This comes as fuel costs are driving up our already high rates, which have risen 10% in the past 18 months. Rural Alaska faces even steeper increases. 
That’s if the projects happen at all. Alaska’s largest solar developer pulled out of all their planned projects based on uncertainty over tax credits. It takes years to get projects to the start line, and the state and federal grants that kickstarted them are disappearing. Ratepayers in other communities, like Kodiak, that have already made the move to renewables but must maintain and eventually replace their equipment, will also lose if these incentives are taken away. If energy projects are canceled now, or infrastructure can’t be replaced, it locks our communities into volatile diesel and imported gas. With the Senate expected to vote on final language for these provisions within the next few weeks, Alaska’s window to defend these benefits is rapidly closing. 
Draft Senate language means many projects would have to start construction almost immediately to access the full credits, and phases them out fully over several years. Alaska’s remote logistics, long supply chains and short building seasons mean that a single delayed barge could make ratepayer costs jump. Slower-to-build projects like hydro plants don’t have a hope of meeting the schedule.
“Prohibited foreign entity” rules demand that utilities prove that no wire or microchip ever touched a blacklisted country. A small rural co-op has no chance of tracking this and could see money clawed back years later for an honest mistake.
Alaska needs our congressional delegation to help keep the elective pay option, technology neutrality, the 30% baseline, and Alaska’s 10% energy community bonus. 

It is also important to fix the parts of this bill that don’t work for Alaska. We need reasonable ‘start of construction’ eligibility, a more realistic phase out schedule for the production tax credit, investment tax credit and residential clean energy credit, and to replace the impossible paperwork mess of the “prohibited foreign entity” requirements with a workable sourcing rule.
Our state has waited decades to benefit from federal clean energy incentives. These credits are our chance to finally diversify our energy system and build a more stable, affordable future. Let’s not eliminate Alaska’s opportunity before we can use it.

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The general manager of the Lower Platte South Natural Resources District has been put on leave, with officials saying only that it involves a “personnel matter.”
Mike Sousek, who has served as the district’s general manager for the past two years, was recently suspended from the $178,000-a-year position.
On Wednesday, the Lincoln-based NRD voted to have Assistant General Manager David Potter perform both his job and the general manager’s responsibilities.
Bob Anderson, the chairman of the Lower Platte South NRD Board, told the Examiner on Friday that Sousek’s job status was a “personnel matter,” and he wasn’t able to comment further.
“I want to be sensitive to all parties,” Anderson said.
The suspension of the general manager comes days after the NRD resolved a federal lawsuit alleging sexual discrimination by a candidate for the general manager’s job when Sousek was hired in March of 2023.
McKenzie Barry, who had worked for the Lower Platte South NRD for 22 years, filed the lawsuit claiming that she was bypassed for the NRD’s top job because she was a woman. She also claimed that she was retaliated against after she filed a sex discrimination claim with the Nebraska Equal Opportunity Commission.
Her lawsuit stated that two members of the committee interviewing candidates for the general manager’s job told her that the agency wasn’t ready to have a female in the top job.
She left the NRD in January, with her lawsuit stating that Sousek told her to clear out her desk a day prior to her last scheduled work day.
U.S. District Court records indicate that Barry’s lawsuit was dismissed on June 13 after a joint motion was filed by the NRD and her attorney, Kathleen Neary of Lincoln. The terms of the dismissal were not revealed.
Neary, when contacted, said only that “the matter has been resolved.”
Anderson, and another board member, David Landis, said they could not comment on whether the job action against Sousek was related to the lawsuit.
The Lower Platte South NRD covers six counties in southeast Nebraska. It operates nine wildlife management areas and maintains 50 miles of recreational trails, along with working with landowners to reduce erosion and manage groundwater use.
Most recently, Sousek and the NRD have been in talks with the Cass County Board about selecting a route for a hike-bike trail to connect the Mo-Pac Trail from Lincoln with the Lied Bridge that spans the Platte River. A recommended route had won approval in the fall, but the board declined recently to give that route final approval.

What she didn’t expect was a stage performance aimed at Native people that included a condemnation of traditional Navajo beliefs — and those who embrace them.
“Unfortunately, it turned out to be a really disrespectful kind of play,” she said.

Among other scenes that trafficked in harmful stereotypes of Indigenous people, the play showcased a Diné Hataałii, or medicine man, being condemned to hell for practicing traditional Diné ways of life, including ceremony and traditional healing.
Hataałii protect and preserve all traditional ceremonies and customs of the Diné way of life, and they hold a special place of honor among the Diné people.
The Door showing the damnation of a Hataałii “wasn’t a misunderstanding,” Tsosie said, but rather a “direct attack on our beliefs and spirituality.”
The Door is an offshoot of the Potter’s House Christian Fellowship Church, which was founded in Prescott, and is part of Christian Fellowship Ministries located in Benton, Kentucky. Christian Fellowship Ministries has over 4,000 churches worldwide, with seven churches on the Navajo Nation.
“Our church here in Gallup was among the first few Southwestern works launched out of the Prescott congregation,” The Door’s website states. “From the earliest days, it has stood as a testimony to God’s power to transform lives and reach cities through evangelism, discipleship and church planting.”
The Arizona Mirror reached out to The Door and Potter’s House, but neither church responded.
The shock from the play prompted Tsosie to start recording a video of the over-the-top theatrical production on her phone. She then posted that video on her TikTok account with the caption: “The things you see in border towns.”
Her TikTok posts feature two parts of the play, which was set in a dark room with the stage illuminated by red lights, while ominous drum music plays in the background.
The music played throughout the show featured remixes of traditional songs, layered with sound effects to create a more menacing tone.
At the center of the stage,  a Navajo man dressed in traditional clothing kneels by a fire, holding an eagle feather in his hand. Kneeling next to the Navajo medicine man is an actor dressed in a demon costume, encouraging his actions.
Suddenly, another Navajo person appears, shouting at the medicine man and demanding to know what he did to his niece.
“She’s in the hospital. What kind of ceremony did you do?” the man shouts. The interaction escalates into violence, as the angry man stabs and kills the medicine man.
In the next scene, the medicine man — the murder victim — is standing at what is supposed to be the gates of heaven, surrounded by white light, interacting with an angel. That angel swiftly bars the Hataałii from heaven and condemns him to hell.

The stage suddenly bathed in red lights, demons surround the medicine man, taunting him. “Come on, let’s do a ceremony,” and “We don’t like tradition, do we?” they say.
The medicine man is laid on the floor, and the lead demon gives orders to his minions: “Let’s do a purification. I’ll purify your soul in the fiery pits of hell. Demons, take this pedophile and make him suffer.”
Since she posted the video, Tsosie said she has received an overwhelming response. The video has garnered more than 230,000 views on TikTok, with nearly 1,600 comments.
Tsosie said some of the comments in her videos claim she is taking the play out of context, misrepresenting the situation and she needs to find her way with Christ.
“It kind of felt like a big slap in my face,” she said.
Tsosie, 24, grew up in a Christian household in Tohlakai, New Mexico, on the Navajo Nation. She said she is familiar with the religion, even though she is no longer religious. She attended The Door’s service because a friend invited her.
In response to the play, Tsosie helped organize a peaceful protest across the street from the church on June 8. She said they want accountability, including a public apology. They have not received a response from the church, much less an apology.
Navajo elders and youth have reached out to her. Tsosie said the elders appreciate her speaking up about the incident because they thought they’d never see it happen. Youth have shared their feelings about forced religion and the cultural shame they encounter.
“It’s been emotional and overwhelming, in the best and hardest ways,” she said. “This moment is bigger than me, and it’s about our people realizing that we don’t have to stay silent anymore.”
 ‘It was absolutely revolting’

As she sat through the service, Tsosie said she noticed how utterly unbothered the predominantly Native audience was as the actors portraying the demons mocked Diné ceremonies.
“I guess it felt normal to them,” she said. “I think the painful part of the play was that most of the actors were themselves Navajo.”
Diné historian Dr. Jennifer Nez Denetdale said she has heard stories about The Door Church and how many Navajo people involved with the church actively participated in demeaning and derogatory remarks about their people.
Her niece witnessed this firsthand and never returned, appalled by their actions. Denetdale said demonizing the Diné people’s way of life is a long-term strategy of The Door Church.
Denetdale said the Navajo Nation has never really acknowledged or accounted for the extent to which the Navajo people have been Christianized since colonization began on their homeland.
“What follows the soldiers are the missionaries,” she said. “What follows the establishment of the forts is the missionaries and the priests.”
Denetdale holds a doctoral degree in history and serves as the professor and chair of American Studies at the University of New Mexico. Her research work focuses on settler colonialism, decolonization and Diné studies.
Denetdale is from Tohatchi, New Mexico, on the Navajo Nation. During her regular drives to Gallup, which is 25 miles away and the closest community with resources for many Navajo people in the area, she made it a habit to count the churches along the way.
“In that stretch, there are at least 16 Christian churches, and we’re talking about a remote area,” she said. “There’s an investment in continuing to Christianize Navajo people, and in that process, they must discount, vilify and demonize who we are and our foundation as Diné people.”
Due to how heavily Christianized the Navajo people are, Denetdale said their response to conflicts involving the church, such as what was depicted in Tsosie’s video, is often not to say anything — or to deflect by saying things like, “That’s not my church and that’s not us.”
“They don’t see it as problematic because they personalize it,” she added. “I think that’s part of the problem, and a question for all of us is to acknowledge just how Christianized we’ve become.”
Denetdale said she is not a Christian, and it is difficult for any Navajo person to say they are not a Christian because so many prominent leaders on the Navajo Nation are Christian. However, she said she is a historian and knows the history of Christianity, and “it is an ugly, ugly story.”
Denetdale said she doesn’t use the terms “culture” or “religion” to explain the Diné people’s way of life because they do not adequately describe who they are. She said that the Diné people’s knowledge and understanding of the world are rooted in a deep philosophy of Diné values.
When she saw the video, she said “it was absolutely revolting” and she shouldn’t be surprised that, in this day and age, one can showcase something that has “such incredibly grotesque depictions of Diné ways of being, and that medicine people, traditional practitioners, are demonized.”
“I’m shocked, but I shouldn’t be shocked — this is Gallup, New Mexico,” she said, a city with a long history of racism and discrimination against Indigenous people.
The City of Gallup was founded in 1881. It has been referred to as the “Indian Capitol of the World” due to its proximity to several tribal nations, including the Navajo Nation and the Zuni Pueblo Nation, whose tribal lands surround the city, as well as the significant contribution of Indigenous people to the local economy.
Indigenous people make up more than 52% of the city’s population, but like many border towns, Gallup has a history of racism and violence against Native people.
In response to public outcry, the City of Gallup released a statement indicating that, since its founding, it has been a place of diverse heritages, beliefs, and practices.
Due to the diversity of Gallup, the city stated that “conflict is inevitable,” and when it occurs, their priority is to ensure the public’s safety and that all rights are respected and protected.
The city stated it cannot intervene or take sides in matters of speech and expression. However, they can and will impose reasonable restrictions on time, place and manner in the public arena.
“Freedom of expression comes at a price,” the city wrote in its statement. “It requires an acceptance of and willingness to bear insult and offense, to hear and see what one may find hurtful or despicable.”
The Arizona Mirror reached out to the City of Gallup for comment, but it did not respond.
 Navajo Nation Council issues letter to church

Navajo Nation Council Speaker Crystalyne Curley said that since the video was released, council delegates have been asked by constituents to address it. Curley called the church’s play very disrespectful.
“It was very gruesome and visual,” she said, especially with the sound effects. “They went above and beyond to do that.”
On the best way to move forward, Curley said that she consulted with faith-based leaders from various denominations and traditional practitioners to hear their perspectives on the incident.
“Many of them reiterated that this type of disrespect or depiction of discrimination should not be tolerated toward any faith,” she said in an interview with the Arizona Mirror.
Many expressed their disapproval of the church’s performance, she said, noting that it crosses the boundaries of respect among faiths.
“Navajo traditional practices are considered sacred by many of our people,” Curley said in a statement. “They are integral to Navajo identity, history, and our way of life.”
On behalf of the Navajo Nation Council, Curley issued a formal letter to The Door on June 11,  expressing disappointment and calling on the church’s leadership to take responsibility for the performance.
“As neighbors to the Navajo Nation, the City of Gallup and surrounding communities share not only a geographical proximity but also a cultural and social relationship with our people,” the letter stated. “It is within this shared space that mutual respect, understanding and coexistence must be nurtured.”
The Navajo Nation Council described the performance as a misrepresentation and mockery of sacred aspects of Navajo spirituality, stating that the portrayal is disrespectful and culturally insensitive.
“Navajo medicine men are spiritual leaders and should never be made a mockery in such a violent manner,” Curley said in a statement.
The letter calls on the church to take the concerns of the community seriously, Curley said, and she is more than willing to sit down with the church’s leaders to have a “respectful dialogue on what has happened.”
“Many of our people are still frustrated,” she said, adding that they have not received any type of response back from the church.
Curley said that it is essential to acknowledge the religious freedoms practiced on the Navajo Nation. However, she said that “freedom should never come at the expense of another person’s sacred beliefs or traditions.”
“My statement is not intended to play down or disrespect another religion, but there has to be some type of respect, even as neighbors,” Curley added. “This goes across all faiths. We have to stay respectful to one another.”
Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren has not released a statement about the incident. The Arizona Mirror reached out to Nygren’s office, but it did not respond.

(Photo by shaunl/ Getty Images)If there was any doubt that the current actions and rhetoric of the Trump administration regarding Canada are not only off-base but downright disrespectful, one just need to sit through a two-hour performance at the Ogunquit Playhouse to appreciate just one example of how much that neighborly relationship should mean to Americans.
The performance, “Come From Away,” which wrapped earlier this month, tells the powerful story of how, over five days, the small town of Gander, Newfoundland managed to safely land, house, and feed 7,000 people from 39 different flights beginning on the terrible morning of September 11, 2001. My wife and I had the opportunity to see the show and were both amazed at the quality of the performance and moved by the story. 
The elephant in the room, however, is that the performance comes amid a series of disparaging messages from the White House about Canada. After seeing the portrayal of this herculean Canadian effort, how do we reconcile the current rhetoric from Washington?  
Canada is our neighbor, our friend, and a valued business partner. We share a long history along our 5,500-mile border, with common interests and values, as well as multi-layered economic ties and security agreements. Recent White House attempts to paint Canada as taking advantage of the U.S. is ludicrous, so much so that CNN recently published a list of nine false claims against Canada. 
To be clear, there is no justification for slandering our closest and most important neighbor and ally. The original North American Free Trade Agreement was forcibly renegotiated during President Donald Trump’s first term to great acclaim (by him). But in his second term, his new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada was apparently not good enough. Now the White House is adding punitive tariffs and threatening to annex the entire 3.8 million square mile country into our 51st state. 
In our current political environment, would Americans respond to a 9/11-like crisis in Canada with unbridled enthusiasm and sacrifice as our northern neighbors did? Would we welcome thousands of people in need with open arms or would we want to know their political or religious affiliation, or to scan their social media, before giving comfort? Based on the response of the show’s audience, made up mostly of New Englanders based on their license plates, I believe that they would stand up and provide the necessary assistance and not subject them to a loyalty test.  
Over those five days in 2001, Canada more than passed any test of a good neighbor and ally — they deserve a medal, not tariffs and threats.

(Courtesy of South Dakota GF&P)A list of donors to a state-owned shooting range under construction north of Rapid City includes $2 million from gun-industry companies or organizations. 
The $20 million, 400-acre complex will be one of the largest public shooting ranges in the nation when it opens this fall, according to the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish & Parks. The complex will host recreational shooters, safety programs, marksmanship competitions and law enforcement training. It will include rifle, pistol, shotgun and archery ranges.
About $6 million of the project’s funding has been given or pledged by donors. The rest is from the state’s Future Fund for economic development.
The department announced last month in a news release that the range will be named the Pete Lien & Sons Shooting Sports Complex, but the release did not disclose the amount of the company’s donation, or include a full list of donations.
“We are extremely pleased with all of the support and excitement for the shooting sports complex and our Second Amendment rights in South Dakota,” Department Secretary Kevin Robling said in the press release. 
List initially withheld
South Dakota Searchlight requested a list of donors with names and amounts. The department’s initial response said only that donors gave more than $6 million, including $2 million for naming rights from Pete Lien & Sons, a mining, concrete and construction aggregate company based in Rapid City.
When Searchlight asked again for a full list of donors, a spokesman for the department directed the request to the state’s online records request portal. Searchlight submitted a letter including a legal argument that the donation list is a public record. A lawyer for the department provided the list 15 days later. 
State lawmakers question authority for $20 million shooting complex, but it moves ahead anyway

Three donors on the list who gave or pledged a combined $6,100 are referenced only as “private donation”; Searchlight asked for those names or a justification for withholding them. The department’s lawyer replied that the names are covered by exceptions in the state open records law to protect personal privacy and to prevent the “unreasonable release of personal information.”
The project has been controversial with state legislators, who refused to fund it. Some were angered last year when they learned that then-Gov. Kristi Noem gave the project $13.5 million from the governor-controlled Future Fund for economic development.
The donations from the gun industry are another concern for Rep. Erik Muckey, D-Sioux Falls. He said that as a gun owner and hunter himself, he wants to ensure South Dakota’s sporting and hunting traditions continue. But he is uneasy about the Legislature being successfully lobbied for fewer restrictions on firearms while some of the entities connected to those lobbyists — including the National Rifle Association — are helping to fund a state-owned shooting range.
“Private funding for state-owned facilities is not a new concept; in fact, several examples of public-private partnerships make this state better each day, like the combination of public and private funds to support the Build Dakota scholarship,” Muckey said, referencing a full-tuition program for technical college students. “But this case should give South Dakotans pause.”
The Republican-dominated Legislature routinely considers and passes pro-gun legislation. Last winter, lawmakers and Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden lifted concealed-handgun bans on college campuses and in bars.

The shooting-range donor list includes $6.3 million from 43 sources, with nearly half of the money in hand and the rest pledged. Donations from the gun industry account for nearly one-third of the total:

Smith & Wesson, a Tennessee-based gun manufacturer, donated $150,000 and pledged $600,000, for a total of $750,000.
Glock, an Austrian gun manufacturer, donated $150,000 and pledged $600,000, for a total of $750,000.
Aimpoint, a Swedish gun optics manufacturer that bills itself as the inventor of the red dot sight, donated $50,000 and pledged $200,000, for a total of $250,000. 
Luth-AR, a Minnesota company that sells custom stocks and other components for AR-15 rifles, donated $25,000 and pledged $100,000, for a total of $125,000.
The National Rifle Association donated $50,000.
Federal Ammunition, a Minnesota ammo manufacturer, donated $25,000.
H-S Precision, a Rapid City weapons parts manufacturer, donated $5,000 and pledged $20,000, for a total of $25,000. 
Mack Bros, a Sturgis company that manufactures suppressors (silencers) and other gun components, donated $3,000.
First Stop Gun Shop in Rapid City donated $3,000.
Lane Silencers, a Rapid City manufacturer, donated $3,000.
Sturgis Guns, a seller of firearms and accessories, donated $3,000.

Some other donations came from companies that sell shooting-related accessories, but not guns or gun parts. Donations also came from various other individuals, businesses and hunting and conservation groups.
Bitter feelings among lawmakers
Some legislators on both sides of the political aisle remain upset about Noem’s unilateral decision to provide state funding for the project.
“Unfortunately, her actions have severely damaged trust in otherwise effective institutions, which may cost much-needed projects funding and support in the future,” said Muckey.
In response, the Legislature passed and new Gov. Larry Rhoden signed into law a bill from Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, that says Game, Fish and Parks projects over $2.5 million must receive legislative approval.
“The shooting complex is the reason I brought that bill,” Karr said. “The appropriations process was circumvented.” 
House Assistant Majority Leader Marty Overweg, R-New Holland, said lawmakers feel their will was ignored. 
“Now, the government has to be the one that ensures this shooting range continues to run,” he said. “We voted no, but now we have to run it. Without any choice.”
Robling, the head of GF&P, said in November that the complex will require three full-time employees who will be reallocated internally, as well as seasonal staff and volunteers. Robling said the range will not be profitable and will require help from federal firearm tax revenue allocated to the department. 
Department spokesperson Nick Harrington told South Dakota Searchlight recently that the shooting range will cost an estimated $355,000 annually to operate and maintain, including the three full-time employees.

He replaces Dan Shipp, who resigned to become president of Maryville University in St. Louis. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from SOSU)TOPEKA — The Kansas Board of Regents selected the president of Southeastern Oklahoma State University to take over leadership of Pittsburg State University.
Thomas Newsom, a former Texan with more than 20 years of experience in higher education, will become the 11th president of 5,700-student public university in southeast Kansas.
“Dr. Newsom brings a wealth of experience as a university and community college president,” said Blake Benson, a Pittsburg resident due to become chairperson of the Board of Regents in July. “He has helped multiple institutions grow enrollment and improve, all while focusing on student affordability.”
Newsom, appointed president of Southeastern Oklahoma State in 2020, was credited with helping set an all-time enrollment record of 5,800 students in 2024 on the campus in Durant, Oklahoma.
Enrollment at Southeastern Oklahoma State has grown nearly 500 students since 2020, while PSU enrollment has declined 13% in that period.
Newsom was previously vice president of student success and dean of students at Texas A&M University at Commerce, Texas. He worked five years as president of Mesalands Community College in Tucumcari, New Mexico.
He said in a statement Friday announcing the PSU appointment that he was appreciative of the faculty and staff at Southeastern Oklahoma State.
“I would also like to thank the Kansas Board of Regents for the opportunity to make this amazing professional and personal move,” Newsom said.
Newsom earned a doctorate in higher education administration at University of North Texas, a master’s degree in higher education from Texas A&M-Commerce and an undergraduate degree in business at Austin College.
He was selected to replace Dan Shipp, who resigned as PSU president in May to become president of Maryville University in St. Louis.

The highway reopened to traffic on Wednesday, according to the Alaska Department of Transportation and Public Facilities. 
The declaration, signed June 17, allows the department to bypass some state environmental laws in order to conduct repairs. It also allows the state to receive waivers from federal truck safety laws in order to transport repair material along the highway.
The emergency declaration allows the state to apply for Federal Highway Administration emergency relief money, which may cover up to 100% of temporary repairs and 90% of permanent repairs. 
Flooding washed out a significant part of the highway on June 14, and several other parts of the highway north of the Brooks Range were damaged by high water.

(Courtesy of MIRC)This story was originally published by Chalkbeat. Sign up for Chalkbeat Detroit’s free newsletter to keep up with the city’s public school system and Michigan education policy.
Maykol Bogoya-Duarte, the Detroit teen whose detention by federal immigration authorities last month caused an outcry and led to calls for his release, has been deported, his attorney said Friday morning.
Attorney Ruby Robinson said he learned late Thursday night from Maykol’s mother, in an 11:15 p.m. voicemail, that the teen was back in his home country of Colombia.
Robinson said he hadn’t yet spoken with Maykol, but hoped to do so later Friday. He said the teen is now with his grandmother in Colombia.
Chalkbeat reached out to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, to confirm the deportation, but did not get a response. His information is no longer available on ICE’s detainee locator.
Maykol, 18, was arrested on May 20 while he and a group of other newcomer boys attempted to join a field trip at Lake Erie Metropark, about 25 miles away from Detroit. Rockwood police stopped the teen for allegedly tailgating another car. Maykol did not have a driver’s license, only a City of Detroit identification card, Robinson has previously said.
His detention prompted advocacy from his teachers, fellow students, community members, and lawmakers who pleaded for Maykol to be allowed to remain in the country to finish high school. He was 3.5 credits shy of a high school diploma at Western International High School, where he was enrolled.
“I’m devastated,” said Kristen Schoettle, who taught Maykol at Western.
“The cruelty of this country really shakes me,” Schoettle said. “This kid, my bright student, was passed along to prisons for a month, scared and facing awful conditions I’m sure, for the crime of what — fleeing his country as a minor in search of a better life? And the US government decided his time was better spent in prison than finishing out the school year.”
Schoettle said she hopes to hear from Maykol today.
“I hope he’s safe with his grandma. I hope he can recover from this traumatizing experience and still will dream of a better life. I’ll miss him in my classroom next year and our city and our country are worse off without people like him,” she said.
Schoettle shared examples of Maykol’s classroom work with Chalkbeat, including what he wrote when asked earlier this year to write about freedom.
“I think the freedom in this moment is a little confusing since we can’t leave safely since we don’t know what can happen and it seems strange to me since we have to be more careful than usual,” he wrote in Spanish.
Thousands of people signed a petition earlier last week calling on the Detroit Public School Community District and lawmakers to condemn Maykol’s arrest.
Dozens of people spoke in support of the teen’s release for more than 2½ hours at the district’s school board meeting on June 10. Afterward, the board released a statement saying it wanted Maykol to be able to stay in the country to earn his diploma.
Maykol’s mother attended that school board meeting, though she didn’t speak. Robinson, senior managing attorney with the Michigan Immigrant Rights Center, said the organization isn’t representing Maykol’s mother.
“But I would suspect she will try to return to Colombia at her own expense based on what she learned with Maykol’s month-long, taxpayer-funded, and entirely unnecessary and harmful detention.”
During the May 20 traffic stop that led to his detention, police officers could not communicate with him in Spanish and called Customs and Border Protection agents to translate.
Maykol, who came to the U.S. when he was 16, had already been going through a legal process to return to Colombia after receiving a final order of deportation in 2024. He was working with immigration officials and the Colombian Consulate to obtain the documentation he needed to fly out of the country with his mother.
While he made those arrangements, Maykol planned to finish high school in Detroit.

(Photo: Adam Miedema/WCMU)This coverage is made possible in part through a partnership between IPR and Grist, a nonprofit environmental media organization.
The final day for the public to comment on a federal environmental review of the Line 5 tunnel is approaching on June 30.
The draft report details the impacts of building a 3.6-mile tunnel under the lakebed in the Straits of Mackinac, which would house a new segment of Line 5. Right now, 72-year-old dual pipelines run along the bottom of the Straits.
That development marks a significant milestone in the years-long project, and the years-long fight over whether it should be built at all.
The Army Corps will decide this fall whether to issue a permit for the project. The last day for the public to comment on the environmental review is June 30.
The draft review is hundreds of pages long, and contains hundreds more pages including appendices, so IPR and WCMU teamed up to identify the key points.
Enbridge’s tunnel plan
Enbridge Energy, the Canadian pipeline company that owns and operates Line 5, says placing it in a tunnel would make a “safe pipeline even safer.”
Read the full draft review. The Corps is accepting public comments through June 30. There is a virtual public hearing on Wednesday, June 25, 2025, 5 – 8 p.m., which is available at this Zoom link or by calling +1-301-715-8592
The company proposed the tunnel project in 2018 after an anchor hit the exposed pipe and applied for a federal permit in 2020. The Army Corps began its review process two years later.
The plan is to use a tunnel boring machine to drill a hole under the lakebed while lining and sealing the space with concrete segments. Construction would last six years, according to the Army Corps.
The agency supports the pipeline’s continued operation, saying products the pipeline transports — oil and natural gas liquids — will be needed for the “foreseeable future.” It also says the tunnel would eliminate the potential of an anchor strike and provide secondary containment in the event of an oil spill, bringing the risk of oil escaping the tunnel to “virtually zero.”
Here are some key impacts outlined in the report:

Recreation: “Direct, short-term detrimental impacts” in the area during construction due to noise and damaged aesthetics.
Groundwater: “Direct, detrimental impacts” with the potential for drilling fluids or contaminants to be released as the tunnel is drilled, which could take 6 – 8 months. It could also lower the water level by as much as 2 feet in a 130-foot area. The Army Corps review says the construction contractor would follow a spill plan and monitor wells during construction and for two years after it is completed.
Surface water: “Direct, detrimental impacts” with the potential release of 20,000 gallons of drilling fluid and unintended release of contaminants. The Army Corps says this fluid is mainly water and a type of clay called bentonite, along with “additives such as lubricants or greases.”
Wetlands: “Direct, detrimental impact” with permanent losses of 4.3 acres of wetland and indirect impact of fragmentation of wetland systems.
Habitats: Various “direct, detrimental impacts” due to removal of up to 19 acres of vegetation, which includes 5.2 acres of forested land. Construction noise and vibration could affect wildlife on land and in the water. The potential release of 20,000 gallons of drilling fluids could also affect aquatic wildlife.
Protected species: Loss of 7.7 acres of habitat for the federally endangered northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat, including clearing of 287 roost trees. Enbridge said it wouldn’t clear trees in June or July, when bats have pups.
Cultural resources: “Adverse effects” on archaeological sites, including activities that could remove or destroy archaeological resources.
Geology: Roughly 416,000 bank cubic yards of rock would be excavated and permanently removed. Formations like sinkholes or caves could develop, and vibrations from tunnel drilling may cause the geology in the area to shift.
Transportation & Navigation: “Direct, detrimental effects” with an increase in road traffic and limited obstruction to navigation.
Air Quality: Short-term impacts to local air quality during construction.
Noise & Vibration: “Direct, local detrimental effects” are likely during construction period, with impacts depending on exact location, while vibration levels are not expected to exceed established impact thresholds.
Energy Demand: “No impact” on the local energy grid’s ability to meet demand.

The draft review also says tunnel construction would require up to 204 workers. That could affect housing, community services and tourism while helping the region’s unemployment rate, income and taxes. The review says half of project materials would come from regional and state supply chains, which would benefit the regional economy.
The review estimates that around eight injuries could occur during construction. It’s also possible they will “encounter unstable geology” and that the build-up of hazardous gases might lead to an explosion in the tunnel, which the report says is unlikely.
A mitigation plan outlines steps to reduce the project’s impacts. That includes more geotechnical analysis to better understand the geology where tunnel boring will take place, a spill plan and monitoring during drilling to detect hazardous gases, among other measures.
Other options
The report compares the tunnel plan to leaving the existing dual lines as they are in the water or covering the lines with gravel and rock. These alternatives would generally have fewer impacts on the landscape, but the Army Corps says they fail to address the risks of an anchor strike or an oil spill.
The Army Corps also reviewed the impacts of different methods to decommission the dual lines if the tunnel is permitted. The options include:

Clean and plug the lines but abandon in-place
Partially remove exposed portions of the pipeline segments along the lakebed while cleaning and plugging the remaining segments
Partially remove pipeline segments in the water between ordinary high-water marks lakebed while cleaning and plugging the remaining section
Clean and fully remove the dual lines

Line 5 tunnel critics say the federal review failed to consider “real” alternatives that involve stopping the transport of petroleum products through the Straits, claiming Enbridge and the Army Corps overstate the economic importance of the pipeline. Critics point to court documents, where an Enbridge consultant said a Line 5 shutdown would raise gas prices by a half-cent per gallon.
What’s not in the draft
The Army Corps is conducting an analysis to determine if the tunnel project violates treaty rights. The analysis is separate from the permitting process under the National Environmental Policy Act.
This is part of the United States’ federal trust responsibility, said Carrie Fox, a spokesperson with the Corps’ Detroit District, in an email, and will inform the permit decision, “as it does not have authority to authorize activities that would abrogate or impinge upon treaty rights.”
Seven tribal nations in Michigan withdrew from permitting discussions this spring, saying that the environmental review process sidelined tribal expertise and concerns, and undermined rights to hunt, fish and gather on that land guaranteed in an 1836 treaty with the U.S. The federally recognized tribes are continuing to work on the treaty rights analysis, though lawyers with the Bay Mills Indian Community said the shortened timeline is a challenge.
“Now everybody’s scrambling, and it’s become a truncated process,” said David Gover, an attorney with the Native American Rights Fund, one of the firms representing Bay Mills. That means tribes need to speed up their work to assess how the project would affect their rights.
The path to a permitting decision has been long and winding. In 2023 the Army Corps extended the original deadline for its draft review by a year and a half. Then, the draft environmental impact statement was among the projects fast-tracked after President Donald Trump declared a national energy emergency to boost the nation’s energy supply. Under new emergency procedures, the agency cut the window for public comment in half, from 60 days to 30.
Environmental advocates have critiqued the scope of the review as too narrow.
They have also pushed for the Army Corps to conduct a detailed analysis of the project’s greenhouse gas emissions, including those released when the oil is extracted and refined. The Army Corps has said doing so is outside the scope of its analysis and that its review would focus on emissions from construction and operations. But following Trump’s executive orders to speed up energy projects and weaken climate considerations, the corps excluded that from the draft review. It also said it doesn’t have the authority to assess the risk of oil spills beyond the project’s design, engineering and safety.
Groups have also called on the Army Corps to include the entire 645-mile stretch of Line 5 in its review. In 2023, the Army Corps declined to do so, citing federal statutes.
Enbridge is still missing permits from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy for the tunnel. Environmental groups are calling on the state to reject those permits. An EGLE spokesperson said there is still no timeline for when the permitting decision will be announced, and the state’s 30-day public comment period has not started yet.

Nick Begich, R-Alaska, speaks at the Resource Development for Alaska annual membership luncheon on June 18, 2025. (Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Two bills sponsored by Rep. Nick Begich III, R-Alaska, have passed the U.S. Senate and are on the way to the desk of President Donald Trump.
The Senate passed House Resolution 42 and House Resolution 43 by voice vote on Wednesday. By phone Friday, Begich said he expects that Trump will sign both bills sometime in the next 30 days.
When signed into law, HR 42 would make it easier for disabled Alaska Natives to qualify for some federal aid programs. It states that certain income will not count against the federal eligibility limit for those programs.
HR 43 would give about 11,550 acres of land to Alaska Native village corporations by eliminating the requirement in federal law that the state hold some land in trust in case a new village corporation is created.
The Alaska Legislature requested the change in federal law last year.
Versions of HR 42 and 43 were proposed by Rep. Mary Peltola, D-Alaska, and were passed on to Begich after he defeated Peltola in Alaska’s 2024 U.S. House election.
“These are only the ninth and 10th bills that originated in the House to actually be passed into law so far,” Begich said, adding that he thinks both are important.
“There’s an assumption that’s often made that villages have an abundance of land because they’re rural, but the reality is, many of these villages don’t have access to land holdings that would allow them to develop additional housing or additional local infrastructure, and so the Municipal Lands Act restores approximately 11,500 acres across hundreds of Alaskan villages,” he said.
“One of the challenges that I hear about on a regular basis from Native communities is the lack of housing, the lack of affordable housing, and the fact that in many communities, multiple generations of families are crammed together in housing units that are too small, unsafe or lack proper standards, and hopefully this bill will be a step toward alleviating that problem,” Begich said.
Begich credited Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, for leading the bills through the Senate. Murkowski delivered remarks Wednesday on the Senate floor, noting that the Senate passed both bills last December but that the prior edition of the House failed to pass them before adjourning.
She thanked two of her Democratic colleagues, Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Ed Markey of Massachusetts, for arranging to have the bills pass by unanimous consent, without a physical vote.
The arrangement saw two Democratic-sponsored bills — one from Nevada and one from Massachusetts — pass unanimously alongside the Alaska bills.
“I’m proud to have been able to work on these important measures,” she said. “It’s been a multiyear effort to get them to the president’s desk. I don’t care really if we send an HR or an S(enate) bill to the president. We just want to get it accomplished. We just want to get some things done for Alaska.”

Santiago/Getty Images)More American children and teens die from firearms than any other cause, but there are more deaths — and wider racial disparities — in states with more permissive gun policies, according to a new study.
The study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics last week, analyzes trends in state firearm policies and kids’ deaths since 2010, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision in McDonald v. City of Chicago. The ruling struck down the city’s handgun ban, clearing the way for many states to make it easier for people to buy and carry guns.
The study authors split states into three groups: “most permissive,” “permissive” and “strict,” based on the stringency of their firearm policies. Those policies include safe storage laws, background checks and so-called Stand Your Ground laws. The researchers analyzed homicide and suicide rates and the children’s race.
Using statistical methods, the researchers calculated 6,029 excess deaths in the most permissive states between 2011 and 2023, compared with the number of deaths that would have been expected under the states’ pre-McDonald rules. There were 1,424 excess deaths in the states in the middle category.
States move to outlaw popular ‘Glock switches’ that make some guns fully automatic

In total, about 17,000 deaths were expected in the post-decision period, but 23,000 occurred, said lead author Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, in an interview.
Among the eight states with the strictest laws, four — California, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island — saw statistically significant decreases in their pediatric firearm death rates. Illinois, which was directly affected by the court’s decision in the McDonald case, and Connecticut saw increases in their rates. In Massachusetts and New Jersey, the changes were not statistically significant.
The rate increased in all but four (Alaska, Arizona, Nebraska and South Dakota) of the 41 states in the two permissive categories. (Hawaii was not included in the study due its low rates of firearm deaths.)
Non-Hispanic Black children and teens saw the largest increase in firearm deaths in the 41 states with looser gun laws. Those youths’ mortality rates increased, but by a much smaller amount, in the states with strict laws.
Experts say the study underscores the power of policy to help prevent firearm deaths among children and teens. The analysis comes less than a month after the release of a federal report on children’s health that purported to highlight the drivers of poor health in America’s children but failed to include anything on firearm injuries — the leading cause of death for children and teens in 2020 and 2021, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Trauma surgeon Dr. Marie Crandall, chair of surgery at MetroHealth medical center and a professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, researches gun violence. She previously practiced at a Jacksonville, Florida, urban trauma unit, where she frequently saw children and teens caught in gun violence.
“When I see children come in with 10 holes in them that I can’t save — that is a loss. That is a completely preventable death, and it is deeply emotionally scarring to have to have those conversations with families when we know, as a society, there are things we could do to de-escalate,” said Crandall, who wasn’t involved in the new study.

In her state of Ohio, firearm death rates among children and teens increased from 1.6 per 100,000 kids in the decade before the McDonald decision to 2.8 after it, according to the study. Ohio was categorized in the group with the most permissive laws.
The study adds to previous research that shows state laws around child access to firearms, such as safe storage and background checks, tend to be associated with fewer child firearm deaths.
“We know that child access prevention decreases unintentional injuries and suicides of children. So having your firearms locked, unloaded, stored separately from ammunition, decreases the likelihood of childhood injuries,” Crandall said. “More stringent regulation of those things also decreases childhood injuries.”
But she said it’s hard to be optimistic about more stringent regulation when the current administration dismisses gun violence as a public health emergency. The Trump administration earlier this year took down an advisory from the former U.S. surgeon general, issued last year, that emphasized gun violence as a public health crisis.
Faust, the lead author of the new study, stressed that firearm injuries and deaths were notably missing from the Make America Healthy Again Commission report on children’s health. He said the failure to include them illustrates the politicization of a major public health emergency for America’s kids.
“It’s hard to take them seriously if they’re omitting the leading cause of death,” Faust said. “They’re whiffing, they’re shanking. They’re deciding on a political basis not to do it. I would say by omitting it, they’re politicizing it.”
Faust and pediatric trauma surgeon Dr. Chethan Sathya, who directs the Center for Gun Violence Prevention at the Northwell Health system in New York, each pointed to the development of car seat laws and public health education, as examples of preventive strategies that helped reduce childhood fatalities. They support a similar approach to curbing youth gun deaths.
Youth gun deaths in the US have surged 50% since 2019

“We really have to apply a public health framework to this issue, not a political one, and we’ve done that with other issues in the past,” said Sathya, who wasn’t involved in the study and oversees his hospital’s firearm injury prevention programs. “There’s no question that this is a public health issue.”
In Louisiana, which the study categorized as one of the 30 most permissive states, the child firearm mortality rate increased from 4.1 per 100,000 kids in the pre-McDonald period to 5.7 after it — the nation’s highest rate. The study period only goes to 2023, but the state last year enacted a permitless carry law, allowing people to carry guns in public without undergoing background checks. And just last month, Louisiana legislators defeated a bill that would have created the crime of improper firearm storage.
Louisiana Democratic state Rep. Matthew Willard, who sponsored the safe storage legislation, said during the floor debate that its purpose was to protect children. Louisiana had the highest rate of unintentional shootings by children between 2015 to 2022, according to the research arm of Everytown for Gun Safety, which advocates for stricter gun access. Willard cited that statistic on the floor.
But Republican opponents said Willard’s proposal would infringe on residents’ gun rights and make it more difficult for them to use guns in self-defense.
“Nobody needs to come in our houses and tell us what to do with our guns. I think this is ridiculous,” Republican Rep. R. Dewith Carrier said during the debate.

Another Republican opponent, state Rep. Troy Romero, said he was concerned that having a firearm locked away would make it harder for an adult to quickly access it.
“If it’s behind a locked drawer, how in the world are you going, at 2 or 3 in the morning, going to be able to protect your family if somebody intrudes or comes into your home?” Romero said.
Gun violence researcher Julia Fleckman, an assistant professor, and her team at Tulane University in New Orleans have started to collect data on the impact of the state’s permitless carry law.
“It places a disproportionate impact on really vulnerable people, really, our most vulnerable people,” Fleckman said, noting kids bear the brunt of legislators’ decisions. “They don’t have a lot of control over this or the decisions we’re making.”
In South Carolina, another one of the most permissive states, the mortality rate increased from 2.3 to 3.9 per 100,000 kids in the time before and after the McDonald decision. South Carolina Democratic state Rep. JA Moore, who lost his adult sister 10 years ago today in the 2015 racist shooting that killed nine at a Charleston church, said state policy alone isn’t enough. He implored his colleagues to also examine their perception of guns.
“We have a culture here in South Carolina that doesn’t lend itself to a more safe South Carolina,” said Moore, who added he’s been advocating for background checks and stricter carry laws. “There is a need for a culture change in our state, in our country, when it comes to guns and our relationships with guns as Americans, realizing that these are deadly weapons.”
‘Problematic’ MAHA report minimizes success of lifesaving asthma medicines, doctors say

And investing in safer neighborhoods is crucial, he said.
“People are hurt by guns in places that they’re more comfortable, like their homes in their own neighborhoods,” he said.
Community-based interventions are important to stemming violence, experts said. Crandall, the Cleveland surgeon, said there’s emerging evidence that hospital-based and community-based violence prevention programs decrease the likelihood of violent and firearm-related injury.
Such programs aim to break cycles of violence by connecting injured patients with community engagement services. After New York City implemented its hospital-based violence interruption program, two-thirds of 3,500 violent trauma patients treated at five hospitals received community prevention services.
After her 33-year-old son was killed in her neighborhood in 2019, Michelle Bell started M-PAC Cleveland — “More Prayer, Activity & Conversation” — a nonprofit collaborative of people who’ve lost loved ones to violent crime. She’s encountered many grieving parents who lost their children to gunfire. The group advocates and educates for safe storage laws and holds peer grief support groups.
She also partners with the school district in a program that shares stories of gun violence’s long-lasting impact on surviving children, families and communities and non-violent interpersonal conflict resolution.
“Oftentimes, the family that has lost the child, the child’s life has been taken by gun violence, there are other children in the home,” she said.
“It’s so devastating. It’s just so tragic that the No. 1 cause of death for children 18 and under is gun violence,” Bell continued.
The decision to “pull a trigger,” she said, changes a “lifetime of not only yours, but so many other people.”

A group of more than 20 Klansmen killed three civil rights workers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, south of Philadelphia, Mississippi. 
The three men had come as a part of Freedom Summer to register Black voters and work in the civil rights movement. Imperial Wizard Sam Bowers called on Klansmen to repel this “communist invasion” by counterattacking the movement leaders at night: 
“Any personal attacks on the enemy should be carefully planned to include only the leaders and prime white collaborators of the enemy forces,” he said.
The trio came to Neshoba County to investigate the KKK’s burning of a Black church and the beatings of members. On their return to Meridian, Neshoba County Deputy Cecil Price jailed the trio and then released them into the hands of the waiting Klansmen who chased them down, executed them and buried their bodies 15 feet down in an earthen dam. 
Hundreds of FBI agents came to investigate the case, which the agency called “Mississippi Burning,” or MIBURN for short. Forty-four days later, agents found the bodies. In a 1967 federal trial, seven men were convicted on conspiracy charges with none serving more than six years in prison. Nobody was ever tried for murder until 2005 when Edgar Ray Killen was convicted of orchestrating the trio’s slayings.

But here’s what we know now about the funds and how we expect them to be spent.","Over the next 13 years, Mississippi is expected to receive hundreds of millions of dollars from companies that profited off Mississippians with opioid addiction. Public health workers and families who’ve lost loved ones to overdoses have said all these dollars should be used to prevent more overdose deaths, but they worry that the state’s plan allows spending dollars on other purposes. 
The way this money is being sent to Mississippi and will be spent is complicated, and both could change in the future. But here’s what we know now about the funds and how we expect them to be spent. 
Where are these dollars coming from? How much money is Mississippi expected to receive?
In the 2000s and 2010s, towns, cities, counties, indigenous tribes and states across the country — including Mississippi — filed lawsuits against companies involved in creating, distributing, dispensing and advertising prescription opioid painkillers. They sued the companies for endangering their residents with predatory business practices, and in 2018, thousands of lawsuits started to be combined into a series of larger cases.

They negotiated settlement agreements with 13 companies — Cencora (formerly AmerisourceBergen), Cardinal Health, Mckesson Corporation, Johnson & Johnson, Walgreens, Walmart, Kroger, CVS, Allergan, Teva Pharmaceuticals, McKinsey, Mallinckrodt and Publicis — in the early 2020s. Purdue Pharmaceuticals is in the process of finalizing a $7.4 billion settlement with states including Mississippi, but its declaration of bankruptcy has delayed its payment for years. 
Mississippi has been receiving a portion of the billions of dollars awarded from these settlements since 2022. The state and its local governments are expected to receive about $374 million through 2038. If Purdue and the states finalize the settlement, Mississippi is expected to receive an additional $41 million dollars over the next 15 years from the bankrupt drug company, according to the Mississippi Attorney General’s office.

How is Mississippi managing its opioid settlements?
The money will be split between the state and Mississippi’s towns, cities and counties. Eighty-five percent of the dollars are controlled at the state level, and 15% goes to the local governments that signed on to the lawsuits.
Originally, Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch designed a plan to send the vast majority of the state’s settlement share to build a new University of Mississippi Medical Center addiction treatment center. She said she did this to satisfy requirements in the settlement that say 70% of states’ shares need to be spent to address the overdose epidemic. The remaining part of the state’s share, now estimated to be $56 million, would go into the general fund. 
But the Legislature controls how state settlement funds get spent, and it erased the plan to direct around $262 million to UMMC. Instead, lawmakers passed a bill this year that instructs an advisory council made up of state agency leaders, local officials, law enforcement and political appointees to develop a grant application process for those dollars. The council will make recommendations of which grants to fund, and the Legislature will approve or deny them. 
The Legislature will control the $56 million set to go to the general fund and set to go to the general fund and spend it without recommendations from the council. The local government plan remains intact.

Who decides how these dollars are spent?
It’s unclear how the Legislature will decide which advisory council recommendations will be approved. But the Republican supermajority leaders of the two legislative bodies, Speaker of the House Jason White and Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, have lots of sway over how all state dollars get spent. And lawmakers will have even more control of the $56 million that doesn’t have to go through the advisory council.
Hosemann and White have not responded to calls about how they plan to approach spending the state’s opioid settlement share. 
For the $56 million spread across Mississippi’s local governments, county supervisors, mayors and city and town councils determine how their settlement dollars get spent. These funds have been trickling in since October 2022.

What expenses can the settlement dollars be used for?
The national opioid settlements mandate that at least 70% of their dollars are spent to address the overdose epidemic, according to the Mississippi Attorney General’s office. Many states have agreed to use 100% of their settlement dollars for this, but Mississippi is not one of them.
The $262 million for which the advisory committee will make recommendations must be spent to address and prevent the harms of addiction through these specific strategies. For the remaining $111 million, state and local elected officials can use them the same as other “appropriation of public money,” according to Fitch.

Is Mississippi doing anything other states aren’t? 
Many parts of Mississippi’s opioid settlement expected distribution are different from other states’ plans. Had Fitch enacted her plan to send 70% of the funds to UMMC, Mississippi would have likely been the only state to use more than half its funds for one project. 
Additionally, Mississippi is one of a minority of states that does not require all its funds to be spent on addressing addiction and has the Legislature playing a decision-making role in how the settlements get spent, according to Vital Strategies and OpioidSettlementTracker.com’s state guides. Of the 20 states that task lawmakers with this responsibility, Mississippi’s representatives and senators are responsible for a larger portion of the settlement than their counterparts in any other state.
Mississippi has also been slow to use the majority of its funds. Its neighbors — including Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee and Georgia — have all begun distributing the largest portions of their settlements. In contrast, Mississippi has not yet established a process for interested groups to apply for its state share. 

When will Mississippi start spending its money?
It’s unknown when the state’s portion of the money will be distributed. Department of Mental Health executive director Wendy Bailey, a co-vice chair of the committee, said the first meeting of the opioid advisory council will be held at the Walter Sillers building in Jackson on July 9.
With the passage of its opioid bill this regular session, the Legislature will likely be able to access its unrestricted share as soon as it wants to. And some local governments have already been spending the shares they’ve received. 

What has the money been used on so far? What do Mississippians impacted by the crisis think of that? 
In its settlement agreement with counties and municipalities, the Attorney General’s office does not require them to publicly report how they spend their money. So it’s difficult to know how much each locality has received and how the dollars have been used. 
In May, Mississippi Today filed public records requests to see how Hattiesburg, Lamar County and Forrest County have been spending their shares. It came in the wake of Mississippi overdose prevention advocate James Moore saying he had not heard anything about his local governments’ settlement shares.
The records revealed that the three localities had received around $750,000. Hattiesburg and Lamar County had not spent any money, but Lamar County administrator Joseph Waits said his government will use their dollars for a new regional mental health facility. 
Forrest County has spent about $200,000 of its nearly $500,000. The county supervisors sent $100,000 to a local program that tries to divert people with nonviolent drug charges away from jails and prisons, and it’s allocated another $100,000 for the county sheriff’s department. His requests for these funds include a handheld X-ray device, a drug identification machine, pole cameras, a vehicle tracking device and weapons equipment. In June, he said he had purchased the first three items.

Moore and other local parents who have lost children to addiction were upset when Mississippi Today told them about these developments. Jane Clair Tyner, whose son Asa Henderson died in 2019, said all the funds should be used to improve Mississippi’s public health and should be spent with the input of those most impacted by the overdose crisis.
“The fact that there wasn’t a public call for input on that money is really disgraceful,” she said. “It’s a slap in the face to the people who are still hurting from it, people who experienced devastating loss as a result.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/07043334/AP_17227561183611.jpg,,,2025-06-21 07:59:42.006075

Idaho outcome is imperfect, doctors can find consolation in the court’s decision, writes guest columnist Emily Corrigan. (Photo illustration by Getty Images)As an obstetrician-gynecologist practicing in Idaho, I’ve seen firsthand the consequences of one of the nation’s strictest abortion bans. I have delivered thousands of babies in my career and provided care to countless Idahoans experiencing pregnancy complications. 
Since Idaho’s ban took effect, many patients with serious pregnancy complications have been denied basic care in hospitals across the state. The stories have become all too familiar: pregnant patients coming to the hospital with medical emergencies and physicians struggling to navigate Idaho’s confusing medical exceptions, at times forced to withhold timely and appropriate care. 
Fortunately, an Idaho state court issued a ruling on April 11 that broadened the medical exceptions to the state’s abortion bans, allowing patients to access abortion care if they have a health condition that increases the risk of having a shorter lifespan if they don’t receive an abortion.
Idaho judge says it’s not a crime to perform abortion in some medical cases

As we mark the three-year anniversary of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, it is important that all Idahoans know that this broad health exception is in effect and applies to every part of the state.  
While the decision in Adkins v. Idaho was imperfect, doctors can find much consolation in the court’s decision. Unfortunately, patients with some fetal diagnoses and those at risk of self-harm due to mental health conditions may not qualify for an exception. 
However, Idaho’s criminal abortion ban previously only allowed abortion care to prevent the death of a pregnant person and in limited cases of rape or incest. That meant doctors were left to figure out how close to death their patients had to be to receive proper care. The Adkins ruling allows Idaho physicians to offer abortion care in many more scenarios, significantly reducing or eliminating the need to send patients out of state for emergency health care.
The Adkins ruling also eliminates the current dichotomy in the standard of care in Idaho for pregnant patients who require emergency abortion care. Due to recent developments in the EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act) federal lawsuits, in late March, the protections against prosecution for emergency abortion care were limited to only physicians working at St. Luke’s hospitals. 
This meant that most physicians in Idaho were not protected against criminal prosecution simply for following federal law, and patients’ treatment options depended on which hospital they visited for care. Their options were different even within the same city.
While Adkins is a step in the right direction, Idaho’s abortion bans still interfere with doctors’ ability to act in the best interests of our patients. One of the consequences is that nearly 1 in 4 OBGYNs have left the state since 2022. These losses have already cut off access to reproductive healthcare for many communities, such as Caldwell and Sandpoint. Abortion care is health care, and the ability to access essential health care shouldn’t depend on your zip code. 
Participating as a plaintiff and expert witness in the Adkins case has been one of the most challenging tasks I have faced as a physician. It was also extremely rewarding to work with the brave women who shared their traumatic medical experiences publicly to fight for improved care for other pregnant Idahoans in the future. 
I am hopeful that this is the beginning of a new era leading to the restoration of reproductive rights in Idaho.

(Spencer Platt/Getty Images)The Trump administration is pushing to reshape the federal housing safety net by slashing spending and shifting the burden of housing millions of people to states, which may be ill-equipped to handle the mission.
President Donald Trump’s recent budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2026, a preliminary plan released in early May and known as “skinny” because a more robust ask will follow, outlines a 44% cut to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, including a 43% reduction in rental assistance programs that support more than 9 million Americans.
Trump also wants to consolidate federal housing aid, which includes programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing, into block grants — or finite amounts of money that states would administer. The proposal also would cap eligibility for many aid recipients at two years, and significantly limit federal oversight over how states dole out housing aid to low-income, disabled and older renters.
The approach tracks suggestions outlined in the Heritage Foundation playbook known as Project 2025, in which first-term Trump advisers and other conservatives detailed how a second Trump term might look. The chapter on HUD recommends limiting a person’s time on federal assistance and “devolving many HUD functions to states and localities.”
To that end, Trump’s new housing aid budget request would put states in charge, urging them to create new systems and removing federal regulatory certainty that residents, landlords and developers rely on for low-income housing.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Trump’s request also proposes new rules, such as a two-year time limit on the receipt of Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8 vouchers, for households that do not include persons with disabilities or older adults. The vouchers, federal money paid directly to landlords, help eligible families afford rent in the private market.

Trump’s allies call the changes responsible, while detractors worry about rising homelessness among those who now receive aid.
Among the nearly 4.6 million households receiving HUD housing assistance in the 2020 census, the average household was made up of two people, and the average annual income was just under $18,000, according to a department report last year.
In testimony to Congress this month about the proposed fiscal 2026 budget, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that HUD rental assistance is meant to be temporary, “the same way a treadway facilitates the crossing of an obstacle.”
“The block grant process will empower states to be more thoughtful and precise in their distribution and spending of taxpayer dollars,” Turner said.
The current budget reconciliation package, the tax-and-spending bill named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, doesn’t address individual Housing Choice Vouchers or send federal housing aid back to states. However, it would offer tax credits to developers of affordable housing and expand areas that could qualify for additional favorable tax cuts. That bill passed the House and is now undergoing consideration in the Senate.
Trump’s hopes for next year
The president’s fiscal year 2026 budget request serves as an outline of the administration’s vision for next year’s federal spending.
Congress — specifically the House and Senate Appropriations committees — must draft, negotiate and pass appropriations bills, which ultimately decide how much funding programs like rental assistance will receive.
Trump’s budget request provides sparse details on how much housing aid the federal government would give to each state, and how it would oversee spending. Housing advocates and state agencies are concerned.
“A big piece of the proposal is essentially re-creating rental assistance as we know it, and turning it into a state rental assistance block grant program,” said Kim Johnson, senior director of policy director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

Experts say any resulting aid cuts would disproportionately affect families with children, older adults and individuals with disabilities, many of whom rely on rental subsidies and support to remain stably housed in high-rent markets.
“It would completely change how households might be able to receive rental assistance of any kind,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the center. “It combines five of these programs that millions of people rely on, cuts the funding almost in half, and then leaves it completely to states to decide how to use that funding.”
That’s a shift most states can’t afford, say housing advocates.
A state-by-state analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows the highest rates of housing assistance are in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, along with a few blue states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.
“There’s no way to cut 43% of funding for rental assistance without people losing that assistance or their housing security,” said Johnson, of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And it’s not just urban centers that would be hit; rural areas of Mississippi and Louisiana also have high rates of federal housing aid.
“A rural community who solely relies on federal funding would be even more impacted,” Johnson added.
While state housing finance agencies proved during the pandemic that they can rapidly deploy federal funding, Stockton Williams, executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies, warned that the budget’s shift to block grants would require sufficient funding, a clear transition plan and strong oversight to ensure success.
Housing authorities are requesting further guidance from the feds and members of Congress, and more detail is needed on how any block-grant process would work, Stockton wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline.
“There is still a risk of overregulation and micromanagement with a block grant,” he wrote. “That said, for any type of new block grant to the states to work, there would need to be a transition period both to ensure states can build the necessary infrastructure and oversight and to test and train new systems with the private sector, local government, and nonprofit organizations that would interact with it.”
In New York City, which operates the nation’s largest housing voucher program, officials didn’t outline what steps they would take if Trump’s proposed cuts become reality, but a spokesperson said the plans would hurt residents.
Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, believes the most innovative aspect of the Trump proposal is the introduction of time limits on housing assistance, a mechanism not currently used in HUD’s rental programs.
But he cautioned that a blanket two-year time limit — especially if applied to existing tenants — would be “a recipe for chaos,” particularly in high-need areas such as New York City. Instead, he supports a phased approach focusing on new, non-disabled, non-elderly tenants.
“Block grants would allow states to move away from one-size-fits-all and apply rules based on their own housing needs,” Husock said to Stateline in an interview.
Affordable housing advocates disagree.
“If passed, the president’s proposed budget would be devastating for all federally assisted tenants,” said Michael Horgan, press secretary for the New York City Housing Authority in a statement to Stateline. “Block grants, program funding cuts, and time limits will only worsen the current housing crisis.”
A recent analysis of 100 metro areas by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that households using housing vouchers are more likely to live in higher income areas than those with other federal rental assistance.
“There is a high share of these households using [other] federal rental assistance in higher-poverty areas,” Gartland, the center’s researcher, explained, noting that programs such as the Housing Choice Vouchers are a rare but essential tool for expanding housing mobility.
“If you’re cutting the programming by 40%, you’re just putting additional strain on that program and just limiting that potential.”
For housing providers, uncertainty is growing
For property owners and landlords, the proposed shift in federal assistance and housing aid to the states isn’t just a policy question, it’s a business risk.
Alexandra Alvarado, director of education at the American Apartment Owners Association, said many smaller landlords are closely following proposed changes to the voucher program.
“Section 8 is a stabilizing force, especially for mom-and-pop landlords,” she said. “Many have had loyal tenants for years and rely on that steady income.”
According to Alvarado, landlords — especially small operators — have come to view housing vouchers not just as a public good, but also as a reliable business model where rent is often on time and predictable.
But with the proposed changes placing administration in the hands of state governments, landlords fear a breakdown in consistency.
“If the administration is serious about shifting responsibility to states, landlords will need a lot more clarity, and fast,” Alvarado said. “These programs are supposed to offer certainty. If states run them inconsistently or inefficiently, landlords may exit the market altogether.”
The transition itself, she added, may be destabilizing.
“You’re turning an ecosystem upside down. Change too many parts of the system at once, and you risk unintended domino effects.”
While developers may benefit from new tax incentives in the budget, Alvarado said that doesn’t offset the instability small landlords fear.
“Most mom-and-pop landlords don’t want to evict or raise rent, especially during hard times,” she said. “They just want to provide stable housing and be treated fairly.”

Apartments in Chapel Hill. (Photo: EMPOWERment Inc.)Earlier this week, Duke Energy provided power to P.E.A.C.H. Apartments in Chapel Hill to allow the developer to run air conditioning units to prevent mold and mildew from taking hold. Triple-digit temperatures and high humidity are forecast for next week, which would create ideal conditions for mold and mildew growth.
The energy company had previously refused to run power to the apartments for low-income residents, citing the developer’s decision to use a single meter for billing purposes, according to a consumer complaint the developer, EMPOWERment Inc., filed with the North Carolina Utilities Commission.
EMPOWERment Inc. Executive Director Delores Bailey had expressed concern about the potential damage mold and mildew could cause to the 10-unit affordable housing complex while Duke Energy and the nonprofit work out differences about the meter.
  Delores Bailey (Photo: EMPOWERment Inc.)
On Friday, Bailey was hopeful that Duke and her organization will soon reach a permanent settlement about the single meter so that tenants can begin moving in August or September at the latest. EMPOWERment Inc., decided to use one meter for the entire apartment complex to accommodate rooftop solar panels and to reduce energy costs for low-income residents who would rent the apartments.
“Duke has set up the power on a single meter, which is what we asked in the complaint,” Bailey said.
Now that the power has been turned on, Bailey said EMPOWERment Inc.’s contractor, Focus Design Builders, can put the finishing touches on the project, which is more than 85% complete.
The remaining work consists mostly of “punch list” items such as making sure appliances are working and water is running properly, Bailey said. Outside, there is some landscaping and grading left to do, she added.
“They’ve (contractors) have got to come back and do a cleanup of the units and make them livable construction-wise,” Bailey said.
The disagreement between Duke and EMPOWERment Inc., stemmed from differing interpretations of a state law prohibiting master meters for electric and natural gas service in new residential buildings. One section of the law outlines an exception to the prohibition if the tenant and landlord agree in the lease that the cost of the electric service or natural gas service, or both, will be included in rental payments. North Carolina has generally required individual meters and service in tenants’ names for each unit in new residential building constructed on or after Sept. 1, 1977.
Bailey previously told NC Newsline that electric bills would be paid by tenants in monthly rent payments under lease agreements between the nonprofit and tenants. The amount charged would depend on the number of bedrooms in the apartment, she said.
Duke Energy told NC Newsline last week that it cannot comment on specific customers’ accounts. But did provide a statement in an email from spokesman Jeff Brooks:


        “Duke Energy service regulations, in compliance with North Carolina law, require residential units to have individual meters, no one master meter covering the entire building. These guidelines are in place to promote consistency in the quality and reliability of service to all customers.”    
 
Rewiring the units so that each has a meter would have cost the nonprofit about $86,000, Bailey said. “We don’t have that,” she said last week. It would take three-to-six months to receive the parts needed to rewire the apartments if the nonprofit decided to go that route, she said.
The Southern Environmental Law Center filed the complaint on behalf of the nonprofit.
EMPOWERment Inc., asked the state Utilities Commission for the following relief:

Require Duke connect electric service to EMPOWERment’s P.E.A.C.H. Apartments immediately, while the Commission considers this Emergency Complaint and Request for Declaratory Ruling, to prevent the risk of irreparable harm and health risks from the lack of essential electric service.
Order that Duke permit the use of “master” meters when the lease between landlord and tenant states that the cost of electric and/or gas utilities is included in rental payments, as set forth in G.S. § 143-151. 42(b)(2).
In the alternative, declare that a multifamily residential building is eligible to use a single “master” meter, with the Commission’s approval, when served by a solar array.
Require Duke to provide permanent electric service to the P.E.A.C.H. Apartments under the current single-meter configuration.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/PEACH-1024x647.jpeg,,,2025-06-21 05:59:46.770194

(Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)In its fiscal year 2026 budget, the Trump administration proposes to cut funding for the National Institutes of Health by almost 40%. That proposal, if enacted by Congress, would be nothing less than a wrecking ball for cancer research in the United States.
That makes no sense. Congress on a bipartisan basis has historically provided substantial financial support to the NIH and the National Cancer Institute for cancer research. That research is responsible for a 34% decrease in the cancer death rate in this country since 1991.
The proposed funding cut would have a devastating impact on cancer research. Clinical trials underway would be canceled, research programs terminated, and training programs for cancer researchers eliminated.
The cuts would harm cancer centers throughout the country, including the University of Kansas Cancer Center, which earned an NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center designation in 2022.
Given the extraordinary accomplishments of cancer research institutions in this country, there’s reason to hope that Congress will not implement cuts proposed by the Trump administration. But damage has already been done.
More than 770 NIH grants totaling $1.9 billion have been canceled. The NCI was ordered to cut its contracts budget. That cut will impact clinical trials, laboratory scientists, and laboratory equipment. The NCI Board of Scientific Advisors was disbanded. Steps have been taken to end the site visits at cancer centers that have promoted scientific collaboration.
The American Association for Cancer Research and the Association of American Cancer Institutes are taking the lead in educating the public and members of Congress about the impact the proposed budget cuts would have on cancer research. They recently conducted a “Hill Day” in Washington to do just that.
Cancer center delegations from throughout the United States participated. Directors of NCI-designated cancer centers attended in unprecedented numbers. The University of Kansas Cancer Center was represented by its director, Roy Jensen; Joaquina Baranda, the director of the center’s Early-Phase Clinical Trials program; and me. I had been designated a community advocate by the AACI for “Hill Day.”
These representatives told delegates that the NIH provided the resources for more than 64,000 active research projects at more than 2,500 institutions located in every state in the country. The NCI anchors a national cancer research network through 71 NCI-designated cancer centers located in 36 states.
Research projects supported by the NIH contributed to 354 of 356 new FDA-approved drugs in the last 10 years, ranging from cancer immunotherapies to mRNA vaccines. The NCI leads more than 1,300 cancer clinical trials each year, producing ground-breaking therapies and treatments.
Cancer center representatives spent the day sharing this information with members of Congress. That’s important because Congress will ultimately decide the fiscal year 2026 budget that’s sent to the president for his signature. Democrats and some Republicans in the Senate have already said that they will not support the budget approved by one vote in the House.
In conversations with senators and staff members, we were assured that the Senate would take a fresh look at the president’s budget proposal. Sen. Jerry Moran, who has been very supportive of the University of Kansas Cancer Center, asked good questions and remarked that he thought the Senate would take a hard look at budget cuts proposed for cancer research. He noted that the Senate has a history of bipartisan support for cancer research.
It was also apparent that many House members would welcome an opportunity to support cancer research in any budget that was ultimately sent by Congress to the president. Rep. Sharice Davids, who serves Kansas’ 3rd Congressional District, said she believed Congress should fully fund cancer research.
The Trump administration’s fiscal year 2026 budget proposal is an unprecedented threat to cancer research in the United States. But there’s a long way to go in the Congressional budget process. AACR/AACI representatives advised our elected officials that the NIH “costs about $138 per American per year and delivers returns in the form of longer lives, stronger communities, and global competitiveness.”
That’s a mighty powerful argument for not cutting cancer research funding.

(Photo by Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)A federal appeals court upheld the murder and racketeering convictions of three members of the international gang MS-13 for their role in the brutal 2019 killing of a 16-year-old in Prince George’s County.
A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected claims by Jose Domingo Ordonez-Zometa, Jose Henry Hernandez-Garcia and Jose Rafael Ortega-Ayala that evidence against them was improperly obtained by police and should have been suppressed. The court’s Tuesday ruling also rejected Hernandez-Garcia’s claim that he should have been granted a new trial.
The three men were convicted after an eight-day jury trial in U.S. District Court for Maryland, and each given life sentences in 2023.
Two of the defense attorneys could not be reached for comment Friday, while a third declined comment. Attorneys for the government also could not be reached for comment.
Court document say the case began on the night of March 8, 2019, when Ordonez-Zometa, the leader of “Los Ghettos Criminales Salvatruchas,” a branch of MS-13 in Maryland, summoned several members of the “clique” to his home in Hyattsville. He suspected that two gang members, both juveniles, were cooperating with police — something punishable only by death, under the gang’s rules.
When they arrived, Ordonez-Zometa began interrogating the two members on whether they had cooperated with law enforcement, which they denied.
“In fact, neither of the youths had cooperated with law enforcement,” Circuit Judge Robert B. King wrote for the court. “Instead, both had recent and brief interactions with police after running away from their homes.”
But convinced that one of the two had talked to police, and after speaking by phone with a senior MS-13 member in El Salvador, Ordonez-Zometa began to assault the 16-year-old, identified in court documents only as “John Doe,” beating him and cutting his face.

Eventually, Ordonez-Zometa had the teen brought to the basement, where he ordered Hernandez-Garcia, Ortega-Ayala and other gang members not named in the case to use “the glove” — a three-bladed weapon that can be affixed to the hand — to attack the teen while another gang member filmed on his cell phone. Each gang member took part in what King called the “brutal and horrific” attack.
The teen suffered 144 wounds and “died from those injuries in Ordonez-Zometa’s basement, at just 16 years of age,” King wrote.
Ordonez-Zometa directed Hernandez-Garcia and another gang member to clean the murder scene and dispose of blood-stained carpeting. The teen’s body was shoved in the trunk of Ordonez-Zometa’s wife’s Nissan Altima, which Ortega-Ayala and two others drove to Stafford County, Virginia, where they dumped the body and set it alight using gasoline.
When a Stafford County Sheriff’s deputy discovered the burning remains, the body was unidentifiable. But police were able to circulate a photo of a tattoo on the teen’s body that the boy’s mother identified as her son’s. She gave police the names of others who were with her son before his death, which eventually led to the three defendants.
By March 13, Stafford County officials had provided Prince George’s County police with a photo of Ordonez-Zometa and advised them to be on the lookout for a gold Nissan with a black hood. When police saw Ordonez-Zometa come out of his Hyattsville house and get into the Nissan, they pulled it over for failing to signal a turn, then arrested him.
Ordonez-Zometa argued at trial that police did not have probable cause to stop the Nissan. But U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis disagreed and allowed the evidence, and the appeals court upheld that decision Tuesday.
Officers “watched a man who matched the photograph of Ordonez-Zometa leave a residence suspected to be the murder scene, get into a car matching the description of one tied to the Doe murder, and drive away,” King wrote. “That was certainly enough to justify the traffic stop.”
Even though he waived his Miranda rights, Ordonez-Zometa also argued that statements he made during his initial interrogation were involuntary, and given due to “coercive interrogation tactics.” He said he was worried about family members, who were in the car with him but being held in a separate room, and about a detective’s statement that his silence could be used against him in court.
The trial court called the detective’s statement “unfortunate and plainly incorrect.” But the courts found that none of those factors “overbore” the defendant’s will to make a statement, which was thus voluntary and admissible.
“Neither uncomfortable circumstances nor a misstep by law enforcement will render a statement involuntary,” King wrote. Even if it was, he said, the weight of other evidence presented by the state would have been enough to convict Ordonez-Zometa without his statements.
“Two former gang members confirmed that he ordered the killing of John Doe, arranged its logistics, directed others to dispose of Doe’s body, and oversaw the cleanup,” King wrote. “Moreover, forensic evidence from the Nissan vehicle corroborated key aspects of those witnesses’ accounts. The trial evidence thus provided the jury with ample grounds for conviction, entirely apart from the contested statements.”
Ortega-Ayala argued that search warrants for his Facebook account, home and cell phone were overly broad, but the appellate judges said the warrants were “particularized and specific.”
As for Hernandez-Garcia’s appeal of Xinis’ decision to deny him a new trial, King wrote that there was no “serious miscarriage of justice” that would merit a new trial.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/federalappealscourt-richmond-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-06-21 01:58:52.047453

“Unfortunately this is not an isolated incident,” she said in a statement, adding that ICE agents are facing a surge in assaults against them.
On June 18, Omaha-based agents with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Homeland Security Investigations led an operation to arrest Hurtado-Cariaco. An ICE spokeswoman said agents conducted a traffic stop and Hurtado-Cariaco allegedly launched an attack on a special agent. 
Hurtado-Cariaco allegedly “threw the ICE agent to the ground, slammed her head into the pavement, ripped off her body armor, and made repeated and physical violent contact,” said the Homeland Security statement.
He fled the scene, but federal agents apprehended him about an hour later in the same area.
The agent sustained injuries to her head and arm and was transported to the University of Nebraska Medical Center. She has since been released and is recovering. Hurtado-Cariaco also allegedly assaulted an FBI agent during the incident.
Federal officials said that Hurtado-Cariaco entered the U.S. illegally in 2023, and was removed by Border Patrol. It said that he re-entered illegally the following year and was released into the country with a notice to appear.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-21 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Trump has no queer pride,John D. Allen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/21/trump-has-no-queer-pride/,The message from the Trump administration: queer people are not welcomed in the United States.,"My husband and I traveled to Washington D.C. to attend World Pride 2025, which coincided with DC’s 50th anniversary of Capitol Pride the first weekend of June. It was in a word – amazing!
We loved being with so many queer people unanimous in being visible and challenging the unbridled homophobia and transphobia heaped on the queer community by the current president, his administration, and many of his followers. We were awed by the sheer number of people from around the world, partied, laughed, and felt rejuvenated by sharing this experience with so many of our queer brothers and sisters.
We were prepared to expect little support from the Trump administration for the anticipated three million visitors for World Pride, yet still surprised for just how petty were the slights directed at our community.
There was a total absence of any events involving anything federal. There were no governmental affinity groups in the parade, no events held on the National Mall or any of the city’s federal grounds, and a month of events had to be moved from the nation’s premiere performing arts halls – the Kennedy Center.
However, most troubling was the closing and mesh-fence barricading of Dupont Circle – ground zero for DC’s queer neighborhood which occurred just before the festival’s largest event, the Saturday, June 7 parade. The excuse conjured by the National Parks Service about protecting the fountain was typical nonsense from administrators who regale in being cruel. Make no mistake, this was done purely for spite.
If any of my queer brothers, sisters, and allies ever had a doubt that queer rights and progress were under attack, this picayune action on the day before the largest queer gathering anywhere in the world during 2025 was designed to send a message to LGBTQ+ people around the world. The message received from closing this sacred queer space was that queer people are not welcomed in the United States. Your community will be removed from social venues. Your rituals and celebrations will be denigrated. Your artistic achievements will be dismissed. Your history will be erased, and more.
During June Pride month and going forward while enduring this administration, this is a time for visibility. The way these slights and inordinate number of hateful laws being perpetrated against the LGBTQ+ community around the country and yes, even in queer-friendly Connecticut, can be countered through each queer person’s secret power – which is to come out.
Be open, yet safe, in the reveal. Attend high-visibility Pride parades and festivals. Write letters to elected officials and business leaders praising their support or condemning their cowardice. Donate to organizations on the front lines fighting against authoritarianism. Educate friends and family that queer people have always been part of the human experience.
The queer community, with its disparate constituencies, becomes more powerful by banding together and employing the power of our collective resources and talents to counteract discrimination. While it is tiresome having to continually deal with bullies, especially one with such power, the challenge facing the queer community is now a moment as significant as Stonewall – the very reason for June Pride. 
On this journey for full equality, Stonewall’s legacy still resonates that a good way to stop a bully is to fight back.

This week, however, the Omahan was picked up at his job of more than 20 years by Douglas County officials who told him he was wanted on a “hold” by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Valentine spent the next two nights in the county jail. On Friday, a day after his attorney sent the jail proof of his U.S. citizenship, he was released.
Valentine said he kept telling himself the ICE hold had to be a mistake, but at the same time he had a worrisome thought that he could wind up in a country he hadn’t stepped in for five decades. 
He had recently been convicted for a felony third-offense DUI, and he was approved for a house arrest with allowance to go to work.
“I was like, well, maybe something about the law changed,” Valentine said, recounting his thoughts while in jail. “I’ve been here for 49 years, I don’t know anything else. If they did deport me, I don’t even speak Spanish.”
 New fuel to enforcement tensions

While Valentine was let go from jail to resume a 60-day house arrest and three years probation for the non-immigration-related offense, the situation adds a different fuel to escalating tensions over ramped-up immigration enforcement in Nebraska and elsewhere.
“It never occurred to me that something like this could happen,” said his attorney Ashley Albertsen, who added that the ICE hold caused “unnecessary” distress and an interruption of Valentine’s job.
Family friend and Omaha criminal defense attorney Yvonne Sosa, who learned about Valentine’s immigration hold, said she found it scary. 
The Trump administration reportedly has demanded that ICE make 3,000 immigration-related arrests a day, and the president more recently directed ICE officers to “do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History.”

Said Sosa: “I am used to a system where there are checks and balances and people are required to check and double check their work. It doesn’t seem like that is happening, and it is to the detriment of citizens — so I am scared.”
Sosa reflected on the recent circumstances of a Guatemalan worker at a west Omaha Early Bird restaurant. 
In that case, an immigration official reportedly told a TV station that agents had been looking for a Guatemalan national who had a final immigration order of removal and saw someone matching his description. 
The agents followed the man, who turned out not to be the original target but allegedly resisted arrest. A video of that man being handcuffed on the ground in front of patrons was widely circulated on social media, prompting new Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. to say: “That’s not the way we want to do law enforcement in Omaha, Nebraska.”
The Early Bird suspect, Romeo Edilzar Yaxcal-Tiul, has been charged in a federal indictment with three counts, including use of a Social Security number not assigned to him and resisting arrest.
 Reason for detainer unclear 

Of the Valentine situation, Albertsen and others wondered how law enforcement information got crossed up to the point that he was handcuffed at his worksite and left to spend two nights in jail not knowing more details. 
Valentine said he asked early on to speak to an immigration enforcement official and noted on a form he was asked to fill out that he was an American citizen.

“I never got to talk to anybody from ICE, and ICE never apologized,” he said.  
A Douglas County spokeswoman said ICE had contacted the county on Wednesday — the same day Valentine was picked up at his job —  requesting that a detainer be placed on him. 
ICE contacted Douglas County Corrections again the next evening, Thursday, requesting that the detainer be removed, the county spokeswoman said. Thursday was a federal holiday, Juneteenth. Valentine spent that night in jail.
A spokeswoman for ICE, responding to a request from the Examiner, said key people privy to information about the situation were not available Friday. It is unclear exactly why the ICE detainer was placed on Valentine. But the federal spokeswoman said it was based on “information gleaned from local law enforcement.” 
 Court records, interviews 

Here’s what happened leading up to that point, according to court records and interviews with Valentine and his father.
Valentine has struggled with an alcohol problem, he and his dad said. In August 2024, he was arrested for the third offense DUI. The first charge had come more than a decade ago, the more recent two came as Valentine pushed through a condition called psoriatic arthritis that Valentine said caused him pain to walk up stairs or tie his shoes. He now takes medication for the condition.
“But he loves to work,” said dad, Walt Valentine, who said his son “religiously” followed the court’s orders so that he could continue working pending his sentencing. 
In the months following the August arrest, Valentine’s attorney said he went to counseling, Alcoholics Anonymous and reported to county officials frequent breathalyzer results showing he was not drinking.
On Tuesday, June 17, following a “joint recommendation” by the prosecution and defense, Valentine was sentenced to three years of supervised probation that called for the first 60 days in jail, continued AA meetings, a seven-year revocation of a driver’s license and a fine. 
The day after being jailed, a judge signed off on an order approving house arrest for the 60 days and released him.
Valentine had lunch with his dad and reported to work that same afternoon, until he was called to a guard’s station. Valentine said he figured it was a routine check by work release officials and was surprised when the county corrections representatives told him he was wanted on an ”ICE hold.”
He said the men who summoned him from his work seemed apologetic. 
 Work flow disruption

Valentine’s dad said his wife, Linda, was more upset about what happened to their son than him. He said he figured it would get sorted out eventually and that their son, who lives with them, could not truly be an ICE target. He said he’s more troubled about friends and neighbors that have little to no recourse from deportation.
“Families are being broken up, people are skipping work and school because they are afraid,” said Walt Valentine.
At work, manager Mark Wright said Valentine’s apprehension caused a disruption, as he leads a crew of about eight in the shipping and receiving area of Skylark Meats. “He’s an important piece of our daily operations, everybody likes Domingo.”
Wright said the incident “strikes fear” in other people who are “rightfully here.”
For Domingo Valentine, he said he is looking forward to completing probation, working on his health and making up for two days of lost pay.
 “I do feel that if you have brown skin you might have to be a little more wary,” he said. “If this could happen to me, it could happen to almost anybody.”

John James (R- Shelby Township) promised increased security on the country’s northern border at a talk Friday in Detroit.
Noem claimed in the discussion panel, organized by the conservative group America’s Future Tour, that “many” transnational gang members are crossing into the country via the northern border after the southern border had experienced increased security since President Donald Trump took office. 
Noem warned conservative allies that undocumented immigrants could enter by land, sea or road border crossings like the Ambassador Bridge in Detroit. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“When we seal secure areas where criminals may want to cross, they will find new areas,” Noem said. 
Noem said she had met with people across the country who are “seeing so many resources going to the southern border that they felt concerned we are forgetting about the northern border.” Noem claims Canada to be floundering on border security and allowing drug traffickers and human smugglers access to the U.S.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or  CBP, logs “encounters” in its system whenever it comes across an individual who is either not allowed to enter the U.S. or has crossed the border illegally at a location other than an official entry point. Illegal crossings at the US-Canada border make up less than 0.5% of the almost 3 million encounters reported nationwide according to CBP data. 
Undocumented migrants also commit far fewer crimes that American citizens, with peer-reviewed studies reporting that U.S.-born citizens are over two times more likely to be arrested for violent crimes and four times more likely to be arrested for property crime. 
State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak), a candidate for U.S. Senate, spoke Friday evening at a campaign event in Ferndale and told Michigan Advance that the Trump administration’s policies were nothing more than “security theater” and not truly enhancing the safety of the nation.
“They are going after anybody and everybody from kids to moms who are trying to immigrate the right way to a kid here in Michigan who was three credits away from graduation, in a way that is scaring anybody from wanting to come across the border,” McMorrow said. “It’s not actually any thoughtful or tactical plans to improve the border and security. It’s just whatever they can put on social media to generate clicks.”

The America’s Future Tour panel comes amid a backdrop of growing protests across the country against the Trump administration’s hardline approach to migration. The Los Angeles migrant rights protest, which saw journalists and protestors shot with rubber bullets and doused in tear gas, has become a flashpoint in the migration debate after the Trump administration deployed the National Guard. 
During Noem’s panel discussion, the LA Press Club and investigative news site Status Coup announced a lawsuit over what they allege to be the “targeting” of journalists by DHS during coverage of the LA protests.
The lawsuit accuses DHS officers of “unnecessarily and indiscriminately” using less-lethal ammunition against reporters, protesters and legal observers during the LA demonstrations. 
Livingston County Sheriff Mike Murphy, a noted Trump ally who was part of the panel, affirmed Noem’s claims.
“[T]he amount of stuff that is coming in, illegals and other stuff from the northern border, is just going to continue until we tighten things up there,” Murphy said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC_3635-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-20 22:58:05.372157

Wes Moore cited a number of reasons for vetoing a bill that would have created a reparations commission, but none of them hold up to scrutiny, writes Ronald Stubblefield, who said a reparations commission is still badly needed.","Protesters outside the State House rally on May 20 against Gov. Wes Moore's (D) veto of the Reparations Commission bill, and demanding legislators override it. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Maryland Gov. Wes Moore’s recent veto of legislation that would have created a commission to study reparations was more than a routine exercise of political discretion. It was a failure of moral leadership.
As someone who has advised federal, state, and local agencies across the country in economic development, I recognize the complexities of governance. But leadership demands more than complexity management. It demands courage.
The proposed commission wouldn’t have authorized payments. It would have simply studied the long arc of economic exclusion and racial harm in Maryland — and explored policy responses grounded in that history. If we can study broadband, infrastructure, or water systems, we can certainly study the cumulative impact of slavery and state-sanctioned racism. Even if direct payment isn’t the outcome, justice requires we understand the full cost of the harm. The idea that even that step was too much to pursue is troubling.
Before we examine Gov. Moore’s rationale, we must clarify a deeper issue: Many of the racial equity initiatives currently prioritized by state and local governments are forward-looking — aimed at stopping future harm. But reparations are about addressing past harm. The legacy of slavery, forced breeding, Jim Crow segregation, housing discrimination, underfunded HBCUs and decades of police violence require targeted, historically grounded solutions.

Maryland’s history also includes the ongoing desecration of Black cemeteries, such as Moses African Cemetery, where community advocates continue to fight for dignity in death. A study commission is a basic and necessary first step in reckoning with this history.
Moore cited these main reasons for his veto:
Black representation. Moore suggested that strong Black leadership in government is itself progress. But representation is not redress. Speaker Adrienne A. Jones, referencing her own family’s role in Brown v. Board of Education, reminded us that symbolic milestones don’t erase structural injustice.
Duplication of equity efforts. Moore argued a commission would duplicate other equity initiatives. But studying reparations is not a distraction — it is a policy tool. We can and should applaud policies that expand opportunity. But we must also demand remedies that repair past harm. The two are not mutually exclusive — they are morally co-dependent.
Bad timing. Moore suggested the political climate wasn’t right. But leadership means shaping moments, not waiting for them. Cities like Evanston, Illinois, and states like California have shown the value of bold, principled action.
Policy substitutes. Moore pointed to his economic mobility, housing, and education policies. These are important, but they are not reparations. They don’t redress generational theft of Black wealth through redlining, displacement or the underfunding of HBCUs. Nor do they address the destruction of cultural assets like Black cemeteries or health disparities from underfunded hospitals. These initiatives look to the future. Reparations confront the past.
Past commissions. Moore cited previous commissions — like the Maryland Lynching Truth and Reconciliation Commission — as grounds to reject the new bill. But those commissions were limited in scope. They did not calculate cumulative economic harm or propose direct redress. The deep racial wealth disparities that persist today — such as the fact that the median Black household in Maryland holds just 12 cents of wealth for every dollar held by white households, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research — are not accidental. This wealth gap is not an abstract inequity; it is the measurable result of government-sanctioned dispossession, from slavery and redlining to exclusion from labor protections and unequal access to capital.
Reparations are not about closing general equity gaps — they are about confronting and repairing the specific harm caused by government policy over generations.
The Maryland General Assembly should reconsider this bill. Communities across the state deserve a formal, statewide commission with the authority and mandate to propose structural redress.
Moore’s rise is inseparable from the history he just sidelined. By vetoing the commission, he signaled that symbolic progress is enough. But real leadership confronts history — and builds a future from its lessons. We need leaders who choose transparency over optics and courage over convenience.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Reparations-rally-5-20-2025-1024x664.jpg,,,2025-06-20 22:58:05.372157

After a series of failed attempts to weaken and strengthen a proposed limit on assault-style weapons, a ban on sales and manufacturing — but not possession —  ultimately prevailed.
True to form, lawmakers found plenty more to debate and discuss over the marathon day that stretched late into the evening. 
As the sun went down, the temperature inside the airless second-floor chambers seemed to rise. On what was the first full day of summer, lawmakers quenched their thirst with Del’s frozen lemonade and an endless carousel of caffeinated beverages.

Senate softens state’s aim on assault weapons 
You can still own an assault-style weapon in Rhode Island, but you will have to cross state lines to buy or sell it. That’s the gist of the legislation approved by both chambers in an eleventh-hour rework aimed at appeasing at least some of its critics.
The rewrite was led by the Senate, which kicked off its marathon session with an hour-long debate, culminating in a 25-11 vote, to approve the bill banning the manufacture and sale of semi-automatic rifles, shotguns, and handguns with military-style features beginning July 1, 2026. It does not address inheritance of these weapons.
“The expectation over time is the proliferation of assault-style weapons, as specified in the bill, will go down,” Sen. Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat and bill sponsor, said. “We need to get this done today.”
The Senate’s checkmate forced the House, which had already approved a more restrictive version that also banned possession, to reconsider. The lower chamber eventually caved to the Senate’s less stringent counterpart by a 43-28 vote just before 9:30 p.m.
The House’s vote came after a nearly two-hour break likely marked by behind-the-scenes negotiations, and an additional, five-minute recess for representatives to familiarize themselves with the Senate’s changes.
“This bill cuts off the supply of weapons of war for the long haul at the point of sale,” Rep. Jennifer Boylan, a Barrington Democrat and gun safety advocate, said.

Rep. Jason Knight, a Barrington Democrat, also backed the Senate version, despite its significant changes from the more sweeping ban he had successfully advanced through the House chamber already.
“The two bills in their effect on the ground are closer to each other than you think,” Knight said, noting that the difficulty in procuring a new assault-style weapon even in other states prevents expansion of the “universe” of such weapons in Rhode Island.
Yet, the compromise was met with some dissatisfaction from both sides. The Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence had denounced the “watering down” of what had been a much more sweeping ban on assault-style weapons. 
Sen. Pamela Lauria, a Barrington Democrat, sought to amend DiPalma’s bill to mirror the House version, despite the Senate Committee on Judiciary opting to hold the stronger option for further study on Wednesday. 
“As we look to pass critical legislation regarding assault weapons, we should have taken the opportunity to pass the best version of this bill,” Lauria said.
But after Senate Republicans, along with Ciccone, raised objections, Senate President Valarie Lawson ruled that Lauria was out of order.
Republicans, along with some conservative Democrats, and gun rights groups maintained that no ban at all was the answer. All four Senate Republicans, plus some conservative Democrats, voted against the ban on the manufacture and sale of assault-style weapons.

Across the rotunda, Cranston Rep. Charlene Lima, a conservative Democrat, also denounced the compromise bill for going too far. Her critiques were met with raucous applause from yellow T-shirt-wearing Second Amendment supporters seated in the gallery. House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi issued a stern rebuke, noting the seriousness of the topic before them.
“We will not have interruptions,” Shekarchi told onlookers. “If there is another uproar, I will close the gallery and you can watch on TV.”
Despite the warning, gun rights advocates booed after the House passed the amended bill.
The final version drew support from Everytown for Gun Safety, which maintained the language still covers the majority of the assault-style weapons frequently used in mass shootings. The Rhode Island AFL-CIO, a strong supporter of Lawson, also backed the proposal in a statement Thursday pointing to the union’s February poll that found 64% of residents support “banning the sale and manufacture of military-style assault weapons” in the state. 
Gov. Dan McKee, who had posed the weapons ban as a budget issue earlier in the year, confirmed via social media he will sign the measure into law.
“I’m proud that Rhode Island took an important step forward in protecting our communities from gun violence,” he posted to X at 9:50 p.m.
Clearing the air in R.I.’s two casinos
Bally’s two Rhode Island casinos will be slightly less smoky starting in 2027 — 18 months later than its advocates wanted.
The delayed start combined with a second, late-in-the-session clawback prompted longtime advocate and sponsor Rep. Teresa Tanzi to withdraw her name from her own bill after the opposite chamber added a carveout for smoking bars within casinos. Tanzi was one of four Democratic representatives to vote against the bill she introduced, though it prevailed with 67 supporters in the House Friday.
Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, railed against the revised proposal, declaring it was “nothing like” her original, which had called for the smoking ban to start July 1, 2025, with no exceptions.
Rather than banning smoking in Bally’s Corp.’s Lincoln and Tiverton casinos altogether, the amended legislation adds an exemption for smoking lounges with a new, hazy definition, Tanzi argued.
“This does not prevent Bally’s from expanding cigarette smoking or cigar smoking or vaping or, I don’t know, cannabis,” Tanzi said. “It’s really not clear to me what this new definition is because there’s all of a sudden a brand-new definition about smoking lounges.”

Existing state law defines “smoking bars” as businesses where tobacco sales are greater than 50% of its total revenue. The amended version offers new meaning for a – “pari mutual facility smoking lounge,” defined as any kind of smoking bar with a “proper ventilation system” that will “prevent the migration of smoke to nonsmoking areas.”
In Tanzi’s interpretation, that means any walled-off section of the casino floors could remain a smokers’ paradise.
The Senate already approved the modified smoking ban under a unanimous vote Wednesday. Though Sen. V. Susan Sosnowski sponsored her chamber’s version, Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone brokered the compromised legislation after initially seeking to reach an agreement between Bally’s and union leaders to expand existing nonsmoking areas at the Lincoln facility. 
Bally’s Corp. officials had opposed the proposed smoking ban, citing a potential annual revenue loss of $30 million to $60 million. Company spokesperson Patti Doyle thanked legislators for the compromise.
“Confining smoking to an existing smoking lounge at our Lincoln venue and allowing for a delayed transition away from smoking on the gaming floor will hopefully mitigate a portion of that anticipated revenue loss to the state,” Doyle said in a statement late Friday.
Union workers who for years have decried the health consequences of smoke-filled working conditions reluctantly agreed to the compromise version as “the best we could get,” Tanzi said Friday. However, the union wants to revisit the topic when lawmakers reconvene, either in a possible fall session in October or when it starts its next regular session in January, Tanzi said.
“I had a lot more faith in our legislators,” Vanessa Baker, an iGaming manager at Bally’s Twin River Casino in Lincoln, said in a phone interview Friday. “I thought they thought we were people.”
15th time’s a charm on payday lending reform
Cracking down on predatory payday lending practices drew strong support in the Rhode Island Senate Friday. The 27-6 vote came swiftly and with little debate — a stark contrast to the 15-year battle to move the legislation out of committee to the chamber for a vote.
Having already passed in the House with unanimous support Monday, the Senate’s endorsement sets the stage for the long-awaited end to triple digit interest rates on short-term, small-dollar loans — though not as soon as some advocates had hoped. A last-minute revision delayed the start date till January 2027 in an effort to give time to the “deferred deposit providers” like Advance America to wind down operations, and for their employees to find new jobs.
Under existing law, these storefront lenders had been able to take advantage of a loophole in state law to charge an annual percentage rate up to 360%. The legislation caps the annual interest and fees at no more than 36%, mirroring policies already adopted by 22 states and the federal government.
Kicking the can on a bottle bill
Rather than start prescribing specifics of a deposit-refund program for recyclable bottles, glasses and cans, both chambers approved a modified bottle bill Friday that advances only a small component of the original calling for yet another study of the policy. 
The 53-11 and 36-0 votes in the House and Senate, respectively, came with reluctant support from Democratic backers who blamed opposing retailers and beverage manufacturers for mounting a misinformation-laden opposition campaign.
“There is still a great deal of conflicting data as to the implementation of best practices to address the problems of improving and disposing of our recyclable products, as well as enhancing our anti-littering efforts,” Shekarchi said in a statement earlier this week.
Rep. Carol McEntee, a South Kingstown Democrat and bill sponsor, also expressed disappointment, stating outright that the watered-down version is not a bottle bill at all, calling just for a series of studies.
Instead, the legislation calls for a “statewide implementation analysis” to be conducted by a third-party consultant hired by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. The study would now be due no later than Dec. 1, 2026, with an interim status report due April 1, 2026. The state-hired consultant would consider the conclusions drawn by an 18-month legislative study commission, and the original bottle bills.
McEntee, who co-chaired the prior study commission, has already indicated she’s planning to introduce a full-fledged bottle bill again next session, even though the state analysis will not be finished yet.
CRMC membership changes on the horizon
Change is coming to the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council, though not the sweeping reform advocates wanted. Rather than abolishing the politically appointed council and reshaping the agency as an administrative authority, lawmakers in both chambers narrowly agreed to a more modest update.
The bills, approved by 49-19 and 25-10 votes in the House and Senate, respectively, Friday, reduce the size of the council from 10 to seven members, simultaneously shrinking the quorum requirement in a nod to the vacancy issues that have plagued the existing panel. And it adds new professional qualifications for the powerful coastal regulatory body, specifically requiring an engineer, a coastal biologist and an environmental organization representative to sit on the new council. 
The existing council does not have any expertise requirements, though members must represent a variety of municipalities based on size and coastal proximity.
How fast the refresh occurs depends largely on how fast new candidates can be found; the legislation calls for Gov. Dan McKee to name six appointees (the seventh is designated as a DEM representative) no later than March 1, 2026. But the bill also says existing members can continue to serve until their replacements are named.
Progressive Democrats and Republicans joined in opposition, with the former insisting the membership changes fell too far short of more comprehensive reforms needed.
Legislators reprimand McKee with anti-bid rigging bill
McKee just can’t seem to escape the stain left by a 2021 state education contract scandal, with an anti bid-rigging bill included on the legislature’s final calendar of the session.
The Rhode Island Senate’s unanimous approval Friday, following passage in the House two days prior, aims to close a loophole in state procurement law by expressly forbidding public officials and administrators from intentionally interfering with the process by which the state awards competitive contracts to outside vendors. 
The need for specificity was laid bare by an investigation by Attorney General Peter Neronha’s office and Rhode Island State Police into a state education contract awarded to the ILO Group. State investigators ultimately found insufficient evidence to charge McKee for steering the $5.2 million school reopening contract to one of his former adviser’s friends — in part because there was nothing in state law saying that he could not.
The newly approved legislation, however, imposes strict penalties on state officials and vendors who participate in future collusion or bid-rigging activities: a felony charge punishable by up to three years in prison and a $1 million fine (or three times the value of the contract, whichever is greater). Vendors found to have participated in bid-rigging or steering activities are also no longer able to perform work for the state for up to five years.
McKee still needs to sign the legislation for it to become law — uncertain given documented attempts by his aides to dismantle the bill earlier in the session. McKee’s office did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment later Friday.
Opposition couldn’t break levy bill
The General Assembly OK’d Providence Mayor Brett Smiley’s request to exceed the state’s annual 4% tax levy cap, clearing the way for a 7.5% increase in the amount of property taxes the city can collect in fiscal year 2026.
Providence Democrats Rep. Rebecca Kislak and Sen. Sam Zurier introduced the bound-to-be unpopular bill in their respective chambers. 
The House was the first to grant the city’s wish, passing Kislak’s bill in a 56-17 vote on May 27. The Senate passed Zurier’s version 30-7 on Wednesday. On Friday night, each chamber voted to concur with the other’s version of the bill, finalizing its passage out of the State House and toward McKee’s desk.
In the House, Zurier’s bill passed 57-14, with opposition from all 10 Republicans plus four Democrats, including Providence Reps. Enrique Sanchez and David Morales. In the Senate, Kislak’s bill passed 27-7, with Providence Democratic Sens. Sam Bell, Tiara Mack and Ana Quezada expressing disapproval similar to their House colleagues.
The extra revenue from the tweaked levy cap is meant to help resolve a budget shortfall introduced last November by a $15 million settlement between the city and the state’s education department over Providence’s public schools. The mayor, with the Providence City Council’s somewhat reluctant approval, has been counting on the levy measure as the critical piece in the city’s fiscal 2026 budget. While the mayor’s budget technically lowers property tax rates, new property valuations mean many homeowners will still see higher tax bills.   
WPRI-12 reported Wednesday that Smiley has asked McKee to sign the legislation as soon as it arrives on his desk. But even with the General Assembly’s blessing, it’s not clear if the added tax revenue will arrive in time to shore up the city’s fiscal 2026 budget, Smiley told the news station. 
Kratom clears Senate
For the second year in a row, a bill to regulate the psychoactive drug known as kratom arrived at the final night of the legislative session. Unlike last year, when the bill provoked a fierce debate in the Senate, it sailed through the chamber with a 22-9 vote.
The House version encountered more vigorous resistance when it went up for a floor vote on May 29. It passed 40-24, with a mix of Republicans, Democrats and one independent lawmaker decrying easier access to the plant-derived drug, which can be used as an opioid substitute or a stimulant.  
The bill was sponsored by Rep. Brian Patrick Kennedy, a Westerly Democrat, and Sen. Hanna Gallo, a Cranston Democrat, with the intent of bringing kratom — a product already available in gray markets like gas stations or head shops — into the sphere of regulation and taxation. This year’s bill is 25 pages, compared to last year’s six, and it would mandate strict labeling, testing, and age restrictions around kratom commerce, as well as limitations on what products could be sold mixed with kratom.
Last year,McKee vetoed the legislation — an outcome sponsors tried to avoid this year by working with the governor and the state health department to craft a more agreeable bill.

(Courtesy of U.S. Navy, Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Janweb B. Lagazo)LINCOLN —  As President Donald Trump decides whether the U.S. will play a larger role in the decades-long conflict between Israel and Iran, the Nebraska federal delegation says it will support whatever the president decides. 
Israel launched an attack last week with aerial attacks in Iran’s capital targeting its nuclear and military infrastructure. Since then, Israel and Iran have continued to exchange bomb strikes with no end in sight. 
Israel has asked the Trump administration to broaden U.S. involvement in the war to eliminate Iran’s nuclear program. The Nebraska federal delegation says they support Trump’s handling of the conflict and that Iran can’t have a nuclear weapon, though there’s no public evidence that Iran is currently building one. U.S. intelligence officials have said Iran could shift toward producing a nuclear weapon.
Unlike other federal lawmakers and some prominent populist pundits, the delegation hasn’t joined in the Republican rift between isolationists and the more hawkish wings of the Trump coalition. 
Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District Rep. Don Bacon hinted at a preference as he told the Nebraska Examiner, “It is preferable for us to stay out of the offensive operations over Iran and reduce risk of escalation.” 
Bacon said it depends on whether Iran stops its “nuclear weapons program” and whether Israeli forces can destroy the country’s nuclear facilities on their own. 
The reason Israeli officials are lobbying for more U.S. involvement is because only the U.S. has the military capacity to destroy more of Iran’s nuclear program with its 30,000-pound bombs – often referred to as “bunker busters.” 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that his country has the capability to achieve its goals alone.
“We may have no other choice than to finish the job,” Bacon said. “A nuclear-armed Iran is a dire threat to America and our allies.”
After days of speculation and conflicting reporting, White House’s Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump would decide over the next two weeks whether the U.S. will strike Iran. Leavitt also told reporters that Iran “has never been closer to a nuclear weapon.” 
“Iran has all that it needs to achieve a nuclear weapon … All they need is a decision from the supreme leader to do that, and it would take a couple of weeks to complete the production of that weapon,” Leavitt said. 
In March, the U.S. intelligence community said Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, according to the Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard. Trump dismissed her comments this week, saying he doesn’t “care what she thinks” and believes Iran is “very close to having one.” 
U.S. Rep Mike Flood, R-Neb., who represents eastern Nebraska’s 1st District, said he supports Trump on this “significant decision,” because he has access to intel that could help inform America’s strategy in the conflict. 
“We must ensure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon,” Flood said. 
U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, who represents Nebraska’s largely rural 3rd District, said, “If Iran’s nuclear ambitions were realized, it would be catastrophic for both Israel and the United States.” 
Because of recent developments in the conflict, U.S. intelligence officials have said Iran could shift toward producing a nuclear weapon if the U.S. attacked its central nuclear facility or if Israel killed the nation’s supreme leader. But it would take months, not days — as Israel’s intelligence claims — to make a weapon. 
U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts told Fox News earlier this week that Trump would “absolutely” have his support to use military action if negotiations failed. 
Ricketts also told reporters Wednesday that the decision should be Trump’s. 
U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer said the U.S. “must continue to stand strong with Israel as [it works] to ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon.”
Even Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen released a video on social media emphasizing that “it is imperative for global peace that Iran never possesses a nuclear weapon,” and he had to cancel a scheduled trip to Israel because of the renewed conflict. 
The possible threat of an autocrat having access to a weapon of mass destruction could lead to the widening of another foreign war, like the precursor to the invasion of Iraq over two decades ago. The newly established two-week timeline from the White House gives more time for diplomacy as Europe makes a late push to de-escalate the conflict.



Statements from the Nebraska delegation 
“I fully support our defensive operations helping Israelis shoot down Iranian missiles and drones. I also support Israel’s actions to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons that would threaten all of us. It is preferable for us to stay out of the offensive operations over Iran and reduce risk of escalation. But if it turns out that only our bunker-busting bombs can destroy the deep underground nuclear facilities and that Iran refuses to stop its nuclear weapons program, then we may have no other choice then to finish the job. A nuclear-armed Iran is a dire threat to America and our allies.” – U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb.
“We must be clear-eyed about the threat posed by Iran and adversaries globally and on the home front … I am grateful President Trump and negotiators from his administration have been robustly engaged in neutralizing Iran’s nuclear program and Iran’s funding for its allied enemies of Israel. If Iran’s nuclear ambitions were realized, it would be catastrophic for both Israel and the United States, who their leaders have sworn to destroy.” – U.S. Rep. Adrian Smith, R-Neb., from a recent column
“I support President Trump as he weighs this significant decision. He has access to intel that will help inform America’s strategy — we must ensure that Iran never gets a nuclear weapon.” — U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, R-Neb.
“As President Trump weighs all options on the table, we must continue to stand strong with Israel as they work to ensure that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon.” — U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb.
“We cannot allow Iran to have an enrichment program or to be able to get a nuclear bomb and Iran was just using the same old tactics of delaying the peace talks,” — U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb.

(Video screenshot)Members of the House Judiciary Committee held an unusual summer hearing on Friday to investigate the conduct of the Alaska Department of Corrections and the state’s decision to take temporary custody of more than 40 immigrant detainees formerly housed in Washington state.
Protests have taken place almost daily outside the Anchorage Correctional Center, which is holding the detainees. 
During a two-hour committee meeting, legislators asked tough questions of Jen Winkelman, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Corrections.
“It’s a very unique situation,” Winkelman said.
She said the federal detention center in Tacoma, Washington, is “bursting at the seams” and that a local Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agent asked if the Anchorage Correctional Center was available.
“We looked at our … current population and said yes in an effort to be a good partner,” she said.
Since the inauguration of President Donald Trump and the start of his second term in office, the number of people being detained by ICE has surged.
The number of people detained for non-criminal reasons has grown even faster than the rate of detentions overall: Before Trump took office, about 1 in 16 ICE detainees had no criminal charges or convictions. Now, the ratio is 1 in 4. 
ICE has used aggressive and at-times violent tactics to make arrests, which has sparked protests against the agency.
The surge has also caused ICE to look across the country for available prison space, and the agency has turned to for-profit prisons and other unusual places.
Alaska does not have a federal prison, and the state has no for-profit prisons, but it does have long-standing contracts with federal agencies.
Traditionally, those contracts have resulted in the state temporarily housing federal inmates until they can be moved to federal facilities outside the state. 
But in June, the state’s contract with ICE worked almost in reverse, as 41 people were brought from the federal detention facility in Tacoma to the Anchorage Correctional Complex.
The problem, said Cindy Woods, senior immigration law and policy fellow for the American Civil Liberties Union of Alaska, is that the state is now housing noncriminals in a facility designed to house criminals.
“What we have here in Alaska is we’ve got a state corrections facility. It’s very different circumstances, and it sounds like that’s not meeting the needs of the folks that are here in our care,” Woods said in front of the judiciary committee on Friday. 
“In addition to that, Alaska’s far away, and when you’re moving folks, especially when you’re moving folks at the last minute, with no notice, they’re losing access to their representation, their social services, their family, and other resources that they have. This is very concerning, and I think that we really need to rethink how we’re treating folks and the contracts and responsibilities of DOC,” she said.
In response to questions from legislators, Winkelman said that the state’s contract with the federal government means that Alaska’s costs are being reimbursed by the federal government.
“I’m just wondering if, all we’re doing is getting refunded for our costs, why are we doing this at all?” asked Rep. Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage.
Winkelman responded that it’s because Alaska doesn’t have a federal detention center but has a large federal presence — the Coast Guard, Army, Air Force and more.
“Until it is changed in statute, we will continue to be a good partner federally,” Winkelman said. “One of those partners is ICE, and I will say that typically, they do not stay.”
In response to a followup question from Josephson, Winkelman said that the state could have turned down the ICE request. 
She said that when the first ICE detainees arrived in Alaska, the department was told that they would be there for no more than 30 days. Since then, six of the original 41 detainees have left the state.
Attorneys for some of the detainees testified that their clients have told them about inadequate conditions and prison guards’ use of pepper spray to put the detainees back into their cells during a lockdown.
“There has been one use of force, and that was not at an individual,” Winkleman said. “We had an incident in the unit where they were … doing, essentially, a verbal demonstration, aggressively. They were not wanting to lock down.”
Woods said the detainees are being held in “punitive conditions.”
“These civil detainees at ACC are brothers, husbands, partners and fathers, who are simply waiting for an administrative body to decide their ability to stay in the United States,” she said.
In some cases, detainees are being kept three to a cell. That’s by detainees’ request, Winkelman said. Some would prefer to stay with people who speak their language and share their culture, she said.
Democratic and independent members of the House Judiciary Committee participated in Friday’s hearing, but none of the committee’s Republican members did so.
At least one Republican lawmaker, Rep. Julie Coulombe, R-Anchorage, watched the hearing from the gallery. Coulombe is not a member of the judiciary committee.
House Minority Leader Mia Costello, R-Anchorage and a member of the committee, issued a written statement calling Friday’s meeting a “show hearing” and saying that the House’s minority caucus “stands with the President.” 
Rep. Sarah Vance, R-Homer and a member of the committee, also commented in the statement.
“This caucus stands with ICE, with Alaska’s Department of Corrections, and with every Alaskan who believes the rule of law still matters,” Vance said.

(Screengrab couretsy Department of Human Services)The Maryland Department of Human Services is giving control of its online state-benefits platform over to the state Department of Information Technology —along with $124.3 million to cover costs of the transfer.
The shift was approved at last week’s Board of Public Works meeting for the Maryland Total Human-services Integrated Network — known as MD THINK. The program allows state agencies to administer benefits such as Medicare, Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, and allows recipients better control over their services.
The change of program oversight better aligns with each departments’ responsibilities, DoIT Secretary Katie Savage said recently.
“As a technology organization, we’re best positioned to make decisions about how to manage and operate the health of the platform,” Savage said.

DHS currently operates the system. With the change, it will still have responsibility for the services that use the platform, but DoIT will operate underlying technologies, Savage said.
The system serves more than 2 million Marylanders, Savage said. Because of its size, the money coming from DHS will go toward cloud services, software and people to administer the platform, she said. 
“The employees won’t experience any real change in their day-to-day, except that they’ll be employees of DoIT instead of the Department of Human services,” Savage said.
The transition will create minimal change on the user-facing side of the platform, and it will affect 43 employees and 450 state contractors, she said.
After this transition year, funds to operate the program will be budgeted directly to DoIT, according to the Board of Public Works, which approved the shift without discussion at its June 11 meeting.

(Photo Katelyn Smith/National Park Service)On Jan. 23, 2018, I woke to the biggest earthquake I had felt in my 30 years in Alaska. A few minutes later, my cellphone started buzzing. A tsunami alert had been issued. We immediately turned on KTOO, our local NPR station. We decided to drive to one of two recommended high points in our low-lying town along Icy Strait, off the Gulf of Alaska. On the radio, a local DJ came on and kept us informed. We went home when he said the warning had been rescinded.
Our area has a 90% chance of a damaging earthquake in the next 100 years. In our town, we probably won’t have electricity right after a major earthquake. Therefore, no internet or cell service. But in a vehicle, we can pick up NPR implementing the Emergency Broadcast Network, perhaps as we’re heading to high ground or going to check on our neighbors.
In other communities, the danger could be fast-moving wildfire. Or landslides.
Commercial radio may be helpful down south, but rural Alaska is different. Pick any rural Alaskan community with exposure to these dangers. You will find they probably don’t have a commercial radio station. They probably do receive an NPR station.
In rural Alaska, there is no market-driven solution to ensure emergency broadcasts happen in a disaster that recurs on a 100-year time scale. The Alaska delegation should protect funding for public broadcasting.

Tremayne Wilson was charged in 2021 and convicted by a jury after pulling out in front of an Anchorage Police Department vehicle and driving away at a high speed. During his arrest, Wilson did not cooperate with police.
After his conviction, Wilson appealed his case and represented himself in court. 
The ruling was what’s known as a “memorandum opinion,” which does not create new legal precedent but can reinforce existing precedent. 
In Wilson’s case, the court — citing prior precedent — concluded that Wilson’s failure to submit to police did not amount to resisting arrest.
In 2007, the Court of Appeals concluded that if someone in Alaska “turns turtle” and announces that they will not go with police, that action should not be considered resisting arrest. 
“Turtling” amounts to orienting the body so that a person’s arms and legs are underneath them, making it more difficult for police to handcuff the person.
“Mere non-submission does not qualify as ‘force’ for purposes of this offense,” the appeals court wrote about Wilson, referring to the state’s resisting-arrest law.
That conclusion followed an admission by Anchorage prosecutors who conceded that “the evidence at trial was legally insufficient to prove that Wilson used force to resist arrest.”
The appeals court, citing video evidence, did uphold Wilson’s conviction for failing to stop his vehicle at the direction of police.

(Photo courtesy of Washington state Democratic Party)Washington state Democratic Party chair Shasti Conrad won a coveted leadership post with the Democratic National Committee on Friday. 
Conrad was elected DNC vice chair, giving her a voice in crafting the party’s strategy for responding to the Trump administration and recapturing control of Congress in 2026.
She beat Kalyn Free, a national committee member from Oklahoma, in a run-off after neither garnered a majority in a first round of balloting earlier this week. That initial round featured a third candidate, Jeanna Repass, chair of the Kansas Democratic Party. 
Conrad, 40, said in a statement that she was “deeply grateful” for the result, which came after six days of voting.
“This was the longest election in DNC history, and every vote cast reflected our shared belief in building a stronger, more inclusive Democratic Party,” she said.
The party is looking to bounce back after a disastrous 2024 cycle. Conrad has argued that Democrats don’t need to drastically change their message or positions and instead must improve how they communicate with voters. 
She has also argued that the platform that has brought Democrats success in Washington, where the party controls all statewide elected offices and the Legislature, can be replicated to rack up victories elsewhere.
“We are not just strategizing to win elections. We are working to transform lives,” Conrad said before results came out.
The DNC chose two vice chairs over the past two weeks in a do-over of Feb. 1 elections that were won by Malcolm Kenyatta and David Hogg.
Those contests were invalidated after Free filed a complaint contending the party failed to follow its own rules on gender parity in officer elections. DNC members agreed to rerun elections for those seats. Only candidates who made it to the final round of voting in February and were eligible for each seat under party rules, could compete.
Hogg, a 25-year-old gun-control activist, declined to run for his seat. He faced criticism from fellow Democrats because of his plans to fund challenges to Democratic incumbents with his group, Leaders We Deserve.
Hogg’s exit left Kenyatta, a Pennsylvania state representative, as the only eligible candidate in the election for the vice chair position that had to be filled by a male under the DNC rules. Kenyatta was elected Saturday.
Conrad, 40, is in her second term as leader of Washington’s Democratic Party and is the first South Asian woman to lead a state party. 
She had the backing of DNC Chair Ken Martin, who appointed her in March to be an associate chair for the national party. In this role, she said she’s strived to spotlight issues of importance to Asian Americans and to work with influencers on ways to better engage younger voters.
“As a millennial, I’m committed to creating more opportunities for young people to get involved and become the leaders of today—not just tomorrow,” she said. She added that she’d ensure Asian American and Pacific Islanders “have a seat at every table where decisions are made.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shasti-Socials-Headshot.png,,,2025-06-20 20:01:42.384860

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaskans understand how much energy matters. It’s not just about turning on the lights or plugging in a phone, it’s about staying warm through the long, dark winters. It’s about making sure a remote community hundreds of miles from the road system has access to affordable, reliable power. And it’s about keeping the cost of living from climbing even higher.
That’s why Alaskans can be thankful to our senators for standing up for something that may sound technical — federal clean energy tax credits — but in reality, makes a world of difference to real people, right here in our state. Both our senators should keep up the good work.
Clean energy tax credits like the ones passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act have enabled Alaskan households, businesses and communities to strengthen their energy efficiency while getting major clean energy projects off the ground in Alaska, creating and protecting good union jobs in the process. Without these energy tax credits, we risk seeing economy-growing projects stalled or canceled, jobs lost and energy costs pushed even higher for Alaskan families already feeling the pinch.
The Alaska AFL-CIO represents 50,000 workers in 50 local affiliates across the state. These are hardworking men and women who build and maintain the critical infrastructure that keeps Alaska running. These are the skilled electricians, laborers, teamsters and tradespeople who have powered our oil and gas industry, and who are now also ready and trained to build the next generation of energy, including wind, solar, hydropower and more. They take pride in what they do, and they deserve the chance to keep working, supporting their families and strengthening their communities.
Many Alaska workers have spent months out on remote job sites, away from their families, helping install wind turbines or repair transmission lines. They are not just doing a job, they’re building a future for their children and for Alaska. And they know, like I do, that the sooner we get more local, affordable energy online, the better it will be for everyone — whether you live in Anchorage or Aniak.
But these projects don’t just happen on their own. They take time. They take investment. And in Alaska, where the terrain is tough and the permitting process can stretch for years, they take strong policy support. The Inflation Reduction Act’s federal renewable energy tax credits have been critical for getting projects to the finish line. Take them away, and we’re back to square one with projects delayed, jobs lost and energy bills creeping up.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski said it well in her letter to Senate leadership earlier this year: Eliminating these credits would disrupt progress and hurt American workers. She’s absolutely right. Here in Alaska, it’s not just about policy, it’s about people. And our people are ready to work. Our unions have already trained workers to build these projects. They’re just waiting on the green light to get going.
We may not always agree with our elected leaders on every issue, but when it comes to energy, we share common ground: We all want a future that’s affordable, reliable and built right here at home. That’s what these tax credits help make possible.
The Alaska AFL-CIO is proud to support an “all of the above” energy approach that includes oil, gas and clean energy resources. We believe in building it all, as long as it creates good union jobs and keeps Alaskans warm, working and thriving.
Let’s keep moving forward. Let’s keep building. And let’s make sure the next generation of energy in Alaska is one we can all be proud of — union-built, Alaskan-made, and here to stay. Sens. Murkowski and Dan Sullivan can help make that possible by protecting the clean energy tax credits that are helping to make this kind of growth possible.
Joelle Hall is the president of the Alaska AFL-CIO.

Greg Gianforte vetoed a bill that would have made child care workers eligible for the Best Beginnings Child Care Scholarship for their own children, arguing Montana has other tools to address the shortage.
But sponsor and Rep. Jonathan Karlen, D-Missoula, said House Bill 456 offered a unique and “proven strategy” for helping to make child care more affordable and accessible.
Best Beginnings leverages federal money to help lower income, working families or parents in school to afford child care, mostly by funding providers.
HB 456 aimed to fix a conundrum in the industry — that child care workers earn wages too low to afford their own child care, but a family with a child care worker might earn too much to qualify for Best Beginnings.
In his veto letter, Gianforte said Montana already has made great strides toward increasing quality and affordable child care.
In House Bill 648 from 2023, he said, the state provided Best Beginnings with $7 million to increase access, permanently expanding income eligibility from 150% to 185% of the federal poverty level.
He also said Montana has “eliminated unnecessary red tape that burdened childcare providers across our state.”
But Gianforte said HB 456 was costly and unfair.
He said it further expanded eligibility to include child care workers with a household income of less than two times the state median income, “essentially providing a benefit to one worker to the exclusion of others.
“The bill’s expanded eligibility is projected to cost Montana taxpayers more than $21 million over the next four years,” Gianforte said.
Gianforte, a Republican, said he shares the sponsor’s aim to support “the workforce behind the workforce,” but he pointed to a separate bill, House Bill 924, as offering a tool to address the childcare shortage and “innovate the industry.”
Karlen said Friday the Best Beginnings bill had offered a strategy to recruit and retain childcare workers that was shown to be successful, and it made childcare more affordable and accessible.
In testimony during the session, Karlen had said a pilot program in Montana that granted child care workers scholarships demonstrated a 20% decrease in turnover.
In a statement Friday, he said he said he’ll continue to work to improve the industry.
“I’m disappointed in the governor’s decision to veto this bipartisan, fiscally responsible bill — and frustrated on behalf of my constituents who are struggling to afford childcare, the dedicated childcare workers who continue to earn low wages, and the Montana businesses facing serious challenges finding employees due to our state’s ongoing childcare crisis,” Karlen said.
“But this veto isn’t the end. Legislators on both sides of the aisle have made it clear they’re ready to act to make childcare more affordable, and I’ll continue to do everything I can to work with the governor to ensure every child in Montana has access to high-quality early learning opportunities.”
In a phone call, Karlen said he also supports and was a co-sponsor of House Bill 924, but the bills had different aims.
Karlen said HB 456 offered a proven method to stabilize the industry.
On the other hand, he said HB 924, to create a new, multipurpose trust fund, presents opportunities to be innovative in, for example, how to help rural areas address unique challenges with early child care, or to create a pilot program in a high cost area.
Karlen said he feels positive about HB 924 and characterized it as a way to “think two steps ahead” about what Montana might need. However, as designed, he said, a board will consider new ideas for child care through the mega trust, but support for Best Beginnings isn’t guaranteed.
He also said even adding the cost of HB 456 and HB 924 together still doesn’t come close to the cost of income tax cuts in Montana, and it’s “a little bit disingenuous to act like this is a budget breaker.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/child-care2-1536x1024-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-20 20:01:42.384860

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Arturo Gamboa, a 24-year-old man who was arrested after a chaotic shooting at the “No Kings” protest in Salt Lake City on Saturday, has been released from jail. 
Third District Court Judge James Blanch signed an order on Friday directing Gamboa to be released from the Salt Lake County Jail, where he’s been held since Saturday night, with conditions agreed to through his attorney, Greg Skordas. 
Those conditions, according to the order, are that Gamboa “maintain residence” with his father and provide address and contact information to Utah Pretrial Services officials, that he not possess any firearms, that he turn in his passport to his attorney, and follow certain other conditions with pretrial services officials, who provide supervision for defendants. That includes staying in touch with his lawyer and calling a recorded line once a day. 
“We’re happy to have this behind us,” Skordas said in a text to Utah News Dispatch on Friday. “He should have never been in jail in the first place. We firmly believe Arturo committed no crimes.”

According to Salt Lake City police, the shooting during the protest happened after two men described as “peacekeepers” confronted Gamboa, who was openly carrying an AR-15 style rifle. One of the men, reportedly part of the event’s volunteer security team, fired three shots from a handgun, grazing Gamboa but also hitting an “innocent bystander,” Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, who was pronounced dead at a hospital. 
Shortly after the shooting, police arrested Gamboa, and he was booked into jail for investigation of murder. Police say, however, that Gamboa did not fire his rifle. The two “peacekeepers,” who wore high-visability vests, were initially detained by police, but were released after being questioned. Police said the man who fired the three shots is cooperating with investigators. 
As of Friday, Salt Lake County prosecutors had not filed charges against Gamboa or anyone else involved in the shooting. 
Skordas said the rifle Gamboa was carrying during the protest was not loaded. 
“All of the evidence confirms that he was lawfully and openly carrying an unloaded firearm on a public road,” Skordas said. “He never brandished it, never fired it and never pointed it in the direction of anyone. He was shot in the back by a person who needlessly shot two innocent men, killing one.”
According to an affidavit of probable cause for Gamboa’s arrest, one of the “peacekeepers” told police he saw Gamboa “move away from the main crowd into a secluded area behind a wall.” There, he told officers he observed Gamboa take out an AR-15 style rifle from his backpack and begin to “manipulate it.” Then they “called out to him to drop the gun after drawing their own firearms,” according to the affidavit. 
“(Gamboa) then lifted the rifle, and according to witnesses he began to run toward the large crowd gathered on State Street holding the rifle in a firing position,” the affidavit says. That’s when one of the “peacekeepers” fired three rounds at Gamboa. One of the bullets hit Ah Loo, “causing a fatal wound.” 
But in the days since Gamboa’s arrest, videos have circulated online raising questions about whether Gamboa had actually raised the rifle in a firing position and charged the crowd, as the “peacekeeper” told police. One angle, reported by FOX 13, showed Gamboa with his rifle aimed down and not running until after one of the security volunteers started shooting.

The order to release Gamboa came after the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office’s homicide team conducted a preliminary review of evidence on Friday. After that review, “it was determined that we will not be able to make an informed decision” by their deadline on Monday “as to the culpability, if any” of Gamboa in relation to the shooting Saturday, the District Attorney’s Office said in a news release. 
“The investigation will continue to be carried out by the Salt Lake City Police Department,” the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office said. “The Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office will continue to review as additional evidence is presented to us.”
The Salt Lake City Police Department issued a statement Friday saying its homicide squad “presented their initial findings from the ongoing investigation” into the shooting to the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office for legal review. 
“This process, known as a case screening, is a key step in any criminal investigation,” the department said. “It serves to analyze legal issues, identify investigative needs, and ensures the matter is prepared for prosecution evaluation, all while detectives continue to investigate.”
Salt Lake City police urged anyone with information on the case, including video, to “come forward.” Digital evidence can be submitted through the department’s public evidence portal. Or, they said witnesses can speak with an officer by calling 801-799-3000. 
The department declined to release any further information regarding the screening or any additional comment on the material that’s been gathered to “protect the integrity of the ongoing investigation.”

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The presumed frontrunner to lead the Maryland Democratic Party cannot fully assume his duties if elected, and the possibility of an extended delay leaves open the potential the party might have to elect another leader before the end of summer.
Hundreds of Democrats are expected to gather Saturday in Prince George’s County, where the agenda includes election of a state party chair to replace Ken Ulman, who stepped down last week. Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman (D), handpicked by Gov. Wes Moore (D), is expected to be the frontrunner.
But a snag involving state campaign finance law, and Pittman’s inability to immediately close the account that funded his contests for county executive, will bar him from fully assuming the role upon his election.
After a meeting late Wednesday between his campaign representatives and state elections officials, Pittman acknowledged the legal hurdle and said he “won’t officially take office until the account is closed out.”
“We’re fully complying with the law that says that you can’t take office as the chair of the party until you’ve closed your account. So I won’t take office until that’s happened,” Pittman said. “The election will move forward because that’s when the meeting is. But I don’t take office until the account is closed.”
To do so, Pittman said he is undergoing a review of the account by state elections officials. But neither the review nor closing the account will happen before the scheduled June 21 vote.
A party spokesperson said in a statement that Pittman told the party “that the standard process in order to close his county executive campaign account is underway and should be complete before the end of June.”
Maryland Democrats celebrate party wins, but Trump and GOP Congress are never far off

“If he is elected as chair this Saturday, he will officially assume the role upon completion of the close out of his account in accordance with state law. In this scenario, [Vice Chair] Dr. Charlene Dukes would remain acting chair until the account is closed,” the statement said.
Party bylaws require a new chair to be elected within 60 days of a vacancy, and Ulman’s resignation last week means the party could hold a vote as late as August, giving Pittman time to resolve the campaign discrepancy.
But party officials said they are committed to a vote this week, since the meeting has long been scheduled — the party is required to hold two meetings a year, usually in the summer and fall — and scheduling another meeting in two months could create problems for party leaders who must come from far-flung corners of the state.
Pittman said he expects the state elections board to expedite his efforts to close the account. Should that effort drag in August, however, party leaders would be faced with having to elect someone who could take office immediately.
In the meantime, Pittman said that if elected he will limit his activities to transition work and meeting with staff.
“I won’t even be quoted as party chair,” he said. “I won’t be putting up documents as party chair. Dr. Dukes will be acting chair until I am legally the chair.”
Alive and a Democrat
Dukes, first vice chair since 2023, has been acting chair since Ulman’s resignation took effect June 13of the party. She has said she is not interested in the position. But having an acting chair allows the party to continue to raise and expend funds while the party seeks a permanent leader.
There are few qualifications for party leadership: Some say in jest that to qualify one must be “a registered Democrat and alive.”
Pittman, however, faces an additional hurdle stemming from his open campaign account and state law. State Board of Elections Administrator Jared DeMarinis said the law is meant to prevent candidates from directing funds in ways that skirt state law.
“The intent of this prohibition is so that you cannot circumvent contribution limits,” said DeMarinis, who spoke generally on state law and not specifically on Pittman’s situation.

	“If I’m a candidate and I had my personal account, and someone gives me $6,000 but also control … another committee, I can tell that person to also give $6,000 to that committee,” DeMarinis said. “Then I can direct those monies to benefit my campaign and in fact exceed the contribution limits because I was in control over multiple accounts.”
After Ulman announced he was stepping down, Moore immediately nominated Pittman — who is not expected to be the only contender — for the post.
Pittman, who is term-limited as county executive, said he did not discuss his campaign account discrepancy with the governor. It is unclear if Moore’s staff picked up the issue in any vetting process, and a Moore spokesperson did not provide a comment for this story.
 ‘A labor intensive process’
The obvious solution – closing the campaign account — could take weeks, possibly longer. An ongoing problem with recordkeeping has left a discrepancy in his campaign finance filings.
Pittman must resolve a $1,500 difference between his stated bank balance and his reported cash balance. Until that happens — or until the elections board signs off on his unsuccessful efforts to find the problem — Pittman cannot close his account.
Pittman attributed the problem to a discrepancy discovered in previous years. He said his campaign hired an outside firm to identify the problem and assist with amending reports with the state board after the board identified problems in routine audits.
A review of his reports shows that Pittman’s campaign account was balanced in the annual report filed in January 2024. By April, the books were off again by $1,490. Seven months later, a new report showed he had $1,500 more in his bank account than he reported in cash on hand.
Campaign accounts are generally audited by the state every two to three years. All filings — annual and required pre-primary and general election reports — within that period are reviewed. Closing an account would trigger an earlier audit.
Discrepancies, including differences in cash and bank balances or other record issues, would have to be resolved, DeMarinis said.
In general, campaigns can hire someone to do it or turn over all the records to the state board, which would then sift through those records to resolve the problems.
Ulman to step down in June as Maryland Democratic Party chair

“It’s a labor-intensive process,” DeMarinis said.
It is also a process that can lead to  civil penalties for failing to accurately report contributions or expenditures. Fines can start as low as $50 for a first offense, but rise for subsequent offenses. Any penalties would also have to be paid before an account closes.
Pittman would also have to legally dispose of the cash balance before closing the account.
In his January filing, Pittman reported $61,775 in his bank account, but cash on hand of $60,275.83 — a gap of $1,499.17. The report, due Jan. 25, was not filed until Feb. 23, according to state records.
DeMarinis said his office is assisting Pittman and the party to resolve the issue.
“We would do this for any political party if they had an issue with selecting a new chair because we know political parties need officers to operate,” he said.
‘They came up with a blank’
In June 2023, a routine audit conducted by the state board identified repeated cash discrepancies and record-keeping issues in Pittman’s account.
Eight letters from the board to Pittman’s campaign and obtained by Maryland Matters identified repeated issues with record keeping and balances. Six letters cover discrepancies in reports for 2022, two others touch on problems in 2021 and 2023 reports.
Pittman said, with campaign managers coming and going, “It’s been a consistent problem … which is why we did a forensic audit to determine whether there was any wrongdoing.”
“That’s as much as I know how to do, is to fully go through everything. And there are times when there is just no receipt that is found, and there is nobody to blame. There is no person who did any wrongdoing,” he said. “So that was the due diligence that we did.”
Pittman said he believed his campaign addressed those earlier concerns.
“We hired the forensic accountant to make sure that there was no wrongdoing that they could identify anywhere in the campaign, and they couldn’t find anything,” Pittman said. “But they also couldn’t find where, what that money had been spent on. Obviously, there were no receipts for those expenditures and so they came up with a blank, which, of course, is frustrating.”
Pittman said he thought after the forensic review the matter was closed. A review of his campaign filings appears to show the current discrepancies are unrelated to those earlier issues.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Pittman, who acknowledged the account discrepancies that have dogged his campaign of late, said party officials who are electing a new chair should not be concerned that those issues will carry over to party accounts.
“If your question is whether I am a fiscally responsible leader who will make sure that the people who work under me are managing their dollars, I think you can look at the AAA bond rating that Anne Arundel County got for the first time under my leadership, and you can say that I have been a fiscally responsible leader as county executive,” Pittman said.
“I think the party has a history of managing their finances in a responsible way. I think the treasurer of the party is somebody who has been doing that work for quite some time and is very responsible. I think the staff does as well,” he said. “So, I think the party is in good hands, and it would be in good hands under me in terms of managing his finances.”
An expedited process?
Pittman said he will turn over his campaign records to the board for review in what he described as a routine audit. Coupled with that review is an effort by the board to resolve the discrepancies in Pittman’s account.
“But based on what I’ve heard from the meeting that they had today [Wednesday], and the meetings they’ve been having, is that it’s going to take some time to go through it — go through the process,” Pittman said. “They’re going to do it more carefully because questions have been asked and they’re going to expedite what would normally be a 30-day audit. Based on that, I’m confident that we’ll be able to close the account.”
DeMarinis declined to comment on a specific timeline.
“We know that political parties need to operate for elections, and we understand their concerns,” he said. “But we will never change our business practices or procedures to compromise the end result.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/DSC_0112-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-06-20 20:01:42.384860

(Photo courtesy Army & Air Force Exchange Service)A small decrease in the state’s gas tax is coming in July.
New tax rates released by the Office of the Comptroller set the new tax rate on gasoline at 46 cents per gallon. The decrease of one-tenth of a penny is the second in two years and the fourth since a 2013 law was enacted that linked automatic increases to the rate of inflation.
By law, the comptroller must set and announce the new rate by June 1, to take effect on the July 1 start of the fiscal year.
Maryland’s gas tax includes two components — the Consumer Price Index and pre-tax prices on gasoline.
In 2013, lawmakers passed legislation coupling a portion of the gasoline tax to inflation. The rate can only go up — capped at 8% annually — but never decreases.
Over the last year, the inflation index increased 2.7% — down seven-tenths of a percent from the previous year. The increase in inflation will add nine-tenths of a penny to the gas tax.
That increase was offset by a drop in the pre-tax price of gasoline, according to Robert Rehrmann, director of the Board of Revenue Estimates.

Rehrmann, in a May 23 letter to Gov. Wes Moore (D), Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) and House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County), said the pre-tax sales price decreased by a full penny year over year.
“The new rates, as a result of slower inflation and lower fuel prices, decrease by 0.1 cent per gallon and are 46 cents per gallon” for gasoline and clean-burning fuels, Rehrmann wrote in his letter.
That means the current rate of 46.10 cents per gallon for gasoline will decrease to 46 cents even. The tax for diesel fuel, called special fuel, will decrease from 46.85 cents per gallon to 46.75 cents, according to the rates released by the Office of the Comptroller.
When lawmakers passed a law increasing the gas tax in 2013, it was the first such increase in more than two decades. The Democratic majority in the legislature that year indexed future increases inflation. The automatic increases, calculated annually, would not require politically charged debates and votes.
The law included a safety valve meant to prevent spikes if annual inflation grew by more than 8% annually. At the time, sharp inflation spikes were rare.
Two years ago, the gas tax rate jumped by nearly 7 cents per gallon, driven by an annual inflation rate of 7.1% and higher wholesale gas prices.
The new rate for fiscal 2026 is just the fourth decrease since the tax was indexed to inflation in 2013. In each case, lower wholesale prices were the cause.
Decreases in fiscal years 2021 and 2022 were caused by lower fuel prices during the pandemic, when fuel demand waned as more people worked from home and traveled less.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/9030514.jpg,,,2025-06-20 20:01:42.384860

Copley Hospital will close its birthing center, the hospital announced in a press release late Friday afternoon, though no specific closure date was given.
Copley’s Women’s Center will remain open, and pre- and postpartum care will continue to be offered at the Morristown hospital. More details will be provided to staff and patients of the birthing center in the coming weeks, the press release said. 
“We will share detailed information about our partner labor and delivery hospitals to help facilitate birthing family decision making,” the statement read. “Current staff will be given assistance to transition to new appointments and positions both at Copley and in the region.”
Copley Hospital has been formally considering closing the midwife-led birthing center since March when its board of trustees announced that a consultant was being hired to review several options, though concerns about a potential closure had been raised months earlier.

Since then, community members, including current and former patients, have been organizing public showings of support to try to keep the birthing center open. They hosted a Mother’s Day rally in downtown Morrisville, wrote personal letters of appeal to the hospital’s board of trustees and distributed lawn signs throughout the surrounding area. 
The Copley Hospital Board of Trustees voted for the closure of the birthing center on Tuesday, the press release said. 
Board Chair Anne Bongiorno acknowledged the outpouring of testimonials board members and administrators had received in the release.
“The Board is grateful to the community, Copley staff, and everyone who shared their personal stories, family connections or professional experiences with the birthing center. It has been a privilege to know how much our community cares for our hospital,” Bongiorno said as quoted in the statement. “With the diligent work by everyone over many months, including the consultant’s thorough research and report, we believe we have made the best decision possible in a challenging situation.”
The press release announcing the closure noted Vermont has the lowest birth rate in the nation and Copley has experienced a downward trend in births at the hospital. Currently less than half of all births in Lamoille County take place at the center, according to the release.
Copley Hospital, like other small community hospitals in the state, struggles with maintaining financial stability. The birthing center operates at a loss of between $3 million and $5 million annually, hospital administrators have said. In recent years, the number of births at the center had dropped to less than 200 per year, below the threshold necessary to maintain efficiencies of scale, according to a report by the consultancy Oliver Wyman that proposed ways to reduce overall health care costs. 
Mary Lou Kopas, one of three full-time nurse midwives at the birthing center, said Friday she was “just heartbroken” by the news, which staff had received earlier in the afternoon. 
“I love this group of people,” she said. “It’s a really special practice.”
The Copley birthing center’s staff had just been celebrated recently for the quality of its care and its outcomes at the annual conference for the Vermont Child Health Improvement Program at the University of Vermont Larner College of Medicine, she said.
Kopas acknowledged the financial challenges faced by Copley and the state’s broader health care system, but said  there were strategies hospital leaders could have tried in recent years to boost the number of births if volume was a concern.
“If there was truly a commitment to keeping the service for the community, why was there none of that?” she said.

Hundreds of people gathered outside the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in St. Albans on Friday, waiting to hear if Wuendy Bernardo, a migrant farm worker who has lived on a dairy in Orleans County for over a decade, would return home to her family or face deportation proceedings.
They cheered as she emerged from the office around 10:30 a.m. to return home to her family with orders to report back on July 21. Migrant Justice, a Burlington-based migrant advocacy organization, estimated that roughly 200 community members turned out to support Bernardo. 
“It’s really difficult because every time I come here I don’t know if I’ll be going back to my family or not,” Bernado said, tearing up while Will Lambek, a Migrant Justice spokesperson, translated. 
Susanna, 79, a retired textile designer from Albany, paced around the parking lot in her raincoat ahead of Bernardo’s arrival. She met Bernardo more than six years ago when she began taking her to prenatal appointments at Bridges to Health, a migrant health care program through the University of Vermont. 
“I’m really nervous about this,” she said. 
She described Bernardo as a charming friend and an excellent mother who loves gardening and her family. (Susanna asked for her last name to be withheld because of her work with migrants). 
Bernardo is a mother of five children, ages five to 18, and guardian to two orphaned half-sisters, according to Lambek. All her children are still in school, and none have immediate concerns about their immigration statuses, he said.

“We’re in a moment of intensifying attacks against immigrant communities around the country and here in Vermont,” Lambek said. “These are premeditated political actions to tear families apart and violate people’s rights.”
Bernardo and her community have been under increasing stress since she was first detained in Vermont in 2019, according to Susanna.
“For a while it was just, ‘be careful and observe the speed limits, and don’t do anything outrageous,’” said Susanna, who also came out to support Bernardo’s prior ICE appointment in April. “And now, of course, it’s no holds barred.” 
Bernardo pulled into the parking lot at 10:00 a.m., accompanied by her daughters. Supporters cheered and called “I love you Wuendy,” as she joined her attorney inside the ICE office. While inside, dozens of cars lined up and down Gricebrook Road and more supporters joined the semi-circle surrounding the office’s front doors. Thirty minutes later, Bernardo walked outside smiling while her daughter tugged the end of her ponytail.

Bernardo’s saga with immigration officials began in 2019 when she was stopped by U.S. Customs and Border Protection while a fellow parishioner drove her home from church. She and two of her children were detained at a border patrol facility and then the ICE office in St. Albans where they were processed and released, according to Lambek. He said border protection agents gave no reason for pulling the car over. 
Border protection and ICE officials did not answer a request for comment by the time of publication. 
Following the 2019 detention, Bernardo was on a telephonic check in schedule until ICE told her in 2022 to come to the office, ordering her to bring a plane ticket that showed she would leave the country. Bernardo applied for a stay of removal — a formal request that her deportation proceedings be delayed. She was allowed to remain in the U.S. while that request was under consideration, according to Lambek.
But earlier this year, Bernardo was again ordered to report to ICE. In April, about 100 supporters rallied outside the office to support her stay in the country, and she was told to return in two months. Attorneys refiled her stay of removal, and that stay remains pending, according to Brett Stokes, Bernardo’s attorney and the director of the Center for Justice Reform at Vermont Law and Graduate School.

‘A lot of risks’
Abel Luna, a 36-year-old Migrant Justice field coordinator, joined the rally supporting Bernardo with his daughter. Luna, who was a farm worker in New York state beginning at age 13, called the recent detentions and deportations of migrants in Vermont a “fear tactic” by the federal government.
Since April, at least 25 migrant workers and students, including farmers, landscapers and construction workers, have been detained in northern Vermont by border officials.
On Saturday, 29-year-old Jose Ignacio De La Cruz, known as Nacho, and his stepdaughter, Heidi Perez, 18, were pulled over by border officials due to “suspicious border activity,” according to Customs and Border Protection spokesperson Ryan Brissette. The agents smashed their car window and detained both De La Cruz and Perez. De La Cruz is being held at the Northwest State Correctional Facility in Swanton and Perez is at the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility in South Burlington, according to the state prison locator.

The two have filed petitions in federal district court alleging their detainment was unconstitutional. The chief judge of Vermont district court, Christina Reiss, issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting ICE from moving them out of state. Both remain in custody pending deportation proceedings. 
Luna said his community was seeing more arrests during the second Trump administration, especially mass arrests, including a group of eight farm workers arrested in April at Berkshire’s Pleasant Valley Farms, the state’s largest dairy, and the detainment and monitoring of community leaders who worked closely with Migrant Justice like Bernardo, De La Cruz, and Perez.
“Nacho especially, and Heidi in her own right, were both very politically active,” Stokes said. “I think it’s important to consider whether that was a justification for this arrest.” 
Stokes didn’t know if they were targeted for their organizing work, but Luna said outspoken migrant leaders were detained during both Trump administrations.

“But it doesn’t matter who you are, you could be driving on the road and get stopped and detained,” Luna said. “There may be some targeting of leaders, but being a migrant worker in the state of Vermont, being a border state, there’s a lot of risks.” 
Stokes said Bernardo’s situation was unique because she was first detained with an expedited removal order upon her initial entry to the U.S. in 2014, and later let out on parole. Bernardo is currently ineligible for asylum because she didn’t apply during her first year in the U.S., and right now, she doesn’t have a pathway to citizenship. Like many others in the U.S., Stokes said, she has spent her time in the U.S. undergoing periodic check-ins by ICE officials. 
ICE under Trump 
ICE practices have changed under the second Trump administration, according to Lambek. While those under ICE supervision like Bernardo were once monitored through email or telephonic check ins, ICE is now ordering more in person appointments. Lambek said this increases stress for migrants, who know that visiting an ICE office could result in detention and deportation.
State leaders have supported Bernardo’s case for more than two years, including a 2023 letter of support by 67 state legislators, and Stokes said the congressional delegation has assisted his office in getting information from ICE about other migrant deportation cases. But Vermont officials could do more to support migrant workers who live in the state, he said.
De La Cruz and Perez had robust community support from Migrant Justice and were able to quickly get in touch with Stokes to start working on their petitions to remain in the state, but that type of support often requires knowing attorneys, like Stokes, exist.
“A lot of other folks who are detained in the state aren’t that lucky,” said Stokes, who can’t find clients to represent unless they get in touch with him.

“There are many other ICE detainees in the same facilities that I’m in that haven’t contacted me that I don’t think anyone knows are there and they don’t know who to call,” Stokes said. 
There could be a better effort to provide intakes for ICE detainees and triage their individual situations, along with pushing for universal representation in immigration proceedings, he said. Vermont has a small community of legal support for immigrants, and he said it was important for the state to fund that work in a meaningful way.
But for detainees who are well-connected, rallies can help support those like Bernado facing stressful situations. 
“I felt a lot of nerves going in, but hearing the chants of ‘Si Se Puede’ gave me strength and made me think that everything was going to turn out okay,” Bernardo said while Lambek translated. “It’s nice to know that there are still good people in this world, people who are out here supporting our community.”

An […]","Nikki Gronli, former USDA Rural Development state director, speaks at a state Department of Social Services public hearing regarding cuts to TANF benefits at the Sioux Falls One Stop on June 20, 2025. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — Some needy South Dakota families could soon lose up to $136 a month less to spend on gas, groceries, clothing, utilities, house repairs or rent.
The average South Dakota family in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program receives $515.55 a month, according to the state Department of Social Services. An average of just under 2,500 families get TANF benefits each month.
Those families would lose anywhere from $32 to $136 a month in benefits under a proposed 10% reduction by the department, depending on the size of their family. The state would save about $1.5 million for the year.
Dozens of South Dakotans stood up to speak out against the cut Friday, using words like “asinine,” “appalling” and “ludicrous” to describe it during a public hearing in eastern Sioux Falls. No one spoke in support of the cut.
TANF is a federal-state program most commonly used to provide financial assistance to low-income families with children, on the condition that the caregiver searches or trains for a job. Non-parent relatives — grandparents or aunts or uncles — who take children into their home when a parent is not able to care for them are among the eligible.
Former Gov. Kristi Noem put $5.3 million in TANF cuts into her proposed budget last year in light of a tight revenue year. Lawmakers approved the $5.3 million cuts in March. In Noem’s recommended budget, leftover federal funds reserved for the program were meant to cover the shortfall.
Public hearing: ‘This is not an expense, this is an investment’
Colleen Werner, a former educator and school administrator in Sioux Falls, said at the public hearing she was shocked the state would start cuts “with the lowest and most in need” to save money. Families are paying more for rent, utilities, food and other living expenses than they did last year, she added.

“Imagine if you’re at your financial end and you still step up,” Werner said, a reference to relatives stepping in to care for children who are not their own. “And what does our state do? It just steps on you and cuts your funds when you’ve taken a bold and brave and loving measure to take care of those you love.”
Lisa Sanderson, who said she formerly worked with Child Protective Services, said the proposal runs counter to the department’s mission to support and uplift South Dakota families in need.
Participants, including Sanderson and others, called for more funding and increased benefits, citing inflation and a higher increased cost of living in recent years.
“This is not an expense,” Sanderson said. “This is an investment.”
Department representatives did not recommend any changes to the policy based on the public testimony, but will take written public comment through the end of the month. After that, they’ll present their proposal to the legislative Rules Review Committee. If approved, the reduction would be implemented by Aug. 1.
DSS explains its proposal
The state distributed $15.3 million in TANF benefits last fiscal year. 
The 10% benefit cut is part of the department’s plan to deal with having $5.3 million less to spend on TANF this year. The department also intends to use $3.8 million from a TANF carryover fund to cover some of the cost of benefits for families.
The carryover fund currently holds about $23 million – more than enough to fully cover the $5.3 million budget cut.
The fund has been reserved as a “rainy day fund,” said Department of Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff. He added that some of the unused funds are intended to upgrade the TANF computer system. He said he didn’t know how much the upgrades would cost.

The department could use another $1.5 million from the carryover balance to avoid the benefit cuts. But Althoff called the reduction a “strategic approach” to managing the carryover fund.
He described the fund as a piggy bank that “is not going to last forever.”  Without knowing what the financial landscape looks like in the coming years, reducing TANF benefits by 10% means the department can “keep the piggy bank there” for a longer period of time. 
If state revenues continue to worsen and more cuts are necessary, the department could propose in the coming years to cut TANF benefits more.
The proposed rule change would also remove TANF eligibility for families who take in child relatives who are removed from their homes by the state’s child welfare system. 
The change would incentivize caregivers to become licensed kinship caregivers with the state. The current foster and kinship subsidy rate for a child in SD is between $22.85 and $27.43 a day, depending on their age. That would be roughly $685.50 to $822.90 a month, per child.
Lawmakers approved rule changes in May to create the licensed kinship foster care pathway, as required by the federal government. Caregivers must meet training requirements to become a licensed kinship home, similar though less intensive than traditional foster care requirements.
According to the department, 184 cases per month managed by the department involving families eligible for TANF would be eligible for kinship subsidies.
Families who take in kin and apply for TANF use the “side door” to receive state and federal support, Althoff said. Eliminating eligibility encourages families to “come in through the front door.”
Proposal’s future depends on legislative committee interpretation
Several participants said they were blindsided by the proposal. They said they understood from lawmakers during the state’s legislative session this winter that the $5.8 million cut to TANF would be fully — not partially — offset by money from the carryover fund. 
Althoff briefly mentioned that his department planned to review TANF benefits during a conversation with lawmakers on the state’s budget committee in January, but admitted Friday that “a conversation wasn’t held in earnest with lawmakers.”

Rep. Erik Muckey, D-Sioux Falls, said Friday that he didn’t expect TANF benefit cuts this fiscal year. Muckey is a member of the Joint Appropriations Committee. Because of a “significant miscommunication” between lawmakers on the committee and the department, Muckey said it wouldn’t be prudent to advance the TANF cuts.
“If the appropriations committee didn’t intend to do this, we need to have more conversations before we reduce benefits,” said Muckey, who’s also a member of the rules review committee.
“I can appreciate the gravity of our state’s financial situation. What is important is those conversations, as far as our budgetary decisions, are not under the purview of the rules review committee,” Muckey said. “I think the public understands this is a case where the Legislature did not give its permission.”

Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, is also a member of the appropriations and rules review committees. She disagreed, saying there isn’t a way for the rules review committee to determine the Legislature’s intent, since the body did not take any votes specifically concerning the TANF changes. Lawmakers only passed a budget with a $5.3 million reduction in TANF spending, she said.
Howard doesn’t remember discussions about TANF carryover funds during the session, but said  she supports the 10% cut.
“Why aren’t we cutting all of it? Why are we even using carryover funds?” Howard told South Dakota Searchlight. Howard has been critical about welfare program spending in the state.

Tapped for Bureau of Land Management post, Brenda Younkin will report directly to agency’s acting director, Jon Raby. 
The post Trump appointee, a Jackson Hole consultant, ID’d pitfalls of Wyoming managing its federal land appeared first on WyoFile .","Not unlike the current moment, roughly a decade ago a political push to do away with large swaths of federal lands in the West was gaining steam. 
Utah Republican U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz ran a bill at the time that would have transferred 3.3 million acres of the federal estate to state ownership. The bill was later pulled, and the representative resigned his congressional seat after the proposal whipped hunters and anglers into a fury. 
The movement crossed state lines into Wyoming. During state lawmakers’ 2015 general session in Cheyenne, a legislative committee drafted a bill that demanded the transfer of vast tracts of federal lands to Wyoming. Later, the measure was amended to require a study of Wyoming managing federal lands, not owning them.
The Wyoming Office of State Lands and Investments was ultimately given $75,000 for the study, and it picked Jackson-based Y2 Consultants to complete the analysis. When the 357-page study was completed the following fall, state land managers and lawmakers were warned that they lacked staff and resources to take over control of 25 million acres of Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Reclamation property that fell within state boundaries.

Brenda Younkin (Y2 Consultants)
“Ultimately, without significant changes to federal law, the greatest challenge would be that the state would be inheriting the same bureaucratic maze of overlapping, entwined, often conflicting federal mandates established in the labyrinth of laws and directives laid out by Congress,” the 2016 Y2 Consultants report stated. “The land management trials, conundrums, and conflicts encountered would largely be the same for the state that exist under present [federal] management.”
The first author listed on the report, a slot that typically denotes the lead, was Brenda Younkin, a natural resource specialist who co-founded Y2 Consultants with her husband, Zia Yasrobi. 
On Wednesday, Politico’s E&E News publicized that Younkin had been appointed by the Trump administration and had started working in a senior advisor post at the Bureau of Land Management, where she’d report to its acting director, Jon Raby. Trump’s first pick to lead the BLM, Colorado oil and gas advocate Kathleen Sgamma, withdrew her bid after it was revealed that she’d written a memo expressing “disgust” for “President Trump’s role in spreading misinformation that incited” the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol. 
WyoFile was unable to reach Younkin for an interview Friday, but an auto-response from her Y2 Consultants email address confirmed a “leave of absence” because of a new gig with the U.S. Department of the Interior, the BLM’s government parent.

According to her biography and past interviews, Younkin has worked in the public lands and ranching sphere her entire career. 
In statements made to the Cowboy State Daily, U.S. Sens. Cynthia Lummis and John Barrasso both lauded Younkin’s appointment. 
“The more Wyoming voices we can have in the room, the better off we will all be,” Barrasso told the outlet. 
Younkin joins a handful of other Wyoming residents who’ve gone to work for the Trump administration’s Interior Department via political appointments, or who have been nominated for positions.

In early February, former Wyoming Game and Fish Department Director Brian Nesvik was nominated to direct the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, though four months later his appointment has still not cleared the Senate’s confirmation process. Cyrus Western, a former Republican statehouse representative, was picked to helm the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Region 8 office, based in Denver. Cheyenne attorney Karen Budd-Falen was also selected as the acting deputy secretary under Interior Secretary Doug Burgum. 
Last, southwestern Wyoming big game hunting advocate Josh Coursey was appointed to a Fish and Wildlife Service post, pulling him away from the Muley Fanatic Foundation, which he co-founded. That group has since gone on record opposing a provision expected to be yoked into the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that would mandate the sale of an estimated 2-3 million acres of federal land in 11 western states. 
“Public lands need to stay in public hands and the Muley Fanatic Foundation opposes anything or anyone that threatens our lands that we hold dear for personal use,” President and CEO Joey Faigle told WyoFile in a written statement. “The public land sales being included in the reconciliation needs to stop now.”
If the public land sale mandates don’t stop, the amount of land that Younkin, the Jackson Hole consultant, will be tasked with overseeing at the Bureau of Land Management will shrink. 
The disposal language in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources legislative text demands selling between 0.5% and 0.75% of the BLM and U.S. Forest Service’s 438 million surface acres within the next five years. Although just a fraction of the agencies’ overall holdings, it’d translate to doing away with public lands that collectively add up to an area no smaller than Yellowstone National Park.

(Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Cyclists riding on Pennsylvania highways have no obligation to pull off the road to get out of the way of faster traffic, the state Supreme Court ruled this week. The decision reinforces the right of bikers to use the road just like other vehicles. 
Instead, cyclists must make “reasonable efforts” to avoid impeding the flow of traffic. How they do that, Justice Kevin Dougherty wrote, is up to the judgement of the rider, taking into account factors such as whether it is safer to remain in the lane or move to the shoulder.
“In some cases, the circumstances might require a pedalcyclist to temporarily but completely exit the roadway to allow traffic to pass. In others, it may not be safe or reasonable to expect a pedalcyclist to do so, or at least not right away. And in others still, a pedalcyclist may only need to move to the right side of the lane to comply with [the traffic code],” Dougherty wrote for the majority in the 5-2 decision.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The case centered on cyclist Brendan Linton of Butler County, who fought a $25 ticket he received in July 2021, after a state trooper was unable to pass him and pulled him over as a result.
Bicycling advocates said the decision is an important victory, because it clarifies the right of cyclists to “take the lane” when they’re riding amongst motor vehicles. 
The Supreme Court reversed a ruling by a Butler County judge that a lower appeals court had upheld.
“I’m sure it would have made it that much harder to use the road,” Chris Gale, executive director of the Bicycle Coalition of Greater Philadelphia, told the Capital-Star. 
“I hear from cyclists that they just don’t feel safe on the road. I think what makes it scary is that people who are driving don’t always understand they have to share the road,” Gale said, adding that the right to choose how to travel is an important personal freedom.
But Ken McLeod, policy director of the League of American Cyclists, said the court could have gone further in giving cyclists the benefit of the doubt. The majority found the question of whether a cyclist’s efforts to avoid slowing traffic are sufficient depends on the circumstances and is “best entrusted to trial courts and juries.”
Justices Daniel McCaffery and David Wecht signed a dissenting opinion, arguing that it should be up to police to prove that a cyclist’s actions are unreasonable, rather than the cyclist’s burden to show they acted reasonably.
The dissenting opinion outlines a stronger standard for cyclists, McLeod said.
Most states have a version of a law that simply requires cyclists to remain as far to the right as practicable, McLeod said. He added that like the Supreme Court’s interpretation of Pennsylvania law, other states judge the reasonableness of cyclists’ actions by looking at the totality of circumstances. 
When cyclists are ticketed for slowing motor vehicle traffic, it’s usually because motorists or law enforcement take issue with cyclists choosing to use the roadway, McLeod said.
“I do see these contests from time to time and it’s often because bicyclists have these interactions with law enforcement over time and they want to contest the ticket and prove they’re doing nothing wrong,” he said.
According to the Supreme Court majority opinion, Pennsylvania State Trooper Joshua Osche saw Linton riding his bicycle on Evans City Road, also known as Route 68, in Butler Township. Osche was aware of complaints about bicyclists slowing traffic on the two-lane road and pulled out behind Linton with his dashcam recording.
The video showed the trooper was at the back of a queue of about ten motor vehicles behind Linton, each of which was able to pass within two minutes. Osche twice tried to pass Linton as he rode 19 mph in a 55 mph zone but was unsuccessful, according to the video. It  also showed the shoulder of the highway was obstructed with gravel, potholes, storm drain grates and a construction vehicle and worker.

The trooper stopped Linton and charged him with disorderly conduct, violating the duties of a vehicle operator and failing to use reasonable effort to avoid slowing traffic.
In a bench trial, the Butler County judge found Linton guilty of failing to take reasonable efforts to avoid slowing traffic and not guilty of the other offenses. The Superior Court upheld his conviction on appeal.
The section of the traffic code at issue requires vehicles traveling less than the speed limit on a two lane road to “drive completely off the roadway and onto the berm or shoulder” at the first opportunity to avoid impeding traffic. 
It also states in a separate paragraph that a pedalcycle “may be operated at a safe and reasonable speed appropriate for the pedalcycle” and that a cyclist “shall use reasonable efforts so as not to impede the normal and reasonable movement of traffic.”
By reading the paragraphs together, it is clear, Dougherty wrote, the law’s authors didn’t intend to expressly require cyclists to leave the road.
“This makes perfect sense: Given the typically smaller size of pedalcycles relative to other vehicles, it may be possible to safely pass a pedalcyclist that remains on the highway but simply moves to the far-right side of the lane,” Dougherty wrote. “The same is not typically true of other vehicles that merely move to the side.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_0039-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-20 19:03:13.145183

A bill seeking to eliminate copayments for reduced priced lunches was vetoed this week by Gov. Greg Gianforte.
House Bill 551, brought by Helena Democrat Rep. Melissa Romano, would have covered the price of reduced lunches for about $600,000 annually from the state general fund.
In a veto letter, Gov. Gianforte said the problem was being taken care of through existing programs. He also raised the cost of the legislation as an issue.
“A variety of federal programs are already available to ensure all students have access to affordable, nutritious meals throughout the school year and summer, such as the SBP (School Breakfast Program), NSLP (National School Lunch Program), Special Milk Program, and the Summer Food Service Program, all of which Montana participates in,” the veto letter reads.
Reduced lunches cost around 30 or 40 cents, but can still add up for struggling parents, Romano said during the session. It also can turn school administrators into collection agents, hurting the trust between parents and the district, adminstrators have said.
“One in six children in MT live in a food insecure household, and school meals can be the most reliable meals in a kid’s life,” Romano said in a press release. “House Bill 551 would have helped kids get a reliable, nutritious meal without worrying about school lunch debt and its stigma. It would have addressed some of the behavioral and attention issues teachers are facing in the classroom and helped kids succeed.”
The move comes as Montana could be losing millions of dollars in federal food benefits if President Donald Trump’s reconciliation and budget bill passes.
The Montana Quality Education Coalition, American Heart Association in Montana, the Blackfeet Nation, Fort Belknap Indian Community, Chippewa Cree Tribe of Rocky Boy’s Reservation, the Helena School District, and the Bigfork Food Bank all were supportive of the legislation during the session.
The bill passed the House 68-30 and the Senate 28-22 in each body’s final vote on the legislation. About 21,000 students currently qualify for free and reduced school lunch bills.
“The Governor failed Montana students today, in particular the most vulnerable,” House Minority leader Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula, said in a press release. “Under the Governor’s watch, low-income kids will continue to enter into debt with their school cafeteria, skip meals, and go hungry in the classroom.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1402987108-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-20 19:03:13.145183

Joe Cook/Georgia RiversAn Alabama-based company that was close to receiving the final go-ahead from the state to mine near the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge has decided to instead sell the land to a nonprofit focused on conserving at-risk sites.
Twin Pines Minerals, which first proposed the controversial mining project in 2019, is in the process of selling about 8,000 acres near the refuge to The Conservation Fund. Twin Pines’ president Steve Ingle confirmed the sale through his public relations firm but declined further comment Friday.
The nearly $60 million land deal will halt a mining project that became the poster child of the first Trump administration’s move to scale back federal protections for the nation’s waterways. That left the decision on whether to approve the project in the hands of state regulators, who issued draft permits early last year that were close to being finalized.
The sale also presents a second time a mining proposal near the swamp was thwarted due to public outcry. A DuPont proposal in the 1990s near the refuge faced intense pressure, and the company eventually dropped the project and sold the land to The Conservation Fund. 
Stacy Funderburke, who serves as vice president of The Conservation Fund’s central Southeast region, said efforts to buy the land around Trail Ridge — the mineral-rich target of mining companies that is seen as an important barrier for the swamp — had been in the works for roughly three years. The deal includes the mineral rights for the site. 
“This is the most important conservation project that we’ve ever worked on because of how imminent the threat was, not only to this site, but to the entire Okefenokee Swamp,” Funderburke said.
The sale is set to be completed by the end of July, though The Conservation Fund is hoping to continue raising money from private donors and foundations. Currently there are between 10 and 15 major donors who are funding the project, and more expected to contribute down the road, Funderburke said. 
Funderburke also credits environmental activists across Georgia for their work drawing awareness to the swamp, which he said was a key factor in acquiring the philanthropic backing needed to purchase the land.
“The public response since this threat started six years ago — all the work that’s been done, and all the voices of people across Georgia that have come out and said that it’s not worth the risk to a place like the Okefenokee to have mining immediately next door — that is why I think funders and others have been willing to step up to the table,” he said. “It’s really hearing the loud voice of everyone who wants to see this protected.” 
The refuge has also been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, which would cement its status as an international tourist destination on par with the Grand Canyon and Galápagos Islands. 
‘Settled in a good way’
The mining proposal sparked a public outcry and was at the center of a yearslong debate at the state Capitol, where lawmakers from both parties pushed for protections for Trail Ridge. 
Rep. Darlene Taylor, a Thomasville Republican who has become known as one of the swamp’s chief defenders at the statehouse, said Friday that she was delighted by the news.
“Protecting the swamp was what it was all about, and I just feel so much better knowing that it’s going to be secure,” Taylor said.
Taylor said the announced land deal is an ideal compromise.
“It was settled in a good way,” she said. “I think everybody in it can be pretty calm about it at this point. [The Okefenokee Swamp is] being protected, they’re being compensated for it, and we can move forward now.”
U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat, had opposed the project from Washington.
“This step toward protecting the Okefenokee Swamp is great news for all Georgians and our beloved natural treasure,” he said in a statement. “For years, I’ve been sounding the alarm that strip mining near the Okefenokee Swamp poses irreversible damage to an irreplaceable natural resource.” 
‘A model for protecting Trail Ridge’
From the start, the mining project was met with concerns about the potential impact on the swamp’s water levels and an ecosystem that is home to thousands of species of animals and plants.
A broad coalition that included environmental groups, faith leaders and others relentlessly warned of the project’s potential harm to the largest blackwater swamp in North America.
Those groups helped galvanize an army of Okefenokee Swamp fans who flooded state regulators any time public input was sought along the way.
“This is an incredibly special outcome and there is no place more deserving than the Okefenokee,” said Megan Huynh, a senior attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center. “Georgians sent a clear message to Twin Pines Minerals that mining next to the Okefenokee is an unacceptable risk.
“This wouldn’t have been possible without a powerful coalition, and regular Georgians who were willing to stand up and defend a place as beloved as the Okefenokee,” Huynh said. 
Rena Ann Peck, executive director of Georgia Rivers, said the deal will help pave the way to conserve more of Trail Ridge. There are still more than 25,000 acres left vulnerable to mining, Peck said. 
“I think this is a model for protecting Trail Ridge, the outright land conservation through acquisition and conservation easements,” Peck said. “Retiring the mining rights is paramount to saving it in perpetuity.”
As an advocate, Peck was a vocal critic of the Twin Pines’ proposal. But she said her favorite part of the job is bringing potential land conservation buyers to the Okefenokee in hopes of helping them form a connection with the swamp. 
“I show them the vastness,” she said. “I like to say that you can paddle these 120 miles of canoe trails and still only see 2% of the swamp.”

(Photo by Mathieu Lewis-Rolland/Getty Images)Washington won’t receive federal aid to cover tens of millions of dollars in damage to public property caused by last fall’s bomb cyclone.
The Trump administration denied the state’s request for federal disaster relief in April. Washington filed an appeal, but the administration rejected it Thursday.
The two-paragraph letter penned by a top Federal Emergency Management Agency official says a thorough review reaffirmed the original decision that federal aid “is not warranted.” No reasons are given.
“They still refuse to explain their outrageous decision,” Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a statement. “My team and I are working to exhaust every possible avenue to get additional support for our state’s recovery. We cannot count on the Trump Administration to uphold its responsibilities to Washingtonians.”
Last month, Washington’s entire congressional delegation sent a letter to President Donald Trump, urging him to reconsider the April denial.
“It is outrageous,” U.S. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, said Friday. “This is exactly the kind of catastrophic event federal disaster aid was designed for. There is simply no justification for this betrayal that leaves local communities and residents of Washington state shouldering painful disaster recovery costs when the federal government was supposed to have their backs.”
The intense November storm damaged hundreds of homes and businesses, caused widespread power outages and killed two people. 
Then-Gov. Jay Inslee declared a disaster and opened up $1 million in state recovery funding for those hit by the storm in King, Snohomish and Whatcom counties. The U.S. Small Business Administration also made low-interest disaster assistance loans available for residents and businesses in Chelan, King, Kitsap, Kittitas, Pierce, Snohomish and Yakima counties.
In January, Inslee asked for federal aid from FEMA to repair damage to highways, public utilities and more. His request focused on Grays Harbor, King, Pacific, Snohomish, Wahkiakum and Walla Walla counties. The state’s request outlined over $34 million in damages across the six counties.

The Zizians have been linked to several homicides across the country, including the fatal shooting in January of a border patrol agent in Vermont.

The alleged leader of the Zizians, Jack LaSota, already jailed in Maryland on state misdemeanor drug and gun charges, has now been indicted on a federal felony firearms offense.
The Zizians have been connected to a cross-country string of homicides, including the fatal shooting earlier this year of a border patrol agent in northern Vermont. 
A federal grand jury in Maryland this week indicted LaSota, 34, of Fairbanks, Alaska, also known as Andrea Phelps, Ann Grimes, Anne Grimes, Canaris, Julia LaSota and Ziz, on a charge of being a fugitive from justice in possession of firearms and ammunition.  
The charge carries a maximum penalty of up to 15 years, if the accused is convicted. 
Prosecutors alleged in court records that LaSota possessed several firearms in February, including a .50-caliber rifle, a handgun and hundreds of rounds of ammunition. At the time, according to court records, LaSota was a fugitive from justice and as a result was not permitted to possess a firearm or ammunition.

The federal charge against LaSota stems from his arrest Feb. 16 in Frostburg, Maryland, along with companions Daniel Blank and Michelle Zajko. 
All three pleaded not guilty earlier this month to multiple state charges, including trespassing, obstructing arrest and possession of firearms. A Maryland state court ordered them held in custody while those state cases remain pending. 
Zajko has also been charged with federal firearms offenses in Vermont. No court appearance has been set in that case. 
Federal prosecutors in Vermont alleged that Zajko bought the weapons that were in the possession of Teresa Youngblut and Felix Bauckholt, also known as Ophelia, earlier this year. 
Youngblut and Bauckholt were stopped in January by federal agents on Interstate 91 in a traffic stop that led to a shootout that left Bauckholt and Border Patrol Agent David “Chris” Maland dead. 
Youngblut has been charged in Vermont with federal firearms and assault charges in connection with that shootout. Youngblut has pleaded not guilty to the offenses and a hearing in that case is set for next week in federal court in Burlington. 
LaSota, Blank, Youngblut, Bauckholt and Zajko all allegedly had ties to the Zizians, a loosely connected group of people and offshoot of the Rationalist movement. 
Another person linked to the Zizian group, Maximilian Snyder, was arrested in the Jan. 17 murder of a Vallejo, California, landlord. Snyder and Youngblut had previously applied for a marriage certificate in Washington state. 
Zajko’s parents were fatally shot in their Pennsylvania home on New Year’s Eve in 2022, according to police, and Zajko was questioned in their deaths in January 2023. In a letter to the media earlier this year, Zajko denied involvement in the fatal shootings, writing, “I didn’t murder my parents.” 
LaSota, the namesake of the Zizian group, had been charged in 2023 in Pennsylvania with disorderly conduct and obstruction in connection with the probe into the death of Zajko’s parents, according to court records. LaSota did not show up for later court hearings after posting bail and being released, according to court documents.
It’s not clear from the federal indictment handed down this week if the charge of being a fugitive from justice in possession of firearms and ammunition stems from LaSota not appearing for hearings in the Pennsylvania case.  
A spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Maryland could not be reached Friday for comment. No attorney was listed for LaSota in the court filings and his lawyer in the state court case could not be reached Friday for comment.

The 5th U.S. Court of Appeals, often cited as one of the most conservative courts in the nation, found the law unconstitutional because it violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which bars the government from endorsing a religion or creating laws that favor one religion over another.
The decision upholds a lower court’s injunction that blocked the law from taking effect in five of Louisiana’s K-12 school districts after families with students in those districts sued the state last year. The injunction applies only to the districts where those plaintiffs live.
“We are grateful for this decision, which honors the religious diversity and religious-freedom rights of public school families across Louisiana,” the Rev. Darcy Roake, a plaintiff in the case with her husband, Adrian Van Young, said in a statement from their attorneys. “As an interfaith family, we believe that our children should receive their religious education at home and within our faith communities, not from government officials.”
The legal battle began in June 2024 when Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law a bill requiring every school in Louisiana to display posters with a Protestant version of the Ten Commandments.
The appeals court wrote that “under the statute’s minimum requirements, the [Ten Commandments] posters must be indiscriminately displayed in every public school classroom in Louisiana regardless of class subject-matter,” and thus, if allowed to go up, “those displays will cause an ‘irreparable’ deprivation of [the Plaintiffs’] First Amendment rights.”
“This ruling will ensure that Louisiana families – not politicians or public-school officials – get to decide if, when and how their children engage with religion,” said Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, one of the groups that represented plaintiffs in the case. “It should send a strong message to Christian Nationalists across the country that they cannot impose their beliefs on our nation’s public-school children. Not on our watch.”
“Religious freedom — the right to choose one’s faith without pressure—is essential to American democracy,” said Alanah Odoms, executive director of the ACLU of Louisiana. “Today’s ruling ensures that the schools our plaintiffs’ children attend will stay focused on learning, without promoting a state-preferred version of Christianity.”
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, also a Republican, said she intends to seek a review from the full 5th Circuit and, if necessary, turn to the U.S. Supreme Court.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Beef, pie, wine, honey and produce are just a few things Iowans might find on the Choose Iowa Farm Store Crawl happening Saturday and Sunday across the state. 
The crawl is part of the state-run local food marketing and branding initiative to encourage Iowans to support local farms and businesses. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the inaugural crawl is a “fantastic opportunity” for Iowans, and visitors, to experience the “diverse and thriving agriculture” of the state. 
“By connecting directly with local farmers, businesses and restaurants, this inaugural event celebrates Iowa’s rich agricultural heritage and showcases our abundant supply of Iowa grown, made and raised food, beverages and ag products,” Naig said in a statement announcing the event. 
The crawl is a self-guided experience, though Choose Iowa has curated several interactive maps of farms, farm-to-table restaurants and businesses to help Iowans plan their routes. 
The overall map, as well as region-specific information, can be found on Choose Iowa’s website. Choose Iowa has more than 280 members selling or producing local goods in rural and urban parts of the state. Nearly 70 members are participating in the farm crawl event. 
Farm crawlers can also log their stops on the Choose Iowa digital passport for an opportunity to win prizes and receive coupons to their favorite local haunts. 
The farm crawl coincides with Iowa Barn Foundation’s spring barn tour, which allows visitors to tour unique barns through “picturesque” settings in Cedar County. 
The farm crawl and barn tours take place Saturday and Sunday, June 21-22. Hours for each stop are listed on the interactive map.

(Photo courtesy of State Historical Society of North Dakota. SHSND 00080-00232)Bruce Hagen, who served on North Dakota’s Public Service Commission for 39 years, died Thursday at age 94 in Bismarck.
Hagen is believed to be the only Democrat to serve on the state’s Public Service Commission. 
The Devils Lake native was appointed to fill a vacancy on the three-member board in 1961 by Gov. William Guy. He was reelected to six six-year terms, choosing not to run for reelection in 2000.
He was known for reaching across party lines.
“Two parties are healthy for all levels of government and regulatory commissioners are no exception,” he wrote in an article submitted in 2006 to the National Regulatory Research Institute.  
The PSC regulates utilities and telecommunications, oversees siting for pipelines and energy projects and has a hand in grain and railroad regulations. Hagen and his contemporaries are credited with spearheading the regulation of coal, electricity, oil and gas and electricity in North Dakota. 
His career spanned North Dakota extending telephone service to the entire state in the 1970s to regulating cellphone service in the 1990s.
“I believe that in our capitalist democratic system of government, regulation of monopolies is very important. The counter-balancing power of the people through a fair system of regulation helps preserve democracy,” Hagen wrote in the 2006 article. 
After leaving office, Hagen cited accomplishments such as the PSC taking on reclamation of coal-mined land in 1969, creating what he referred to as “the best reclamation system in the world.”
Hagen also chaired a committee under Gov. George Sinner’s administration to coordinate the state’s first observance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1986, after it became a federal holiday.
He made unsuccessful runs for Congress in 1968 and 1978. 
Former North Dakota Sen. Byron Dorgan said that Hagen stood out among state leaders for his lifelong service.
“There was one North Dakotan named Bruce Hagen who, for decades, relentlessly continued his dedicated public service to our state,” Dorgan, a Democrat, said Friday in an email. “He was a thoughtful, quiet leader whose judgement on important issues always supported the best interests of the people he served.”

Hagen first got involved with politics in 1960, when he was invited to campaign with Guy, who was running for governor. Hagen at the time unsuccessfully ran for commissioner of agriculture and labor as a Democratic-NPL candidate. He spent a short time as deputy registrar for motor vehicles before his appointment to the Public Service Commission.
Susan Wefald, a Republican who served alongside Hagen on the Public Service Commission in the 1990s, called Hagen a thoughtful and outgoing commissioner who always did his homework. She noted he was known to save every paper that came across his desk.
Hagen’s daughter Marin said she has fond memories of visiting her father’s office and joining him in parades during campaign season. 
She said when her father traveled to Washington, D.C., for an annual conference for utility regulators, he always insisted on staying with family or friends so the state wouldn’t have to spend taxpayer money on his lodging.
“That’s just how he was programmed,” she said. “He always did the right thing.”
Marin described her father as a “voracious reader” and a lifelong learner. He also enjoyed gardening, traveling and spending time in nature. She said when her family would visit relatives in Devils Lake, her father would always stop the car and take a moment to admire the landscape.
“He always wanted to look at the land, and I sort of rolled my eyes when I was younger,” she recalled. “I appreciate it now.”
In 1988, Sinner awarded Hagen the North Dakota National Leadership Award of Excellence. At the time, Hagen was serving as the president of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners.
In announcing that he would not seek reelection in 2000, Hagen said: “I have enjoyed and appreciated working on the commission over all these years to help the vital, necessary industries change, modernize and become more efficient while bringing reasonably priced services to North Dakota people.” 
In 2018, the North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party recognized Hagen with the Spirit of the Non-Partisan League Award. 
Hagen served in the Korean War. He continued to farm in Benson and Ramsey counties during his years in office. Funeral services, which have not yet been scheduled, will be at Parkway Funeral Home in Bismarck and at the Norway Lutheran Church Cemetery west of Devils Lake.

,DC,2025-06-20 22:08:32+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Vance dispatched to LA after Trump administration court victory in National Guard case,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/vance-dispatched-la-after-trump-administration-court-victory-national-guard-case,,"Vice President J.D. Vance took a victory lap to Los Angeles Friday, following a federal appeals court’s ruling that the administration could retain control of the California National Guard troops responding to protests earlier this month over immigration raids in the city.“BIG WIN in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on the President’s core power to call in the National Guard!” President Donald Trump wrote on social media following the decision.Vance was scheduled to visit an FBI building being used by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, meet with law enforcement leadership and U.S. Marines and deliver remarks, according to a White House release Friday morning.The trip was announced about 12 hours after the administration’s win at the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that Trump could keep control of the 4,000 National Guard troops he’d ordered to Los Angeles.Three judges on the appeals court issued a unanimous opinion Thursday evening that courts had to afford the president wide discretion to decide when a state National Guard can be federalized, leaving command in Trump’s hands while California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s lawsuit challenging the deployment is ongoing. The case has been closely watched by leaders of states around the country.The order overturns a lower court’s ruling that Trump return control of the troops to Newsom, a Democrat who opposed sending the National Guard to Los Angeles. Newsom has said the Guard troops’ presence has only inflamed tensions between anti-ICE protesters and law enforcement.The president has the authority to deploy troops to a state with or without the governor’s consent, the panel of appeals judges said Thursday.The state’s “concerns have more bearing on the question of whether the President should have federalized the California National Guard, not whether he had the authority to do so,” the panel, made up of two judges appointed by Trump and one by former Democratic President Joe Biden, wrote.They opted to revoke the district court’s temporary restraining order, reasoning that the federal government stood a good chance of ultimately prevailing on the case.Quelling rebellion, enforcing lawsAttorneys for the state had argued in federal court that Trump’s order was invalid because he did not show the conditions that the statute Trump cited, Section 12406 of U.S. Code Title X, required for federalization of a National Guard had been met and because the order was sent to the California National Guard adjutant general, not to Newsom himself.The 9th Circuit panel rejected both arguments.Based on the language of the statute alone, the judges might have required greater support for the federal government’s position, which may have helped California’s case, the order said.But under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, the president only must meet a low standard to show that deployment is warranted to enforce laws or quell a rebellion, the judges wrote in language that resembled what Judge Jennifer Sung, the Biden appointee, said during oral arguments Tuesday.“We are not writing on a blank slate,” they wrote. “The history of Congress’s statutory delegations of its calling forth power, and a line of cases …  interpreting those delegations, strongly suggest that our review of the President’s determinations in this context is especially deferential.”The federal government’s evidence that protesters had thrown rocks and other objects at ICE officers, vandalized federal property and attacked vans used by ICE was enough to satisfy that standard, the judges wrote.Trump quickly took to social media. “The Judges obviously realized that Gavin Newscum is incompetent and ill prepared, but this is much bigger than Gavin, because all over the United States, if our Cities, and our people, need protection, we are the ones to give it to them should State and Local Police be unable, for whatever reason, to get the job done,” Trump wrote.In amicus briefs in the case, Democratic state leaders have said they see Trump’s use of the National Guard as a threat to their ability to use their Guards for state-level functions, including drug interdiction and natural disaster relief.Some reviewabilityThe opinion did, however, reject the U.S. Justice Department’s argument that a president’s federalization order could never be questioned in court.In a statement, Newsom praised that aspect of the ruling and pledged to “press forward” with the case.“The court rightly rejected Trump’s claim that he can do whatever he wants with the National Guard and not have to explain himself to a court,” Newsom said. “The President is not a king and is not above the law.""U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer canceled oral arguments at a previously scheduled Friday morning hearing in the trial court, after the 9th Circuit order.Breyer anticipated that the state may pursue a challenge based on a potential violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the military from engaging in domestic law enforcement, and asked each side to file a brief by noon Pacific time on June 23 arguing whether the trial court or appeals court should first hear that issue.",,,,2025-06-20 19:03:13.145183

Addressing Israel’s attacks against Iran Wednesday in a call with reporters, Grassley said he would “prefer military action only if there’s an immediate threat to the United States.” He said he prefers “negotiation over military action,” but notes “Iran is an enemy of the United States.”

In a discussion with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth during a hearing with the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services, Ernst questioned the role of Iran in the Oct. 7 attack against Israel by the militant group Hamas. 
“Forty-three Americans lost their lives on October 7th, at the hands of Hamas, which is an Iran-backed terrorist organization,” Ernst said during the hearing. “When there is question about whether it’s appropriate for America to be engaged in the Middle East and defending Americans that live and work abroad, I think there’s our answer.”
Ernst works with newly appointed defense official to prevent sexual assault in the military
Ernst announced at the hearing she would hold quarterly meeting with newly appointed Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office overseer Steve Erickson. Hegseth noted a decrease in military sexual assault numbers this year at this discussion. Ernst also said she plans to propose an amendment that would require quarterly briefings from SAPRO to members of Congress 
“We want to make sure that we continue the momentum that we are seeing within the Department,” Ernst said in a press release. 
Advocates urge Iowa senators not to ‘Shut Down’ the clean energy tax credit
A six-figure advertising campaign launched by Protect Our Jobs is urging Grassley and Ernst to stop cuts to clean energy production. POJ is an eight-figure campaign defending clean energy workers and local economies. The commercial “Shut Down,” is currently playing on television channels in Des Moines, Omaha and Cedar Rapids. It will also run on digital platforms within the state.
Several supporting research papers were included in the initial press release to provide data points on Iowa’s clean energy economy: 
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 2023, roughly 62% of Iowa’s total energy production comes from clean energy sources of which roughly 59% came from wind power. According to a research brief published by Bluegreen Alliance , repealing clean energy tax credits puts an estimated 4,329 Iowa jobs at risk. This also could pose a risk to the 99 data centers stationed in Iowa, one of the largest concentrations in the midwest.
“When Congress talks about cutting clean energy production, that’s a major problem for Iowa’s economy,” said the narrator in the ad.“We’ll see businesses shut down, higher energy bills for families, and farmers struggle. Our senators, Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst, know what clean energy means to Iowa. Senators, the stakes are high for Iowa, let’s stop these cuts to clean energy production.”
Grassley-led resolution to promote streaming service passes Senate unanimously
A bipartisan resolution from Grassley and Minnesota Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar urges all television providers to carry the network C-SPAN 2, which provides an uninterrupted coverage of the Senate floor.
“Transparency brings accountability, and C-SPAN’s coverage has brought transparency to the people’s business,” Grassley said in a press release. “The Senate unanimously stands behind C-SPAN in its fight to be platformed by streaming giants.”
Grassley-led resolution to rededicate June to stopping elder abuse
Grassley and Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal introduced a bipartisan resolution to recognize June as “National Elder Abuse Awareness Month.” The resolution also seeks to stand “in support of seniors who’ve been victim to fraud schemes.” This would coincide with the federal recognition of June as LGBTQ Pride month. June has been federally recognized as Pride month for 14 of the last 25 years.
“For every elder abuse case that’s reported, as many as 24 go unreported. These aren’t just numbers. They’re our parents, our grandparents, our neighbors and our veterans,” Grassley said Monday on the Senate floor. “Elder abuse isn’t limited by geography or income. It occurs in nursing homes and private residences — the very places meant to offer them care and protection.”
Nunn-led act aims to combat agriculture cyber-attacks
Reps. Zach Nunn and Don Davis, a Democratic legislator from North Carolina, introduced an act to establish five “Regional Agriculture Cybersecurity Centers.” This bill seeks to “safeguard Iowa’s agricultural economy from cyber threats by harnessing the expertise of land-grant universities including Iowa State University.”
“We’ve already seen hackers shut down grain handling and meat processing operations with just a few lines of code, stealing American agricultural technology or holding our food supply for ransom,” Nunn said in a press release. “By leveraging Iowa’s leadership in agricultural and cyber defense innovation at institutions like Iowa State, we’re putting the nation’s top minds to work protecting the backbone of America’s economy: our farmers.”
Feenstra leads bill to expand rural broadband network
Reps. Randy Feenstra and Teresa Leger Fernandez, a Democratic legislator from New Hampshire, introduced a bill to aid the construction of broadband in rural Iowa. This act would require “edge providers,” such as Google, Amazon, etc., to contribute funds to networks built and maintained by the Universal Service Fund. 
“Access to high-speed internet is critical to our economic growth in rural communities. Families, farmers, and businesses across rural Iowa go to great lengths to collect and deploy the necessary funds to build reliable, affordable broadband,” Feenstra said in a press release. “However, Big Tech companies use these networks once completed but rarely contribute their fair share towards the cost. It is completely unfair.”
Miller-Meeks discusses ‘big, beautiful bill’ with Muscatine small business owners 
Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks visited small business owners in Muscatine this to hear their thoughts on the “big, beautiful bill.”
“I proudly voted for President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill,” Miller-Meeks said in a press release. “It cuts taxes, eliminates red tape, and gives working families and small businesses the freedom to grow and thrive. I’ll never stop fighting to protect Iowa’s values and way of life.”
Hinson ‘applauds’ new renewable fuel requirements for 2026-2027
Rep. Ashley Hinson issued a statement in response to the Environmental Protection Agency’s announcement to increase Renewable Volume Obligation levels in 2026 and 2027. RVO’s dictate the amount of renewable fuel that gasoline and diesel refineries have to blend into their fuel supply. 
“Earlier this year, I led a bipartisan letter to President Trump, urging him to propose robust blending targets, especially for biodiesel, after the Biden Administration’s low RVOs caused several biodiesel plants in the Midwest to stop production,” Hinson said in a press release. “This is a strong first step, and I look forward to my continued work with President Trump and Administrator (Lee) Zeldin to expand domestic production of liquid transportation fuels.”

The Vermont Department of Health said the number of emergency room visits for Covid-19 briefly dropped to zero, although it has since ticked up.

The number of emergency room visits for Covid-19 in Vermont hit zero multiple times over the past week, “at or nearing” a historic low for that indicator, the Department of Health reported Wednesday.
The health department first reported a drop in Covid-19 hospital visits in its weekly surveillance report. Epidemiologist John Davy confirmed via email there have been a few recent days with no emergency room visits, with the rolling average around one. 
He wrote that overall hospitalizations for the disease, which includes Vermonters who have been in the hospital with Covid-19 for days or weeks, have not dropped to zero. But the number of current patients has been in the “low single digits” in recent weeks. 
In past years, the period of late spring and early summer has been marked by low rates, followed by a rise in the late summer into early fall. Davy wrote it “remains to be seen” if that pattern will reappear in the coming months. 
“There have been recent outbreaks in Long-Term Care facilities, so there is clearly some amount of COVID circulating,” he wrote.
Chart via the Vermont Department of Health
The state health department also reported it has detected the presence of a new Covid-19 variant, NB.1.8.1. The variant has made international headlines for causing severe sore throats nicknamed “razor blade throats.” But it has not been found in Vermont in large numbers, Davy wrote. 
“There is no clear indication that NB.1.8.1 is associated with greater disease severity,” he wrote. “Preliminary lab studies suggest that vaccines will be effective against severe outcomes from this strain.”
The future of vaccines themselves are still uncertain, however. Covid-19 vaccines tailored to the dominant strains of the virus have typically become available in early fall, along with other seasonal vaccines like influenza. But U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has a long history of anti-vaccine activism. 
Kennedy recently dropped the recommendation for pregnant people and healthy children to receive the vaccine and dismissed all 17 members of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine advisory panel, replacing them with eight of his own appointees, some of whom have previously objected to the Covid-19 shots. The panel is slated to hold its first meeting June 25.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Central Iowa Water Works reinforced Friday that water coming out of the system’s treatment plants continues to meet federal safe drinking water standards. 
The regional water production authority said the lawn-watering ban has been effective at reducing load and allowing treatment facilities to keep the drinking water nitrate levels below the federal limit, despite near historic levels in source water. 
“We don’t anticipate that there’s going to be any concern with our water not meeting safe drinking water standards because of the hard work that everyone is doing with the lawn watering ban,” Tami Madsen, CIWW executive director said at a press conference Friday. 
CIWW issued a lawn watering ban on June 12 due to exceptionally high levels of nitrate which can cause problems like blue-baby syndrome or other adverse health effects when consumed in high concentrations.

Rumors circulated on social media Thursday that CIWW was expecting nitrate concentrations in output water to exceed the federal safety standards, but Madsen shut down the rumors and said CIWW has “no concerns” of that happening, because the lawn watering ban has been so effective.

Madsen said while CIWW does not expect its output to exceed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s drinking water standard, which for nitrates has a maximum of 10 milligrams per liter, but if it did CIWW would communicate with the public. 
“Unless you hear it directly from Central Iowa Water Works, our water is still safe to consume through the safe drinking water standards,” Madsen said. 
Des Moines Water Works’ Fleur Drive plant and the Saylorville Water Treatment plant have the capacity to remove nitrates from the water. CIWW has plans to expand treatment capacity by 25% in the coming years, which would help to reduce future lawn watering bans. 
Iowans across the state asked to conserve water due to dry wells, high nitrate levels

Madsen said the nitrate levels in the river have gone up slightly due to recent rainfall. Friday afternoon figures from CIWW had the Des Moines River at 14 mg/l and the Raccoon River at 15 mg/l. Water coming out of out of the system had concentrations around 8 mg/l. 
Madsen said on average it cost about $16,000 a day to operate the nitrate removal facility, which is only turned on at the Fleur Drive facility when necessary. Nitrate levels tend to spike in the spring and early summer when rain washes nutrients off of fields and other surfaces up the watershed. During the current spring flush of nitrates to the system, the removal facility has been operating for more than 60 days. 
The levels in the Des Moines and Raccoon Rivers are below 10 mg/l for most of the year, according to charts from the Iowa Water Quality Information System. 
Saylorville facility 
Madsen spoke Friday outside of the Saylorville Water Treatment Plant which uses ultra filtration membranes and reverse osmosis filtering to remove contaminants, including nitrates, from water it sources from groundwater wells along the Des Moines River. 
Ted Corrigan, CIWW’s system operator, said this dual-membrane filtration is the normal process, regardless of nitrate levels, for the 10-million-gallon per day facility. 
Corrigan said membrane treatment is “the next generation” of water treatment technology, and represents the direction the industry is moving to treat drinking water. 
The Saylorville facility is in the design phase to double its capacity as part of several planned CIWW projects to expand capacity. Madsen said this expansion was in response to the anticipated capacity increases from residential growth, rather than higher anticipated levels of nitrates in source water.

The Saylorville expansion, along with a new facility in West Des Moines and expansion in Grimes, however, will all have the ability to filter nitrates. The total expansion is expected to be completed within the next seven years, and cost estimates are around $1.3 billion according to a regional water treatment facility study. 
CIWW officials did not respond to questions relating to funding for the expansion projects and to pay for operating the nitrate removal system.
Madsen, when asked about efforts to control nitrate runoff up the watershed, said the focus of CIWW is to “continue to provide safe drinking water” to the region.
For now, that means the lawn watering ban stays in place until further notice. CIWW allowed splash pads and spraygrounds to reopen Thursday to help Iowans cool off during the anticipated high temperatures this weekend. 
“We just need to continue to stay vigilant with the lawn watering ban so that we can reduce the capacity to be able to continue providing water that meets all safe drinking water standards,” Madsen said. 
Central Iowa Water Works posts regular updates about the ban and nitrate levels on social media and on its website.

This story by Jason Starr was first published in the Williston Observer on June 19.
The brick office building at 188 Harvest Lane that houses the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency was sold in May by Burlington’s Pizzagalli Properties to a Washington D.C. company that specializes in leasing property to government agencies.
The sale of the 75,000-square-foot building closed for $20 million, according to Williston Town Clerk property records.
Though the building has changed hands, its use as ICE’s “Law Enforcement Support Center” — staffed 24-7 to help law enforcement agencies around the country prosecute immigration cases — won’t change. The buyer, Easterly Government Properties, Inc., said in a news release that the building comes with a “non-cancelable” lease with the U.S. General Services Administration that runs through 2031.
“With this asset, we continue to increase our cash flows derived from federal agency tenants like the DHS and facilitate operations which remain mission-critical to the safety and security of the United States,” Easterly President and Chief Executive Officer Darrell Crate said in the release.
Easterly owns about 100 properties throughout the country that are leased to the federal government, the release states.
The ICE website describes the Williston building as a single point of contact for law enforcement agencies around the world, “providing real-time assistance … regarding aliens suspected, arrested or convicted of criminal activity.”
A detailed description of its operations on the site outlines the center’s role in helping law enforcement personnel verify immigration status and “remove aliens from the U.S. who pose a threat to public safety and national security.” Staff also conduct proactive investigations to inform ICE field officers’ work around the country.
The building has been the epicenter of citizen protests against immigration policies under President Donald Trump, both in his first and current terms. Most recently, hundreds of protesters marched along Harvest Lane and gathered in front of the building on May 1.
“I’m here because I believe in social justice and human rights,” Shelburne’s Joanna Cole told VTDigger during a May 1 interview in front of the building. “I do not want any immigrants forced out, especially illegally. I think it’s horrible so many people are being kidnapped off the street and being thrown in jail.”
Pizzagalli Development Manager Bob Bouchard said the protests had no impact on the company’s decision to sell.
“We are selling a few of our properties right now,” Bouchard said.
Pizzagalli built the building in 1999 after winning a U.S. government bid to provide office space to what was then the Immigration and Naturalization Service. It was a deal facilitated by longtime Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy in an effort to bring federal jobs to the area.
“It’s been a great property with a great tenant,” Bouchard said. “We have nothing but positive things to say about the lessee, which is the government, or the occupant, which is ICE.”
He said the company recently completed upgrades to the building with the intention to sell.
“As soon as we were done with the renovations, the property went on the market,” Bouchard said, calling Easterly a “first-class organization.”

The program would offer people accused of criminal ordinance violations a chance to engage with the community rather than facing immediate court action.

BURLINGTON — City leaders hope a new program aimed at responding to low-level crimes will help increase public safety. 
At a City Hall press briefing on Wednesday, Burlington Mayor Mulvaney-Stanak introduced City Circle, a community-based initiative designed to respond more effectively to minor criminal ordinance violations and reduce repeat offenses downtown. The violations could include littering, public possession of alcohol, unlawful trespass, disorderly conduct and unlawful mischief, among others.
People who commit these violations would have the chance to discuss their offense with the community.  The program would discourage disruptive behaviors by holding people accountable for their actions.
“The goal is to connect and engage with people and provide them with the support that they need to build their capacity to be accountable for any harm that their behavior is causing in the community,” City Attorney Jessica Brown said. 
If someone accused of a criminal ordinance violation decided not to join in the program, they would receive a court summons. The city attorney’s office would file charges in the Vermont Superior Court and could request a warrant if they failed to appear.

City Circle would be run by the Burlington Community Justice Center and involve law enforcement or community service officers, volunteers who live or work in the downtown center, and the victim of the crime, if they chose to take part.
Brown said the ordinance to establish City Circle still needs feedback from different stakeholders and will be presented to the City Council and Ordinance Committee in the next few months. The goal is to have it take effect by the end of September.
“Based on some initial conversations with a couple of city councilors, who both expressed enthusiasm about the City Circle concept, we’re also confident that the Ordinance Committee and City Council will approach this project with a spirit of collaboration toward passage,” Brown wrote in a statement to VTDigger. “Generally I think there is enthusiasm among many stakeholders for trying something new when what we’ve been doing within the system has not been particularly effective.”
The mayor also presented another initiative called Situation Table, which is meant to complement City Circle. The program would bring together different organizations, city agencies and police officers to share expertise and provide services based on people’s specific needs. Focus areas would vary in different communities but could include services related to mental health and addiction, housing, education, health, and child and family services.
Situation Table is already widely used in Canada and the U.S., including four tables in other Vermont communities.

NEW ORLEANS — A federal appeals court on Friday struck down a Louisiana law that requires public schools to display the Ten Commandments in every classroom.
The 5th U.S. Court of Appeals, often described as one of the most conservative courts in the nation, found the law unconstitutional because it violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment, which bars the government from endorsing a religion or creating laws that favor one religion over another.
The decision upholds a lower court’s injunction that blocked the law from taking effect in five of Louisiana’s K-12 school districts after families with students in those districts sued the state last year. The injunction applies only to the districts where those plaintiffs live.
The legal battle began in June 2024 when Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law a bill requiring every school in Louisiana to display posters with a Protestant version of the Ten Commandments.
The appeals court wrote that “under the statute’s minimum requirements, the [Ten Commandments] posters must be indiscriminately displayed in every public school classroom in Louisiana regardless of class subject-matter,” and thus, if allowed to go up, “those displays will cause an ‘irreparable’ deprivation of [the Plaintiffs’] First Amendment rights.”
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, also a Republican, said she intends to seek a review from the full 5th Circuit and, if necessary, turn to the U.S. Supreme Court.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The 16-year-old accused of shooting and killing three people — including a pregnant woman and an infant — at a West Valley City carnival over the weekend is being charged as an adult.
Prosecutors charged Matthiaz Cantre Lauti Ioane-Register with four counts of aggravated murder and nine counts of felony discharge of a firearm in Salt Lake County’s 3rd District Court, according to court documents unveiled on Friday. 
Police say Ioane-Register was at West Valley City’s WestFest on Sunday when he opened fire in a crowded area, killing an 18-year-old who was believed to be the intended target, as well as a 41-year-old woman and an 8-month-old baby. 
The baby was killed in a stroller alongside their twin sibling, prosecutors say.

The 41-year-old woman was eight weeks pregnant, according to Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill. Ioane-Register is also being charged with the murder of her unborn child. Two other teenagers — a 15-year-old and 17-year-old —- were injured after sustaining gunshot wounds to their arms, Gill said.  
Per federal law, children charged as adults cannot face the death penalty or be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Ioane-Register is currently being held in jail without bail. 
Gill also confirmed an ongoing investigation into whether responding officers fired their weapons. On Sunday, a West Valley City Police Department spokesperson said one of the officers fired a single round toward the suspect, but didn’t hit him or any of the victims.
“Anytime a law enforcement officer uses any lethal force we have a task force that is involved to do that investigation,” Gill said. “That did happen and that’s a separate, unconnected investigation that is pending.” 
Gill told reporters that the shooting is likely gang-related. Ioane-Register, believed to be a member of the gang Titanic Crips Society, was seen on surveillance footage confronting a group of people at the carnival who Gill said were likely part of a rival gang. Moments later, Ioane-Register opened fire, using a handgun that prosecutors say was reported stolen in Louisiana.

Officers recovered 12 shell casings from the area, according to court documents. They believe Ioane-Register fired the handgun in the crowded area until the magazine was empty.
The 16-year-old then quickly turned to flee but was apprehended by police. Gill described the aftermath of the shooting as tense, as people gathered around a detained Ioane-Register, yelling at him and screaming “F— TCS,” the acronym for the gang. 
Police then moved Ioane-Register to a more secluded area, according to the charges, where he denied shooting anyone other than his intended target, for whom he appeared to show little remorse. 
“I’m gonna tell you guys right now, I know what I hit because I know where I was aiming, and I know where I was shooting. I did not hit no baby (sic). It was only one person I hit,” he told officers, according to court documents. “He was already over there on the ground, and I been hitting him. That was the only person I went for. No other bullets went flying elsewhere. There was only one direction. So, there is no way I hit that baby.”
But later, when he was interviewed by detectives, Ioane-Register changed his story, telling them he didn’t know the 18-year-old intended victim, didn’t have a firearm and spent the evening “at WestFest with some homies, just chilling,” according to prosecutors. 
When officers told him the 18-year-old was killed, he “laughed and smiled,” court documents read, telling officers he “just liked to laugh about things that are funny.” 
More ‘intense’ crimes with younger suspects 
Gill said on Friday that while violent crime in Salt Lake County isn’t necessarily increasing, he’s noticing more intense crimes involving younger suspects.
Historically, most homicide suspects in Utah are between the ages of 19 to 28 years old. But according to a recent report from the University of Utah School of Social Work, Gill said that range is now 10 to 19 years old. 
“We are becoming more organized, we are becoming more sophisticated as well as the proliferation and access of stolen guns in younger and younger ages is causing this kind of stuff,” he said.  
Gill called for more resources to curb what he described as a growing problem. 
“Instead of fighting with hands or other things, the easy access to guns is driving these numbers. And that’s something we should pay attention to,” he said. “I think we have about four to six years to invest in the infrastructure so we can stay on top of it.”

(Photo by Greg LaRose / Louisiana Illuminator)Even though the nation’s highest court upheld a state-level ban on gender-affirming care for young people this week, local advocates in New Mexico say legal protections here stand.
The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld Tennessee’s 2023 ban on gender affirming care for minors. The same year that Tennessee enacted the prohibition, New Mexico went in the opposite direction with two new laws intended to protect this kind of health care.
New Mexico legally protects the trans community — but fear persists

New Mexico enacted the Reproductive and Gender-Affirming Health Care Freedom Act, which in part prohibits government entities from restricting or discriminating against a person’s right to access abortion and gender-affirming care. State lawmakers and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham also enacted the Reproductive and Gender-Affirming Health Care Protection Act, which shields abortion and gender-affirming care providers from civil or criminal liability and discrimination by state licensing boards and by other states that lack these protections.
These state laws still stand despite the ruling, according to a statement released on Wednesday by seven New Mexico-based organizations.
“In New Mexico, we safeguard people’s access to the care they need,” the groups said. “Gender-affirming care is still protected and fully legal in the state of New Mexico.”
The group includes: the Transgender Resource Center of New Mexico, Equality New Mexico, ACLU of New Mexico, Bold Futures, Tewa Women United, Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains and ProgressNow New Mexico.
“In upholding Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming care for young people, the court got it wrong,” the group said. “Denying transgender youth the health care they need solely because they’re trans is discriminatory. These laws block healthcare access and undermine the right we all have to bodily autonomy.”
Republicans in the New Mexico Senate on Wednesday, on the other hand, applauded the ruling, saying it permits state governments to ban gender-affirming care and arguing the New Mexico Legislature should reverse course.
“In stark contrast to the common sense we’re seeing out of Tennessee, New Mexico practically encourages children to undergo these permanent physical changes,” said Sen. Nick Paul (R-Alamogordo) in a statement. “After all, New Mexico funds these transgender surgeries with taxpayer dollars and even allows them to occur without parental consent. It’s time we show some common sense and enact protections for our kids by banning these irreversible procedures.”
The New Mexico community organizations said Wednesday all major medical associations have determined gender-affirming care to be safe, appropriate and effective.
“Gender-affirming care saves lives,” the group said. “We know that placing barriers between young people and medically necessary care deprives them of the chance to grow, thrive, and live authentically – in their own bodies and within our communities.”
In a “friend of the court” brief filed in the Supreme Court case, the two major professional associations for historians in the U.S., as well as the LGBTQ+ History Association, argue that surgical intervention, cross-sex hormone therapy and puberty blockers are well-established mainstream forms of health care and are not experimental or untested.
“Although gender-affirming care for adolescents is often depicted incorrectly as recently developed in a field previously restricted to adults, adolescents with parental consent have had well-documented access to medical interventions to alleviate distress from gender dysphoria in the U.S. for the past sixty years,” the historians wrote.
The group of New Mexico community organizations said transgender people have for generations faced efforts to erase them from public life — and every one of them has failed.
“This is no different,” the group said. “A world without trans people has never existed and never will.”

Ron DeSantis is taking a second try to get Adam Kissel on the University of West Florida Board of Trustees.
Kissel appeared before two Senate committees seeking confirmation to the position earlier this year and received a “recommend refuse to confirm” each time. The full Senate never took up his appointment, requiring the governor to reappoint him to keep serving.
In a Friday afternoon news release, DeSantis announced he was reappointing Kissel, who has remained on the board since the governor first named him in January, and added Edward Fleming, a Pensacola attorney, to the board.
Senators rejected Kissel, a West Virginian and Heritage Foundation fellow, citing concern with his lack of ties to the state; for advocating defunding public universities; and suggesting the GI Bill led to over-enrolled four-year colleges.
Now, Kissel can serve on the board at least until the Senate reconvenes next year, when it can vote again whether to confirm or reject him.
DeSantis shook up the Pensacola institution this winter when he and the university system’s Board of Governors, primarily appointed by him, placed eight new members on the UWF board. Those members faced extensive questioning by senators and two of them resigned before they could be confirmed.
Senators took issue with the appointees’ lack of local ties and their support of the now-resigned chair, Scott Yenor, a professor in Idaho who faced backlash for proclaiming that LGBTQ+ practices bring “dreaded diseases” and labeling career-oriented women as “medicated, meddlesome, and quarrelsome.” The bipartisan Jewish legislative caucus called Yenor “antisemitic.”
Kissel told a Senate panel that ultimately voted against him that he agreed with “probably everything” in the education section of Project 2025, a nearly 1,000-page document released last year led by Heritage detailing conservative ideas for the incoming U.S. president. It recommends dismantling  federal student aid programs, eliminating diversity efforts, and expanding public funding for private and home schools.
Kissel received his bachelor’s degree from Harvard and master’s from the University of Chicago. He served as deputy assistant secretary for higher education with the U.S. Department of Education during President Donald Trump’s first term.
Since the heated Senate questionings, UWF President Martha Saunders announced her resignation and the Board of Governors has approved Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. to serve as interim president starting in July.

Vermont State Police say they are investigating the suspicious death of a woman whose body was found along the side of a road in Woodbury.
Authorities have released few details of the ongoing investigation, which they reported began around 3:30 p.m. Thursday after police received a call that a body had been found at a roadside pull-off along Route 14.
First responders who arrived at the scene confirmed that the person, a woman, was deceased, according to a state press release issued Thursday night. 
Police have called the woman’s death “suspicious,” the release stated. No one was in custody. 
The woman’s identity has not been released pending further investigation and notification of her relatives, the release stated. 
The woman’s body was expected to be taken to the Vermont Chief Medical Examiner’s Office in Burlington for an autopsy to confirm her identity and determine the cause and manner of her death, according to the release.

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)Residents of District 25 are still short one representative after the death of Rep. Cindy Schreiber-Beck due to uncertainty about whether the southeast North Dakota Republican Party district properly elected a chair.
Secretary of State Michael Howe said Friday there may not be a legal path in state law for him or Legislative Management to fill the vacancy.
Ann Smith, who described herself as chair of the District 25 Republicans, issued a news release Friday naming Richland County Commissioner Terry Goerger as the new lawmaker. Schreiber-Beck, a Republican from Wahpeton, died in May. When a lawmaker dies while in office, state law calls for the district committee of the political party to appoint a successor.
Hours after that news release, the North Dakota Republican Party issued a statement saying the appointment of Goerger is invalid. 
  Terry Goerger (Photo provided by Ann Smith)
Matthew Simon, newly elected state chair of the NDGOP, said District 25 is not recognized as an organized district under NDGOP rules because it did not complete a valid reorganization by a May 15 deadline. He said the district has no chair and no authority to make an appointment. 
It’s Sen. David Hogue’s job as Legislative Management chairman to formally notify the district chair about a legislative vacancy. If the district doesn’t make an appointment within 21 days of getting that letter, then Legislative Management makes the appointment, according to state law.
But in this case, it’s unclear who Hogue was supposed to notify and the 21-day clock has not started, according to an analysis by the Attorney General’s Office. Hogue sent letters on June 10 to both Smith and Erik Nygren, former chair of District 25.
“It’s a quagmire,” said Hogue, R-Minot. “Maybe this is why we have a third branch of government, to tell us who the district chair of the Republicans in District 25 is because I don’t know at this point.”
Howe said Friday the Secretary of State’s Office can’t issue a certificate of appointment for Goerger because the request came from someone who is not confirmed to be chair of the District 25 Republicans.
“A certificate of appointment will not be issued until the NDGOP acknowledges that a District 25 Republican Party district exists and is organized,” Howe wrote in a letter to Smith Friday.
Smith did not return a call seeking comment Friday. 
Nygren, the former District 25 chair, posted on Facebook on May 2 that the original District 25 reorganization meeting on April 26 violated the district’s bylaws and possibly state law. He added to “avoid confusion and potential legal challenge” the district would hold a new reorganization meeting on May 10. 
It is unclear which bylaws or state laws were violated during District 25’s reorganization meetings.
North Dakota Republican Party division apparent as new chair elected in split vote

Goerger said Friday he was interviewed by the District 25 Executive Committee over the past week and informed he would be their appointee. He added he is aware of the disagreement over the chair position, but declined further comment because he was not directly involved.
A news release said Goerger, of Mantador, was elected to the Richland County Commission in 2022 and is a member of more than 20 local and state boards, such as the North Dakota Renewable Energy Council, National Biodiesel Board and the North Dakota Soybean Council.
The NDGOP said the state party plans to work with the district to hold an organizational meeting by Aug. 31, with the help of a parliamentarian to make sure actions meet legal and procedural standards.
The North Dakota Republican Party is divided,between establishment and populist factions, with members of the State Committee voting 24-22 to elect Simon as state party chair last Saturday in five rounds of voting. The State Committee did not allow a representative from District 25 to vote. 
The legislative appointment would run through Nov. 30, 2026. Legislative Management meets next week and is expected to appoint lawmakers to interim committees and other governing boards.

(Photo provided by Lockheed Martin)As many as 180 South Carolinians could be out of a job after Lockheed Martin announced it will layoff 10% of staff working in the global aerospace giant’s Greenville facility.
The layoffs follow a decision by the United States Air Force not to continue a $900 million contract for maintenance and upgrades of the country’s fleet of F-16s. The contract, announced in 2020, was supposed to last for 10 years and bring 15 “Fighting Falcons” to Greenville annually for maintenance , but the government ended it early.
“To meet our customers’ needs for affordability in a cost-competitive environment, we made the difficult decision to conduct a limited reduction in force at our Greenville site. This decision was made with a great deal of consideration and careful evaluation, and we’re committed to supporting affected employees with outplacement services and career counseling,” according to a company statement.
Lockheed has operated in Greenville for more than 40 years, moving into the former Donaldson Air Force Base in 1984. As of last August, the company employed more than 1,800 people at its Upstate location.
While the Air Force contract is ending, Lockheed will continue to build F-16s for the international market. As of February, the company still had a backlog of 117 planes to produce, selling the military fighter jets to countries such as Bahrain, Bulgaria, Morocco, Slovakia and Taiwan.
As Lockheed dialed back F-16 production in 2019 and shifted its focus to other models, it moved the F-16 manufacturing line to Greenville as it continued to fill orders. In 2024, the company produced 16 of the aircraft, according to financial reports.
The Greenville facility also performs maintenance and upgrades on several of the company’s other models, including the C-130, P-3, KC-10, and C-9.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lockheed_Bulgarian_Minister_of_Defence_Ceremony_Remarks-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-20 18:04:27.715421

Roger Wicker, are part of a larger $21 million award for infrastructure improvements for airports across the state.","Jackson-Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport is set to receive much-needed upgrades and improvements after receiving more than $4.1 million in Airport Infrastructure Grant and Airport Improvement Program funding from the Federal Aviation Administration. 
The grants, announced this week by Sen. Roger Wicker, are part of a larger $21 million award for infrastructure improvements for airports across the state. 
“Upgrading local air travel is an investment in the future of Mississippi. This funding will bring necessary advancements to our airport systems and provide more business opportunities for Mississippians. I look forward to these improvements being made to spur economic development in our great state,” Wicker said in the announcement. 
Last week, U.S. Congressman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., announced some of the federal grants, including $158,334 for Hawkins Field, the smaller joint civil-military public airport under the Jackson Municipal Airport Authority and located in northwest Jackson.
The Jackson airport also received an $8 million Airport Terminal Program grant from the FAA last year, Wicker announced in February of 2024. That money was slated for terminal rehabilitation, including placing escalators, elevators, HVAC systems, generators, passenger boarding bridges and baggage belts.
In previous legislative sessions, Rep. Earle Banks, D-Jackson, has authored legislation requesting millions of dollars for upgrades to the Jackson International airport, though the bills died in committee. The legislation that he introduced, he said, was for urgent repairs to the airport’s elevators, escalators and cooling towers. 
“Parts are not easy to find for that. That system for the escalators is about 50 years old, and they aren’t easily available,” Banks said. “That’s why for the elevators at the airports, we cannot get those parts. Some of those parts are not readily available.”
Banks said that the airport is a major driver for Mississippi’s economy, and it’s important to invest into the services that keep travellers moving forward. 
“One of the things you have to realize Mississippi, about the Jackson Airport, known as Medgar Evers, is we have got to have an airport that is first class to bring in first class businesses and first class tourism. We’ve got to keep our airport up,” he said. 
Banks points to the state’s attempts to gain control of the airport as one reason why the legislation failed. In 2016, then-Governor Phil Bryant signed Senate Bill 2162, which aimed to wrest control from the five member Jackson Municipal Airport Authority, which is appointed by Jackson’s mayor, to a nine member board appointed by the state. 
The fight over the airport has been wrapped up in legal proceedings since then, with the city of Jackson alleging that this law is racially discriminatory and violates the Mississippi and the U.S. Constitution. In May of this year, U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves denied the state’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
“JMAA might in fact continue to operate the airport for years to come. That is becauseafter the case wraps up here, there will likely be another appeal to the Fifth Circuit and perhaps a petition for U.S. Supreme Court review,” Reeves said in the decision. “And if all that litigation ends with a victory for the defendants, there will be an administrative process in Washington, D.C., in which the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) decides whether to approve a transfer from JMAA to the new, state-controlled authority. … For now, though, the status quo has been maintained.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/07090829/airport_Capture.png,,,2025-06-20 18:04:27.715421

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current) The upper chamber of the Rhode Island General Assembly gave its seal approval to the state’s $14.3 billion fiscal 2026 Friday. 
The Rhode Island Senate’s 32-4 vote was divided along party lines with all four Republican senators opposed. The Senate’s decision marks the penultimate hurdle for the state’s annual tax-and-spend plan. The last stop: Gov. Dan McKee’s desk for signature.
The Rhode Island House of Representatives approved a carbon copy of the spending plan in a 66-9 vote on Tuesday.
The $14.3 billion bottom line for fiscal 2026 falls $433 million shy of the record, $14.8 million final budget for the prior year. But, it’s $118 million higher than what McKee proposed in January.
Despite a series of new and increasing taxes and fees on motorists, nicotine pouch users and high-end second homeowners, the spending plan drew relatively little opposition in both chambers this year. Advocates praised the inclusion of extra health care funding for primary care providers, hospitals and nursing homes, though many acknowledge the extra money is not a panacea for the deep wounds of the state’s health care industry.
The cash-strapped Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) is also facing uncertainty, with $15 million of its $33.6 million shortfall plugged in the final budget, partly through a 2-cent-per gallon increase in state gas taxes. RIPTA CEO Chris Durand indicated the remaining shortfall may lead to layoffs of 90 of the agency’s staff, along with a 20% cut to service of buses other than the paratransit program. 
In addition to a hike in gas taxes, the budget also increases the real estate conveyance tax, and adds a new property tax on second homes valued at over $1 million. Meanwhile, costs for traffic violations, short-term public parking and electric and hybrid vehicles are all going up under a set of new and increasing fees and tax changes. 
Despite vocal and persistent advocacy, lawmakers opted to forgo a “millionaire’s tax” on top earners, though House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi indicated that might be considered if and when lawmakers reconvene for a special session in the fall — subject to fallout from the federal budget.
Other elements of interest in the spending plan include:

Extending the state’s 5% hotel tax to short-term rentals, dividing up the revenue it generates between homelessness services, municipalities and local tourism districts
Imposing an 80% wholesale tax to nicotine pouches (The tax already applies to other tobacco products.)
Adding a new $4 per-person fee to monthly health insurance premiums to fund a state assessment of primary care and other health care needs
Revising the state’s Rebuild Rhode Island tax credit program to allow the developers of the Superman building in downtown Providence to qualify for a sales tax exemption on construction materials
Increasing state aid to local school districts for special education students and backfilling an inadvertent $12 million shortfall in state aid already required for students in poverty
Adding $22 million in the long-term capital projects budget for the state’s share of costs in the Washington Bridge rebuild

McKee’s office did not immediately respond to questions Friday regarding when he will sign the budget.
Sen. Ryan Pearson, a Cumberland Democrat, was absent from the vote Friday.

Ned Lamont announced Friday that Amy Porter, a veteran state administrator, will become the acting commissioner of the Office of Health Strategy, replacing Deidre Gifford, who revealed plans to retire in May.
Porter will continue in her current position as the commissioner of the Department of Aging and Disability Services.
“I appreciate Amy for agreeing to serve at OHS on an acting basis while we explore the future leadership of this agency,” Lamont stated in a press release. 
Lamont also complimented Gifford, who was a senior advisor to Lamont during the COVID-19 pandemic, serving as the acting commissioner of the Department of Public Health while maintaining her responsibilities as commissioner of the Department of Social Services. She took over as OHS commissioner in 2023. 
Lamont praised her service in all three state departments.
“I appreciate all that she has provided our state, and I wish her the best on this well-earned retirement from a career filled with significant accomplishments in the service of the people of Connecticut,” said Lamont.
Lamont also praised Porter, who has served at ADS and its predecessor agencies since 2012.
“Amy Porter has served in leadership roles in Connecticut state government for well over a decade, and she is intimately familiar with our state’s health and human services needs, especially the needs of the most vulnerable populations that depend on access to affordable, quality health care.”
Gifford announced her resignation from OHS last month as The Connecticut Mirror was preparing to publish a story demonstrating her involvement in the state’s audit of Helen Zervas, owner of Family Eye Care in Bristol, in the days before DSS officials cancelled the audit in 2020. 
Zervas was charged with conspiring to have the audit of her Medicaid overpayments cancelled. Zervas pleaded guilty in February. DSS officials canceled the audit after Zervas offered to pay the overbillings, according to emails obtained by CT Mirror between Gifford and John McCormick, who was then head of the state’s Medicaid audit division. 
Zervas was engaged to former Democratic state Rep. Christopher Ziogas, who was charged with allegedly paying former state deputy budget director Konstantinos Diamantis $95,000 to pressure high ranking state officials to drop the probe in 2020. 
Ziogas and Diamantis were indicted on federal corruption charges by a grand jury weeks after Zervas pleaded guilty. They were released on bail and are awaiting trial.

No state stands to lose more in Medicaid cuts being discussed in the “Big Beautiful Bill” than Montana, according to several new reports. That translates to nearly 40,000 people losing health insurance, billions taken out of the state’s economy, and a new mountain of paperwork for state workers.
Current projections show that 31,000 to 38,000 Montanans could lose health coverage, with small and rural healthcare organizations taking a huge financial hit, while increasing paperwork and requirements for less federal funding.
The Montana Healthcare Foundation, which has tracked the results of Medicaid’s expansion in the Treasure State since its inception, as well as publishing yearly academic research on its effects on the state, reports that no state stands to lose more on a per-capita basis than Montana.
“On a percentage basis, Montana would lose more federal funding than any other state in the country, with an estimated 32% decrease in federal Medicaid funds over the next 10 years,” says a new report issued by the foundation titled “The One Big Beautiful Bill Act: Impacts on Montana Medicaid.”
Medicaid in Montana covers nearly 1-in-every-5 residents, and estimates say that as many as 38,000 people could lose healthcare coverage, with 4,000 of those being elderly, children or disabled Montanans.
The Daily Montanan sent questions to both of Montana’s U.S. senators, Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, including whether they supported the bill, and if they had concerns about its economic impacts on the health of Montanans or the state’s healthcare system. Neither of the senators, both Republicans, responded to questions.
But Daines appeared on FOX News on Tuesday, claiming it was Democrats who wanted to doom Medicaid, and that it was the Republicans who were looking out for it.
“It’s an important safety net, but we’ve got to reform Medicaid if we’re going to save Medicaid. We’ve got to take able-bodied males who are laying on the couches at home and get them back to work and off of Medicaid,” Daines said.
However, data tracked by state leaders show that 93% of people enrolled in Medicaid in Montana either work at least part-time, are full-time students, disabled or elderly, with the remaining small percentage being people who have recently lost a job or are transitioning to one of the other categories. Meanwhile, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms those estimates another way: As of February 2025, it estimated fewer than 17,000 in Montana who were eligible for the workforce were not employed, consistent with the state’s historically low unemployment rate.
Montana, which places a tax on healthcare providers to help support Medicaid’s expansion, would also be prohibited from increasing or adding to those taxes in order to help support the program — even though the taxation program has been highlighted by conservative lawmakers as a way to help share costs, even among the businesses that benefit by the expanded coverage.
The Montana Healthcare Foundation estimated that the state would lose $5.7 billion during the course of the next 10 years from federal support, shifting the burden to Montana, leaving state officials to choose whether to increase funding or decrease coverage.
The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation estimated that nationally, 16 million people would likely lose some form of health care. It also said that uncompensated care — that is, care that hospitals have to provide without reimbursement due to a lack of insurance — will soar by $283 billion during the next nine years in America, if the bill is passed.
In Montana, the report said that Montana healthcare will lose billions in the next decade, in a variety of areas, while increasing the cost of uncompensated care, creating a sort of double-whammy hit:

A loss of $2.6 billion in spending ($1 billion loss to hospitals, $200 million less to physicians, $700 million to other healthcare services, $800 million to prescription drugs).
An increase of $1.2 billion in uncompensated care ($300 million to hospitals, $100 million to physicians, $500 million to other healthcare services, $200 to prescription drugs).

  Rural areas impacted most 

Various reports analyzing the bill seem to center on at least one common conclusion: The cuts that would be required in the new Medicaid provisions would disproportionately hit rural providers in Montana. That spells trouble for two-thirds of Montana’s Medicaid-covered population who live in rural areas.
“Since Montana expanded Medicaid in 2016, 93% of Montana’s critical access hospitals reported adding or expanding specialty care services allowing them to provide care to rural Montanans previously only accessible in more urban areas,” the Montana Healthcare Foundation report said.
  Logistical challenges 

Some of the reports analyze what the changes in the reconciliation bill would mandate, and one of the new wrinkles include more work requirements for participants, which would, in turn, require a significant increase in documentation by states.
One of the new proposed work requirements would mandate 80 hours of work or qualifying activities per month to be eligible for Medicaid. This would require the state to develop and implement new tracking systems to verify the work. Even for someone who has lost a job, they would still have to demonstrate they’re working 80 hours to enroll in the program, according to the Healthcare Foundation.
Workers could see more “churn” or cycles of qualifying or not qualifying that would lead to inconsistent coverage and potential bureaucratic hassles.
“It would also cause ‘churning’ in and out of coverage for eligible adults, particularly for Montana’s seasonal workers such as firefighters and agricultural workers,” the report said.
This eligibility process, which requires “redetermination,” shifted in Montana to a yearly verification, as well as checking work requirement in 2023. That resulted in the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services to admit that thousands of Montana residents lost coverage because of technical issues, not related to eligibility, but to paperwork related to the process. New provisions within the “Big Beautiful Bill” would shift the redetermination period to every six months, speeding up the already cumbersome process.
“In (2023), nearly two-thirds (63%) of enrollees lost coverage due to procedural reasons, like incomplete paperwork, and not because they were determined ineligible,” the foundation report said.
  Hurting the state’s budget 

According to the Pew Charitable Foundation’s analysis of how the Medicaid changes in the federal bill affect local states, researchers broke down impacts on state budgets, and the results show a destabilizing effect on the Treasure State.
For example, the recent Medicaid expansion with federal support has helped stabilize the state budget. Montana’s trend line has shown a decreasing amount of state support and increasingly better healthcare outcomes for its residents.
For example, since 2023, the state’s overall contribution to the program has shrunk from 9.9% to 9.2% of the budget. Most of the states that touch Montana, with the exception of North Dakota, have seen a similar trend line where they spent less than the previous 15-year average on Medicaid.
According to Pew, most states’ spending pattern shows a general decrease in state spending, which has allowed Montana and others to spend money elsewhere.
Montana also fares better than most states because of its Medicaid agreement with the federal government. The average state contributes nearly one-third of the cost, while the federal government contributes the rest. But in Montana, the federal government covers nearly 80% of the cost, meaning that any cut to Medicaid overall will have an outsized and likely negative impact on Montana.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GettyImages-480940202-1024x650.jpg,,,2025-06-20 18:04:27.715421

Measles cases are in 34 states with North Dakota now the focus

A Utah County adult has been diagnosed with measles, state health officials said on Friday. The person was unvaccinated and didn’t report any out-of-state exposure, meaning that the infection was transmitted within Utah, they warned.
The Utah Department of Health and Human Services said it hasn’t identified any other cases in the state as of Friday morning. However, they’re encouraging Utahns who may have been in the same area as the infected person to monitor themselves for symptoms.
Before the diagnosis and during the illness’ infectious period, the Utah County resident visited several public places and medical centers in Orem, including Parkway Health Center on June 13, and the Timpanogos Regional ER, which the patient visited on June 14 from 2:14 p.m. to 7:02 p.m., the department said in a news release.
“People who were at these sites at the same time or two hours after this person could have been exposed to measles,” the release says. “We encourage unvaccinated people who were in these locations during the exposure time period to monitor themselves for symptoms.”

Dr. Leisha Nolen, Utah Department of Health and Human Services state epidemiologist, told reporters on Friday afternoon that those were the places the individual visited during the most contagious window of the virus.
The patient is between 20 and 40 years old, is currently doing well and has been isolating at home with very limited contact with others since the diagnosis, according to Nolen.
 Doctor warns there may be additional cases of the measles in Utah

This is the first confirmed measles case after an isolated case reported in 2023, Nolen said. However, this time experts suspect there may be additional measles cases in the state.
“This individual who we just identified, who has measles, had not traveled outside of Utah, so that means they were exposed somewhere in Utah from someone who was here,” she said. “We have not been able to identify how that happened. So certainly there is some person who was able to transmit the virus to this individual.”
Some of the patient’s family members were exposed to the virus, are watching out for symptoms, and have been advised to remain at home, Nolen said.
The Utah diagnosis comes amid a national spike in measles cases reported in at least 36 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of Thursday, there were 1,214 confirmed cases across the country and 23 outbreaks reported in 2025.

Measles symptoms typically show up 7 to 14 days after exposure. Symptoms like fever higher than 102.2°F, cough, runny nose or red eyes may indicate early stages of measles. A rash could appear after four days of fever, the Department of Health and Human Services said.
Measles is one of the most contagious diseases public health officials know of. An infected person can just walk into a room and spread it to almost everyone there, Nolen said. The disease may stay in the air two hours after that kind of exposure.
Those who may have contracted the virus from exposure to the Utah County resident may be experiencing symptoms now.
Nolen highlighted that the best protection against measles is the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, which, she added, is safe. Two doses ensure 97% of protection, and most Utahns already have it.
More than 90% of Utahns are reported to have the MMR vaccine and “are highly protected against infection,” according to the department. However, infants younger than age 1 aren’t eligible for the immunization and are especially vulnerable to measles.
“The MMR vaccine has been used since the early 1970s. It has saved millions of lives and prevented significant suffering around the world,” Nolen said in a prepared statement. “The MMR vaccine is safe and effective. Decades of careful research has shown the benefits of being vaccinated against measles far outweigh any risks the vaccine may pose. We encourage those who are not vaccinated to talk to their doctor about receiving the vaccine.”
The epidemiologists recommend Utahns to track down information on their vaccination status to ensure protection. Partially-vaccinated adults can get a second dose, and those who are unable to find immunization records could also get an additional dose, Nolen said.
While most Utahns have been vaccinated, there has been a decrease in vaccination rates among Utah children in the last five years, Nolen said.
“The numbers are still not super low, but they’re low enough to cause us to be concerned that there could be kids who are vulnerable to this, and certainly there are parts of our state or schools that have higher numbers of kids that are not vaccinated,” she said. “So we are concerned that little kids are susceptible to this. There could be an outbreak in a school. So we really would like to encourage people to get them and their children vaccinated.”
A measles infection shouldn’t be considered minor, Nolen stressed. While its symptoms can be common among children, statistics show that 1 in 20 kids will go into the hospital due to severe illness.
“And that’s really significant. I think none of us want any kids in the hospital,” she said. “We also know kids can die of this. We’ve already had three deaths in the United States. We don’t want any more.”

The Education Freedom Account program, created by the wide-ranging Arkansas LEARNS Act, provides up to 90% of the annual per-student public school funding rate for allowable expenses, including private school tuition and homeschooling. The state budget set aside $32 million for the program for the 2023-24 school year and an additional $65 million for 2024-25, totaling roughly $97 million.
That number increased to $177 million for the upcoming school year, not including Friday’s allocation of $90 million from the state’s restricted reserve fund, Department of Education Chief Fiscal Officer Greg Rogers told the Arkansas Legislative Council.

F.2. fy26 restricted reserve 
Little Rock Democratic Sen. Clarke Tucker asked Rogers if the cumulative amount of funds set aside will be enough to cover all accepted Education Freedom Account applications for the school year.
The education department is still accepting applications, Rogers and agency Chief of Staff Courtney Salas-Ford reminded the committee.
“We’re following the process that we have,” Rogers said. “Right now we think it is [enough] but we’re still continuing to evaluate that.”
To manage the large influx of applications, ADE is evaluating and approving applications based on funding priority categories within designated application priority windows, instead of a first-come, first-served basis, according to the education department’s EFA website.
Three-week priority windows began in early March, and the sixth window will close Sunday, Salas-Ford said.
The Advocate reported that 37,000 students had been approved for the EFA program as of June 2. This number had increased to 39,000 out of the 44,000 applications received, education department officials said Friday.
About 28,000 applicants have sought vouchers for private school while 16,000 have been homeschooling applicants, Salas-Ford said.
The $90 million EFA allocation previously received approval Tuesday from the Legislative Council’s Performance Evaluation and Expenditure Review subcommittee. The full council is responsible for giving final approval to its subcommittee’s actions when the Legislature is not in session
House Minority Leader Andrew Collins, D-Little Rock, tried Friday to pull the allocation out of PEER’s report and vote on it separately. His motion failed on a voice vote after Sen. Jim Dotson, R-Bentonville, asked education department officials how many EFA applications would not be able to receive funding without the $90 million.
Rogers said about 12,800 applicants would lack funding for the 2025-26 school year.

(Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)NEWARK, N.J. – A federal judge on Friday ordered the government to immediately release a pro-Palestinian activist from the Louisiana immigration detention center where he’s been held since March 9.
Attorneys for the activist, Mahmoud Khalil, said that after more than three months of fighting his detainment and potential deportation, Khalil can be reunited with his wife and newborn son.
“We are so relieved Mahmoud is finally out of his cruel, remote detention, but equally outraged that it took this long and that Mahmoud had to fight this hard to challenge such outrageous and unconstitutional government conduct,” said Baher Azmy, legal director for the Center for Constitutional Rights. “All Americans should be grateful that Mahmoud had the fortitude to defend basic First Amendment principles – and his pursuit of justice for Palestinians – against the administration’s autocratic tactics, which threaten us all.”
Judge Michael Farbiarz’s ruling comes one week after he ordered Khalil’s release but allowed federal prosecutors to ask the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals to weigh in. Instead, federal authorities refused the judge’s order to release Khalil, a former Columbia University student, claiming Khalil could still be held under a federal statute allowing immigrants to be detained during removal proceedings.
The judge instead confirmed in a virtual hearing Friday that Khalil should be released as soon a separate judge sets bail conditions. Khalil would be required to surrender his passport to the government as part of the bail agreement, that judge ordered Friday afternoon.

The bail conditions should not include electronic monitoring because there is “no basis for that” in the record, Farbiarz said.
Abigail Jackson, a spokeswoman for the White House, said the Trump administration expects to be “vindicated” when it appeals Friday’s order and that federal officials “look forward to removing Khalil from the United States.”
“Mahmoud Khalil was given the privilege of coming to America to study on a student visa he obtained by fraud and misrepresentation. While in the United States, Khalil has consistently engaged in conduct detrimental to American foreign policy interests. Khalil is thus removable twice over. And in any event, there is no basis for a local federal judge in New Jersey — who lacks jurisdiction — to order Khalil’s release from a detention facility in Louisiana,” she said.
Khalil, who was born in Syria, was among the first wave of arrests after President Donald Trump targeted students involved in pro-Palestinian efforts across college campuses amid the war in Gaza. Khalil was arrested by federal authorities near his New York City apartment and transferred through the Elizabeth Detention Center — where he was located when his attorneys filed a petition for his release — before eventually ending up in Louisiana.
His attorneys have argued for the last three months that he was unfairly targeted and held for deportation over his advocacy for his pro-Palestinian advocacy. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Khalil’s presence could have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”
Farbiarz had previously ruled that while the government couldn’t deport Khalil on those grounds — the government cited a rarely used statute the judge said is likely unconstitutional as applied to Khalil — they could pursue the case based on allegations of fraud on his green card application. That means Khalil’s proceedings aren’t over, and he still faces deportation.
Noor Abdalla, Khalil’s wife, said Friday that after three months, her family can “finally breathe a sigh of relief.”
“We know this ruling does not begin to address the injustices the Trump administration has brought upon our family, and so many others the government is trying to silence for speaking out against Israel’s ongoing genocide against Palestinians,” she said in a statement. “But today we are celebrating Mahmoud coming back to New York to be reunited with our little family, and the community that has supported us since the day he was unjustly taken for speaking out for Palestinian freedom.”

Shane Khoury appear before the House Agriculture, Forestry and Economic Development committee on April 10, 2025 to speak in favor of Senate Bill 290, which preserved the existing Buffalo River watershed permit moratorium. (Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)After 13 years, large-scale swine farms are banned — permanently — within the Buffalo River watershed, ending a saga that started when Arkansas environmental regulators quietly approved a general water permit for C&H Hog Farms in 2012.
The Arkansas Legislative Council reviewed and approved the regulations containing the so-called permit moratorium during its Friday meeting without discussion. It marked the culmination of over a decade of efforts from environmental advocates and their allies to prevent a similar large-scale swine farm, known as concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) from taking root in the watershed. The moratorium specifically applies to medium and large swine CAFOs that meet the Environmental Protection Agency’s definition.
It’s also the end of a year-long battle that began when the Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment began updating Rule 6, which regulates the Division of Environmental Quality’s issuance of federal water permits under the Clean Water Act. A temporary moratorium had been contained in the language of Rule 6 since 2014.
But the language of the temporary moratorium required DEQ to either move to make the prohibition permanent after five years or similarly take the measure out of the rule. 
DEQ went with the first option in 2020. But the ALC voted down the moratorium after legislators expressed concerns about the impact on agriculture.
The temporary moratorium stayed on the books. 
In 2023, the legislature transferred the authority to issue other state permits for liquid animal waste systems from DEQ to the Arkansas Department of Agriculture. Rule 5 permits, as they are known, are “no-discharge” permits, which prohibits permit-holders from discharging anything into state waters — and they also contained the Buffalo River watershed permit moratorium.
Last summer, DEQ again unveiled proposed changes to Rule 6 that included making the permit moratorium permanent. A little while later, the Department of Agriculture released its proposed version of Rule 5, which also included permit moratorium language.
The proposals were instantly controversial, and each one received hundreds of public comments. The battle lines were relatively clear — on one side were those who had been fighting for the moratorium since the now-shuttered C&H Hog Farms opened its doors in 2013. Moratorium supporters worried about how the waste from such operations could impact the water quality of America’s first national river. On the other side, the Arkansas Farm Bureau and other agriculture supporters argued that such a moratorium would hurt the state’s largest industry and infringe on property rights.

Arkansas Farm Bureau decried DEQ’s efforts for infringing on the “right to farm” in written comments submitting to the division as part of the rulemaking process. They said the number of swine farms in the area has “precipitously declined” since the 1990s. Meanwhile, nitrate concentrations in the watershed have increased, they said.
“Obviously, something other than agriculture, particularly swine farms, is affecting the perception, albeit unfounded, that there is an impact on the Buffalo River as its water quality remains extremely high,” the Farm Bureau’s Evan Teague wrote.
Segments of the Buffalo River and Big Creek, which is part of the watershed, are on the state environmental agency’s impaired waterbodies list for not meeting e. Coli standards. While no specific source of the bacteria is cited, DEQ said in one of the reports accompanying the list, which it cited in its responses to the Farm Bureau’s comments, that swine farming could be a contributing factor.
In its response to Arkansas Farm Bureau’s comments opposing the moratorium, DEQ said science and the history of the watershed supported the prohibition.
“The Division does not concur with Commenter’s conclusion regarding the history of swine farms in the Buffalo River Watershed,” the division wrote in its response. “The potential impacts of swine farms … on the Buffalo River has been an ongoing concern in Arkansas.”
The proposed rules were pulled from the Legislative Council’s agenda in December. During the 2025 legislative session, some lawmakers sought to repeal the moratorium via legislation and prohibit DEQ and other agencies from putting in place similar moratoriums going forward. After pushback — and the involvement of Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders — the bill was changed in the final days of the session to explicitly protect the existing moratorium in its current form, while putting into place hoops that agencies would have to jump through to get a similar ban in place going forward.
What started with a bang ended with a whisper — there was no discussion about the moratorium during the Rules Subcommittee meeting on Thursday, nor during the ALC meeting on Friday.

The 5th U.S. Court of Appeals, often cited as one of the most conservative courts in the nation, found the law unconstitutional because it violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which bars the government from endorsing a religion or creating laws that favor one religion over another.
The decision upholds a lower court’s injunction that blocked the law from taking effect in five of Louisiana’s K-12 school districts after families with students in those districts sued the state last year. The injunction applies only to the districts where those plaintiffs live.
The legal battle began in June 2024 when Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law a bill requiring every school in Louisiana to display posters with a Protestant version of the Ten Commandments.
The appeals court wrote that “under the statute’s minimum requirements, the [Ten Commandments] posters must be indiscriminately displayed in every public school classroom in Louisiana regardless of class subject-matter,” and thus, if allowed to go up, “those displays will cause an ‘irreparable’ deprivation of [the Plaintiffs’] First Amendment rights.”
Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill, also a Republican, said she intends to seek a review from the full 5th Circuit and, if necessary, turn to the U.S. Supreme Court.

USC has signed a $1.5 million agreement with OpenAI to offer CharGPT to all students and faculty. (File/Mary Ann Chastain/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s largest university system has signed a $1.5 million agreement with OpenAI to offer free AI tools to all students and faculty beginning this fall.
USC’s Columbia campus will become the first in the state to offer access to ChatGPT, following approval of a software licensing agreement by the college’s governing board Friday. The university system’s other campuses throughout the state also will have the option to join.
The school plans to use the technology to train students on ethical and appropriate use of AI, said spokesman Jeff Stensland. USC envisions students will use ChatGPT to create study guides for their classes or to help with time management, a skill Stensland said students often struggle with, by automating any busy work on their to do lists.
The sole-source contract is for one year, starting with the fall semester. Stensland was unsure why the contract didn’t go through the normal procurement process.
“AI is here and people in the private sector are using for whole host of things,” Stensland said. “This will position students to know how to use these tools responsibly.”
Students will be expected to abide by all policies for student conduct and academic integrity in their use of the technology.
USC also expects ChatGPT will be a time saver for faculty in the classroom, automating grading or creating syllabi, or with data analysis in research.
By having a licensing agreement for the technology, USC also will benefit from greater cyber security, protecting any data or information they use the tool for.
“The campus-wide adoption of secure enterprise AI technology puts USC on the leading edge of higher education institutions,” said Brice Bible, USC’s vice president for information technology and chief information officer. “This initiative will not only make our students more employable, but it will allow for much greater innovation in the classroom and across research teams in every discipline.”
The school plans to provide more information on the program throughout the summer.
“ChatGPT as a tool is one outcome. The larger goal is to adopt training, build operational efficiencies, advance the institution’s understanding of AI and build guardrails to experiment and protect USC data,” Stensland said in a statement.
USC is not the only university leaning into advancements in AI. OpenAI invested $50 million in a partnership, which it calls the NextGenAI consortium, to help speed up the research process.
College partners in the consortium include:

Neronha said in a statement.Appropriations powerMcConnell seemed likely during a Wednesday hearing to block the Transportation Department’s move to withdraw billions in congressional funding.McConnell, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama in 2011, pressed acting U.S. Attorney Sara Miron Bloom on how the Transportation Department could have power over funding that was approved by Congress, saying federal agencies “only have appropriations power given by Congress.”“That's how the Constitution works,” he said. “Where does the secretary get the power and authority to impose immigration conditions on transportation funding?”The suit brought by 20 Democratic state attorneys general challenges an April directive from Duffy, a former House member from Wisconsin, that requires states to cooperate in federal immigration enforcement in order to receive federal grants already approved by Congress.“Defendents seek to hold hostage tens of billions of dollars of critical transportation funding in order to force the plaintiff states to become mere arms of the federal government's immigration enforcement policies,” Delbert Tran of the California Department of Justice, who argued on behalf of the states, said.Arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, Bloom said that Duffy’s letter simply directs the states to follow federal immigration law.McConnell said that while the states could interpret it that way, the Trump administration has gone after so-called sanctuary cities and targeted them for not taking the same aggressive immigration enforcement as the administration.The judge said Bloom’s argument expressed a “very different” interpretation of the directive than how the administration has described it publicly. He also noted President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem have “railed on … the issues that arise from sanctuary cities.”Trump on June 15  directed U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to target Chicago, Los Angeles and New York — three major Democrat-led cities that have policies to not aid in immigration enforcement.Undermines CongressTran said the Department of Transportation’s directive is not only arbitrary and capricious, but undermines congressional authority because Congress appropriated more than $100 billion for transportation projects to the states.Cutting off funding would have disastrous consequences, the states have argued.“More cars, planes, and trains will crash, and more people will die as a result, if Defendants cut off federal funding to Plaintiff States,” according to the brief from the states.Bloom defended Duffy’s letter, saying it listed actions that would impede federal law enforcement and justified withholding of funds because “such actions compromise the safety and security of the transportation systems supported by DOT financial assistance.”McConnell said that didn’t answer his question about the secretary’s authority to withhold congressionally appropriated funding.“It seems to me that the secretary is saying that a failure to comply with immigration conditions is relevant to the safety and security of the transportation system,” Bloom said.",,,,2025-06-20 17:04:03.610962

(Photo courtesy of Community College of Rhode Island) The new permanent president of the Community College of Rhode Island’s (CCRI) is the same person who’s been leading the institution for the past two years. 
The Rhode Island Council on Postsecondary Education voted unanimously Wednesday to confirm Rosemary Costigan as sixth permanent president of the state’s only public community college. The council oversees public higher education in the Ocean State,
Costigan is the first CCRI graduate to lead the institution, and the second woman president following her predecessor Meghan Hughes, who left the post in 2023, when Costigan was named interim president. She outpaced 43 other candidates and one other finalist to secure the permanent post after a roughly five-month search.
“Dr. Costigan is a deeply experienced administrator with decades of teaching experience who as interim president has provided strong and visionary leadership through this difficult post-COVID era,” David Caprio, chair of the Postsecondary Council, said in a statement Wednesday. “The caliber of the candidates overall was impressive, but Dr. Costigan stood out as the best person suited to lead the college now.”
Gov. Dan McKee also congratulated Costigan on Wednesday. 
“This is a great day for higher education in our state,” McKee said in a statement. “Dr. Costigan is a graduate of CCRI, taught nursing students for years, led the nursing department, and rose to the highest level as interim president. She knows CCRI inside and out, and I’m confident she will continue to elevate CCRI, its faculty and its students.”
In her 18 months of presidency, Costigan led the school through its once-in-a-decade accreditation process. She launched the CCRI Advantage program to help students with developmental needs complete math and English requirements, along with new course initiatives in hospitality, culinary arts and apprenticeship programs to help rebuild enrollment amid pandemic-era declines. During her leadership, the three-year graduation rate has doubled to 30%, and fall to spring retention rose from 80 to 85%.  
Prior to her interim appointment, Costigan taught nursing at CCRI and the University of Rhode Island (URI). At CCRI, she advanced from an associate professor of nursing to nursing department chairperson, later assistant dean and finally vice president of academic affairs.  
Costigan also worked as a full-time nurse at Memorial Hospital for 21 years.   
Before becoming an educator, Costigan studied at each of Rhode Island’s public institutions of higher learning. She earned her Ph.D. and master;s degree in nursing from URI, while her bachelor’s in nursing came from Rhode Island College. Her associate’s degree in nursing came from CCRI.
Costigan’s contract, salary and official start date will be determined in the coming weeks, according to a CCRI news release.

Tracey Mann, R-Kansas, said it was important to prevent Iran from securing nuclear weapons and defended his vote for a GOP-crafted House bill that controversially delved into budgets, immigration, agriculture and the social safety net. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Republican U.S. Rep. Tracey Mann of Kansas said Friday the nation ought to get behind President Donald Trump’s ultimate decision on whether to authorize military strikes to interrupt Iran’s development of nuclear weapons.
The Trump administration said a determination could be made within two weeks about deployment of sophisticated weapons aimed at dismantling Iran’s nuclear sites. Meanwhile, Israel and Iran continued to exchange barrages in a weeklong shooting conflict.
“Under no circumstance should Iran be allowed to have a nuclear weapon,” Mann said in an interview. “President Trump has always been clear that his goal is to attain American peace through strength. We need to support our president on whatever his decision is.”
Mann wasn’t the only member of the Kansas delegation drawn to the clash between Iran and Israel.
“Iran should not have nuclear capabilities,” said U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, a Republican serving the Wichita region. “They are a state sponsor of terrorism and a threat to the Middle East and the entire world.”
U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas, said he was confident Trump was examining different sides of the question. He said he hoped Israel could finish the job without direct involvement of the United States.
“What we’re hoping to see over there is a regime change as well and end this terrorist organization,” Marshall said. “I know philosophically President Trump is not going to get us into another endless war.”
 
The big bill
Mann, who serves the large 1st District stretching from Dodge City in the west to Lawrence in the east, said the House and Senate was intent on passing a massive bill featuring tax cuts, investment in border security and deportation of people in the country illegally, modernization of air traffic control systems, expansion of agriculture programs and reform of the social safety net.
“If we fail to pass this bill the average Kansas family will face a tax hike of $2,200 in January,” Mann said. “That’s the last thing Kansas families need after four years of level records of inflation.”
Mann objected to the latest projection from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that budget legislation passed last month by the House and undergoing vetting by the Senate could increase federal deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade. The CBO produced a dynamic analysis that took into account how the economy could adjust to changes in revenue and spending.
Mann said the CBO’s estimate of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act underestimated economic growth tied to tax reductions. In 2022, he said, CBO said the Inflation Reduction Act would lower the deficit by $238 billion. That was revised in 2024 to indicate it could boost the deficit.
In addition, he said economic assumptions related to implementation of the pending “big, beautiful bill” were too modest.
“I believe once it’s passed the economic growth will exceed expectations as President Trump has done in the first five months of his presidency,” Mann said.
Mann said the Senate shouldn’t make broad changes to the House version because “I was really happy with what we passed.”
 
Farm economy
Mann said he had heard concern among Kansas farmers about Trump’s tariff and immigration policies disrupting the agriculture economy. Trump has been criticized by baffled business owners for the on-again, off-again targeting of immigrant labor on farms. There have been calls to exempt agriculture from Trump’s immigration crackdown.
Mann said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel were focused on deporting individuals with a violent background.
“No one loves America’s farmers, ranchers and ag producers more than President Trump,” Mann said. “America has the safest, most secure food supply in the world and this administration is working around the clock to ensure that we further strengthen the farm economy.”
Assertions tax provisions in the House bill excessively rewarded billionaires while making life difficult for lower-income individuals were misplaced, Mann said. He said the bill featured the largest tax cut for middle-class families in U.S. history and eliminated income taxes on overtime and tips, reduced taxes on Social Security and expanded the child tax credit.
“I’ve never met a billionaire who is counting on overtime pay, living off of Social Security or banking on tips to make ends meet so I just reject that notion,” Mann said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Tracey-Mann-with-chamber-3-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-20 17:04:03.610962

(Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)A federal judge in New Jersey on Friday ordered the government to immediately release a pro-Palestinian activist from the Louisiana immigration detention center where he’s been held since March 9. 
Attorneys for the activist, Mahmoud Khalil, said that after more than three months of fighting his detainment and potential deportation, Khalil can be reunited with his wife and newborn son. 
“We are so relieved Mahmoud is finally out of his cruel, remote detention, but equally outraged that it took this long and that Mahmoud had to fight this hard to challenge such outrageous and unconstitutional government conduct,” said Baher Azmy, legal director for the Center for Constitutional Rights. “All Americans should be grateful that Mahmoud had the fortitude to defend basic First Amendment principles – and his pursuit of justice for Palestinians – against the administration’s autocratic tactics, which threaten us all.”
Judge Michael Farbiarz’s ruling comes one week after he ordered Khalil’s release but allowed federal prosecutors to ask the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals to weigh in. Instead, federal authorities refused the judge’s order to release Khalil, a former Columbia University student, claiming Khalil could still be held under a federal statute allowing immigrants to be detained during removal proceedings. 
The judge instead confirmed in a virtual hearing Friday that Khalil should be released as soon a separate judge sets bail conditions. Khalil would be required to surrender his passport to the government as part of the bail agreement, that judge ordered Friday afternoon.
The bail conditions should not include electronic monitoring because there is “no basis for that” in the record, Farbiarz said.
Abigail Jackson, a spokeswoman for the White House, said the Trump administration expects to be “vindicated” when it appeals Friday’s order and that federal officials “look forward to removing Khalil from the United States.”
“Mahmoud Khalil was given the privilege of coming to America to study on a student visa he obtained by fraud and misrepresentation. While in the United States, Khalil has consistently engaged in conduct detrimental to American foreign policy interests. Khalil is thus removable twice over. And in any event, there is no basis for a local federal judge in New Jersey — who lacks jurisdiction — to order Khalil’s release from a detention facility in Louisiana,” she said.
Khalil, who was born in Syria, was among the first wave of arrests after President Donald Trump targeted students involved in pro-Palestinian efforts across college campuses amid the war in Gaza. Khalil was arrested by federal authorities near his New York City apartment and transferred through the Elizabeth Detention Center — where he was located when his attorneys filed a petition for his release — before eventually ending up in Louisiana. 
His attorneys have argued for the last three months that he was unfairly targeted and held for deportation over his advocacy for his pro-Palestinian advocacy. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Khalil’s presence could have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”
Farbiarz had previously ruled that while the government couldn’t deport Khalil on those grounds — the government cited a rarely used statute the judge said is likely unconstitutional as applied to Khalil — they could pursue the case based on allegations of fraud on his green card application. That means Khalil’s proceedings aren’t over, and he still faces deportation.
Noor Abdalla, Khalil’s wife, said Friday that after three months, her family can “finally breathe a sigh of relief.”
“We know this ruling does not begin to address the injustices the Trump administration has brought upon our family, and so many others the government is trying to silence for speaking out against Israel’s ongoing genocide against Palestinians,” she said in a statement. “But today we are celebrating Mahmoud coming back to New York to be reunited with our little family, and the community that has supported us since the day he was unjustly taken for speaking out for Palestinian freedom.”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Governor Josh Stein issued the first vetoes of his administration on Friday, rejecting a trio of controversial measures sent to him by the General Assembly last week.
Permitless concealed carry
Senate Bill 50 would allow North Carolinians over 18 to carry concealed firearms without applying for a permit. The measure, branded “constitutional carry” by conservative backers, is law in 29 other states. The Senate approved the bill on a partisan, 26-18 vote, with all Republicans voting ‘yes’ and all Democrats voting ‘no.’ Six members were absent. In the House, the vote was 59-48, with two Republicans — Reps. William Brisson (R-Bladen) and Ted Davis (R-New Hanover) — joining Democrats in opposition. If Brisson and Davis remain opposed, it could make it much harder for Republicans to must the necessary three-fifths vote to override the veto.
In announcing his veto, Stein said:

        “This bill makes North Carolinians less safe and undermines responsible gun ownership. Therefore, I am vetoing it. The bill eliminates training requirements associated with concealed carry permits and reduces the age to carry a concealed weapon from 21 to 18 years old. Authorizing teenagers to carry a concealed weapon with no training whatsoever is dangerous. The bill would also make the job of a law enforcement officer more difficult and less safe. We can and should protect the right to bear arms without recklessly endangering law enforcement officers and our people.”     
 
The veto announcement also noted that the action had the support Sheriffs Charles Blackwood of Orange County and Clarence Birkhead of Durham County.
Immigration enforcement
Senate Bill 153 would require state agencies to sign agreements cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). It also bars undocumented immigrants from receiving state-funded benefits, and opens local government “sanctuaries” to lawsuits in crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. The bill passed the House 60-46 (with 14 members absent) and the Senate 26-17 (with seven members absent). In each case, all ‘yes’ votes were from Republicans and all ‘no’ votes were cast by Democratic members.
According to Stein:

        “Senate Bill 153 would also make us less safe, so I am vetoing this legislation. At a time when our law enforcement is already stretched thin, this bill takes state law enforcement officers away from their existing state duties and forces them to act as federal immigration agents. Furthermore, under current law, people without lawful immigration status already are prevented from receiving Medicaid, SNAP, Section 8, and other benefits.”     
 
And House Bill 318 aims to close what Republicans have called a “loophole” in a 2024 law requiring local sheriffs to cooperate with ICE “detainer” requests. As with Senate Bill 153, the bill was, with one exception in the House (Rep. Carla Cunningham (D-Mecklenburg), approved on exclusively partisan votes.
Stein said the bill is unconstitutional.

“I am vetoing House Bill 318 because it is unconstitutional. I support the bill’s efforts to require sheriffs to contact federal immigration authorities about people in their custody charged with sexual battery, armed robbery, arson, assault on public officials and court personnel, and other dangerous crimes. People who commit these crimes should be held accountable, whether or not they are here without legal authorization, and those charged with serious offenses ought to receive increased scrutiny from federal immigration officials.
“My oath of office requires that I uphold the Constitution of the United States. Therefore, I cannot sign this bill because it would require sheriffs to unconstitutionally detain people for up to 48 hours after they would otherwise be released. The Fourth Circuit is clear that local law enforcement officers cannot keep people in custody solely based on a suspected immigration violation. But let me be clear: anyone who commits a serious crime in North Carolina must be prosecuted and held accountable regardless of their immigration status.”     
As with the permitless concealed carry legislation, Stein’s veto messages on the immigration enforcement bills included statements from county sheriffs — as well as a law professor, a farmer and a family physician — endorsing the action.
GOP-led legislature can override Stein’s vetoes, but path is narrow
In recent years, legislative reversals on the governor’s vetoes have been routine. Republicans held enough seats in both chambers of the General Assembly to easily override vetoes from Stein’s predecessor, Gov. Roy Cooper.
But Democrats were able to claw back enough House seats in last November’s election to deny the GOP a veto-proof majority — by one vote.
That means a simple party-line vote is no longer enough to force a law into effect. Republicans will have to flip a Democratic vote for a successful override, assuming all members are present. (Senate Republicans maintain a precise (30-20) veto-proof majority.)
Still, flipping a vote in that scenario remains a possibility. Rep. Cecil Brockman (D-Guilford), who has accused his party of “attacking” him after prior votes, is one such member who could flip.
House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) frequently refers to a “working supermajority” when he describes the voting margins in the chamber. It remains to be seen whether that holds up when override motions reach the floor.
In a statement, Hall blasted the veto of House Bill 318:

        “Governor Stein has made one thing clear today: he stands with criminal illegal aliens and the most radical elements of his party’s base over the safety and security of North Carolinians. Make no mistake, the NC House will override the Governor’s veto at the earliest opportunity.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_2163-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-20 17:04:03.610962

After judge affirmed public broadcasting’s independence from Trump, battle over $1.1B funding clawback heads to the Senate.
The post Wyoming Public Media backers urge congressional delegation to defend funding appeared first on WyoFile .","After a judge on June 8 affirmed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting’s independence, a funding fight with President Donald Trump is now beginning in the Senate, where $1.1 billion in broadcasting appropriations are on the line.
Because Wyoming Public Media is funded in part by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the organization’s supporters are urging Wyoming’s congressional delegation to vote against an effort to claw back funds. 
The Senate Appropriations Committee is preparing to debate the administration’s plan to take back CPB money and another $8.2 billion in already appropriated funds, perhaps as soon as Wednesday. Congress funded CPB, which distributes grants to independent public broadcasters and National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service, with $1.1 billion through the end of September 2027.
Republican U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman has voted for a rescissions bill to take back the money. Wyoming Public Media backers recently urged U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, both Republicans, to vote against the rescission and preserve federal funding for public radio and television broadcasting in Wyoming and nationwide.
“[Listeners] deserve strong public broadcasting that is free from political influence.” Christina Kuzmych
“We recognize that you and others may not agree with some National Public Radio programming,” Casper’s Maggi Murdock, chair of the Wyoming Public Media Public Advisory Council, wrote to the senators. “[B]ut we hope you will have the foresight and thoughtful care for the many Wyoming residents who rely on Wyoming Public Media as one of their vital sources of information and as a foundation for a statewide community.”
Murdock’s fellow board members also signed the letter. Barrasso and Lummis appear unmoved.
“I am troubled by the recent trend of publicly funded media promoting political agendas,” Lummis wrote in response Wednesday, according to a copy of her letter posted by Wyoming Public Media. Lummis added that she was “working with my colleagues on ways that we can hold public media accountable.”
“Hard-earned taxpayer dollars should not be spent promoting far-left climate policies or woke agendas,” Barrasso replied.
Respect for listeners
General Manager Christina Kuzmych said 50,000 people listen to Wyoming Public Media each week. The radio station, like more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations across the country, receives CPB support. It also subscribes to NPR, another recipient of the corporation’s grants, for news programs.
“WPM respects the work our legislators perform as they serve the many interests of Wyoming voters,” she said in a statement. Yet listeners deserve respect too, she said.
“They bring many diverse viewpoints to their listening experience, and they deserve strong public broadcasting that is free from political influence,” Kuzmych wrote.
A judge affirmed that independence after the CPB board, chaired by Ruby Calvert, a retired 35-plus-year veteran of Wyoming Public Broadcasting in Riverton, sued Trump and his administration in April. The administration had emailed three CPB board members saying they were fired, leading the congressionally funded, independent organization to defend itself in court.
Trump himself characterized federally funded public media as “trash,” “madness,” “biased,” “radical” and “woke propaganda disguised as news.”
CPB sought a preliminary injunction to prevent Trump from dismantling the organization, which Congress designed to be free from political meddling. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss on June 8 denied the corporation’s request for a preliminary injunction, saying in essence that it could continue to operate despite the administration’s attacks. But Moss certified CPB’s independence.
“Congress intended to preclude the President (or any subordinate officials acting at his direction) from directing, supervising, or controlling the Corporation,” Moss wrote. The judge was open to CPB “renewing their motion should Defendants [Trump and those acting in concert with him] take steps to interfere in the independence of the Corporation.”
With that decision, Patricia Harrison, president and CEO of the corporation, affirmed that the three targeted board members are still governing.
“Laura G. Ross, Thomas E. Rothman, and Diane Kaplan, are, remain, and shall continue to be directors of the Board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,” according to a CPB statement.

The Supreme Court is hearing arguments in US v. Skrmetti, a case about Tennessee's law banning gender-affirming care for minors and if it violates the Constitution’s equal protection guarantee. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s law prohibiting gender affirming care for minors, saying children who seek the treatment don’t qualify as a protected class.
In United States v. Skrmetti, the high court issued a 6-3 ruling Wednesday overturning a lower court’s finding that the restrictions violate the constitutional rights of children seeking puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender dysphoria. The U.S. Court of Appeals overturned the district court’s decision and sent it to the high court.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented, writing that the court had abandoned transgender children and their families to “political whims.”
Tennessee lawmakers passed the legislation in 2023, leading to a lawsuit argued before the Supreme Court last December. The federal government, under the Biden administration, took up the case for the American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal and three transgender teens, their families and a Memphis doctor who challenged the law, but the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump dropped its opposition.
Conservative justices lean toward allowing Tennessee’s ban on gender affirming care

In its ruling, the court said that the plaintiffs argued that Senate Bill 1 “warrants heightened scrutiny because it relies on sex-based classifications.” But the court found that neither of the classifications considered, those based on age and medical use, are determined on sex.
“Rather, SB1 prohibits healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers or hormones to minors for certain medical uses, regardless of a minor’s sex,” the ruling states.
The ruling says the application of the law “does not turn on sex,” either, because it doesn’t prohibit certain medical treatments for minors of one sex while allowing it for minors of the opposite sex.
The House Republican Caucus issued a statement saying, “This is a proud day for the Volunteer State and for all who believe in protecting the innocence and well-being of America’s children.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, who sponsored the bill, said he is grateful the court ruled that states hold the authority to protect children from “irreversible medical procedures.”
“The simple message the Supreme Court has sent the world is ‘enough is enough,’” Johnson said in a statement.
How to stay or when to move? Transgender laws force tough choices on Tennessee families

The Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ advocacy group, expressed dismay at the decision: “We are profoundly disappointed by the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to side with the Tennessee legislature’s anti-transgender ideology and further erode the rights of transgender children and their families and doctors. We are grateful to the plaintiffs, families, and the ACLU for fighting on behalf of more than 1.3 million transgender adults and 300,000 youth across the nation.”
The group said gender-affirming care saves lives and is supported by medical groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical Association.
The court also rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the law enforces “a government preference that people conform to expectations about their sex.”
The court found that laws that classify people on the basis of sex require closer scrutiny if they involve “impermissible stereotypes.” But if the law’s classifications aren’t covertly or overtly based on sex, heightened review by the court isn’t required unless the law is motivated by “invidious discriminatory purpose.”
“And regardless, the statutory findings on which SB1 is premised do not themselves evince sex-based stereotyping,” the ruling says.
In response to the outcome, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said Tennessee voters’ common sense won over “judicial activism” on a law spurred by an increase in treatment for transgender children.
“I commend the Tennessee legislature and Governor Lee for their courage in passing this legislation and supporting our litigation despite withering opposition from the Biden administration, LGBT special interest groups, social justice activists, the American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, and even Hollywood,” Skrmetti said.
U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., criticized the ruling just moments after it came out after being asked about it during a press conference.
“This Supreme Court seems to have forgotten that one of their jobs is to protect individual rights and protect individuals from being discriminated against,” Schumer said. “It’s an awful decision.”
Democrats, he said, are “going to explore every solution,” though he didn’t elaborate.
Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion: “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best. Our role is not ‘to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic’ of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process.”
The ACLU said in a statement the decision is based on the record and context of the Tennessee case and doesn’t extend to other cases involving transgender status and discrimination.
Chase Strangio, co-director of the ACLU’s LGBTQ & HIV Project, called the ruling “devastating,” but despite the setback said transgender people still have healthcare options.
“The court left undisturbed Supreme Court and lower court precedent that other examples of discrimination against transgender people are unlawful,” Strangio said in a statement.

Jeff Landry signed a bill into law Wednesday that lets local law enforcement officers “neutralize” any drones operating in a “nefarious manner,” such as flying over a parade route. 
House Bill 261 by Rep. Jay Gallé, R-Mandeville, passed both chambers of the Louisiana Legislature with unanimous support.  
According to the new law, officers can neutralize, intercept or disable drones through any legal and safe methods – including but not limited to jamming, hacking or physical capture – to prevent illegal or harmful activity. 
The new law, called the “We Will Act” Act, states officers can take such actions only if there is reasonable suspicion the drone is involved in criminal activity, poses an imminent threat to public safety or is otherwise operating in violation of state or federal law. 
“The new law does not explicitly authorize the shooting down of drones but does provide the use of discretion for law enforcement to mitigate unlawful drones, provided those measures are safe to life and property,” Gallé said in a text message Friday. 
The law, which takes effect Aug. 1, restricts the flying of drones over parade routes and requires local authorities to post notices establishing “Drone No Fly Zone” along those routes. The restriction does not apply to drone operators who have permission to film the parade. 
Any violation of the parade route restriction carries a minimum fine of $2,000 and up to one year in prison. 
“This law puts Louisiana on the front lines of drone defense,” the governor said in a press release. “We are taking bold steps now to protect our people and our skies before tragedy strikes.”
Drone pilots currently rely on Federal Aviation Administration notices about airspace restrictions. 
Mikon Haaksman, a professional drone videographer in Shreveport, said his business is very strict in following the federal laws and has some worries about local law enforcement trying to govern the same airspace. 
“I think for the most part it’s a good idea, but I have concerns on how much knowledge these officers will have on actual laws and could make judgement calls not based on the law or safety but because they feel it’s the right thing to do,” Haaksman said. “But I do see much too often people who fly drones unsafe or illegally and that can be a problem. Like any law, it has its pros and cons.”

(Photo by GracedBytheLight/Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished without a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY — Now with a critical court decision in hand, Attorney General Gentner Drummond said he hopes to settle a 20-year-long lawsuit over pollution to the Illinois River Watershed.
In a decision released this week, a Tulsa federal judge determined poultry farm runoff in eastern Oklahoma is still harming the Illinois River, Lake Tenkiller and connected waterways. U.S. District Judge Gregory K. Frizzell found that “conditions have not materially changed in the Illinois River Watershed” since the lawsuit went to trial in 2010.
Drummond’s past attempts at mediation with poultry producers broke down, as the corporations alleged that phosphorus levels causing the pollution had significantly reduced, the Attorney General’s Office said.
Evidentiary hearings Frizzell hosted in December led to his conclusion on Tuesday that poultry waste is still causing unnaturally high phosphorus levels in Illinois River waterways, building up algae and worsening water quality.
Frizzell ruled in 2023 that poultry companies, including Tyson Foods, are responsible for elevated phosphorus levels that had been recorded in the past in the Illinois River. The Attorney General’s Office presented more recent information and data during the December evidentiary hearings.

The judge could enter a final decision in the case before the end of the year, Drummond said. That decision likely would order the corporations to immediately stop spreading poultry waste on the land in the Illinois River Watershed area, he said, and the companies are likely to file an appeal.
While those decisions are pending, the attorney general said he intends to negotiate. Drummond said he is open to a settlement that would give poultry producers a several-year runway to remove the pollutants.
Such an agreement could protect the poultry industry’s profits while also restoring the watershed, he said.
“I don’t think that they’re mutually exclusive,” Drummond told Oklahoma Voice. “My objective in the end is we continue to have a vibrant poultry industry in Oklahoma and we have a path through which the watershed is rehabilitated and healed.”
Former Attorney General Drew Edmondson filed the lawsuit in 2005. A 2010 trial resulted in court-ordered mediation between the state and the corporations to determine remedies for the pollution. In the years since, negotiations failed to result in an agreement. The corporations sought to have the case dismissed.
Gov. Kevin Stitt has said he is “100% against” using a lawsuit to force poultry companies to change their policies. Stitt has been a vocal critic of the case, calling it an attempt “to get a pound of flesh” out of poultry businesses that he said had been following the law.
He even fired his secretary of energy and environment last year for attending the December evidentiary hearings in Frizzell’s courtroom.
Stitt’s office did not return a request for comment Friday on the judge’s recent ruling.

In an April news conference, the governor said improving the Illinois River Watershed would be better accomplished through legislation or through action from the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry. 
He signed a bill into law last year that protects poultry companies from future lawsuits as long as they are complying with a state-approved waste disposal plan.
Drummond, a Republican candidate running to succeed Stitt as governor, said the new law won’t have any bearing on the Illinois River case, but “it illustrates how effective and powerful the poultry lobby is on Oklahoma legislators.” 
The attorney general said he hopes to resolve the 20-year-long lawsuit during his tenure in office. So far, he said, the corporations have shown more interest in litigating than reaching a final resolution. 
“I think every year that they can delay, that’s just additional profits that they can enjoy, and that’s disappointing,” Drummond said. “I wish that they would recognize, say, ‘We’re the cause of the watershed’s deterioration, and we should self-police and can coordinate with the state on a path through which we remove the pollutants in the watershed and give Mother Nature an opportunity to heal herself.’”

Free.,Trump administration move to restore gun rights to some convicts protested by Democrats,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-move-restore-gun-rights-some-convicts-protested-democrats,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration's decision to restore 10 convicts’ ability to legally purchase firearms and explosives violated the law, according to a letter six high-ranking congressional Democrats released Friday.The Justice Department publication of an interim final rule moving the authority to restore some convicts' gun rights from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to the attorney general also violated the separation of powers and a decades-old provision in the department’s annual funding bill, according to the 12-page letter.The Democrats wrote that while Congress did delegate the authority to “oversee restoration of federal firearm privileges applications” to the ATF several decades ago, lawmakers have included language in nearly every government funding bill since 1993 barring the ATF from spending any money to process those applications.The prohibition followed then-President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, trying to move the authority from the ATF to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.“Given the pervasiveness of gun violence in our nation, this Administration should not be circumventing Congress’ authority to prioritize restoring firearm privileges to individuals convicted of serious or violent crimes,” the Democrats wrote.The letter was signed by House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn.; Senate Appropriations ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash.; House Judiciary ranking member Jamie Raskin, D-Md.; Senate Judiciary ranking member Dick Durbin, D-Ill.; House Appropriations Commerce-Justice-Science subcommittee ranking member Grace Meng, D-N.Y.; and Senate Appropriations Commerce-Justice-Science subcommittee ranking member Chris Van Hollen, D-Md.The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment from States Newsroom.Mel Gibson caseThe DOJ under President Donald Trump has so far restored 10 individuals’ ability to legally purchase firearms, including the actor Mel Gibson, who “pleaded no contest to a charge of domestic violence” in 2011, according to Reuters.Federal law bars several types of people from legally buying firearms, including anyone sentenced to more than one year in prison, which typically coincides with felonies, and those who commit domestic violence.The six Democrats wrote that the “intersection between firearms and domestic violence remains a key concern, demonstrating the need to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers.“Research has shown that the presence of firearms significantly increases the risk of death or serious injury for victims of domestic or dating violence. The Supreme Court has recognized that the danger of a domestic abuser with a gun serves as a limitation on the Second Amendment.” The Democrats wrote that for decades Congress has prevented the ATF from restoring prohibited people’s ability to legally purchase firearms. The annual DOJ appropriations bill also bars moving the ability to approve those applications away from ATF to any other federal agency. “The concerns that originally led to these provisions — recidivist crime, limited investigative resources, and difficulty in assessing applicants — remain unchanged,” they wrote. “Congress made an explicit policy choice to prioritize investigating crime, rather than to waste funds on evaluating whether to restore firearm rights to previously convicted felons.”Study citedThe letter says a study from the Violence Policy Center that looked at restorations during the late 1980s is one of many reasons Congress prohibited the ATF from restoring some felons' ability to legally purchase firearms.The study, which reviewed 100 ATF case files obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request, showed the federal government had restored the ability of “terrorists, murderers, rapists, drug dealers, gun traffickers, and child molesters” to legally purchase firearms and explosives.“The FOIA-obtained records also showed that of those granted relief between 1985 and 1989, 47 individuals were later re-arrested for serious offenses such as attempted murder, first-degree sexual assault, kidnapping, child molestation, illegal possession of a machine gun, trafficking in cocaine, LSD, and PCP, and illegal firearms possession or carrying,” they wrote.The letter ends with Democrats calling on the DOJ to withdraw the interim final rule and “vacate the wrongfully granted restoration of federal firearms privileges to the 10 individuals.”",,,,2025-06-20 16:07:18.441030

BURLINGTON — City property taxes are set to rise more than expected due to a $1.8 million budgeting error, Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak said this week — though she noted the increase could be offset by a drop in education taxes. 
In the mayor’s initial $106.6 million budget — first presented to the Board of Finance on June 2 — property taxes were expected to increase by just $35, or less than 1%, over the current year. Three days later, however, Mulvaney-Stanak said a $1.8 million gap was discovered, stemming from an overestimation of tax revenue from commercial properties and a miscommunication between the Clerk/Treasurer Office and the Assessor’s Office.
To close the gap, the mayor said the city’s property taxes would instead have to increase by around $100 per year, or 2.5%, on a $500,000 home, bringing in around $831,000 in revenue. 
Mulvaney-Stanak said most property owners will still experience an overall tax decrease in fiscal year 2025-26 due to a projected drop in the education tax rate.
“That was something that was, again, important to me so that, at the end of the day, people had a more affordable bill,” Mulvaney Stanak said during a Tuesday press conference at City Hall. 
Burlington School District’s Executive Director of Finance and Operations Nathan Lavery said the city’s education budget is expected to decrease by 4.5%, or about $360 on a $500,000 house.
Mulvaney-Stanak also said she would not receive a cost-of-living salary increase in fiscal year 2026, and other department heads would not receive it for six months. 
“This is a very hard decision because my department heads work incredibly hard for this city,” she said. “This is why in six months I want to restore the 3% [cost of living adjustment] that we were originally budgeting for fiscal year [20]26 for department heads.”
The budget error also means that new roles — including a deputy city attorney and a housing-related position — will be put on hold, and the upcoming police academy class will be cut from four recruits to two. These reductions come on top of the 25 positions already cut across various city departments.

“That is important for us to actually structurally start to fix our budget because if we continue to have more employees than we could really financially sustain, that continues to make that gap grow over years,” she said.
Other expected revenue sources include a 25-cent tax increase for Uber and Lyft rides, $250,000 in anticipated development permits fees, and an estimated $200,000 from the hotel occupancy tax tied to a new hotel opening in downtown Burlington. 
The mayor also highlighted two budget revisions: the restoration of $100,000 for UVM Health Network Home Health & Hospice and an adult programming position in the Parks, Recreation & Waterfront Department.
Mulvaney-Stanak said she is committed to transparency and informed Democratic and Progressive city counselors of the budget error on the same day it was discovered. To prevent similar errors from happening in the future, the mayor said the Clerk/Treasurer Office and the Assessor’s Office will create new procedures to outline the process for submitting grand list figures, and the City Assessor’s Office will move under the Department of Finance and Administration starting July 1.
Final budget numbers have not yet been determined. 
“The administration is still working with City Council on a revised budget that identifies exactly how much of the $1.8 million will be in new revenues versus cut expenses,” Burlington Chief Administrative Officer Katherine Schad told VTDigger. 
The budget may evolve slightly after consultations with city councilors. “I’m confident that we’re going to have an agreement with the City Council, both the Progressive caucus and Democratic caucus,” Mulvaney-Stanak said.

The private university announced in a news release its law school received the donation from the Sease & Wadding Law Firm as part of an almost $4.2 million settlement between the State of Iowa and a sibling of Sabrina Ray. Funds will go to the Children’s Rights Clinic, a semester-long course in which students participate in children’s advocacy and representation in different court settings, with faculty supervision.

Two initiatives will be established with the gift, the release stated, including an award for a student participating in the clinic “whose advocacy on behalf of children in the juvenile court system inspires hope for a better future” and the Sabrina Ray Justice for Children Summer Fellowship.
Nickole Miller, director of the Joan and Lyle Middleton Center for Children’s Rights, said in the release she is “particularly excited” about the summer fellowship, which will give law students the chance to attend law conferences on child welfare and intern at children’s rights organizations.
“Finances are often a barrier for law students interested in public interest legal work on behalf of children…,” Miller said  in the release. “The fellowship, together with the new Ray of Hope Award recognizing student excellence in the Children’s Rights Clinic, build strong children’s attorneys and envision a future where all children are safe, supported, and empowered.”
Police found Ray’s body, which weighed under 60 pounds and showed evidence of severe malnutrition, in May 2017 in her adoptive parents’ home, Iowa Capital Dispatch previously reported. Two adopted siblings were found with her body, and food was locked inside cabinets and windows were screwed shut.
According to a report from the Iowa Office of Ombudsman, the Iowa Department of Human Services rejected child-abuse reports in the case before Ray’s death and discouraged someone from continuing to share concerns, despite having regularly visited the home and had contact with the family.
“Sabrina Ray deserved a strong legal advocate and (a) safe and loving home,” Miller said in the release. “These funds will be used to honor the life and legacy of Sabrina Ray by supporting and celebrating the next generation of children’s rights attorneys and giving them the tools and experiences needed to be zealous, child-centered advocates.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The national 50501 group that has organized “No Kings” protests across the country has disowned a Utah chapter after a shooting at the Salt Lake City protest on Saturday that killed a bystander who was marching in the protest. 
“Due to SLC 50501’s disregard for our nonnegotiable values, we are no longer affiliated with them,” the organization said in a Facebook post on Thursday. 
The national organizers emphasized that the grassroots 50501 movement is “decentralized,” noting that “each local group is autonomous and they are responsible for their planning.” However, citing a “strict no-weapons policy,” the national organizers said they would no longer recognize the Salt Lake City chapter. 
“50501 is rooted in nonviolence, collective care, and principled protest. Every action organization under the 50501 name is expected to uphold a strict no-weapons policy, without exception,” the national organization said. “We hold ourselves and all action associated with our banner to these uncompromising standards.” 

Based on information that’s “currently available, it appears” the Salt Lake City chapter “did not meet those standards,” national organizers said.
“The presence of weapons, and any action that endangers lives, stands in direct opposition to the values we uphold,” the national group said. “We feel deep anguish that harm unfolded in a space connected to our name and vision.” 
The Utah 50501 group’s organizers did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.
According to Salt Lake City police, the shooting happened after two men described as “peacekeepers” confronted another man, 24-year-old Arturo Gamboa, who was openly carrying an AR-15 style rifle. One of the men, reportedly part of the event’s security team, fired three shots from a handgun, grazing Gamboa but also hitting an “innocent bystander,” Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, who was pronounced dead at a hospital. 
Shortly after the shooting, police arrested Gamboa, and he was booked into jail for investigation of murder. Police say, however, that Gamboa did not fire his rifle. The two “peacekeepers,” who wore high-visability vests, were initially detained by police, but were released after being questioned. Police said the man who fired the three shots is cooperating with investigators. 
The Utah 50501 organizers said in a prepared statement issued earlier this week that the “safety volunteer who responded to the individual (holding the rifle) and who was questioned by police is a military veteran.” They also said that their “team of safety volunteers, who have been selected because of their military, first responder, and other relevant de-escalation experience, believed that there was an imminent threat to the protesters and took action.” 
‘Peacekeeper’ involved in shooting at SLC ‘No Kings’ protest is a military veteran, organizers say

In the aftermath of Saturday’s shooting, unanswered questions remain, including more details of who the “peacekeepers” were and how they were vetted to be acting as armed security during the protest. Questions also remain regarding Gamboa’s intentions and why he brought a rifle to the protest. 
As of Friday, Salt Lake County prosecutors had not filed charges against Gamboa or anyone else involved in the shooting. On Thursday, a judge granted the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office more time to determine what charges, if any, should be filed against Gamboa, who remains held in jail with no bail. 
The three-day extension now gives prosecutors until 5 p.m. on Monday to file any charges against Gamboa. On Thursday, District Attorney Sim Gill said the extension was sought because his office had not yet received a formal screening of evidence associated with the charge of murder for which Gamboa was booked. 
“Detectives continue to interview witnesses and involved parties, as well as review voluminous amounts of surveillance and amateur footage of the incident,” Gill said. “This extension will allow the police to present their evidence at a formal screening scheduled for this Friday and allow the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s Office sufficient time to review, analyze, and make an informed decision to any allegations of criminal wrongdoing.”
Gill added that he asks “for everyone’s patience.” 
“When a person loses their life we are all impacted as a community,” he said. “It is critical that we are thorough, accurate, and faithful to the truth. Arthur Afa Ah Loo’s family and our community of citizens deserve no less.”

Utah is a “constitutional carry” state, meaning its laws allow the open and concealed carrying of firearms without a permit for those who are legally allowed to possess them. In 2021, with HB60, the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature eliminated the state’s concealed carry permit requirements. Now, anyone 21 and over who can legally possess a gun is free to carry it loaded and hidden in public. 
Unlike 26 other states, Utah has not adopted a law prohibiting carrying long guns at state capitols or political protests, according to Everytown Research & Policy, an organization that produces research on gun violence and advocates for gun violence prevention. The group has ranked Utah as No. 36 in the country for “gun law strength.” 
National 50501 organizers acknowledged in their Facebook post that “while we do permit firearms at 50501 protests, we recognize that Utah law permits the open carry of weapons, and this reality shaped some of the events that unfolded.” 
They also acknowledged, however, that “this is an active legal investigation,” and they committed to “amend any misstatements as facts emerge.” 
Both the national and Utah chapters of 50501 have expressed devastation for Ah Loo’s death. 
“No words can fully capture the depth of sorrow we feel for Afa’s family, friends, and the entire Salt Lake community,” national organizers said in their post Thursday. “We grieve alongside them.”

,DC,2025-06-20 19:24:27+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Both parties prep for mega-bill marathon in U.S. Senate vote-a-rama,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/both-parties-prep-mega-bill-marathon-us-senate-vote-rama,,"WASHINGTON — The next hurdle for Republican leaders in the U.S. Senate and the “big, beautiful bill”: Democrats — and possibly a few of their own members — in a marathon voting session will make last-ditch attempts to change the tax and spending cut measure.The vote-a-rama, as it’s known, is expected to begin sometime during the last full week of June as Congress heads toward the Fourth of July recess. It will likely begin in the afternoon and  last overnight into the next morning. Senators will debate and vote on dozens of amendments attempting to revise the massive legislation that could have an effect on nearly every American.Democrats, who have 47 votes in the Senate compared to 53 for Republicans, plan to zero in on Medicaid, taxes, corruption, policies that could raise energy costs and proposals that would increase the deficit, according to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and the committee chairs tasked with drafting pieces of the package have spent weeks combing through the House-passed bill to figure out what needs to be altered to avoid divisive floor votes. They’ve rewritten numerous policy proposals to comply with the strict rules that go along with the complex reconciliation process and are now trying to work out disagreements among GOP senators that could doom or complicate a final deal.The goal is to avoid a protracted debate over core GOP provisions in full public view once the vote-a-rama begins, though some senators are already predicting votes on GOP amendments.‘A potentially messy process’Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who has raised concerns about the bill’s impact on rural hospitals, said he hopes GOP leaders reach a consensus before vote-a-rama but didn’t rule out offering his own amendments if they don’t settle their disputes.""Amending it on the floor, that's a potentially messy process,"" Hawley said. ""I would hope that we could get to a good place before that. But we have to fix the rural hospital issue.""Alabama Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville said he will likely propose amendments during floor debate, though he declined to say what specific policies he’d seek to change or eliminate from the package.“Yeah, we’ll have some,” Tuberville said. “And we've got them all, we just haven't turned them in yet.”Thune said he and other negotiators are making “headway” toward consensus on the more significant provisions in the package, which in many respects is far from its final form.“The meetings right now are on the major provisions in tax and health. We have sort of pre-litigated a lot of that,” Thune said. “But there are a lot of the other provisions in the bill, chapters in the bill that are still subject to going through the Byrd bath, and we're in the process of doing that. But hopefully that'll be done by early next week.”

Republicans are using the reconciliation process to pass their sweeping tax and spending cuts package through the Senate with just a simple majority vote, requiring them to comply with the Byrd rules.That includes the Byrd bath — going before the Senate parliamentarian to explain how each provision has an impact on federal revenue or spending that is not “merely incidental.” Democrats then usually debate before the parliamentarian the various changes that don’t meet that threshold. The process is named after the late Sen. Robert Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat.Once the parliamentarian rules what elements comply and which need to be removed, the bill can go to the floor and senators can trudge through vote-a-rama. Eventually, all 100 lawmakers will vote to approve or disapprove of the legislation.GOP senators passing their version of the package would send it back to the House, which passed its version on a slim 215-214 vote earlier this year — and could make yet more changes in the Senate bill.Democrats develop strategyDemocrats are hoping to highlight policy divisions among Republicans during the vote-a-rama. And even if they don’t succeed in getting any of their amendments adopted, several votes could serve as fodder for campaign ads during next year’s midterm elections.Schumer said Wednesday during a press conference it would be “difficult” for Democrats to peel off at least four GOP senators from the rest of the party in order to get an amendment adopted, but said he’s hopeful Republicans will “vote with us on some things they've all said they've agreed with.”Democratic senators, he said, have created a task force to reach out to Republicans on major issues in the package, including how it would impact rural hospitals.“Many of these hospital administrators and employees are Republican,” Schumer, a New York Democrat, said. “In many of the rural hospitals, they are the largest employer in the county, and in most they're the only supplier of health care. It infuriates the rural counties, and they tend to be Republican.”‘It’s just a show, it’s a charade’West Virginia Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said she’s not concerned about having to vote on dozens of amendments. “We're here to vote,” Capito said. “As a creature of the House, we voted all the time on everything, so this doesn't bother me. And, you know, just let the body work its will. If some changes are made, those will have to be dealt with. But I'm not worried about that.""Arkansas Republican Sen. John Boozman said he expects the vote-a-rama will be “a very late night” and that he’s not planning to offer any of his own amendments.As chairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, Boozman expects to spend a considerable amount of time during vote-a-rama arguing against amendments seeking to change those provisions — including controversial cuts in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food aid for lower-income families.Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson said he plans to spend much of the vote-a-rama “going back and forth from my hideaway,” the ceremonial office that every senator holds in the Capitol building.But Johnson cast doubt on actually being able to amend the package during that process, saying changes to the various bills that Senate committees have released need to be agreed to before then.""You've got to get this before it ever goes to the floor. I mean, you're not going to change things substantially or significantly with amendments. I know people have some idealized version that happens. It doesn't,” Johnson said. “You've got to get these things in the base bill. Amendments; it's just a show, it's a charade.”Vote-a-rama after vote-a-ramaThe Senate has held two vote-a-ramas so far this year, and both demonstrated how difficult it is to change a piece of legislation.The first all-nighter in February went along with Senate debate on its budget resolution and included votes on 25 amendments, with lawmakers adopting just two — one from Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan and one from Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee.The second vote-a-rama took place in April just before the Senate voted to approve the budget resolution that ultimately cleared the way for Congress to use the budget reconciliation process to advance the “big, beautiful bill.” Senators debated 28 amendments, voting to adopt one change from Sullivan.Oregon Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden, ranking member on the Finance Committee, said he and staff on the panel will continue to parse through details of the panel’s bill, which Republicans just released Monday.Wyden said he plans to hold several town hall meetings in GOP areas of his state over the weekend to gauge how residents there view the policy revisions Republican senators have put forward.""We've had this bill for basically 36 hours. The first time I had it, I stayed up all night, so last night I got a little sleep,” Wyden said on Wednesday. “But on the plane, I'll be working through it. And I expect to be working through it all through the next few days, except when I'm having these town hall meetings where I'll have a number of questions.""",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-06-20 16:07:18.441030

Discovered on Sunday morning, the fire was caused by lighting and has grown through the week. The fire’s acreage was listed at 351 acres as of the most recent estimate, the evening on June 18, and it was 0% contained.
On Wednesday, the Lewis and Clark County Sheriff’s Office issued an evacuation warning for Rimini Road and all feeder roads south of Bear Gulch Road.
The announcement said residents impacted by the warning should gather important belongings and make arrangements for livestock should an evacuation order be issued.
Additionally, the U.S. Forest Service issued a closure order for some parts of Helena National Forest, including a section of the Continental Divide Trail.
The Continental Divide Trail is closed from MacDonald Pass to the edge of the Helena National Forest, near the Luttrell Peak and Old Baldy Mountain area.
The Forest Service also closed a number of its roads in the area, including Minnehaha, Hahn Creek, Flume Creek Road, Telegraph Creek Road, and Bullion Parks.
Land owners or lessees in the area as well as area residents are exempt from the order. Violations of the order are punishable by a $5,000 fine and possible imprisonment.
The fire itself is burning through heavy fallen timber, steep terrain and limited access to the incident. The Jericho Mountain Fire has seen a heavy response from firefighters, with 250 personnel assigned to the blaze.
Eight hand crews are on the scene, as are several helicopters and a variety of other heavy machinery, including skidders, skidgines, and feller bunchers. Scooper planes are also being used to fight the fire.
In a Friday update, Northern Rockies Incident Management Team 9 said they were looking for opportunities to work on the fire’s edge. Fire lines are being constructed and improved west of Minnehaha Road, along the Continental Divide and north of Jericho Mountain.
Thursday’s storms, which brought rain, lessened fire behavior, a press update from the Northern Rockies team said.
Structure protection efforts are being undertaken in Rimini, a small community in the area. The area is historically significant and is home to some early Montana mining claims, as well as a ghost town.

Residents of the Pine Valley community, home to about 370 people according to Census data, were under a mandatory evacuation order Thursday night after the ​​Forsythe Fire was spotted burning about a quarter mile from town. 
Pine Valley is located about 30 miles north of St. George, in between state Route 18 and Interstate 15. 
As of Friday morning, the fire had burned about 1,000 acres and was not contained, according to Utah Fire Info. Crews worked through Thursday night and no structures were reported lost.

Smoke was visible from St. George, authorities in Washington County said, and crews are using aircraft to fight the fire. Smokejumpers — highly specialized firefighters that parachute into the fire area — have also been called in.   
The ​​Forsythe Fire is one of nine fires that started in the last 24 hours, as the state experiences record-breaking heat and high winds. Other than the ​​Forsythe Fire, the other new fires are all still relatively small. 
So far this year, the Beehive State has seen a reported 328 wildfires that have burned about 13,850 acres. Of those, 243 were determined to be human-caused. At least 47 were natural, and 38 remain undetermined, according to Utah Fire Info. 
The largest fire of the year is the France Canyon Fire, burning in a sparsely populated area outside of Bryce Canyon National Park. The U.S. Forest Service is currently fighting the blaze, which has burned about 7,650 acres and is just 5% contained. 
The Bridge Creek Fire, located on the Navajo Nation near the Utah-Arizona border, has burned about 1,145 acres and is 0% contained.

The city is still trying to get the plaza open before the event, but it may not be complete in time (submitted photo).The clock is ticking. In less than a year, hundreds of thousands of tourists are expected to descend on Kansas City for the FIFA World Cup.
Local leaders tout it as a once-in-a-generation event, which FIFA estimates will bring $650 million to the region. It is touted as the largest sports event ever, with matches stretching over a month.
With the spotlight on Kansas City, as well as the other 15 host cities, nerves are high.
“Anybody who’s not feeling nervous about it is foolish,” said Kansas City Councilman Wes Rogers, who represents the 2nd District in the Northland. “It’s the biggest sporting event in the history of mankind, and it’s a great opportunity for our city. But it’s incredibly high stakes. We’ve got to get it right.”
Cities across the area are gearing up for six matches to be hosted at Arrowhead Stadium, making plans for transportation, public safety, lodging and a variety of other elements.
Here are five key issues that Kansas City leaders are keeping in mind leading up to the World Cup.
 Where will visitors stay for the Kansas City World Cup?

When Kansas City submitted its bid for the World Cup, it had to demonstrate to FIFA that there were 55,000 hotel rooms available within a two-and-a-half-hour radius of the city.
Many tourists will end up at hotels in the metro area. But travelers will likely stay in other cities as far away as Wichita, Columbia, Springfield, Des Moines and even St. Louis.
That will require a more robust network of transportation so that tourists — many without cars — can get to and from the city.
Some cities in the area are also trying to make space by temporarily loosening restrictions on short-term rentals. That would allow more property owners to rent out their homes during the World Cup. Parkville has already voted to loosen its short-term rental regulations starting in May, and Rogers said Kansas City intends to do something similar soon.
Despite a massive influx of tourists, Pam Kramer, president of the KC2026 organizing committee, is encouraging as many community members as possible to stick around — not just for their own benefit but to help tourists appreciate Kansas City.
“From my own travels, my strongest and fondest memories are the people that I’ve met and encountered and the authentic experience of a culture or a place,” she said. “There is something really different about the hospitality and the authenticity of people here … I’m excited for the world to see that.”
 Transportation to the Kansas City World Cup

At a bare minimum, FIFA is expecting that ticketholders will be able to get to and from matches, hotels and the airport. That is a FIFA requirement, and it’s an undertaking on its own.
KC2026 is leasing temporary buses for the duration of the World Cup that will shuttle people between the airport and downtown, as well as between downtown and the stadium.
Rogers said it makes sense for those buses to be temporary, because far fewer people would use those routes during a normal summer.
But Kramer is more excited about how KC2026 is aiming to build a regional transit network during the World Cup to make sure visitors can spread the economic benefits around the metro area to cities like Olathe, North Kansas City, Lee’s Summit and Kansas City, Kansas.
One of KC2026’s goals is to get more people to use public transportation in Kansas City to show them what the public transit network could become with more investment. That, Kramer believes, would be a meaningful legacy for the Kansas City World Cup.
 Public safety

The estimated 650,000 visitors during the World Cup are more than the entire population of the city of Kansas City. That, City Manager Mario Vasquez said, brings some public safety concern.
It’s not so much that he expects visitors to be behaving poorly, he said. It’s just that they may be unpredictable.
During big events like Super Bowl parades, law enforcement may travel in from out of state to provide help — including from Illinois, Kansas, Arkansas or Nebraska. The World Cup is different in that it will be multiple days, rather than a one-time event.
That raises the issue of housing for additional officers who would be staying for several days at a time.
Rogers said the City Council may explore options in the near future.
As far as specific safety concerns, Rogers doesn’t expect gun violence to be an issue at the major fan gatherings around downtown, like the rally at Union Station, because they will have security checkpoints. That, he said, should alleviate some concerns from Kansas Citians who witnessed the mass shooting at the Union Station Super Bowl rally in 2024.
One of Vasquez’s public safety concerns is possible human trafficking or sexual exploitation while tourists are in Kansas City. The Beacon previously reported on sexual exploitation during sporting events in 2023, when the NFL Draft came to town.
 Business and economic development

World Cup visitors will be bringing their wallets, and Kansas City is eager to use the extra business to its advantage.
The Missouri General Assembly voted this year to allow businesses to serve liquor at nearly all hours of the day during the World Cup, and the bill is awaiting Gov. Mike Kehoe’s signature.
Rogers said it will be all the more important to have a temporary modular jail up in time for the World Cup if the city will be keeping bars open until the early hours of the morning.
The Kansas City Council has also pursued legislation to help small-business owners fill vacant storefronts during the World Cup. The hope is that a few successful weekends during the event will help those business owners afford a full-time space.
Rogers said that one way to look at the World Cup is that it will bring 650,000 visitors over five weeks, which will bring economic activity during that time.
But, he said, “what we really need to do is make sure that (those) five weeks are the beginning of the next chapter for Kansas City.”
That means sustainable changes that last much longer than just those few weeks.
Rogers said there’s a place for both kinds of development, and they can work hand-in-hand.
For example, the City Council is also going to be giving grants to small businesses to provide outdoor dining. That’s a short-term solution for the World Cup. But if that’s paired with policy changes, like reducing the fees for outdoor dining, it can become a solution that can be sustainable long after the World Cup is over.
“We don’t just want to, you know, duct tape everything together so we can hold it for a few weeks,” he said. “We want this to be a long-term thing.”
As far as bigger construction projects, Kansas City plans to have its new Berkley Riverfront streetcar extension open before the World Cup, and the city has broken ground on a new parking garage in the 18th and Vine district.
The city is also renovating Barney Allis Plaza to hopefully make it a gathering place for fans. But because of some issues on site, Barney Allis Plaza may not be complete in time for the World Cup, Vasquez said.
Getting things done in time can be a challenge.
Vasquez said that if any property owners want to get a project done before the World Cup, like a new outdoor bar at a restaurant, they need to get their permit applications as soon as possible. It’s likely too late to start new major construction.
 International tourism under the Trump administration

Some Kansas City leaders are concerned that the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown could hinder the city’s ability to attract international tourists.
Since his inauguration, tourists have been detained at the border during their travel in the United States. That includes a British tourist who was detained in Tacoma, Washington, as well as an American woman’s German fiancé, who was deported after two weeks at a detention center.
Several countries have issued travel advisories, particularly for transgender travelers whose gender markers could get flagged upon entry to the United States.
“I know we’ll have visitors probably from close to 100 countries. We want them to come. We want them to celebrate. We want them to watch the game,” Vice President J.D. Vance said. “But when the time is up, they’ll have to go home. Otherwise, they’ll have to talk to (Homeland Security) Secretary (Kristi) Noem.”
Rogers is concerned.
“We’ve got this great economic opportunity,” he said, “and frankly, a great cultural opportunity to remind people that America, despite some of the rhetoric, is still the most open and welcoming and diverse country in the world. And yeah, I’m really worried that we’re going to present a different face than that and then scare people away because of it.”
A representative from FIFA declined to respond to those concerns but said that nearly 1.5 million tickets have been sold so far for this year’s Club World Cup, speaking to global enthusiasm for U.S.-hosted matches.

“That’s not too much my style,” he said just before 10 a.m. Tuesday, wiping the sweat from his face with a gray washcloth. “I just like to go to work and go back home.” 
The 37-year-old man said he’s happy with his job at a car wash, which he’s held for most of his adult life after dropping out of school in the ninth grade. He wished not to give his name, but described the freedom offered through his occupation as “music to me.”
“I can just work the way I want to work,” he said. 
Many of the others who visited the Jackson ImmunoTek Plasma Donation Center on a recent weekday morning haven’t struck the same when it comes to earning a living in this part of the city. 
The plasma donation center, located at the intersection of McDowell and Raymond roads on the cusp of west and south Jackson, is one of the few signs of life in an otherwise neglected zone. Family members and friends pick up and drop off their loved ones; people walk to the center from nearby neighborhoods. 
It’s almost as busy as the Cash Savers, a discount grocery store catty-cornered from the biotech center, where people often take the pre-paid debit cards they receive in exchange for their blood to buy groceries. The intersection also includes a gas station, a Rally’s fast food restaurant, an empty store that locals say used to sell car parts and an AutoZone. 
“They put it in the right spot of town,” said the man waiting for his brother outside the center. The hours are 7 a.m. to 2 p.m.
He was describing the plasma center’s convenient location on two main thoroughfares, but he’s right for another reason: This area of Jackson has a high concentration of poverty, few economic opportunities and is rapidly depopulating. 
The dire economic situation is top of mind for the city’s new leadership, as incoming Mayor John Horhn has pledged to reverse these trends, telling attendees at the South Jackson Parade and Festival earlier this year that it would be the first thing on his to-do list. 
Similar promises came with the center’s opening in 2022 inside a former pharmacy that closed during the Great Recession. That year, ImmunoTek boasted that it could bring an estimated economic boost of $5 million a year for a “part of Jackson that is undergoing revitalization,” according to the Mississippi Free Press. 
The company did not respond to inquiries from Mississippi Today, so the center’s exact economic impact in the years since is unknown. For now, ImmunoTek remains one of the newest establishments operating in this part of Jackson and was likely drawn by the same data points that make other investors look elsewhere. 
“It’s amazing how the blood of a group of people was used as a commodity at the beginning of this country and how the blood of this same group of people is still being a commodity today by them having to sell it in order to survive,” said Fredrick Womack, founder of Operation Good, a violence prevention organization. 
Womack said when his group has encountered people walking to ImmunoTek from the surrounding neighborhoods, he’s attempted to intercept them and help them find stable, long term employment.
Studies have shown that plasma donation centers are more likely to be located in areas with higher rates of poverty. In Jackson, the ImmunoTek center is located in a census tract where the median household income was $29,500 in 2020, according to data compiled by the city of Jackson. And CSL Plasma, another plasma donation company, has facilities in south and northwest Jackson. 
“Regardless of how you feel about the community, businesses – for lack of a better word – match with the outputs of the demographic,” said Jhai Keeton, the director of Jackson’s planning and development department. 
Keeton has been working to bring more development to west and south Jackson, but he said recruiting businesses to the area has proven difficult due in part to the concentration of poverty, by which he means lower median household incomes, less spending power and declining property values. 
“What I would love for the greater community to understand is that economics is all about data,” he said. “Every individual needs to look at themselves as a dataset, and when you have 100 individuals in one neighborhood, they need to look at themselves as a collective dataset.” 
When it opened, the center offered a larger payout for a plasma donation than it does now, said Darian Little, a cook at Buffalo Wild Wings who had donated blood Tuesday to get money for groceries. He said he used to get $100 per session, but that now the center offers him $40 for the first and $70 for the second. 
Nonetheless, the facility remained consistently busy throughout the morning. In the 45 or so minutes it takes, and even with the lower going rate, a donor can still earn 10 times the state’s minimum wage of $7.25-an-hour. 
Several people had stopped in to ImmunoTek on their way to work. One woman wore a blue Waffle House shirt. Another left the facility wearing nursing scrubs and a blue bandage on her arm. 
Others came because it was their only source of income. As the morning wore on, the center’s parking lot started to fill up with people.
Anderson Wallace was sitting on the curb, waiting for his pulse to fall below 100 so he could make a donation. He has visited ImmunoTek four times a month since he arrived in Jackson from Brooklyn, New York, earlier this year to visit his mom. 
If Wallace had been able to find employment, he wouldn’t be here, he said. But he’s applied everywhere – Amazon, UPS, and various jobs through Indeed.com – with no luck. 
“It’s too tough down here,” he said. “I gotta go back to New York.” 
Two sisters whose electricity had gone out this morning after they were late paying the bill had also tried to donate, but their iron was too low, so the center turned them away. One of them shrugged when asked what they were going to do instead. 
Deonte Woodson’s iron was also too low, so while his partner was inside giving a donation, he sat on the hood of his car and soothed their baby. The 30-year-old said he has a couple of businesses, though he didn’t give specifics, and his partner aspires to be a TV reporter. But for now, they need to donate plasma to make ends meet.
“She ain’t doing nothing now, just being a housewife,” he said. “For right now, I try to handle all the bills and take care of the kids.” 
Ella Moore, a former Dillard’s employee, was waiting in her father’s car to pick up her 32-year-old son who was inside. Moore said her son is in between construction jobs. A few years ago, the young man tried to gain steady employment by starting his own mobile car wash, but he got into an accident, Moore said, leaving him without a car.
Moore grew up in Jackson and has raised her kids here, but she can’t make sense of the city. She said she used to shop at a corner store by her house, but a few months ago, a man came in holding a rifle, and the shopkeeper did nothing. She doesn’t shop there anymore.
“I think people just don’t care no more, because ain’t nobody really listening to them,” she said. “It’s like they ask you a question and they say they’re gonna do this, they’re gonna do that, but in reality, they really don’t do it. You’re voicing your opinions on things, and there’s nothing happening.” 
When was the last time she felt Jackson’s leaders were listening? Moore pursed her lips. 
“Probably in the early 90s,” she said, citing an example of a skating rink on Terry Road that closed, then reopened after community uproar.
But a few years later, Moore went by the rink, and it was closed again. Now she feels like there’s nothing for her grandkids to do in south Jackson, she said, except for a small park up Raymond Road from the plasma donation center. 
She voted for Horhn, because she wanted to see change in Jackson, but she is skeptical that any will come. When she heard on the news that part of the Metrocenter Mall had a new owner, it just made her think about the last time people promised to redevelop the shopping center. 
“We shall see, we shall see, we shall see,” she said. “Cause that would’ve been a nice thing to have a skating rink right there, a water park for the kids. Another era.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/17163427/ImmunoTek-1.jpg,,,2025-06-20 16:07:18.441030

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Vanderbilt University Medical Center, one of the largest academic research and hospital care systems in the southeast, expects to lay off 650 employees as a result of grant and other funding cuts made by the Trump Administration, it said in a statement.  
The teaching and trauma care hospital system will reduce operating costs by $300 million overall, the statement said.  The medical center said the cuts are being made “in response to the impact of budgetary actions in Washington, DC related to government-sponsored research and patient care.”
The staffing cuts affect employees primarily in research, administrative and other support areas, the statement said. 
“While this is extremely difficult, the staffing loss represents less than 2% of VUMC’s total workforce,” the statement said. “To support affected employees, VUMC is providing severance packages and other assistance.
“VUMC sees more than 3.5 million patient visits each year and remains committed to meeting the needs of all who depend on us for health care.”
The statement noted that Vanderbilt University Medical Center will continue to hire clinical staff for a long-planned, 180-bed Jim Ayers Tower.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-06-20 18:41:38+00:00,CT Mirror,Will Lamont veto CT HB 5002? Governor promises to ‘get it right’,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/06/20/ct-hb-5002-housing-lamont-sign-veto/,Gov. Ned Lamont is confronting a quandary largely of his own making: Whether to sign the largest housing bill to ever reach his desk.,"Gov. Ned Lamont returned from the Paris Air Show this week to confront a quandary largely of his own making: Would he sign an omnibus housing bill his administration negotiated? Or would he bow to unexpectedly virulent opposition from suburbs crucial to a potential reelection campaign?
Opposition to House Bill 5002, the most consequential housing bill to reach his desk in his seven years in office, exploded immediately after Lamont shared his present inclination to seek a third term in 2026, inextricably linking the fate of the bill to his own ambitions.
Lamont reiterated Friday he would like to see revisions when the General Assembly returns for an unrelated special session, expected before much of the housing law would take effect. But his immediate choice is whether to sign the bill with suggestions for change or to veto it and call for a do-over. 
His deadline to act on the bill is Tuesday.
In comments Friday before and after an appearance in New Haven celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana by Wooster Square, Lamont declined to share his leanings or detail what more he needs to know before making the call.
“I’m just talking to a lot of people right now. The housing bill, to be really effective, towns have got to buy in. I want them to take the lead. Most of the towns have taken the lead. Some of them haven’t,” Lamont said. “Housing is absolutely crucial to the economic growth and opportunity in the state, so we’re going to get it right.”
HB 5002 is an expansive 41-section bill that attempts the address a critical housing shortage by requiring municipalities to set goals for affordable housing, prioritizing state aid to communities that build housing, and streamlining approval for so-called “middle housing,” defined as a building with two to nine units.
Under the bill, zoning regulations would have to allow middle housing in commercial zones as “of right,” which means approval without any discretionary zoning action other than a review to determine if a site plan conforms with applicable regulations and will not impact public health and safety.
Another provision would prohibit municipalities from rejecting a housing development solely due to a failure to conform to formulaic on-site parking regulations, rather than a specific impact on public safety.
CT169Strong, an advocacy group opposed to any intrusion into local planning and zoning prerogatives, put out an email blast an hour after the governor concluded a press conference on June 5, the day after the annual legislative session ended. Lamont had signaled an interest in reelection — and doubts about HB 5002.
They described the bill as heavy handed.
“Collaboration brings forth good workable policy, not unfunded mandates and extreme positions. We thank Gov. Lamont for being thoughtful in this process and we are happy to meet with him,” the group said. They provided the email addresses of Lamont and his chief of staff, Matt Brokman. He was the governor’s chief negotiator on the bill.
The group said prioritizing aid for communities producing housing would be punitive and described the so-called “fair share” goals as “quotas.”
A deluge of emails followed.
Lamont said he found the fair share goals to be “aggressive,” but calling them quotas “was fake news.” He was hoping to bring down the temperature before making a decision, but that seems unlikely.
“They’re screaming on both sides,” Lamont said Friday as he exited his black SUV  at Pepe family’s storied pizzeria in a three-story brick building, a survivor of urban renewal and highway construction. “There’s not much middle ground. The story of American politics right now.”
Mayor Justin Elicker, a supporter of HB 5002 who had complained recently that Lamont’s fiscal conservatism was harming municipalities, was waiting to introduce him. Elicker’s only agenda Friday was pizza, not politics or policy.
“The governor and I don’t always agree on everything, but we agree on pretty much everything,” Elicker told the gathering. “And you can be darn sure that today we agree that New Haven has the best pizza in the country.”
Two days earlier, Elicker issued a statement praising HB 5002. “I’m hopeful the state legislature and the governor will be able to find common ground and a pathway to get this important legislation across the finish line and open doors to new housing in Connecticut.” 
On Friday, a coalition of eight pro-housing groups, including the Open Communities Alliance and United Way of Connecticut, shared a letter urging Lamont to sign a bill that they see as meeting specifications largely set by his administration.
“Signing this bill would be a major step forward on solving one of the state’s most pressing issues. It has been crafted specifically with many of your previously stated concerns in mind,” they wrote.
Pete Harrison, an advocate who was not a signatory to the letter, said he believes the governor is likely to sign the bill.
“I think the governor wants to get to a yes. He has certainly been involved in this process during the legislative session, even before the vote,” said Harrison, the Connecticut director of the tristate Regional Plan Association. “I think his instincts have been very good on recognizing how important the bill is.”
Republicans, who hold fewer than one-third of the seats in the General Assembly and have not won a gubernatorial contest in nearly two decades, have tried with little success to transforms concerns over home-rule, zoning and housing into a source of votes.
In 2022, the Republican gubernatorial nominee, Bob Stefanowski, promised Fairfield voters he would repeal and replace 8-30g, a 30-year-old law that gives developers leverage in communities where less than 10% of the housing stock is affordable. Lamont cruised to reelection, flipping 45 suburbs that Stefanowski had won in their first, much closer match in 2018.
Alexis Harrison of Fairfield, a founder of CT169Strong, failed to recapture the 132nd House District seat in 2024, using concerns about bills like 5002 as a platform. Rep. Jennifer Leeper, D-Fairfield, who had flipped what had been a GOP seat in 2020, beat Harrison, 58% to 42%.
But there are signs of nervousness in some of the Fairfield County districts now represented by Democrats, as was evidenced by the 87-64 House vote for the passage of the housing bill. 
Every Republican voted in opposition, joined by 18 of the 102 members of the House Democratic majority. Two thirds of the Democratic dissenters were from Fairfield County, among them Leeper.
“There is no harder issue, probably, in Fairfield County, than tackling housing,” Leeper said. “It is the No. 1 driver for the cost of living.”
Like Lamont, she said she had concerns about whether the fair share goals were realistic. Rep. Sarah Keitt, also a Democrat of Fairfield, also voted no. But Rep. Cristin McCarthy Vahey, the third Democrat representing the Bridgeport suburb, voted for the measure.
Four years ago, she successfully worked for passage as co-chair of the Planning and Development Committee for a fair-housing bill that, among other things, eased the approval process for accessory dwelling units in single-family zones.
“I experienced a lot of the same kinds of conversations that we’re experiencing now, and some of the things that we talked about then in that bill that were so controversial, including accessory dwelling units, are things that people are now talking about as real positives,” she said. “And I see this opportunity the same way, because this issue is the No. 1 crisis facing our state.”
Joe DeLong, the executive director of the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, said many of his members were not opposed to the bill in totality but had reservations about certain provisions.
“We just think there’s a few provisions in this bill that weren’t completely thought out that could be modified in a way to make it more workable, and perhaps even get people more energy behind it, from the cities and towns, as opposed to animosity,” he said.
DeLong dismissed complaints that prioritizing state aid for communities building housing was punitive, but he is aware of concerns that language limiting the ability to require adequate parking for new housing was overly broad.
“There are towns where you’ll you’ll suffocate the businesses on town greens if all of the residents are taking up all of the parking spaces in that in those areas, and there’s nowhere for shoppers or anyone to come in and park,” DeLong said. “I don’t think those things were really thought about.”
 DeLong said it appears the governor is experiencing buyer’s remorse for giving his “blessing to the legislation before he realized exactly what was in it or how it was written.” But he praised Lamont for trying, if belatedly, to rally support for the substance of the bill, with revisions.
“He hasn’t really drawn a line in the sand with anybody on it. I think he’s trying to bring people together,” DeLong said. “I’ve been pretty hard on the governor over a lot of things lately, but wherever this thing ends up landing, I’m at least appreciative of his effort. You know that he’s trying to bring people together on it.”
House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, the legislature’s most prominent advocate of the bill, said that after meetings with the governor and his staff, he was uncertain of the governor’s intent.
“We’re conversing with the governor’s office,” he said. “We expect to come to an agreement certainly before Tuesday, and hopefully that will give him the comfort and the understanding that will allow him to sign the bill and knowing in the future that we’re going to come back to this and make some adjustments that are needed.”
Peter Harrison of the Regional Planning Association said a veto would be a mistake.
“I think a veto would be, I think, pretty bad politics, pretty bad policy. And it would signal Connecticut is still in the same rut,” he said. “And that’s going to signal a lot of bad things to businesses, home builders, young people, people that we want to come and do business in Connecticut.”
The governor said he shares the goals of the advocates.
“I know that we’re never going to get this state growing again with economic opportunity for everybody, never going to bring down the price of housing unless you get more housing,” Lamont said. “That’s workforce housing, affordable housing, supportive housing, lot of housing right here in New Haven, our downtown areas.
“I just got to figure out whether this bill is the right way to get it done.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_7895-1024x805.jpeg,,,2025-06-20 15:03:28.370464

A Utah County adult has been diagnosed with measles, state health officials said on Friday. The person was unvaccinated and didn’t report any out-of-state exposure, meaning that the infection was transmitted within Utah, they warned.
The Utah Department of Health and Human Services said it hasn’t identified any other cases in the state as of Friday morning. However, they’re encouraging Utahns who may have been in the same area as the infected person to monitor themselves for symptoms.

Before the diagnosis and during the illness’ infectious period, the Utah County resident visited several public places and medical centers in Orem, including Parkway Health Center on June 13, and the Timpanogos Regional ER, which the patient visited on June 14 from 2:14 p.m. to 7:02 p.m., the department said in a news release. 
“People who were at these sites at the same time or two hours after this person could have been exposed to measles,” the release says. “We encourage unvaccinated people who were in these locations during the exposure time period to monitor themselves for symptoms.”
The Utah diagnosis comes amid a national spike in measles cases reported in at least 36 states, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of Thursday, there were 1,214 confirmed cases across the country and 23 outbreaks reported in 2025.
Poll: Belief in false measles claims correlated with lower vaccination rates

Measles symptoms typically show up 7 to 14 days after exposure. Symptoms like fever higher than 102.2°F, cough, runny nose or red eyes may indicate early stages of measles. A rash could appear after four days of fever, the Department of Health and Human Services said. 
More than 90% of Utahns are reported to have the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine and “are highly protected against infection,” according to the department. However, infants younger than age 1 aren’t eligible for the immunization and are especially vulnerable to measles.
“The MMR vaccine has been used since the early 1970s. It has saved millions of lives and prevented significant suffering around the world.” Leisha Nolen, Utah Department of Health and Human Services state epidemiologist said in a prepared statement. “The MMR vaccine is safe and effective. Decades of careful research has shown the benefits of being vaccinated against measles far outweigh any risks the vaccine may pose. We encourage those who are not vaccinated to talk to their doctor about receiving the vaccine.”

May 22, 2025 | ScreenshotA corrective action plan, a new “go live” approval process and additional project management support are among steps being taken by the Michigan Department of State as it seeks to correct issues with its new campaign finance reporting system, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson told reporters on Friday.
Benson, in a virtual press call, detailed solutions the department was crafting after a disastrous launch of the $9 million Michigan Information Transparency Network project, or MiTN, which replaced its aging but heavily-used and mostly user-friendly campaign finance reporting system.
She also said department staff were working around the clock, until 11:30 p.m. on some nights and on weekends, to get the system back on track and improve it along the way.
“We’ve had hard conversations with our team about how this happened, the issues, the snafus, how we would move forward,” Benson said. “I am personally ensuring that we can do this consistently with our team over the months ahead. We are making improvements, not just to the system, but also internally to our own testing, training and launch processes, so that we can use this experience to continue to, on all of [the] other work that we’re doing to modernize systems within our department, increase those efficiencies ever more.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The rollout of the new system caused delays in reporting, and the overall functionality of the website was bothersome for many users, including news reporters, political watchdogs and nonprofit groups who rely on access to campaign finance information to better track how politicians spend campaign money and who gives it to them.
Meanwhile, scrutiny mounted last month from Republican lawmakers in charge of the state House of Representatives, who have separately requested hordes of information on election manuals and other materials through the House Oversight Committee. That includes a lawsuit filed by House Republicans against Benson over a subpoena related to the request, and an effort to impeach Benson over the spat and other grievances.
Christina Anderson, Benson’s chief of staff, testified on May 20 before a joint meeting of the House Oversight Committee and the House Subcommittee on General Government, where she apologized for the system issues and vowed improvements.
Benson on Friday gave an overview of what was being done from May through June.
The secretary of state said the department has increased the frequency of communication with users over bugs and issues and increased training. The department has conducted additional user research to better understand and prioritize improvements, and devoted additional project management and testing support from the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget.
As Anderson alluded to in May, Benson said Friday that it also has a corrective action plan in place with Tyler Technologies, the contracted vendor on the project. Benson said Tyler was processing refunds for any downtime the department has experienced on the website and has made clear that the department would suspend payments until the system is working as expected.
A new process to approve when aspects of the system go online was also established to ensure thorough vetting before new aspects launch.
On the technical side, Benson said four main improvements were made via two new software updates between May 31 and June 17.
Additional data fields were implemented to align candidate and lawmaker forms as outlined in statute, and the public search function was also improved. Users can now search by contributor information, view migrated committee notifications, and fixes were made to lobby search functions to include searching by office title.
An improved filer experience was implemented, Benson said, fixing known issues with committee module import information and data display fields within the program. 
Other improvements dealt with personal finance disclosure data both for filers and the data itself.
On the personal finance disclosure system, the department has a July 13 deadline to launch and improve that system, less than two weeks before the July 25 filing deadline. To date, the department has received information from 159 filers, with 47 submissions through the new network and 112 via email submissions or PDF files.
Benson said the department has added additional training videos to the system for filers, additional after-hours phone support, increased email communication and resolved a handful of issues directly with filers.
System improvements for the July personal finance system release include a campaign finance filing summary report, which was missing when the state transitioned to the new system, usability improvements for filers and additional improvements to the public search module.
As updates continue, the department is also conducting a usability study with eMichigan, the state’s online government services platform, to drive long-term user experience improvements, which is a work in progress.
Benson also plans to testify before the House Oversight Committee on Tuesday, June 24, which she announced in a letter sent Tuesday to state Rep. Jay DeBoyer (R-Clay), the committee’s chair.
The letter, written by Anderson, notes that Benson was “pleased” to accept the committee’s request for testimony on MiTN improvements, but noted the expectation was that questions would focus only on improvements to the new system and not other matters considering the ongoing litigation between House Republicans and Benson.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Screenshot-2025-05-22-at-4.37.05 PM-1024x666.png,,,2025-06-20 15:03:28.370464

Kobach urged the revenue department to transfer revenue from the sales tax exclusively to the county, and as of this month the state agency will comply with the recommendation. In 2024, Morton County voters overwhelmingly approved a 10-year, 1% sales tax targeting revenue to the county hospital and ambulance services. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Attorney General Kris Kobach objected to the Kansas Department of Revenue’s decision to divide proceeds from Morton County’s 1% sales tax among the county and municipalities after voters a decade ago passed a flawed resolution that didn’t specifically tie the revenue to health care.
In 2024, the Morton County Commission learned the Department of Revenue had since 2015 — nine years — spread revenue from the countywide 1% sales tax to three cities as well as the county.
Kobach said in a nonbinding legal opinion last month that the revenue department should stop carving off sales tax revenue for distribution to cities because the clear voter intent 10 years ago was to earmark sales tax revenue for benefit of the county hospital.
On Friday, an official with the Department of Revenue said that starting this month Morton County’s 1% sales tax and compensating use tax would be remitted solely to the county government.
The problem from the Department of Revenue’s perspective was the original sales tax resolution put forward in 2015 by the county commission referenced a general tax provision rather than a special tax provision tied to funding of health care services. The revenue department concluded the resolution embraced by county voters required the 1% sales tax revenue to be shared with cities and the county.
However, Kobach said the ballot debate was framed in a way voters understood a “yes” vote for the sales tax equated to support for collecting sales tax for county health care operations.
“The question here is whether the electors of Morton County understood what their vote meant on the ballot proposal. We believe they did,” Kobach’s written opinion said.
In the opinion, Kobach said state law didn’t require the commission’s published notice or ballot proposition to include a reference to the state law giving a county authority to create a retail sales tax. The result of the commission’s citing of the wrong state law in that 2015 resolution shouldn’t have resulted in diversion to cities of money that voters thought would go to county health services, Kobach said.
“After the voters approved the measure, but before adopting the tax, the board passed and published an amended resolution correcting the authorizing provision,” the opinion said.
The conflict came to the forefront as county officials worked to gain voter consent for a new 10-year, 1% sales tax supporting the cash-strapped county hospital and emergency medical services. In May 2024, that countywide sales tax for health care passed 547-215.
Presentations prior to the latest vote indicated the objective was to invest three-fourths of revenue at Norton County Hospital and one-fourth in Norton County Emergency Medical Services.
Kevin Faughnder, chief operating officer of Norton County Hospital, campaigned for the sales tax by pointing to rising operating costs and declining insurance reimbursement revenue at the hospital.
He said Norton County Hospital was among 88 rural critical access hospitals in Kansas operating at a loss.
“The challenges Norton is facing are not unique to Norton County Hospital,” he said. “They’re just what the reality of health care is.”
If the sales tax were to fail at the ballot box, Faughnder said, the county hospital could be compelled to reduce important medical services or eventually close.
County EMS director Craig Sowards told voters the sales tax was designed to avoid escalation of the county’s property tax.
“Our hope is the sales tax will offset the need for any type of mill levy. Nobody wants property taxes to go up,” Sowards said.

President Donald Trump’s recent budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2026, a preliminary plan released in early May and known as “skinny” because a more robust ask will follow, outlines a 44% cut to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, including a 43% reduction in rental assistance programs that support more than 9 million Americans.
Trump also wants to consolidate federal housing aid, which includes programs such as Housing Choice Vouchers and public housing, into block grants — or finite amounts of money that states would administer. The proposal also would cap eligibility for many aid recipients at two years, and significantly limit federal oversight over how states dole out housing aid to low-income, disabled and older renters.
The approach tracks suggestions outlined in the Heritage Foundation playbook known as Project 2025, in which first-term Trump advisers and other conservatives detailed how a second Trump term might look. The chapter on HUD recommends limiting a person’s time on federal assistance and “devolving many HUD functions to states and localities.”
To that end, Trump’s new housing aid budget request would put states in charge, urging them to create new systems and removing federal regulatory certainty that residents, landlords and developers rely on for low-income housing.
Trump’s request also proposes new rules, such as a two-year time limit on the receipt of Housing Choice Vouchers, formerly known as Section 8 vouchers, for households that do not include persons with disabilities or older adults. The vouchers, federal money paid directly to landlords, help eligible families afford rent in the private market.
Trump’s allies call the changes responsible, while detractors worry about rising homelessness among those who now receive aid.
Among the nearly 4.6 million households receiving HUD housing assistance in the 2020 census, the average household was made up of two people, and the average annual income was just under $18,000, according to a department report last year.
In testimony to Congress this month about the proposed fiscal 2026 budget, HUD Secretary Scott Turner said that HUD rental assistance is meant to be temporary, “the same way a treadway facilitates the crossing of an obstacle.”
“The block grant process will empower states to be more thoughtful and precise in their distribution and spending of taxpayer dollars,” Turner said.
The current budget reconciliation package, the tax-and-spending bill named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, doesn’t address individual Housing Choice Vouchers or send federal housing aid back to states. However, it would offer tax credits to developers of affordable housing and expand areas that could qualify for additional favorable tax cuts. That bill passed the House and is now undergoing consideration in the Senate.
 Trump’s hopes for next year

The president’s fiscal year 2026 budget request serves as an outline of the administration’s vision for next year’s federal spending.
Congress — specifically the House and Senate Appropriations committees — must draft, negotiate and pass appropriations bills, which ultimately decide how much funding programs like rental assistance will receive.
Trump’s budget request provides sparse details on how much housing aid the federal government would give to each state, and how it would oversee spending. Housing advocates and state agencies are concerned.
“A big piece of the proposal is essentially re-creating rental assistance as we know it, and turning it into a state rental assistance block grant program,” said Kim Johnson, senior director of policy director at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
Experts say any resulting aid cuts would disproportionately affect families with children, older adults and individuals with disabilities, many of whom rely on rental subsidies and support to remain stably housed in high-rent markets.
“It would completely change how households might be able to receive rental assistance of any kind,” said Sonya Acosta, a senior policy analyst with the center. “It combines five of these programs that millions of people rely on, cuts the funding almost in half, and then leaves it completely to states to decide how to use that funding.”
That’s a shift most states can’t afford, say housing advocates.
A state-by-state analysis by the National Alliance to End Homelessness shows the highest rates of housing assistance are in the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, along with a few blue states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island.
“There’s no way to cut 43% of funding for rental assistance without people losing that assistance or their housing security,” said Johnson, of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
And it’s not just urban centers that would be hit; rural areas of Mississippi and Louisiana also have high rates of federal housing aid.
“A rural community who solely relies on federal funding would be even more impacted,” Johnson added.
While state housing finance agencies proved during the pandemic that they can rapidly deploy federal funding, Stockton Williams, executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies, warned that the budget’s shift to block grants would require sufficient funding, a clear transition plan and strong oversight to ensure success.
Housing authorities are requesting further guidance from the feds and members of Congress, and more detail is needed on how any block-grant process would work, Stockton wrote in an emailed statement to Stateline.
“There is still a risk of overregulation and micromanagement with a block grant,” he wrote. “That said, for any type of new block grant to the states to work, there would need to be a transition period both to ensure states can build the necessary infrastructure and oversight and to test and train new systems with the private sector, local government, and nonprofit organizations that would interact with it.”
In New York City, which operates the nation’s largest housing voucher program, officials didn’t outline what steps they would take if Trump’s proposed cuts become reality, but a spokesperson said the plans would hurt residents.
Howard Husock, a senior fellow in domestic policy studies at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, believes the most innovative aspect of the Trump proposal is the introduction of time limits on housing assistance, a mechanism not currently used in HUD’s rental programs.
But he cautioned that a blanket two-year time limit — especially if applied to existing tenants — would be “a recipe for chaos,” particularly in high-need areas such as New York City. Instead, he supports a phased approach focusing on new, non-disabled, non-elderly tenants.
“Block grants would allow states to move away from one-size-fits-all and apply rules based on their own housing needs,” Husock said to Stateline in an interview.
Affordable housing advocates disagree.
“If passed, the president’s proposed budget would be devastating for all federally assisted tenants,” said Michael Horgan, press secretary for the New York City Housing Authority in a statement to Stateline. “Block grants, program funding cuts, and time limits will only worsen the current housing crisis.”
A recent analysis of 100 metro areas by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows that households using housing vouchers are more likely to live in higher income areas than those with other federal rental assistance.
“There is a high share of these households using [other] federal rental assistance in higher-poverty areas,” Gartland, the center’s researcher, explained, noting that programs such as the Housing Choice Vouchers are a rare but essential tool for expanding housing mobility.
“If you’re cutting the programming by 40%, you’re just putting additional strain on that program and just limiting that potential.”
 For housing providers, uncertainty is growing

For property owners and landlords, the proposed shift in federal assistance and housing aid to the states isn’t just a policy question, it’s a business risk.
Alexandra Alvarado, director of education at the American Apartment Owners Association, said many smaller landlords are closely following proposed changes to the voucher program.
“Section 8 is a stabilizing force, especially for mom-and-pop landlords,” she said. “Many have had loyal tenants for years and rely on that steady income.”
According to Alvarado, landlords — especially small operators — have come to view housing vouchers not just as a public good, but also as a reliable business model where rent is often on time and predictable.
But with the proposed changes placing administration in the hands of state governments, landlords fear a breakdown in consistency.
“If the administration is serious about shifting responsibility to states, landlords will need a lot more clarity, and fast,” Alvarado said. “These programs are supposed to offer certainty. If states run them inconsistently or inefficiently, landlords may exit the market altogether.”
The transition itself, she added, may be destabilizing.
“You’re turning an ecosystem upside down. Change too many parts of the system at once, and you risk unintended domino effects.”
While developers may benefit from new tax incentives in the budget, Alvarado said that doesn’t offset the instability small landlords fear.
“Most mom-and-pop landlords don’t want to evict or raise rent, especially during hard times,” she said. “They just want to provide stable housing and be treated fairly.”

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.

Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

– Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky


But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
Growing threats
In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”

Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
Language matters
Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”

Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
Security measures
Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

Dias Goncalves was arrested by federal immigration authorities shortly thereafter. (Screenshot from Mesa County Sheriff’s Officer YouTube)A Mesa County sheriff’s deputy who shared information that led federal immigration officers to arrest a Utah college student in Grand Junction has been placed on leave pending an internal investigation.
The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office said earlier this week that federal authorities had “extrapolated” information about Caroline Dias Goncalves’ immigration status from information sent by Investigator Alexander Zwinck via the encrypted messaging app Signal to a group organized by federal law enforcement for drug interdiction efforts.
Zwinck pulled over Dias Goncalves on Interstate 70 near Fruita on June 5 for driving too close to a tractor-trailer, and although she was let go with a warning she was detained a short time later by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Body camera footage released by the department shows Zwinck asking Dias Goncalvez, who was born in Brazil and brought to the U.S. by her parents as a 7-year-old, whether she was “born and raised” in Utah, after noting she had “a little bit of an accent.”

Colorado law generally prohibits cooperation and information-sharing between local law enforcement agencies and federal immigration authorities. ICE representatives have ignored questions about the incident from Newsline and other media outlets.
The sheriff’s office declined this week to answer follow-up questions about the content of the Signal message and its intended purpose, but it said in an updated statement Thursday that it was “reviewing communications” sent by its officers to the group chat as it investigates whether the message complied with state law and departmental policies.
“This includes, but is not limited to, working to understand if and when Mesa County Sheriff’s Office employees were made aware that the information shared for drug interdiction efforts was being utilized for immigration enforcement,” the statement said.
Whether Zwinck faces disciplinary action “will be determined by the outcome of the full administrative investigation,” it added.
The arrest of Dias Goncalves, a nursing student at the University of Utah with no criminal record, sparked an outcry from national groups that advocate on behalf of “Dreamers,” young adults who lack permanent legal status after being brought to the U.S. as children.
“Caroline — and Ximena Arias Cristóbal and numerous other Dreamers recently detained and even deported — should have never been targeted in the first place,” Gaby Pacheco, president of the advocacy group TheDream.US, said in a press release. “America’s national interests are better served by delivering education and legal status for Dreamers instead of raids, detentions, and deportations.”
Tensions over immigration enforcement have risen across the country in recent weeks as President Donald Trump’s administration, seeking to fulfill its promised mass-deportation campaign, has ordered ICE to dramatically broaden the scope of its operations. Contrary to claims by the Trump administration that its efforts are targeting violent criminals, the share of people held in ICE detention with no criminal record has risen sharply since January.
Dias Goncalves is expected to be released from the ICE detention facility in Aurora in the coming days after an immigration judge in Denver granted her bond on Wednesday. Her attorney, Jon Hyman, said that she and her family were requesting privacy after the “traumatic past few weeks.”
“We know that Caroline’s arrest and detention should not have happened in the first place,” Hyman said in a statement. “Investigations should continue to ensure that other young immigrants in Colorado do not have to go through the same harrowing experiences.”

(Courtesy photo)As Katrice Grant went through high school, college and graduate school, she participated in federally funded student support programs called TRIO, which introduced her to the idea of going to college in the first place.
The TRIO programs — described as ones “designed to identify and provide services for individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds”— set Grant on the path for campus visits and academic scholarships that paid for part of her tuition while she studied psychology and Africana studies. TRIO advisors connected her to her community on campus and future opportunities; boosted her the confidence and organization to delve into research; and paid for her travel to a conference in Maryland where she received her first graduate school offer at Johns Hopkins University.

That education allowed Grant to work as a K-12 school counselor for about 12 years in Virginia, Dubai, Albuquerque and Bernalillo.
Now a student success specialist at the Student Support Services-TRIO program at the University of New Mexico’s main campus in Albuquerque, Grant says the Trump administration’s plan to zero out funding for TRIO —funded at nearly $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2024— would harm students and their families.
While TRIO programs don’t have race- or ethnicity-based criteria for admission, Grant said, the reality of the U.S. leads to disadvantages for people of color, and so the program includes many students of color.
“We’re all being threatened with elimination,” Grant said. “If we think about the Trump administration’s attack on diversity, equity and inclusion, any kind of programs that support those missions are being targeted even more.”
Statewide, 42 TRIO programs at 16 different institutions serve more than 10,000 students, according to TRIO New Mexico. Those programs are supported by more than $13 million in federal funding.
In interviews last week, people who work for TRIO programs in New Mexico told Source NM they provide students with holistic services, including academic advising, tutoring, financial literacy and emotional support. Without these programs, they say, thousands of students and their families would lose their futures, and New Mexico’s economy would suffer.
“I think it’s going to hurt New Mexico and states all over the nation, economically,” said Bernadine Booky, director of student support services at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces and a past president of TRIO New Mexico.

Rick Martinez, an academic advisor in the TRIO Student Support Service program at San Juan College in Farmington and president of TRIO New Mexico, told Source NM that cutting the programs would dramatically drop the rate of students at two-year universities graduating or transferring to four-year programs, and ultimately send the country backwards when it comes to education.
“It’s really sentencing them to a life of low-skilled labor type jobs, or a much longer process of upward socioeconomic migration,” Martinez said. “When we don’t have people in higher-paying jobs, they’re also not paying higher taxes, so this has widespread implications on the entire nation.”
Martinez said students do not succeed when they are only given money for tuition and books. They also need career counseling and life skills training that their parents weren’t able to give them, he said.
For example, first-year students in the TRIO program at UNM are expected to meet monthly with an advisor and a peer coach twice per month to help them get acclimated in the classroom, connected to student organizations and informed about the best places to eat off campus, Grant said.
Peer coaches offer tutoring, workshops in soft skills like good study habits, career readiness, financial literacy and social and cultural activities, Grant said. The Education Opportunity Center at UNM also helps adult students get back into academics, she said.
TRIO workers say these needs are even more pronounced in more rural parts of New Mexico, especially in areas adjacent to Native nations.
“Many of our students are from the reservation, so coming to San Juan College is their first time off the reservation,” Martinez said. “We really give students cultural experiences where they haven’t had that opportunity otherwise.”

Most of the students at San Juan College come from Navajo Nation but others also come from Apache and Ute nations, he said.
The administration’s budget recommendations also said colleges and universities should pay for these kinds of support programs instead of “engaging in woke ideology with federal taxpayer subsidies.”
Booky said this stance shows how uninformed the administration is about what TRIO does, its effects and its history.
With roots in U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson administration’s “war on poverty” legislation in the 1960s, the federal education programs called TRIO are meant to support first-generation college students, low-income students and students with disabilities.
U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon on June 3 said the goal of her proposed cuts at her agency is to “make education better, fairer and more accountable by ending federal overreach and empowering families, schools and states who best know the needs of their students.”
McMahon said her priority is to “reform and strengthen those programs, fix what’s wrong, increase accountability and not abolish them.”
TRIO program officials told Source NM that there are already strong accountability measures in place, with annual audits.
“There are very detailed measures of trying to stay accountable,” Grant said. “If the program isn’t meeting the grant objectives, then it wouldn’t be funded.”
TRIO programs are held to a high standard, Booky said, and their grant funding can already be cut if they don’t perform to the objectives they’re required to meet.
Russel Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, in his May 2 budget recommendations for the upcoming fiscal year, referred to TRIO and Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) as “a relic of the past,” and access to college is no longer the obstacle it once was.
Booky said her jaw dropped when she read the administration’s plans.
“They have done nothing but create obstacles now, with their proposals,” she said.
James P. Holloway, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs at the University of New Mexico, told Source NM that both TRIO and GEAR UP are “tremendously valuable programs that serve the people of New Mexico.”
“These programs help thousands of young and adult learners annually to complete high school, to be ready for college and to get the most from their undergraduate experience,” Holloway said in a statement. “Their loss would certainly create new barriers to educational attainment for the people of our state.”
Grant said while she acknowledges that progress has been made in the U.S., she said there is still a long way to go.
“All the oppression that has been experienced, and continues to be experienced, is still impacting our students,” she said. “These programs are needed, and they will never be a relic of the past until our country looks a lot different than what it looks like today.”

Kelly Ayotte says she will veto the plan. (Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)There’s nothing easy about crafting a state budget. Not only do you have to match squishy revenue projections with real spending, but the line between needs and wants is both subjective and blurry.
That essential complexity is the main cause of the intraparty squabble between House and Senate budget writers and first-term Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who is now threatening to veto the two-year spending plan that is supposed to be in place at the start of the fiscal year on July 1.
Ayotte’s revenue projections have always been more optimistic than both the House and Senate, and so while the veto threat may be a little surprising, the current Republican divide was not only predictable but inevitable. And the path that led us here stretches back much further than the beginning of the legislative session or even the November election. Through overly aggressive business tax cuts, the repeal of the interest and dividends tax, and the expansion of a rudderless school voucher program, among other purposeful state missteps and various federal clawbacks, Republicans have abandoned huge swaths of the people they are supposed to serve, now and tomorrow, for the single-minded pursuit of ideological purity.
This, right now, is the bed they made.
Throughout New Hampshire’s budget process, I’ve been thinking a lot about Ron Swanson. He’s the white, heterosexual, libertarian everyman who was played brilliantly by Nick Offerman on “Parks and Recreation.” If you were to screen a montage of Swanson’s philosophies in action for New Hampshire Republicans, you would hear nothing but admiration. He can and will fix anything, builds his own furniture, kills his own food, defends personal privacy with as much vigor as he attacks bureaucracy, and holds a deep mistrust of traditional monetary systems. Nothing is wasted in the world he inhabits — not words, actions, or emotions. He is the celebrated ideal of the rugged individualist.
But in all of that admiration it’s easy to miss the subtlety of Swanson’s beautiful undoing: as much as he despises the idea of government institutions, that is how much he cares about real people. He struggles because the rigid political identity he embraces is, in the end, incompatible with the realities of our interconnectedness — of people, yes, but that extends to the environment, its resources, and even the imperfect systems we have designed in our endless striving for universal prosperity.
That’s the hardest pill for Republicans to swallow, it seems: Try as you might, you cannot separate the institutions you dismantle from the people they were created to serve.
In this whole budget mess, Ayotte appears most upset about the way House and Senate decisions harm politically important constituencies, namely police and firefighters, whose pensions are affected, and the city of Manchester, which stands to lose millions for education. She also knows that the back-of-the-budget cuts to the state’s largest department, Health and Human Services, hold unforeseeable consequences — and peril — for her administration and the people of the state. 
She is right to be upset about those cuts. But, again, this isn’t the hand that Republicans were dealt. This is the hand they chose, and the cards were face up. They picked the tone and the targets, and the priorities and policies flowed from there.
Imagine if Republicans attacked corruption within the health insurance industry — which builds wealth through unscrupulous claim denials — with the same passion that they have attacked immigrants. 
Imagine if they went after corporate polluters — who receive a fat taxpayer subsidy every time they skip town without cleaning up their mess — the way they have gone after trans teens who dare to play on a school soccer team.
Imagine if, instead of writing voucher checks to wealthy families who already send their kids to private schools, they tried to fix a funding system that directly penalizes people who live in our poorest communities.
Just imagine, and then maybe spend a little time thinking critically about the mess New Hampshire finds itself in.
The right question to ask when starting work on a budget “for all of New Hampshire” is, “What do we owe to each other?” But the question Republicans have built their entire identity on is, “Among those with little, who is getting more than they deserve?”

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.

Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

– Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky


But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
Growing threats
In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Honoring slain Minnesota leader, Maine House speaker makes plea not to normalize political violence

Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
Language matters
Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”

Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
Security measures
Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

Regardless, LGBTQ+ rights organizations and their legislative allies say they are determined not to let GOP attempts to repeal Michigan’s protections succeed.
The nation’s highest court on Wednesday issued a 6-3 decision ruling that a law Tennessee’s state legislature passed in 2023 banning gender affirming care for minors would be upheld.

The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision did not itself ban gender-affirming care for young patients, rather it upheld a state law, which is an important distinction, Michigan state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky (D-Livonia) said on “X” following the decision, as Michigan has no such law.
“An important thing to remember in light of SCOTUS’ ruling on gender affirming care for minors: it does not ban this care. It allows states to enact laws to ban it. Michigan does not have such a law, and gender affirming care should still be available,” Pohutsky posted.
Her colleague, state Rep. Emily Dievendorf (D-Lansing), Michigan’s first openly nonbinary lawmaker, issued a statement reiterating that point and making clear the fight would continue for trans rights. 
“To every trans young person and family watching this ruling with fear and heartbreak: I see you. I grieve with you. And I’m standing with you. You are not alone. Trans youth are loved, and we are fighting for you, today, tomorrow, and every day this fight continues,” Dievendorf stated.

During the two years that Democrats held a once-in-decades majority in Michigan’s Legislature from 2023 to 2024, Pohutsky, Dievendorf, and other lawmakers, put numerous pro-LGBTQ+ policies into law including embedding LGBTQ+ rights into the state’s civil rights laws, making it easier for transgender Michiganders to change their names and banning the “gay panic” legal defense.
Additionally, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel fought against Tennessee’s ban being upheld, signing onto an amicus brief against bans in Tennessee and Kentucky in 2023 which argued the laws were discriminatory.
However, Michigan Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), who is also a candidate for governor, applauded the Supreme Court’s decision Wednesday on “X’, calling for Michigan to do the same.
“Let’s make Michigan a sanctuary for our children and common sense,” Nesbitt said on X.
Republican lawmakers in both chambers of Michigan’s Legislature have introduced legislation to ban gender affirming care, which mainly consists of talk therapy and hormone treatments, but also more rarely, gender-affirming surgical intervention for young patients.
It’s unlikely such legislation would pass Michigan’s Democratic-led state Senate or get approval from the state’s Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer.
When signing into law a ban on conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ youth in 2023, Whitmer called herself a “lifelong ally” to the community who as the mother of a gay daughter was proud to sign the ban into law.
Advocates vow to ‘never stop fighting’ for trans youth
The U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to uphold Tennessee’s ban on gender affirming health care for minors marks a devastating blow for the health and well-being of Tennessee residents and a bad trend of legislative harm towards transgender youth, Equality Michigan said in a statement following the decision.
While Michigan has no ban on health care services for transgender residents, Executive Director of Equality Michigan Erin Knott said the group stands ready to “fight like hell” to preserve the rights of transgender youth in the state.

“This decision is cruel and dangerous. It ignores the overwhelming consensus of the medical community and opens the door for politicians to play games with kids’ lives. In Michigan, we stand firm. Trans youth are loved, protected, and supported here.”
Also speaking out was Stand with Trans, which posted to TikTok that while the ruling was “was a painful setback for trans youth and the families who love them…hope is not lost.” 
The group noted several trans-related court victories, including a federal judge certifying a class-action lawsuit challenging the administration’s passport gender marker ban and a federal court ruling in favor of LGBTQ+ health centers and resource organizations who had faced grant threats.
“Yes, the Supreme Court targeted gender-affirming care. But this ruling does not define our future. We are resilient. We are growing. We are still here. At Stand with Trans, we will never stop fighting for a world where trans youth can live fully, freely, and with pride,” the group posted.
Meanwhile, a Trans and Nonbinary Community Meeting has been scheduled for Monday, June 30 at 6:30 p.m. in Ann Arbor, hosted by The People’s Coalition. It will allow interested community members to ask questions and hear legislative updates from State Sens. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) and Sue Shink (D-Northfield Township) and State Reps. Jimmie Wilson, Jr. (D-Ypsilanti), Jennifer Conlin (D-Ann Arbor Township), Jason Morgan (D-Ann Arbor), Morgan Foreman (Pittsfield Township) and Carrie Rheingans (D-Ann Arbor).

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Scientists at Southeastern Louisiana University have found dangerously high levels of toxic metals and other contaminants in Lake Maurepas and have traced most of the pollution to industrial and other human activities.
Led by SLU chemistry professor Fereshteh Emami, a team of researchers analyzed 400 water and sediment samples collected from multiple locations and depths in the lake from June through December 2023 and developed new methodologies to trace the origin of the pollutants, track how they spread and determine the factors that make them worse. The results were “alarming,” according to the study, which was published in Environments in November and accepted for publication in another scientific journal, ACS Omega, this month.
The analysis revealed concentrations of heavy metals and nutrients far beyond the thresholds the Environmental Protection Agency considers safe. Arsenic levels peaked at 420% above the safe limit for lakes and 6,300% over the EPA’s drinking water threshold. Lead and cadmium were detected at similarly high levels averaging orders of magnitude above safe limits. Nickel, copper, and manganese concentrations were also observed above their respective safety thresholds.
Heavy metal exposure is known to cause severe health problems and can be fatal to humans.
“I was just surprised how polluted the area is,” Emami said in an interview.
Emami’s team at Southeastern developed new methodologies that allowed them to trace the pollutants to Pass Manchac and three rivers that feed into Lake Maurepas: the Blind, Amite and Tickfaw. It indicated that industrial and agricultural activities are major sources of the pollution.
The researchers also detected a spike in contaminants near Pass Manchac following the Oct. 23, 2023, “super-fog” multi-vehicle pileup on Interstate 55, indicating that toxic chemicals from combustion vehicles are also running off into the lake.
The heavy metal concentrations found in Lake Maurepas are similar to those later detected following breaks in the waste containment levees at the Atlantic Alumina (Atalco) facility in Gramercy last year. Atalco’s toxic metals — which also included arsenic, cadmium and lead, among others — ended up in a public drainage system that flows into the Blind River Swamp of Lake Maurepas.
Although Emami’s new methodologies did not trace the pollutants to specific facilities, news of the Atalco incident brought to light a previously unknown event that aligns with their findings, at least anecdotally, Emami said. More sampling and analysis is needed deeper upstream into those rivers in order to further narrow down the sources, she said.
The researchers found other contaminants in the lake, including high levels of nitrogen, phosphorus and a parameter called chemical oxygen demand, which indicates the presence of organic pollutants in water. According to the study, all three parameters were elevated at averages beyond what is considered safe. Their methodologies traced these pollutants to urban runoff and agriculture.
The samples contained other toxic metals, such as mercury, at levels that were within safe limits. But the study noted they still pose a threat to humans and the environment through bioaccumulation, in which low doses of a heavy metal can amass in a living organism over time and add up to a dangerous level.
“Because of the non-biodegradable and bioaccumulative nature of these heavy metals, they could accumulate and biomagnify in fish and other aquatic animals,” the researchers wrote. “As a result, they could enter the human body eventually through the food chain.”
Emami said mercury is particularly dangerous because it easily bioaccumulates in crops and animals such as fish. Her team is conducting a follow-up study in which they are testing aquatic samples from Lake Maurepas and surrounding rivers for heavy metals and other contaminants such as polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), known as “forever chemicals.”
Corinne Gibb, a chemist who works for the environmental advocacy Louisiana Bucket Brigade and was not involved in the study, said the research very clearly points to pollution that is flowing into Lake Maurepas from other water bodies.
“What they’re showing for sure is that the pollution is coming through those rivers,” Gibb said.
A Louisiana refinery spilled toxic waste into the community and knew about it for months

Southeastern has been monitoring Lake Maurepas since the proposal of a carbon sequestration project by Air Products & Chemicals. The company plans to use carbon capture technology to trap emissions from an $8 billion hydrogen manufacturing complex in Ascension Parish and take them by pipeline to Lake Maurepas, where Air Products will have the capacity to inject an estimated 5 million tons of CO2 per year about a mile below the lakebed.
In the first half of 2023, Air Products performed seismic testing to map the geological formations under the lake. In August of that year, the company moved a large temporary drilling rig into Lake Maurepas that served as a test well for the collection of core and fluid data, which ended in early 2024.
Emami’s team initially suspected but were ultimately unable to link any chemical pollutants to Air Products’ activity in the lake. Aside from providing a multi-million dollar funding grant, the company played no role in any aspects of the study, its design or the decision to publish the results.
“We’re committed to protecting the Lake Maurepas environment and ecosystem, which is why we have supported the independent monitoring of the Lake,” Air Products spokeswoman Christina Stephens said Wednesday after learning about the SLU study’s findings. “It’s important for people to understand the lake’s ecosystem, and as our work progresses we will continue to operate in a safe and responsible fashion.”
That still doesn’t assuage concerns of some local lawmakers. Rep. Kim Coates, R-Ponchatoula, who ran for office on a platform of protecting Lake Maurepas, pointed out the study shows the baseline water quality of the lake is already deeply concerning and could be made worse with general disturbances that accompany lakebed drilling and similar industrial activities.
“Adding deep geological carbon sequestration to an ecosystem already under strain from nutrient pollution raises serious questions,” Coates said. “Even well-intentioned projects can have unintended consequences in such a delicate and dynamic environment. Until more is known, extreme caution is not just warranted — it’s essential.”
SLU’s study is the first of its kind to combine dynamic statistical models with water quality data to trace pollutant sources and their driving factors. This allowed Emami’s team to provide a comprehensive assessment of the chemical composition of Lake Maurepas based on a wide array of data. The methodology can also be used to predict when and where pollutants will flow or migrate to other areas, she said.
“Using the models, we were looking for the origins of the pollutant sources, and I wanted to know if the pollution sources in the Blind River could [let us] predict what was gonna show up in Manchac,” Emami said. “And it did.”
Emami said Pass Manchac’s significant tidal exchange between Lake Maurepas and Lake Pontchartrain has allowed her team to conclude that the water quality and levels of pollution between the two estuaries are virtually the same.
Until the start of Southeastern’s research, there was no ongoing public monitoring for toxic metals in Lake Maurepas.
Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality spokesman Matthew Day said the public should be aware of existing fish consumption advisories, such as one issued last year for Lake Maurepas based on elevated mercury levels detected in fish tissue. However, the agency does not conduct any regular heavy metal monitoring in Lake Maurepas because it is not required under Clean Water Act obligations, Day said.

(Inset photo courtesy Iowa District Court; facility photo via Google Earth)An Iowa nurse who allegedly admitted stealing painkillers from nursing home residents has agreed to surrender her license.
The Iowa Board of Nursing alleges Andrea Raffield, 42, of Reinbeck admitted that on several occasions she removed controlled substances from the supply of a nursing home and misappropriated the drugs for her personal use.
According to the board, the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing investigated the matter and determined an allegation of dependent abuse against Raffield was founded based on the preponderance of evidence related to the alleged drug theft.
The available board records give no indication as to where the alleged violations occurred. However, court records show that in November 2023, Raffield was criminally charged with tampering with records, prohibited acts involving a controlled substance, and prohibited acts involving illegal intent to deliver a prescription drug.
Police alleged Raffield had used her position as a licensed practical nurse working at the Westbrook Acres nursing home in Gladbrook to illegally obtain the drugs.
According to police records, Raffield concocted a scheme that involved ordering unneeded Tramadol, an opioid painkiller, for a resident, destroying the records of delivery of the drug, and then stealing the medication for her own use. In addition, police alleged she diverted Tramadol from “multiple residents” of Westbrook Acres for her personal use. At least 54 tablets of Tramadol were stolen, according to police.
As part of a plea agreement, the records-tampering charge was later dismissed and Raffield pleaded guilty to the two prohibited-acts charges and received a deferred judgment. Assuming she successfully completes a sentence of two years’ probation, her conviction will be expunged from court records.
Raffield was also charged with the misdemeanor offense of dependent adult abuse. Pursuant to the plea agreement reached in the drug case, the abuse charge was dismissed.



Other nurses face disciplinary charges
Other Iowa nurses facing sanctions from the board include:
— Katia Shallcross of Fort Madison, who recently surrendered her license. Board records indicate that in 2017, Shallcross, then known as Katia Petlitchka, surrendered her license for the first time after pleading guilty to a criminal charge of running a drug house in Lee County.
In July 2024, Shallcross requested reinstatement of her license to work in Iowa as a practical nurse. In February 2025, the board consented to the request, noting that Shallcross had not had any further criminal convictions since surrendering her license and had completed a mental health evaluation and substance abuse evaluation, both of which were reviewed by the board.
Shallcross’ new license was subject to a probationary period of at least 12 months during which she was required to complete a nursing refresher course, submit to chemical testing and the monitoring of her practice, and refrain from using alcohol or illicit drugs.
Two months later, in April 2025, the board charged Shallcross with behavior that constitutes unethical conduct pr practice that is harmful to the public in that she failed to comply with board orders. According to the board, Shallcross has again surrendered her license, stating that she doesn’t want to submit to monitoring and has decided to “go a different route professionally.”
–– Laurie Brockman-Jones of Tiffin, a registered nurse charged with practicing nursing while under the influence of alcohol, marijuana, or illicit drugs, or while being impaired by the use of pharmacological agents or medications.
The available board documents give no indication as to when or where the alleged violation took place or whether any patients were harmed. Board records indicate the charge was filed by the board in December 2024, although it was only announced on June 11.
— Rochelle Westvold of Ames, a registered nurse, is charged with practicing on an inactive license. The board has opted not to disclose how long, or where, Westvold practiced without an active license.  The charge was levied against Westvold in December 2024, but was only announced on June 11.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Westbrook-Acres-in-Gladbrook.jpg,,,2025-06-20 14:05:43.021095

(Photo by Ted Soqui for CalMatters)Donald Trump can continue to control the National Guard in California for the time being after a panel of judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit determined he followed the law in deploying troops to Los Angeles.
The order, handed down Thursday evening, is the latest in a fast-moving legal saga playing out over Trump’s decision to call up the National Guard and U.S. Marines to the Los Angeles area in response to protests after federal immigration law enforcement agents began worksite raids and arrests two weeks ago. California’s Democratic leadership, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, has called the deployment unnecessary and illegal.
The appeals court order in a lawsuit filed by Newsom contesting the deployment isn’t surprising; the panel signaled an openness to the Trump administration’s legal arguments during a legal hearing on Tuesday.
In court earlier this week, attorneys from the Trump administration argued the president’s deployment was “unreviewable” by courts.
The appeals court judges disagreed that the decision was beyond the reach of the judicial branch, but found the president had a legitimate interest in protecting federal employees when he called up the troops.
“The undisputed facts demonstrate that before the deployment of the National Guard, protesters ‘pinned down’ several federal officers and threw ‘concrete chunks, bottles of liquid and other objects’ at the officers.”
Two of those judges were appointed by President Trump in his previous term.
Trump deployed the troops through a presidential memo on June 7 and cited a rarely used federal statute permitting a president to deploy the National Guard in times of invasion, domestic rebellion, or the inability for the federal government to carry out its laws. Trump’s order was for 60 days and technically applied to all of the state Nation Guards in the U.S.
Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass imposed a weeklong curfew in the city’s downtown after Trump’s deployment. She and other California leaders have maintained that local law enforcement agencies were more than capable of addressing the unrest that followed high-profile immigration sweeps earlier this month.
Trump’s order marked the first time since 1965 that a president deployed the National Guard against the wishes of a state’s governor. A group of former service secretaries and four star military commanders wrote an amicus brief supporting Newsom’s lawsuit challenging the deployment.
“The court rightly rejected Trump’s claim that he can do whatever he wants with the National Guard and not have to explain himself to a court,” Gov. Newsom said in a written statement after the Ninth Circuit released its ruling. “The president is not a king and is not above the law. We will press forward with our challenge to President Trump’s authoritarian use of U.S. military soldiers against citizens.”
What’s next
What happens next could take one of several turns. On Friday a lower court judge, Charles Breyer, will hold a hearing on whether to return the troops to Newsom through a preliminary injunction. Breyer last week issued an order that would have temporarily halted Trump’s deployment, but the Ninth Circuit blocked it.
Now, the battle over whether federal troops can remain in Los Angeles is operating on three parallel tracks — the case the Ninth Circuit decided, which can be appealed; Friday’s hearing on the preliminary injunction; and the full merits of the case that would be argued through a prolonged trial.
For Newsom’s legal team to prevail in Friday’s hearing, they’ll have to clear a higher threshold of scrutiny than they did when they initially won back the National Guard last week, albeit for a few hours. That’s because anyone seeking a preliminary injunction must demonstrate that the merits of their arguments will likely prevail in the full trial.
The appeals court’s decision could influence Breyer’s thinking, legal thinkers said, even if he initially signalled support for the Newsom administration’s arguments.
“It’s kind of hard to disentangle the two processes when we think about how Judge Breyer will be weighing” the preliminary injunction hearing, because a lot of that’s going to be informed by what these higher level courts decide,” said Christopher Mirasola, an assistant law professor at the University of Houston Law Center.
No matter what Breyer does after Friday, it’ll likely quickly go back to the appeals court. And if the appeals court keeps halting the lower court’s orders, Trump keeps the National Guard for the duration of the lower court’s full trial.
Would the Newsom team try to appeal the injunction with the Supreme Court?
On one hand, “why not shoot your shot when you got the opportunity, right?” asked Mirasola rhetorically. But there’s a chance the high court comes back with such a strong opinion favoring the Trump administration that it could “substantively affect how Judge Breyer treats the merits of the case.”

Dias Goncalves was arrested by federal immigration authorities shortly thereafter. (Screenshot from Mesa County Sheriff's Officer YouTube)A Mesa County sheriff’s deputy who shared information that led federal immigration officers to arrest a Utah college student in Grand Junction has been placed on leave pending an internal investigation.
The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office said earlier this week that federal authorities had “extrapolated” information about Caroline Dias Goncalves’ immigration status from information sent by Investigator Alexander Zwinck via the encrypted messaging app Signal to a group organized by federal law enforcement for drug interdiction efforts.
Zwinck pulled over Dias Goncalves on Interstate 70 near Fruita on June 5 for driving too close to a tractor-trailer, and although she was let go with a warning she was detained a short time later by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. Body camera footage released by the department shows Zwinck asking Dias Goncalvez, who was born in Brazil and brought to the U.S. by her parents as a 7-year-old, whether she was “born and raised” in Utah, after noting she had “a little bit of an accent.”

Colorado law generally prohibits cooperation and information-sharing between local law enforcement agencies and federal immigration authorities. ICE representatives have ignored questions about the incident from Newsline and other media outlets.
The sheriff’s office declined this week to answer follow-up questions about the content of the Signal message and its intended purpose, but it said in an updated statement Thursday that it was “reviewing communications” sent by its officers to the group chat as it investigates whether the message complied with state law and departmental policies.
“This includes, but is not limited to, working to understand if and when Mesa County Sheriff’s Office employees were made aware that the information shared for drug interdiction efforts was being utilized for immigration enforcement,” the statement said.
Whether Zwinck faces disciplinary action “will be determined by the outcome of the full administrative investigation,” it added.
The arrest of Dias Goncalves, a nursing student at the University of Utah with no criminal record, sparked an outcry from national groups that advocate on behalf of “Dreamers,” young adults who lack permanent legal status after being brought to the U.S. as children.
“Caroline — and Ximena Arias Cristóbal and numerous other Dreamers recently detained and even deported — should have never been targeted in the first place,” Gaby Pacheco, president of the advocacy group TheDream.US, said in a press release. “America’s national interests are better served by delivering education and legal status for Dreamers instead of raids, detentions, and deportations.”
Tensions over immigration enforcement have risen across the country in recent weeks as President Donald Trump’s administration, seeking to fulfill its promised mass-deportation campaign, has ordered ICE to dramatically broaden the scope of its operations. Contrary to claims by the Trump administration that its efforts are targeting violent criminals, the share of people held in ICE detention with no criminal record has risen sharply since January.
Dias Goncalves is expected to be released from the ICE detention facility in Aurora in the coming days after an immigration judge in Denver granted her bond on Wednesday. Her attorney, Jon Hyman, said that she and her family were requesting privacy after the “traumatic past few weeks.”
“We know that Caroline’s arrest and detention should not have happened in the first place,” Hyman said in a statement. “Investigations should continue to ensure that other young immigrants in Colorado do not have to go through the same harrowing experiences.”

MAYHEW, Miss. – A summer camp for girls in northeast Mississippi is designed to help produce the next generation of skilled construction workers.
FORGE’s Girls Construction Camp brought together 12- to 15-year-old girls last week for mentorship, interactive workshops and hands-on experience in the traditionally male-dominated field of construction. 
This is the program’s second year, and  24 campers participated, double last year’s number. The camp took place at East Mississippi Community College’s Golden Triangle campus.
FORGE is a nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing awareness of skilled trades among young people.
“We start out young, work with them as they grow, hoping to get more and more interested in construction and the skilled trades,” said Melinda Lowe, FORGE’s executive director.
Demand for workers in construction and other skilled trades is growing. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the U.S. will have an average of 663,500 job openings per year in construction and extraction until 2033. This field has a median annual wage of $58,360.
Christee Roberson is owner and founder of West Point-based Graham Roofing. She is also a founding member of FORGE and a trade partner for the camp. She and her team taught the girls about roofing. 
Roberson said it’s important to introduce construction and other trades to young people, especially girls.
“I think, being a female in the industry and never knew that this was something I could do, it’s important for sure to show other females that they can be in the trades, too,” she said. 
Aveline Webb, 12, of Starkville was a first-time camper. 
“We have been building our boxes,” Webb said. “We put up drywall. We’ve done roofing, electrical, plumbing, all the stuff that you would need to build a building.”
In addition to the lessons, the campers heard from guest speakers and worked in groups on a central project – building and decorating food pantry boxes. 
Jada Brown, 15 from Lowndes County, attended the camp last year and came back as student mentor.
“What I hope they take away is knowing how to build and wanting to want to do it in the future, and see themselves doing it,” she said. 
Lowe said the camp provides useful information even for those who don’t enter construction.
“We already have one young lady who has been helping her family replace some shingles that were damaged in a recent storm,” Lowe said. “We’ve had others who have fixed the stoppers in their sink, because they learned here how to fix that.”
The food pantry boxes will be placed in and around Lowndes County in the coming weeks.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/13141132/3X0A4626.jpg,,,2025-06-20 13:09:09.565948

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis announced during an unusually early Friday morning news conference that a second flight carrying Floridians evacuating Israel had landed at Tampa International Airport.
Florida began the rescues this week after Israel and Iran fell into conflict, exchanging missiles and killing hundreds.
Following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on Israel, Florida did the same in terms of the airlift.
“Given what’s happening over there, given that you have a barrage of missiles being launched by a very hostile regime into Israel, given that the airport’s totally shutdown, given that the neighboring areas aren’t exactly easy to navigate, this was probably the most challenging and logistically difficult mission that the Florida Department (sic) of Emergency Management has done — certainly in my time, and I don’t think there’s been anything like it,” DeSantis said during the 5:30 a.m. press conference at the airport.
According to DeSantis, Florida has helped “effectuate” more than 1,500 people’s exit from Israel.
Kevin Guthrie, executive director of the Division of Emergency Management, said the Friday morning flight from Cyprus had about 160 people on board, bringing the total to 300 flown out and more than 1,100 evacuated by ferry.
The operation is also facilitated by Grey Bull Rescues, a Tampa foundation focused on rescuing Americans from conflict zones, and the Florida Department of Transportation.
“Florida stands with its residents. In peace and in crisis, we will always rise to the challenge. This is not just a rescue mission, it is a reflection of Florida’s values of safety, courage, and resilience,” Guthrie said.
Guthrie said his staff has been working around the clock on rescues and that more people will be rescued.
Also overseas facilitating rescues is state Sen. Jay Collins, a retired Army Green Beret whom the governor described as “almost like an action figure.”
‘Florida-focused’
DeSantis said it is a “Florida-focused mission” but other Americans won’t be turned away. Many of the people rescued were students and people participating in the Israel birthright program, he said.
“I think people should be proud that you have a state that when they see a problem, when they see a challenging mission, that we don’t shy away from it and pass the buck, we step up and we lead and we get the job done,” DeSantis said.
Josh Hammer, an editor for Newsweek, joined DeSantis and Guthrie after returning from Israel.
Hammer said he was in Israel for a wedding, flying there a week and a half ago.
Hammer said he decided to leave Israel to protect his six-month-old daughter from missiles and reached out to Collins after the senator posted on social media that he was participating in rescues.
“The whole week has just been a total blur. I feel like I’m not even here physically. Thank God that the Jewish sabbath starts tonight, because we really desperately need that rest and that sleep,” Hammer said alongside the governor at the early morning news conference.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Hoot–owl restrictions are in effect on the upper Madison River above Hebgen Lake, according to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
Hoot–owl restrictions prohibit fishing from 2 p.m. to midnight each day. These restrictions started Thursday and will stay in effect until conditions improve.
For other restrictions, FWP directed people here.
FWP’s drought policy provides for angling restrictions when flows drop below critical levels for fish, when water quality is diminished or when maximum daily water temperatures reach at least 73 degrees for three consecutive days, FWP said. Water temperatures of 77 degrees or more can be lethal to trout.
These restrictions are designed to protect fish that become more susceptible to disease and mortality when conditions like this exist, FWP said. One short-term strategy to address heat-induced stress in Montana’s wild trout is to reduce catch-and-release mortality by alerting anglers to fish only in the morning.
Anglers can reduce stress on fish at all times of the year by getting fish to the net or in hand quickly, keeping them in the water and reviving them prior to releasing them back into the river.
If high temperatures and extremely low flows persist, anglers may want to consider fishing areas with less stressful temperatures and conditions, such as larger lakes or reservoirs, or higher elevation waterbodies.
Along with monitoring stream temperatures, FWP also monitors stream flows and in some streams holds instream flow water rights. FWP’s water program can issue a call on junior water users, when appropriate, to contribute to stream flows through the late summer and early fall.

My path to this point hasn’t been easy. 
I lost my mom in March 2020, during my sophomore year of high school, and my dad when I was just 8 years old. Living with that kind of loss while trying to move forward in life and school has been an ongoing challenge. 
There’s a common narrative that college is supposed to be the “best years of your life” (for academic and personal growth), but for students like myself and the many others who are grieving: It can feel like you’re expected to “wear a mask” and just “keep swimming.”


Family and peers often put intense pressure on us to succeed, pursue higher education, and be “okay.” But the path of grief doesn’t always allow that consistency. If I didn’t carry the constant desire to make my parents proud, I don’t know if I’d be where I am today. That motivation has been my anchor to succeed. 
In an essay published on October 7, 2024, writer Justin Grimes put it well: “Dealing with loss while juggling school or work isn’t easy, and there’s no manual for handling it perfectly… Grief doesn’t follow a timeline, and you shouldn’t expect yourself to either.” 
Justin captures the truth that many of us know all too well: grief doesn’t end after a semester or a school year. It lingers, often returning in waves when we least expect it. 
According to a student article from Purdue University, “40% of college students are grieving a death…Servaty-Seib’s research with grieving college students has indicated that students dealing with grief often struggle academically.” Students are silently navigating the emotional toll of grief. This statistic underscores that grief is not a rare or isolated experience; it’s a widespread issue affecting nearly half of the student population. 
You never truly know what someone else is going through. There is immense pressure on students to be able to fit in socially, excel in their academic responsibilities, and present as emotionally stable, regardless of the personal challenges they may be enduring. We need more unspoken compassion in our classrooms and communities. Empathy to all. 
Whatever path someone takes, whether it’s finishing school on time, taking a break, or finding a nontraditional route, should be accepted without judgment. Remember, grief is not a weakness, and it’s a normal part of the cycle of life. 
As always, with time, patience, and support, will come the final stage of grief: acceptance. It doesn’t mean forgetting or moving on. It means learning to live with the loss. It means learning that love can only grow stronger with distance. It means understanding that grief and love can coexist and that healing doesn’t erase the past, but honors it. It means learning to carry the memories without being crushed by them, to smile at what was, and to hope for what still can be. 
In the acceptance stage, one finds inner power, peace, and the freedom to move forward in light and love.

(Rendering courtesy of JBS Foods) The Iowa Economic Development Authority board announced Friday it had approved $12 million in tax benefits for a JBS Foods sausage production facility planned for Perry. 
The IEDA approved the benefits through its High Quality Jobs program, noting that nearly 60 jobs at the sausage making plant will have salaries above $30 per hour.
The plant will employ 250 people the first several years and eventually scale up to 500 jobs, according to the release.
Gov. Kim Reynolds commented on the tax benefit announcement and said the JBS facility was “tremendous news” for Perry and the whole of Iowa.

“This investment by JBS reflects confidence in Iowa’s workforce, our strong agricultural economy, and our commitment to growing vibrant communities,” Reynolds said. “At a time when Perry has faced real challenges, this investment brings renewed hope and opportunity for the hardworking families who call this community home.” 
A 1,300-employee Tyson facility shuttered in Perry last summer, leaving a large employment hole in the community. 
JBS Foods is building an entirely new facility on the southeast side of town, once the zoning is approved by the city. The facility will have 150,000 square feet of space and represent a $135 million investment. 
According to JBS, which announced plans for the facility in late May, the plant will process around 500,000 sows each year, which would equate to 130 million pounds of sausage.
The Brazilian company’s USA CEO Wesley Batista Filho said the company was “grateful” to the state of Iowa for its “continued support.” 
“This investment aligns with our ongoing commitment to Iowa, our producer partners, team members and the U.S. market as we look to build a best-in-class sausage production facility,” Batista Filho said in a statement. 
The plant is slated to be fully operational in late 2026, and while not officially approved by the city, Perry Mayor Dirk Cavanaugh has been publicly supportive of the project. 
“We look forward to being part of the Perry community — creating quality jobs and economic opportunity in the region,” Batista Filho said.

(Photo courtesy of the S.C. Department of Motor Vehicles)COLUMBIA — Starting this fall, the Department of Motor Vehicles will no longer issue day-of driver’s licenses in a shift to make state IDs more secure, the agency announced Friday.
Residents with current licenses don’t need to get theirs updated until the expiration date on it. The new licenses, beginner’s permits and identification cards will be made of stronger material and use laser engraving that makes them more difficult to counterfeit, according to a Friday news release.
“First and foremost, these updates will better protect South Carolinians from becoming victims of identity fraud,” agency director Kevin Shwedo said in a news release. “Additionally, they will provide a more secure and reliable credential for law enforcement, merchants, retailers, and other parties who count on the authenticity of the licenses and identification cards we issue.”
Leaders of SC courts, DMV warn what could happen if ‘ancient’ technology isn’t upgraded

The cards will also look different, using a to-be-announced new design that more prominently features Palmetto State imagery, according to the agency.
The changes involve centralizing the production of driver’s licenses, permits and ID cards.
Unlike the current system, in which a person visiting the DMV can leave with a license or ID before walking out the door, the state DMV will start mailing the cards out. In the meantime, people will receive a temporary certificate that serves the same purposes as the card for which they applied, according to the DMV.
Because receiving a new card could take up to two weeks to arrive in the mail, the DMV encourages people not to wait for the expiration date on their license to renew it. Their local branch will be able to return the older license or ID with a hole punched in it so people can continue using it until their new one arrives in the mail, according to a news release.
At least 45 other states already use this process, according to the DMV.
The agency does not have a timeline for when the change will take effect.
Two branches in Columbia and Lexington are expected to make the switch first to work out any kinks, followed by the remaining 63 offices across the state two weeks later, said agency spokesman Mike Fitts.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/REAL-ID-Sample-Image-1024x640.png,,,2025-06-20 13:09:09.565948

Reeves signs most spending bills into law,Taylor Vance,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/06/20/belated-budget-gov-reeves-signs-most-spending-bills-into-law/,"Governor approves most special session bills, enacting $7.1 billion Mississippi budget.","Gov. Tate Reeves on Thursday signed the vast majority of the state’s budget bills into law but vetoed a handful of the measures, which finalizes the state’s $7.1 billion budget for the next fiscal year, which starts July 1. 
The governor wrote on social media that the budget is fiscally conservative and “essentially halts the growth of government.”
“In short, the $7.135 billion budget will help us get the job done on your behalf, and it will help us break new ground all across our state,” Reeves said. 
The budget for the next fiscal year is typically completed in the spring, but the Legislature adjourned its 2025 session earlier this year without agreeing on a budget due to Republican political infighting. The governor called lawmakers into a special session in May to pass a budget. 
The measures the governor vetoed were portions of the Department of Finance and Administration’s budget, parts of the Mississippi Development Authority’s budget, a portion of the State Health Department’s budget and a bill that attempted to give the Attorney General’s Office $2.5 million to combat human trafficking. 
The only bill the governor completely vetoed was a House bill that sought to allocate $2.5 million in excess revenues for the Attorney General’s Office to help victims of human trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation  
The state constitution gives the governor the power to set the parameters for what legislators can consider during a special session, not legislators. Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and several senators argued that the legislation was outside of the governor’s special session parameters, but they passed it anyway. 
“All state action, including legislative power, must be exercised within the strict boundaries established by the Constitution,” Reeves wrote in his veto message. “Failure to recognize such limitations on power threatened to undermine the legitimacy of the rule of law — the very foundation of our Constitutional Republic.” 
The Mississippi Constitution also gives the governor the power to issue partial vetoes, or line-item vetoes, of appropriation bills, which the governor did for three other measures. 
One of those measures was a provision in the Mississippi State Department of Health’s budget that directed the state agency to send around $1.9 million to the Methodist Rehabilitation Center. 
After House members passed the bill, legislative staffers realized that the money could be a violation of federal law and regulations, placing Mississippi’s multi-billion-dollar Medicaid funding at risk. 
When the bill arrived in the Senate for consideration, senators were faced with the option of forcing the House back to the Capitol or sending a flawed bill to the governor for him to veto. They chose the latter. 
In the Department of Finance and Administration’s budget, the governor vetoed money for a project at the Mississippi Children’s Museum and LeFleur’s Bluff State Park. In the Mississippi Development Authority’s budget, Reeves vetoed $6.9 million for the Mississippi Main Street Revitalization Grant Program.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/29192608/State-of-the-State-2.jpg,,,2025-06-20 12:12:15.200829

In the wake of the assassination, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety (Steven Garcia/Getty Images)A year into her first term in office, New Jersey Assemblywoman Sadaf Jaffer decided not to run for reelection.
The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.
But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
 Language matters

Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
 Security measures

Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

You can read more about the section here.

In Tunica County, Mississippi, wind energy is working.
Delta Wind, the state’s first utility-scale wind farm, has brought over $350 million in investment to the area and electricity to power 80,000 homes each year.
Wind projects are often among the largest taxpayers in the communities where they’re built. Delta Wind is expected to deliver substantial benefits for Tunica County, with tens of millions in projected tax revenue over the life of the project, typically 20 to 30 years, per industry standards.
This creates long-term, stable funding to support local public schools, road repairs, emergency services and other critical public needs. Landowners who host turbines also receive annual lease payments, generating new income while continuing to farm their land. This is what it looks like when a community embraces opportunity.

Across several rural Mississippi counties, energy developers have signaled interest in making substantial investments in renewable energy. In some communities, local officials are actively considering updates to zoning ordinances that could determine whether — and how — those projects move forward.
Policies aligned with industry best practices could support continued farm operations while unlocking major economic opportunities for these areas.
Mississippi isn’t standing still at the state level. Gov. Tate Reeves recently signed SB 3166, a law that incentivizes investment in renewable energy. It may be a technical policy, but the signal is clear: the state is ready to welcome new investment, especially in agricultural communities.
Recently, the governor also launched Mississippi’s “Power Play” initiative—a broader effort to reduce regulatory barriers, encourage private investment and position the state as a leader in energy policy and innovation.
Now it’s time for Mississippi counties to turn that momentum into action, while wind investments are still on the table.
Investments in wind energy strengthen our communities in so many ways — powering statewide economic development, providing new local tax revenue, offering steady income to landowners and farmers, all while maintaining existing agricultural operations right up to the base of the turbines.
Not long ago, opportunities like these were only available to our neighbors to the west — states like Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas, where wind now powers a significant share of the electricity supply and early investments in wind helped fund schools, strengthen infrastructure and diversify rural economies.
In a recent episode of WBUR’s On Point podcast, Samuel Davis, a sixth-generation rancher in Texas, said:  “Not every county, not every community, is blessed with oil and gas. People say, ‘Why don’t they just drill for oil?’ Well, they don’t have it, so you have to be resourceful. Every county, every school district has to use what they have.”
Thanks to advances in turbine technology, these same kinds of opportunities are now available to Mississippians. But realizing them will depend on local governments stepping forward to catch the wind while they still can.
This is a chance to bring millions in new tax revenue, land payments and jobs to more counties across the state. Tunica County showed what’s possible. It embraced the opportunity and helped launch a project that’s delivering homegrown power and investing in the future of its schools, families and local services.
The wind is blowing. The only question is: Who will catch it?

Senate Majority Floor Leader Julie Daniels, R-Bartlesville, asked Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond for an official opinion, which could be legally binding.
House Bill 1217 prohibits individuals from performing sexually explicit or obscene acts in public places or areas where minors are present. It also bans political subdivisions from authorizing the performances on public property.
The measure became law last month.
“The Legislature has made it abundantly clear that sexually explicit performances have no place in public spaces, especially in front of children,” Daniels said. “Unfortunately, drag shows continue to spark controversy in Bartlesville and across the state, underscoring the need for further legal guidance.”
Daniels asked Drummond if drag performances were obscene or if certain actions were necessary.
She also asked if a performance by a person dressed in drag is protected speech under the First Amendment.

House of Representatives chamber with a football play in the foreground. (Illustration by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CREATIVE/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — South Carolina’s governing body for high school sports altered its bylaws this week to ensure it can keep functioning amid legislators’ efforts to ban “name, image and likeness” deals for pre-college student athletes.
The approved new wording in the South Carolina High School League’s bylaws says students “may not earn compensation” for their sport.
The bylaws previously said students “may earn compensation” as long as it’s not tied to their athletic performance and does not involve school or league logos, to include an incentive to enroll at a certain school.
It wasn’t meant to be a policy for or against NIL, and the slight shift in wording doesn’t change that, said league Commissioner Jerome Singleton.
Rather, the phrase is part of the rule that students must maintain amateur status, meaning they can’t be paid for playing a sport. The previous wording reflects the league’s inability to control anything beyond sports, he said.
It still can’t. But the league wanted to make clear it was not condoning NIL deals after the Legislature inserted a clause in the state budget banning public school districts from joining any athletic association that permitted, allowed or authorized such compensation.
State Sen. Sean Bennett, who authored the budget clause, said it was absolutely directed at the High School League, an independent, dues-paying organization that sets and oversees the competition rules for participating middle and high schools.
“I hope everybody involved with high school athletics realizes they are extracurricular activities, and they are no place for the ugliness or business activities ruining college athletics,” Bennett, R-Summerville, told the SC Daily Gazette.
The league’s executive committee unanimously approved the wording Tuesday, two weeks from the ban taking effect with the July 1 start of the fiscal year. The overwhelming majority of the league’s more than 400 members are public schools that potentially faced not being able to participate in league-organized athletics in the coming school year.
Singleton said the altered wording changes nothing in terms of the rule’s intent.
If a student uses school or league logos or clothing as part of an endorsement deal, or receives money for their participation, they are still violating the league’s amateur policy, he said.
Punishment on a first offense is a warning. The second time it’s a one-year suspension from High School League competition. Each additional violation would result in at least another one-year suspension, with the exact period of ineligibility “based on the nature of the violations.”
“From the very beginning … the league does not support NIL for athletic purposes. That’s the only authority we have the right to reject,” Singleton said. “You can change the wording, but you can’t change the intent.”
In total, more than 40 states allow NIL deals for high schoolers, according to Opendorse, an athlete marketing firm.
NIL is only one example of how changes in college sports, where it’s become routine for players to transfer to another school on a moment’s notice and receive large paydays, have seeped into high school athletics.
In March, the league changed its longstanding transfer policy to allow student-athletes one penalty-free transfer.
Senators approve lifting NIL restrictions on SC colleges after gun debate puts bill in timeout

When the NCAA first permitted personal branding and sponsorship deals in 2021, it provided few guidelines, leaving lawmakers around the country grappling with how to handle them.
South Carolina legislators initially responded by simply suspending state law prohibiting the deals. Then last year, the head coaches of Clemson and South Carolina’s football programs asked legislators for clarity with a bill allowing them to represent student athletes. After getting briefly held up by a gun debate, the bill became law in May 2024.
It was approved as a way to help students navigate contracts and not get swindled. But legislators still didn’t like the idea of NIL deals. Senators who complain the transfers and million-dollar payouts have ruined college sports include Bennett.
The avid Gamecocks fan vowed to keep it out of high school sports.
The league’s prior wording wasn’t strong enough: Giving NIL “a wink or a nod certainly invites it,” he said.
Recent examples of high-dollar influence in college include an $8 million offer for South Carolina quarterback LaNorris Sellers to leave the Gamecocks, according to an article published Monday by the Athletic. The offer depended on him playing for two more years for the unnamed school, his father told the publication. Sellers, however, declined. He’s staying in Columbia.
Scott Earley, president of the South Carolina Coaches Association, said he’s against high school athletes getting paid, though he says it is happening.
The league is doing all it can to control the influence of money in high school sports in South Carolina, he said.
Singleton said the league can’t legally do anything more.
During an interview with the SC Daily Gazette, he used the example of a musical prodigy who happened to be a high school softball player.
If somebody wants to offer that athlete a contract to play the violin, the High School League has no right to stop it, he said.
“If you aren’t using the intellectual property of the school, which is the name, the mascot or the logo, why can’t you be an accomplished violinist who is playing on a team?” Singleton asked rhetorically.
Bill Carter, the head of Student-Athlete Insights, an NIL consulting firm that has worked with many high schools, colleges and high school athletic associations, called the proviso “pretty extreme.”
“The other states don’t get into very aggressive language of what they are going to fund,” he said.
Carter said it could also lead to a legal challenge.
Should that happen, recent examples signal courts will side with the youth.
“It’s the playbook that’s been run from the NCAA on down,” Carter said. “What we’ve learned is that the courts are never going to accept there’s an impediment to a young person’s ability … to earn income by way of their name, image and likeness.”
In 2021, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that said the NCAA’s restrictions on providing non-monetary compensation for academics, like free laptops or paid post-grad internships, violated antitrust laws. That decision paved the way for NIL.
Earlier this month a judge approved a settlement that ended three separate antitrust lawsuits against the NCAA, allowing schools to spread $20.5 million, a figure that will grow annually, to its athletes.
And last year in North Carolina, a judge sided with a star quarterback when his mother sued the state Board of Education on his behalf, making it so high schoolers in the Tar Heel State could profit from NIL.
“The court says, ‘You are overreaching your authorization or jurisdiction that would allow their young person’s right to earn income,’” Carter said.
Rep. Jackie “Coach” Hayes, a member of the House budget-writing committee, led his teams to seven state championships during his nearly 30 years as the Dillon Wildcats’ football coach.
Prior to coaching, he played high school football, as well as baseball and running track. He’s among the contingent against NIL in high school sports.
“If you pay them in high school, they are going to worry about how many times they run the ball, how many catches they get or how many touchdown passes,” Hayes told the SC Daily Gazette. “We got enough ‘me’ in this world. We need to get everybody working together for a common cause.”
As for the league’s wording change, Bennett said Friday he hasn’t had a chance to review it yet.
However, “as long as the High School League is acknowledging we shouldn’t be participating in this mess,” he’s satisfied that it’s meeting the intention of the budget clause he proposed.
And the possibility of a lawsuit doesn’t surprise him: “Anything done from a regulatory standpoint invites a legal challenge.”

The bill didn't reach the floor of either chamber in 2025. (Provided by Rick Osbon)As the 2025 legislative session concludes, South Carolina lawmakers can point to meaningful progress on consumer choice and freedom issues, working to advance long-awaited income tax cuts and passing tort reform that will benefit residents statewide.
But amid these victories, the Legislature failed to act on a commonsense measure that would empower South Carolinians at the most local level: the South Carolina Financial Freedom Act.
At its core, this bill is about extending those same principles — choice, competition, and fiscal responsibility — to local governments’ management of taxpayer dollars.
Just as individuals should have more freedom in how they save, invest, and spend, so should the cities, counties, and school districts that serve them daily.
And that’s exactly what the Financial Freedom Act seeks to accomplish.
Though H.3221/S.60 was not passed this year, the Palmetto Public Deposits Coalition (PPDC) reflects on this session as one of significant momentum in our effort to give local governments greater flexibility and financial choice.
The Financial Freedom Act, championed by Rep. Nathan Ballentine and Sen. Sean Bennett, steadily gained ground, attracting new bill sponsors, receiving a Senate Banking and Insurance subcommittee hearing, and raising broad awareness about a policy change that would give public entities more tools to deliver better outcomes for taxpayers.
The bill would do one simple thing: allow public entities to deposit taxpayer dollars in credit unions.
These institutions already serve millions of South Carolinians with mortgages, car loans, and small business financing.
Enabling local governments to use them would create healthy financial competition, expand access to local banking options, and allow the free market to deliver better interest rates, stronger returns, and smarter stewardship of public funds.
That need for competition is especially urgent when you consider where public money is currently going.
As much as 78% of all deposits in South Carolina last year were put into banks headquartered in another state.
That means the vast majority of South Carolinians’ dollars — often taxpayer funds — are managed by institutions with no stake in our local economies. By contrast, credit unions are locally governed and mission-driven, with a proven track record of reinvesting in the communities they serve.
Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to speak directly to members of the Senate Banking and Insurance subcommittee about the practical impact of this change.
I shared my perspective not only as chairman of the coalition, but also as the former mayor of Aiken and former president of the Municipal Association of South Carolina.
My message was simple: too many communities are locked into limited banking choices, even as branches continue to close across the state.
In fact, bank closures remain a growing concern.
TD Bank recently announced the shuttering of branches in Columbia and Greer — part of a national trend that saw over 140 net bank branch closures in the first quarter of 2025 alone.
When public entities are barred from banking with credit unions, they’re often forced to do business with institutions outside their communities — ones that may not reinvest locally or offer the best value for taxpayer dollars.
As Greg Habib, mayor of Goose Creek, wrote earlier this year, “Financial convenience for local governments isn’t just a banking issue — it’s a community issue.”
Habib’s words reflect what many local government leaders experience: the inability to choose the best local financial partner often leaves public funds managed from afar, rather than reinvested back into our own communities where those dollars originated.
That’s why the Palmetto Public Deposits Coalition has spent the past year engaging stakeholders, legislators, and the public to make the case for this reform.
As we prepare for the 2026 legislative session, we’re expanding that effort, working closely with the Municipal Association of South Carolina and the South Carolina Association of Counties to educate their members about the real financial benefits this policy could unlock.
From taxpayer savings to improved access and responsiveness, the case for action grows stronger every day.
This is not about picking winners and losers. It’s about fairness, competition, and allowing local governments to choose the best financial partners for their communities.
South Carolina’s financial system should reflect those values because strong local institutions build strong local economies.
There’s still time. With continued public support and growing legislative interest, the Financial Freedom Act can be part of South Carolina’s path forward.

Six of the 175 license offices in Missouri are closed because no contractor is willing to operate them. (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)When the state announced the Caruthersville license office was going to close, residents needing to renew registrations or driver license were directed to the closest open offices in Kennett, New Madrid and Malden. 
Those communities are all at least an hour, round-trip, from Caruthersville. The inconvenience would be compounded if, after waiting in line, the transaction couldn’t be completed for lack of a required document.
The Missouri Department of Revenue was quick to note motorists renewing vehicle registrations — but not new vehicle registrations or drivers license transactions — could do so online. 
But the situation in Caruthersville is not unique, as a growing number of license offices around the state are shuttering — currently at least six of 175 — with dozens more operating under an expired contract.
A bill sponsored by state Sen. Sandy Crawford, a Republican from Buffalo, and awaiting action from Gov. Mike Kehoe, would increase the fees received by the license offices by 50%.
The transaction fee for a drivers license or motor vehicle would go from $6 to $9 for the shortest period and from $12 to $18 for the longest, six years for a drivers license and two years for a vehicle registration.
The fee on transactions is in addition to the state charge for titling and registering a vehicle and obtaining or renewing a drivers license.
 Sen. Sandy Crawford, a Republican from Buffalo, listens during Senate debate of an initiative petition bill on Feb. 12 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
The goal is to make the offices attractive to contractors and avoid closures, Crawford said during a House committee hearing in April.
“I live in a small town, and if my license bureau were to close, I would likely have to drive 45 minutes, take a half a day to drive and get my license,” Crawford said. “And so I would much rather pay $3 than take off half a day and drive 45 miles or 45 minutes to get this done.”
There is supposed to be at least one license office in every county.
“Many small agents in rural communities have stated they are closing or not rebidding upon contract expiration,” said Ryan Williams, the license office contractor in Gladstone in Clay County. “Hopefully this increase will help enough to keep them open and solvent.”
Williams is also the legislative chair of the Missouri Association of License Offices.
The smallest office currently closed is in Unionville, in Putnam County on the Iowa border. The nearest open office is in Milan, a 50-minute round-trip. The busiest is the South Springfield License Office, which processed more than 100,000 transactions in fiscal 2024. There are two other offices within five miles.
The other offices currently closed are in Cuba, Willow Springs, Sedalia and Palmyra.
 Financial challenges

License offices, also known as fee offices for the transaction fees they charge, at one time were awarded by governors as political patronage. Until 2005, there were a dozen state-operated offices in the largest cities.
A bidding and contract system was created in the following years. The fees have been raised twice previously this century, in 2003 and 2019. There are currently 16 license offices listed on the state purchasing website, including Caruthersville and Unionville, which is on for the second time this year.
“We’re the only direct interaction that most people have with the state of Missouri,” Williams said.
In fiscal 2024, license offices processed almost 9 million transactions and charged $58.4 million in fees.
The Unionville office generated $28,736 in fees on 4,519 transactions. The Caruthersville office took in $119,260 from 18,747 transactions. And the South Springfield office received fees of $702,290 to process 105,516 transactions.
The reputation of license offices is not good, as seen by comments of members of the House Commerce Committee during the April hearing.
“If I had $1 for every time my office got called for the unpleasantness of the Rolla, Missouri, office, I’d be a millionaire today,” said state Rep. Tara Peters, a Republican from Rolla in her third year in the legislature.

State Rep. Brian Seitz, a Branson Republican, said he was glad lawmakers get special service for their license plates, which have legislative identifiers. There are two two license offices in Branson.
“I’m so glad that as a representative, I get to do the things right here in the Capitol that I need to do so I can continue to serve the people instead of wait an hour and a half in line without a bathroom,” Seitz said.
During the hearing, Williams said the contract office system saves the state money.
“If the state took it over, it would be a considerable expense,” he said.
The facilities and staffing are dependent on the amount of fees an office generates, Williams said. The contractor must meet payroll, pay rent and cover office expenses from the fee revenue.
“When you have long wait times, that’s a direct result that we can’t afford to hire the staff that we need, or pay them or attract the staff that we need,” Williams said.
 Administrative issues

The issues forcing contractors to give up their offices aren’t all financial, said Terri Harris, owner of Elle Management in St. Louis. At one point, Harris operated nine license offices around the state and was the contractor at South Springfield when it closed.
The contract had been repeatedly extended, for short periods, leaving her with uncertainty about the future and making it difficult to hire staff, she said.
After 34 years in the business, including almost two decades managing license offices for others, health issues and working through bureaucratic and political issues with the department became too much, she said.
The fee increase in 2019 was welcome, Harris said, but came just before the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The first thing I did when we got that increase is I brought my employees’ wages up to where I could stay competitive,” Harris said. “After COVID, everything changed for all employers, and my offices were large. It required a lot of employees, and frankly, the increase that I could afford to make was eaten up when you wait 17 and a half years for an increase.”
When she surrendered the contract, Harris said, she was offering $20.50 an hour to employees.
“We couldn’t keep people at that pay rate,” she said.
The fee increases will not induce her to return to the business of operating license offices, Harris said.
The South Springfield office was on an extended contract, but the extensions were short. That uncertainty also made staffing difficult, she said. 
“We went through years of being extended, two months, three months, maybe four months at a time,” she said. “That was ridiculous.”
She was reluctant to seek new contracts because the requirements being added didn’t work in the office situations she dealt with, Harris said. Specific performance numbers for managers, who Harris wanted supervising rather than processing transactions, was one issue, she said.
“The relationship became adversarial,”
 Initial contracts are generally for five years and the bill before Kehoe allows an extension of five years at the discretion of the director of revenue.
The bill would also bar department employees from becoming contractors or part owners of a license office company for a year after leaving state employment.
The department should figure out how to give more support to the small, rural offices where fee income is low, Harris said.
The contract requirements for the Unionville office call for it to be open 24 hours a week. It processed about four transactions an hour during fiscal 2024. 
“These communities, when you close an office, they’re not going 10 minutes away to the next office,” Harris said. “They’re going counties away, right to the next office. It’s it’s tough on the community period. I also understand there is a very small profit margin in them, and that makes it difficult.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Columbia-license-office-20250616-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-06-20 11:06:45.127153

The goal is simple, yet radical: to show that faith—when rooted in shared values like compassion, justice, and responsibility—can bridge divides and rebuild communities.
But there’s a catch: it takes courage. Healing polarization doesn’t just require dialogue; it demands confronting hard truths, crossing boundaries, and taking bold action for the common good.
That’s exactly what unfolded recently at Duke Divinity School, where I traveled from my native Bolivia to join young faith leaders from more than a dozen countries. We gathered with the Muslim World League (MWL)—the world’s largest Islamic NGO—not to debate doctrine, but to explore how shared spiritual values can help address today’s most urgent challenges: climate change, inequality, violence, and the erosion of trust.
The stakes couldn’t be higher. While in North Carolina, I learned that residents are deeply divided on many fundamental issues, as evidenced by recent Meredith College surveys. The same is true across the United States, where divisions over core values are at historic highs, according to Gallup.
In my home country of Bolivia, political polarization has intensified following a disputed presidential election. Globally, the situation is even more alarming: the world is now facing 56 active conflicts—the highest number since World War II, according to the Global Peace Index.
While politicians point fingers and tech platforms struggle with misinformation, the MWL and those of us in the Faith for Our Planet (FFOP) Fellowship discussed and debated a different path. We spent a week forging genuine human connections, seeking moral clarity, and focusing on values that transcend religion and nationality —empathy, responsibility, and stewardship of our planet.
These ideas were underscored by the MWL Secretary-General Mohammad al-Issa during his visit to the Triangle. He reminded us that over 84% of the world’s population identifies with a religion. That shared moral foundation, he argued, could be the key to building collaboration in a fractured world.
We’ve already seen this potential realized. Earlier this year, the MWL convened a groundbreaking gathering in Islamabad, Pakistan. In partnership with the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, they brought together Islamic scholars from across the ideological spectrum to address one of the Muslim world’s most sensitive issues: girls’ education.
It wasn’t an easy conversation. Many participants, including conservative Afghan tribal leaders with ties to the Taliban, arrived with worldviews shaped by years of conflict. But the MWL believed that faith could guide even the hardest discussions.
Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai, who survived an attack by the Taliban at age 15 for advocating education, joined the dialogue. The result? The Islamabad Declaration—affirming the irrevocable right to education for all Muslim girls.
This wasn’t just a policy win—it was a moral breakthrough. Achieved not through pressure or compromise, but through a shared conviction that faith, at its best, upholds human dignity.
If such an agreement is possible in Islamabad, why not in North Carolina? Why not on issues like voting rights, gun safety, or climate justice? Why not in Bolivia? We face similarly urgent challenges that require genuine moral courage and collaborative leadership.
Too often, we act as if our problems are unsolvable. They’re not. What we lack isn’t solutions—it’s the will to act on our values. That’s why the work at Duke matters. It offers a model of interfaith cooperation rooted in action, not just conversation.
Across North Carolina, on my first-ever trip here, I learned about faith communities already working together on food security, refugee resettlement, and climate resilience. They prove that common ground is not a fantasy—it’s already here, waiting to be embraced.
It’s a vision that begins not with politics or profit, but with people—people willing to listen, to lead, and to risk discomfort for the greater good. People of Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist and other faith traditions united by a shared moral vision and the bravery to act.
Could what began as a conversation among faiths in Durham become something far louder, broader, and more powerful? Let us pray that it does.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Youth-interfaith-leaders-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-20 11:06:45.127153

As of December 2024, there were 60,489 EVs — defined as all-electric, plug-in hybrid, range-extended EV or fuel cell vehicles — registered in Connecticut, according to EV Connecticut, a 2,481% increase since 2014. 
Fairfield County is home to the top two towns for EV ownership — Weston and Westport — with 10.1% and 10.4% percent of registered vehicles classified as EVs.
Teslas account for 35.4% of all EVs registered in Connecticut as of Dec. 31, 2024, according to EV Connecticut. Other manufacturers don’t even come close; Toyota takes second but accounts for only 9.5% of all registered EVs statewide. 

As the state continues to encourage residents in the market for a car to buy electric, President Donald Trump’s proposed spending bill could cut federal EV tax credits completely. The bill proposes annual federal registration fees on electric and hybrid vehicles to go towards highway and road maintenance. 
The state offers credit on qualifying EVs under the Connecticut Hydrogen and Electric Automobile Purchase Rebate, falling somewhere between $750 to $1,500, depending on the type of vehicle. This program is part of the state’s commitment to clean air goals, and for “creating cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable communities,” according to the EV Connecticut dashboard.
And to make EV purchases more equitable, the state offers an additional credit program called Rebate+. Qualification for the program is determined by either income level, participation in federal assistance programs or location of residence. 
So with Rebate+ and CHEAPR, those in the market for an EV who qualify can receive up to $4,500 from the state.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas Bureau of Investigation initiative is expected to change the state’s sexual assault evidence kit process so that survivors are no longer left in the dark.
As early as 2026, sexual assault survivors, health care facilities, law enforcement agencies, forensic science laboratories and attorneys’ offices in Kansas will be able to track the status of a sexual assault evidence kit, also known as a rape kit, through an online system. Kansas is among the last states in the country to adopt such a system.
KBI director Tony Mattivi told a group of legislators about the new approach at a June 10 hearing on interagency cooperation before the Senate Committee on Government Efficiency. The tracking system will offer real-time information on the status and location of an evidence kit.
“That, I think, will help ensure transparency and accountability in a way that has never been seen in our lab before,” Mattivi said, “and we’re very proud to be working to provide that to the citizens and crime victims in Kansas.”
Kansas is a late adopter of kit tracking systems. The majority of states across the country, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., adopted some sort of system by 2024, but Kansas is one of around a dozen states that haven’t, according to data from End the Backlog, a project by the national nonprofit Joyful Heart Foundation.
Tracking systems are one of a handful of transparency initiatives that End the Backlog recommends agencies adopt. Those recommended initiatives arose after a major push in the 2010s to eliminate massive backlogs of untested rape kits sitting under the purview of law enforcement agencies. The KBI claimed in 2021 to have zero untested kits, compared to 2,220 untested in 2017. KBI did not provide updated untested kit numbers for this story.
Once the program is available in early 2026, Kansans can access information on the kits through a web portal, and the tracking process begins from the moment a nurse receives an evidence kit.
Hospitals will be stocked with kits with barcodes that a nurse can scan into the system. Once in the system, law enforcement is automatically notified that the kit is ready to be picked up, said Melissa Underwood, a KBI spokeswoman.
“From there, the system tracks the status of the kit as it moves from the law enforcement agency to a forensic science laboratory for testing, and then back to the law enforcement agency,” Underwood said.
Attorneys’ offices will receive notice when forensic lab reports are available to be used as evidence.
“Finally, the system will provide the survivor with anonymous login access so they are able to track the status of their kit as it moves through the process,” Underwood said.
The KBI contracted with a third-party vendor, Porter Lee Corp., to provide the system for $240,000 through the first quarter of 2026.
Sen. Michael Murphy, a Sylvia Republican and one of four senators who attended the efficiency committee meeting, said that initially, he hadn’t thought of a tracking system as a solution, but he has heard frustration from constituents who know nothing about evidence kits they submitted in the wake of a sexual assault. He expressed approval for the change.
“I think that’s real important,” he said.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)The U.S. Conference of Mayors is holding its annual meeting in Tampa this weekend, and one of the resolutions they are poised to vote on calls upon federal authorities to focus their deportation actions on convicted criminals, and not on undocumented individuals who “contribute to their local communities.”
That’s according to Andy Ginther, mayor of Columbus, Ohio, and the conference’s sitting president.
Ginther spoke on Thursday at a press conference held at the Tampa Marriott Water Street on the first day of the four-day event. There are 179 mayors from across the country who have gathered for the annual summer meeting, where they will participate in panel discussions on issues such as handling natural disasters, homelessness, and public safety, to name a few.
Resolution
The resolution regarding immigration has three main planks:

Delineates the appropriate roles of local and federal officials in protest response.
Calls on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to focus its deportation actions on convicted, serious criminals, and not on undocumented “hard-working individuals who have families and pay taxes and contribute to their local communities.”
Urges federal officials to notify local authorities in advance of any planned ICE actions, and to conduct those actions in “as orderly and unprovocative way possible.”

Fresno, California, Mayor Jerry Dyer served 40 years in the Fresno Police Department, the last 18 as chief. He said at the press conference that one of the things he’s learned is that for police officers to be effective they must be seen as a welcome presence and not “as an occupying force.”
“Unfortunately, what we are seeing today in many cities across America, including L.A., is an occupying force, and that is federal agents and now our U.S. military,” he said. “And, unfortunately, the Los Angeles Police Department is having to be brought into that situation.”
“I do think that our friends over at HIS (Homeland Security Investigations) and ICE need to modify how they approach immigration enforcement in our cities, and the truth is the tactics need to be changed,” he added. “The uniforms need to be modified, and I really believe there needs to be better coordination with local law enforcement.”
  Jane Castor via City of Tampa.
Tampa Mayor Jane Castor, host of this weekend’s conference, served on the Tampa Police Department for 31 years, the last six as chief. She echoed Dyer’s remarks, arguing that collaboration between local neighborhoods and the police department is built on a “foundation of trust.”
When that trust is eroded, crime rises, she said. Why? Because when some in immigrant populations become victims of crime, they aren’t comfortable in reporting that because they no longer trust law enforcement.
“That is the fundamental reason that local law enforcement should not be engaged in immigration enforcement,” she declared.
Backlash in San Diego
San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria said he is still unhappy about an ICE raid that place in his city’s South Park neighborhood late last month on a Friday evening, when dozens of ICE agents raided a popular Italian restaurant to round up and ultimately arrest four people, according to the website CalMatters.
“It was explained to me that they were looking for a handful of dishwashers, busboys, and waiters and waitresses,” he said. “None of them are known to have any serious criminal offenses.”
Agents used flash-bang grenades and intimidated patrons with their aggressive presence, Gloria said. And he criticized the lack of coordination between federal agents and local law enforcement.
“My officers were called to respond to that situation,” he said. “The radio calls were for hundreds of people in the streets that were protesting and blocking traffic. … That lack of coordination … puts everybody at risk, including the federal agents who were doing their job that day.”
ICE officials reportedly had a warrant for 19 individuals who were employed at the restaurant and were alleged to be using falsified green cards.
Gloria noted the No Kings protest Saturday in San Diego, where media reports initially indicated as many as 60,000 came out to protest the Trump administration. “I’m pleased to tell you that there wasn’t one arrest,” he said. (Local organizers now say that there were 69,000 people at the demonstration).
“Was that raid in the restaurant focused on making our country safer, or was it focused on sowing fear in that community? Those are the things that we as Americans need to pay attention to,” added Castor.
Before he spoke about the proposed ICE resolution, Mayor Ginther discussed the decision by President Trump to send the California National Guard and U.S. Marines into Los Angeles, and said the conference stands behind L.A. Mayor Karen Bass (who was scheduled to appear at the gathering on Friday).
“The federal government’s decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles without the consent, and indeed over the objection of the governor, is an unprecedented overstep,” he said. “We must acknowledge the seriousness of the protests sparked by these federal actions. People have the fundamental right to peacefully assemble and voice their concerns. That is the cornerstone of American liberty.”
The resolution on ICE actions is scheduled to be discussed on Friday during the Criminal and Social Justice Committee, with the entire body of mayors to vote on the resolution on Sunday, according to a spokesperson for the Conference of Mayors.

Patricia Ann Reilly Farnham, of Burlington, died peacefully on June 11, 2025 surrounded by loved ones.
Pat was born in Teaneck, New Jersey on February 25, 1936 to Edward D. and Irene (Hickey) Reilly. She grew up in Allston, Massachusetts attending Saint Anthony of Padua Elementary and Saint Columbkille High School in Brighton. She later took classes at Boston University.
Pat worked several jobs in her career as an administrative assistant and receptionist. She was working at WBZ Boston when she met John “Jack” Farnham who had recently returned from Korea, had attended Tufts University School of Dental Medicine, and was a Resident at Massachusetts General Hospital. They married on August 10th, 1957. Eventually they moved to Jack’s home state of Vermont where he began his lengthy practice as an Oral Surgeon.
Pat and Jack raised four sons in a very rural setting at the time, on the east end of the “Sandbar” in Milton. Pat was the consummate devoted mother and wife, and was patient and supportive as Jack and the boys pursued their hunting, fishing, sports and other passions and pastimes. She was also Jack’s partner as they invested in local real estate over the years. Pat was a voracious reader and loved Broadway musicals. She was a wonderful cook and baker, and welcomed myriad guests over the years. Pat cultivated many friendships with people both near and far and was always known for her sense of humor, positive outlook on life, and considerable generosity.
Pat was predeceased by her parents, Jack, Jack’s parents Charles and Mary, and her sisters Marilyn Guilmet and Kathleen Reardon.
Pat is survived by her sister Elizabeth Dugan (Owen) and brother David Reilly (Bonnie), by her four sons, Jonathan of Burlington, Joseph (Manon) of South Hero, Daniel (Jill), of Swanton, and Matthew (Apryl) of Grand Isle. Pat was a devoted and loving “Nanny” to grandsons Christopher, William J, and William A., granddaughters Lillian, Olivia (Michael), Madeline, Sarah and Lucy; and great-granddaughters Bobbi and Ricki.

Some municipalities who claim the law asks too much of them are still looking to the courts and the Legislature for relief. 
The post MBTA Communities fight lingers in courts, on Beacon Hill appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","WITH SEVERAL TOWNS opting this week to finally get into compliance with the MBTA Communities housing law, some municipalities who claim the law asks too much of them are still looking to the courts and the Legislature for relief. 
Milton and Duxbury voters at special town meetings approved zoning that would meet the requirements of the housing law that requires cities and towns served by the MBTA system to rezone to make it easier to build multi-family housing. Ipswich special Town Meeting voters rejected a citizen’s petition to overturn the town’s compliant zoning plan.  
Before 69 percent of Milton voters decided to adopt new zoning, state Rep. Richard Wells, of Milton, told Town Meeting that it’s time now for elected officials and the courts to consider the matter. 
There are no less than 40 bills on Beacon Hill right now addressing MBTA Communities from a multitude of perspectives, Wells said. It’s likely, he said, that “either judicially or legislatively, there will be changes to MBTA Communities going forward.” 
Superior Court Justice Mark Gildea, who is overseeing many of the suits challenging MBTA Communities regulations, dispensed with a core argument and a bundle of nine complaints in early June. Despite a determination from the state auditor’s office that the housing law was an “unfunded mandate” – imposing direct costs on cities and towns without including a proper funding mechanism – Gildea found that the supposed costs were too speculative and noted that there are fundings sources available from the state to help reduce the burden of increasing housing supply. 
Gildea is currently considering a lawsuit brought by 16 Milton taxpayers challenging the town’s classification as a “rapid transit community.” The group of residents argue that the Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities incorrectly tethered the town’s transit status, and therefore its rezoning requirements, to the quaint single-car Mattapan High-Speed Trolley rather than the more distant commuter rail and MBTA subway stations. 
Several members of Milton’s Town Meeting referenced a June 11 hearing on the case, with proponents and opponents of the higher density plan suggesting that the judge was sympathetic to their side of the issue.  
Brian Kelley, one of the taxpayers who filed suit to challenge classification, played a clip from last week’s hearing in which Gildea asked the state’s lawyer “how’re you going to fit much more in that particular area. What’s the available land?” He added that Milton is not like Middleboro, one of the towns in the suit he dismissed, where there is a “ton of land around the station.” Gildea also asked the state’s attorney whether anyone who wrote the law had visited Milton. 
This exchange illustrated, Kelley said, why Milton is different from other rapid transit communities, or even other communities that unsuccessfully protested their obligations before Gildea earlier this spring. The land around the Mattapan Trolley stops, Kelley said, are mostly already residential, while in Middleboro new housing would not be “disrupting an existing neighborhood.” 
Town meeting member Douglas Hyne offered a different perspective. The case before the judge turns on whether it is entirely unreasonable for Milton to be classified as a rapid transit community. It feels unfair to classify the town this way, Hyne acknowledged, but the lawsuit isn’t about what’s fair. 
Gildea was being respectful of the taxpayers’ the arguments and prodding the state’s attorney, according to Hyne, but he also asked the taxpayer’s attorney, given his ruling the week before, to “tell me why you think I’m wrong, if you want, but I don’t think it’s going have a lot of effect.” 
Since the hearing, the housing office has moved to dismiss Milton’s case. 
Other cases are working their way through the courts, including an appeal from a group of Rockport residents arguing the housing law was an unfunded mandate and unconstitutional, which was rejected by an Essex County Superior Court judge in Lawrence. The residents did not have standing to sue, the judge said in dismissing the case without ruling on the underlying question. 
Gildea is also considering complaints from the towns of Carver and Wilmington. In seeking an injunction, which the housing office opposes, Wilmington argues that the state created an “impossible” and “completely arbitrary” deadline of July 14 to submit a compliant plan. Rather than tailoring the regulations to each town’s characteristics, the suit argues, the housing office is applying a “one-size-fits all” approach that ignores the work done to encourage multi-family housing in the town. 
With less than a month left until July 14, the state lists only Middleton, Marshfield, and Halifax as entirely non-compliant. Most towns that oppose the housing law have still submitted possible action plans to the state showing how they may comply in time, with an array still holding out hope for judicial or legislative intervention.

[…],"Interim LSU President Matt Lee (Piper Hutchinson / Louisiana Illuminator)This is an interview with interim LSU President Matt Lee that took place earlier this month about how the legislative session and federal changes will impact higher education in Louisiana. It has been edited for length and clarity.
You can also listen to a version of this interview on our new podcast The Light Switch.


Piper Hutchinson: The legislature has just wrapped up, and LSU got some big wins. How are you feeling about your budget situation?
Matt Lee: I’m very excited. We’re very appreciative of our colleagues in the legislature, most of them are very strong advocates for LSU, and they understand the work that we do, the value that we bring to the state, our role in workforce development and helping drive economic growth for the state. 
Overall, we came out quite well with the understanding that there was not going to be a lot of extra recurring money. And so while they kept us very stable in recurring money, we also had some significant wins in terms of one time funding. 
Hutchinson: You’ve got some one time funding for research at the Ag Center and at Pennington. Is that right?
Lee:  That’s right. So as you know, the Ag Center is one of the top ranked ag organizations in the country … and so we’re winning like crazy over there. Big work in plant sciences and precision agriculture and that kind of thing. 
Pennington, being a world class Biomedical Research Center as well, does great work related to nutrition, metabolic syndrome, obesity, these kinds of things. And given that we have ongoing health challenges in the state of Louisiana, that’s always a good investment.
Hutchinson:  I was speaking with Senate President Cameron Henry and he said the idea with that funding was to kind of help fill in the gaps for the lost federal research funding. Is it going to be enough to fill in all of the gaps?
Lee: Time will tell. That’s going to be an ongoing problem for the foreseeable future. As you know, at the federal level, they’re working on reorganizing their funding mechanisms, not only at NIH, which is where Pennington predominantly draws their funding from, but at other federal agencies, NSF, USDA, they’re all evaluating their funding programs, and we anticipate that there will continue to be some reorganization and some headwinds at the federal level. 
But the bottom line is, we are an organization that I think last year, posted over a half a billion dollars in research activity. We’re going to continue to lean in, because the innovation that we drive from those research efforts enhance the quality of life in Louisiana and beyond.
Hutchinson: And y’all got some money for some capital outlay projects as well. I think the big one was that $36 million for the library. When are we going to see some groundbreaking on that?
Lee: Hopefully very soon. I’m actually very excited about that. Everybody calls it a library, but I like to think about it as a future state learning commons that will be something more like an Information Commons, or a Digital Commons for students to go to spend their time and learn and collaborate and so forth. 
I don’t know when the exact groundbreaking is, but I have seen plans and rendering for the footprint and where it will be. We’re actively talking about how we’re going to clean up that space and basically start doing site prep. So I don’t know the actual initiation of the project, but I’m very excited about it feels like we are now closer than we’ve ever been before to making progress on that. 
Hutchinson: Outside of the budget. I think the big debate this session was transferring the University of New Orleans from the University of Louisiana system to the LSU system. The legislature has given their approval for that. You know what happens now? What’s y’alls plan for UNO? 
Lee: The first step is I already had a preliminary conversation with the President of UNO, Kathy Johnson. I had a delightful conversation with her, and got to know her a little bit and get a little bit better understanding of that institution. Of course, we have a long history with UNO because its genesis was under the umbrella of LSU. It’s now been under another system for a while. 
The next steps, I think, will involve putting together a transition committee in which we will basically, I think, detail a set of verticals or workspaces where we have to figure out how things are going to start aligning under the LSU system. They’re actually in the process right now of reaffirmation of accreditation through the [Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges.] So I think that will finish up in December, and then, best case scenario, we would submit a substantive change request, which would move it from one system to another for the next June of 2025, for that SACSCOC board meeting. 
During that working period, we’re going to be looking at the health of their academic programming, get a better sense of the state of their physical infrastructure and facilities and get a better sense of what their financial status is overall. 
And I think work with them to delineate a plan that will give us, I think, what we all really want, which is New Orleans is a great global city, and it deserves a great public institution that not only helps develop talent and serve as a workforce pipeline, but that also is appropriately conducting research to help solve problems within the city, or to help give industry within the city the types of innovative tools they need to accelerate their work and engage in economic growth.
There’s not a crystal clear playbook on how this plays out, but the bottom line is, I think we all desire an end state where the city itself has a valuable institution that everybody can look up to and can engage with and feel like is a tremendous asset for the city.
Hutchinson: I have been getting a lot of questions about whether we are going to see UNO in purple and gold. Do you have any thoughts about the branding of the university?
Lee: My main thought is that that’s going to be a task for the transition committee to work through. There’s lots of questions about, you know, should it retain its name, or should it become LSU New Orleans? Should it retain its color branding and so forth? 
I’m not going to speak to any of that directly at the moment, but those questions are, since we’ve run in some of the same circles, those questions are circulating among that crowd. What I can tell you is that LSU has one of the best brands in American higher education and in fact, globally, and it’s not just due to our athletics programs, it’s also due to our outstanding academic programming and the increasing brand recognition we’re getting for our research programming as well. 
So we’re very proud of the LSU brand. It’s quite flattering that we have colleagues in state government who would look to us to help them take an institution and help get it to a place where they feel like it’s fulfilling its mission a little bit more clearly and a little bit more strongly.
Hutchinson: I think one of the big victories for faculty statewide, not just at LSU, was the passage of a bill that reforms the Optional Retirement Plan of the Teachers Retirement System of Louisiana. These reforms have been wanted for decades, and the legislature has stalled them. Now we’re finally getting some traction on that. Do you have any thoughts on how that’s going to help recruit and retain faculty? 
Lee: We need as many tools as we can get to retain faculty. For sure, we actually do very well on the recruitment front, especially when we’re bringing in faculty at the front end of the pipeline as assistant professors. We do a really good job there. 
But too frequently what happens is, they come here, we give them a set of tools, they become very successful, and then they start getting picked off by our competitors. The reality is, when you are an elite and high performing research institution, there’s a lot of mobility of faculty among these institutions, because it’s so competitive. And so this legislation will give us another tool to be successful in terms of retaining them. 
Hutchinson: Another victory that I think is going to hit across higher ed in the state is legislation that’s going to give some money to athletic departments, LSU and other Division I athletic programs, and they’re also going to start studying name, image and likeness issues. What are your thoughts on the future of athletics and how this legislation is going to assist the university? 
Lee: So higher education is fascinating in that it’s always in a period of change, yet it is generally slow to move in change. Athletics is an area where this is not the case. This has been a rapidly evolving landscape. Luckily, we have some, I think, of the best athletic administrators in the country working here. We have excellent leadership over that program.
So they’ve been reading the landscape for the last couple of years and anticipating how it was going to end up shaping up in terms of the evolution of NIL, so I think we’re in good shape under their leadership. College athletics will look different going forward, but I think we have a good handle on it. 
I just met a week or two ago with the SEC presidents, and we spent a lot of time talking about what this will look like for all of us, but I think at the end of the day, the House settlement was just approved, and we have a very clear set of guidelines about what will happen next. 
Everybody in the state wants LSU to have a successful athletics program. It provides for us tremendous national and international visibility. And I’m just very thankful both for the work that the legislature has done to support us in this effort and for our outstanding athletics administrators, because they’re really good. They’ve been at the forefront of this. 
Hutchinson: Well, they made it to Omaha. 
Lee: Yes, they are. We’re looking forward to it where we’re going to win. That’s my prediction. 
Hutchinson: I think everybody hopes so. 
Lee: You have to believe, Piper. You can’t just hope. You have to believe.

The firm — to be called BDGR P.A., will offer services across a wide range of practice areas, including civil rights, criminal defense, family law, estate planning, and government affairs.
Each of the lawmakers is an attorney who has been working for years in the legal field. Rayner gained notice in 2018 when she represented the family of Markeis McGlockton, an unarmed Black man who was gunned down in Clearwater in a dispute over a handicapped-accessible parking spot by a man who invoked Florida’s controversial “stand your ground.” 
She was elected to the Florida House in 2020, and has already declared her candidacy for the Florida Senate District 19 seat next year.
Gantt is a former public-school teacher who taught in Miami-Dade County and later became a Broward County public defender before opening her own law firm. She was elected to the Florida House in 2022.
Bracy-Davis is from west Orange County. She served as an attorney with the Florida Department of Children and Families and was first elected to the Florida House in 2022. She is now a candidate in the Florida Senate District 15 seat that has been vacant since the late Geraldine Thompson died earlier this year. That primary election will take place next Tuesday.
In a joint statement, the three legislators say that “nothing happens by chance.”
“Our journeys have combined for us to be more powerful together than separately. We look forward to representing the people of Florida, not only in the legislature but also in the courtroom — from the Panhandle to the Keys.”

(Photo by Steven Garcia/Getty Images)A year into her first term in office, New Jersey Assemblywoman Sadaf Jaffer decided not to run for reelection.
The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Many State Capitols Have Security Holes

Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.










People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated. It's an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.


– Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky


But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
Growing threats
In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
NM lawmakers review security practices after Minnesota assassination

Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
Language matters
Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
North Dakota man charged with threatening official after email citing Minnesota shootings

Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
Security measures
Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A Kansas Bureau of Investigation initiative is expected to change the state’s sexual assault evidence kit process so that survivors are no longer left in the dark.
As early as 2026, sexual assault survivors, health care facilities, law enforcement agencies, forensic science laboratories and attorneys’ offices in Kansas will be able to track the status of a sexual assault evidence kit, also known as a rape kit, through an online system. Kansas is among the last states in the country to adopt such a system.
KBI director Tony Mattivi told a group of legislators about the new approach at a June 10 hearing on interagency cooperation before the Senate Committee on Government Efficiency. The tracking system will offer real-time information on the status and location of an evidence kit.
“That, I think, will help ensure transparency and accountability in a way that has never been seen in our lab before,” Mattivi said, “and we’re very proud to be working to provide that to the citizens and crime victims in Kansas.”
Kansas is a late adopter of kit tracking systems. The majority of states across the country, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., adopted some sort of system by 2024, but Kansas is one of around a dozen states that haven’t, according to data from End the Backlog, a project by the national nonprofit Joyful Heart Foundation.
Tracking systems are one of a handful of transparency initiatives that End the Backlog recommends agencies adopt. Those recommended initiatives arose after a major push in the 2010s to eliminate massive backlogs of untested rape kits sitting under the purview of law enforcement agencies. The KBI claimed in 2021 to have zero untested kits, compared to 2,220 untested in 2017. KBI did not provide updated untested kit numbers for this story.
Once the program is available in early 2026, Kansans can access information on the kits through a web portal, and the tracking process begins from the moment a nurse receives an evidence kit.
Hospitals will be stocked with kits with barcodes that a nurse can scan into the system. Once in the system, law enforcement is automatically notified that the kit is ready to be picked up, said Melissa Underwood, a KBI spokeswoman.
“From there, the system tracks the status of the kit as it moves from the law enforcement agency to a forensic science laboratory for testing, and then back to the law enforcement agency,” Underwood said.
Attorneys’ offices will receive notice when forensic lab reports are available to be used as evidence.
“Finally, the system will provide the survivor with anonymous login access so they are able to track the status of their kit as it moves through the process,” Underwood said.
The KBI contracted with a third-party vendor, Porter Lee Corp., to provide the system for $240,000 through the first quarter of 2026.
Sen. Michael Murphy, a Sylvia Republican and one of four senators who attended the efficiency committee meeting, said that initially, he hadn’t thought of a tracking system as a solution, but he has heard frustration from constituents who know nothing about evidence kits they submitted in the wake of a sexual assault. He expressed approval for the change.
“I think that’s real important,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5020028-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-20 10:06:43.702314

The divisions we face are real. But by embracing civility, demonstrating respect, and extending grace, we can begin to heal the rifts.  
The post Why we shouldn’t give up on civility appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","OUR TODAY OFTEN seems more polarized than at any moment since the 1960s. Gone are the days of robust debate and discourse, replaced by shouting matches, social media pig piles, and a pervasive sense of resentment and anger that threaten the very fabric of our democratic society.
Even the human urge to reach out and calm tempers in hopes of restoring order are today under attack. 
Just since the beginning of the year, we’ve seen progressive anger over John Fetterman’s meeting with Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago. There was the outrage over the hug Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan received from Trump during a visit to her state – and her subsequent humiliation covering her face with a folder before an in-person meeting at the White House. We’ve also seen controversy surrounding California governor Gavin Newsom’s invitation of right-wing figures like Steve Bannon onto his podcast.
The responses to these figurative olive branches were brutal, with Fetterman’s actions derided as “crazy,” Whitmer’s as “weak” and Newsom’s as “arrogant.”  They remind us that perhaps the only thing more dangerous than the growing chasm between political factions might be trying to bridge it.
But in America, we should never give up on civility.
For one, the consequences are too profound. According to a 2024 Gallup Poll, 80 percent of Americans believe that the nation is more divided than ever, and a significant portion reports feeling anxious or hopeless about the future of democracy. 
When political figures and media personalities model disrespect and hostility, it emboldens the broader culture and threatens to erode the foundational skills of listening and respectful debate.
At the same time, silencing or ostracizing those with opposing opinions threatens our ability to have meaningful discourse. Often derided as “cancel culture” by those on the right, Harvard researcher Pippa Norris writes that “scholars may be less willing to speak up to defend their moral beliefs if they believe that their views are not widely shared by colleagues or the wider society.” This creates a chilling effect, where people opt for silence over honest conversation.
Recently, I attended the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation’s annual dinner, where former Vice President Mike Pence received the Profile in Courage Award. Pence was recognized for his actions on January 6, 2021, when he put his own life on the line to certify the 2020 presidential election as rioters outside the Capitol made a noose and chanted, “Hang Mike Pence!”
Some openly questioned whether he was deserving of praise for simply “doing his job.” I saw it differently. It would have been easy for Pence to capitulate to his boss’s desire or follow the crowd, but at that definitive moment he risked everything to uphold the Constitution.
So, at the event at the JFK Library, I walked up to the former vice president and told him, “My politics could not be more different than yours. But what you did on January 6th was courageous and an act of true grace.” 
Pence thanked me politely before moving on. What I didn’t expect was that later in the evening when he saw me, he thanked me again. I’m not sure if he had been surprised a Black woman with an accent in Boston had reached out to him, but it was clear my gratitude had stuck with him. Likewise, his appreciation stuck with me.
I’m under no illusions about what our exchange meant in the grand scheme of things. And yet, when we step out of our comfort zones to recognize and acknowledge that behind every opinion is a person with experiences and feelings we can begin to form a mutual respect. At these moments, bridging the divide in America seems, well, less unbridgeable.
There are steps we can take as individuals and as organizations to further this respect – whether it’s prioritizing listening over speaking, modeling civil discourse to exemplify respectful behavior, steering discussions in the media and in common society towards facts over opinion – and by developing civics education curricula in our schools that teach critical thinking, media literacy, and effective communication.
Ultimately, it comes down to us. As we navigate these turbulent times, we should remember the words of President Abraham Lincoln’s second inaugural address: “With malice toward none, with charity for all.” 
The divisions we face are real. But by embracing civility, demonstrating respect, and extending grace, we can begin to heal the rifts.

Tim Walz said during a press conference that the shooting ""appears to be a politically motivated assassination."" (Photo by Steven Garcia/Getty Images)A year into her first term in office, New Jersey Assemblywoman Sadaf Jaffer decided not to run for reelection.
The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job. They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.
Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020. In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere. As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.
But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
 Language matters

Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
 
Security measures
 


Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)The state Board of Elections voted 3-2 along party lines to once again recognize the Green Party after a discussion over whether it qualified. 
Republicans supported recognition, while Democrats were opposed.
The official status means that voters can continue to register with the party. 
There are three ways to qualify for party recognition, by submitting petition signatures; having a candidate for president or governor receive at least 2% of the vote in the previous general election or having a presidential candidate on the ballot in at least 35 states. 
The North Carolina Green Party was seeking renewed recognition under the third option.
Jill Stein, the party’s presidential candidate, appeared on ballots around the country. The question at the Board of Elections meeting was whether she was on enough state ballots as the Green Party candidate. 
State law says that the voters seeking political party recognition needed to have a candidate on 35 state ballots who was “nominated by that group” in the last general election.
Stein was on ballots in at least 35 states, but ran as an independent or as the candidate of a different party in some of them.
Democrats at the Thursday Board meeting said Stein fell short of hitting the 35-state requirement because she was not identified as the Green Party candidate on all of those states’ ballots. 
Siobhan Millen, a Democrat, said allowing the Green Party recognition would open the door to other small parties seeking access by claiming they supported candidates on different state ballots even when those candidates were not their parties’ nominees.
However, Stacy “Four’ Eggers IV, a Republican, said the board should “err on the side of party access,” noting the “board’s track record in opposing third-party access to the ballot recently is quite poor.”
The state board has been sued over the last few years by third parties seeking ballot access. 
The Green Party sued the board in 2022 after it initially denied the party’s petition for recognition over questionable signatures. The board reversed its decision about a month later. 
Last year, a federal judge ordered the board to certify the Justice for All Party, which allowed presidential candidate Cornel West on the ballot. 
The Justice for All Party, along with the Constitution Party, the We the People party, and No Labels all lost their party recognition after the November election.
Voters registered with those parties, about 34,000 people, will have their status changed to “unaffiliated” in the state’s voter registration database, the state Board said in a news release.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/P5071581-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-06-20 10:06:43.702314

This story by John Lippman was first published in the Valley News on June 19.
WOODSTOCK — A Windsor County sheriff’s deputy has been placed on administrative leave after she was charged with domestic assault and interference with access to emergency services.
Kristinnah Adams pleaded not guilty at her arraignment in Windsor County Superior Court last Friday, her attorney, Michael Shane, said in an email to the Valley News on Wednesday.
Adams, a 2003 Hartford High School graduate and a former Hartford police officer, did not reply to an email seeking comment on Wednesday.
According to a police affidavit filed in support of the charges, Adams attempted forcefully to take away a phone from a juvenile in an incident involving physical contact on the evening of June 11 at her residence in White River Junction. Adams also is alleged to have prevented the juvenile from calling 911.
“Ms. Adams is absolutely innocent of any wrongdoing in this case,” Shane said in his email. “We are confident that the truth will be forthcoming in short order.”
Adams joined the Windsor County Sheriff’s office in July 2023, as part of Sheriff Ryan Palmer’s efforts to expand the agency’s footprint by contracting with towns for policing services.
“When we were made aware of the pending criminal charges on the morning of June 12, we immediately took steps to cooperate with Hartford police” in their investigation, and placed Adams on administrative leave, Palmer said on Wednesday.
“We take all allegations of domestic and family violence seriously,” he said, adding that “we’re going to let the criminal process move forward and play out like we would with any case.”
Adams has a checkered record in law enforcement.
She served for a period as the school resource officer in Hartford, and was tapped as the department’s “designated detective” investigating sexual assault and child abuse with the Windsor County Special Investigation Unit. She received the Unsung Hero Award from CHAD at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center in 2015 “for her care, compassion and dedication through her work with victims of sexual assault.”
Adams was one of the officers involved in the arrest of Wayne Burwell in 2010 when police responded to a report of a “burglary in process” at Burwell’s address in Hartford. Burwell was experiencing a medical episode. When he didn’t respond to police, he was beaten with a nightstick, pepper sprayed, handcuffed and hauled off in a blanket.
Vermont’s attorney general subsequently cleared Adams and another officer of criminal wrongdoing. But Burwell filed a civil lawsuit against the town in 2012, alleging excessive use of force. Burwell received a $500,000 out-of-court settlement on the excessive force claim.
In 2020 while an officer in Hartford, Adams was the subject of a “Brady letter” — which requires a prosecuting attorney to notify a defense attorney when a police officer whom the prosecution relied upon in the case may have a credibility issue.
The letter, written by Windsor County State’s Attorney Ward Goodenough and addressed to an unnamed “defense counsel” in an unidentified case, reported that prosecutors “received information indicating” that Adams had been “untruthful” in regards to her whereabouts on a recent patrol shift.
Adams “was called to respond as back-up to an incident and took an unusually long time to arrive on scene and then gave a supervisor an explanation that does not appear to be supported by the facts,” the Brady letter said.
In addition, Goodenough wrote that his office had “further been notified” that in 2018, Adams had “made a fictitious illness report for a scheduled work shift.”
On Wednesday, Palmer said he was aware of Adams’ background when he hired her but that he believes in providing second chances for officers who may have blemishes on their record.
He praised Adams’ work in the county sheriff’s department, which includes courthouse security and patrol duties, according to the department’s website.
“She’s been great for us,” Palmer said of Adams. “The things that we assign her, she’s been fantastic at.”
The criminal investigation remains with the Hartford police. But because the case presents potential conflicts of interest for the Windsor County law enforcement community, the state was represented during Adams’ arraignment on Friday by the Windham County State’s Attorney Office, which will oversee the prosecution.
Separately, Palmer said he has asked the Bennington County Sheriff’s Department to conduct an internal affairs administrative investigation “in order to prevent any perception of impropriety.”

In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.

But elected leaders say there are no easy answers. And they fear things will get worse before they get better.
“These threats of violence, we’ve seen it before here and there, but nothing like we’ve seen it now,” said South Carolina Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, speaking with reporters this week. “And yes, I think that would make a lot of people stop and think and decide they do not want to enter that arena.
“It’s a tough arena anyway,” McMaster said, “but when you have the threat of violence — unanticipated, unmitigated, unexpected violence — that’s just one more reason not to get involved in politics.”
 Growing threats

In recent years, elected officials have faced a growing number of threats and attacks.
In 2020, a group of men were accused of plotting to kidnap Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer; five were later convicted. That same year, the 20-year-old son of a federal judge in New Jersey was killed by a gunman and lawyer who had previously had a case before her.
Paul Pelosi, the husband of former U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was assaulted by a hammer-wielding attacker at his home in 2022. President Donald Trump was targeted in a pair of assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign, including a shooting in which a bullet grazed his ear. And earlier this year, Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro was targeted in an arson attack on the governor’s mansion.
Nearly 9 in 10 state lawmakers reported facing demeaning or derogatory comments or actions in their current term or the campaign leading up to it, and more than 4 in 10 reported harassment and threats, according to a report published last year by the progressive-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.
Women were three to four times more likely than men to experience abuse related to their gender, according to the report. And people of color were more than three times as likely as white officeholders to endure race-based abuse.
Since the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, political threats against candidates — particularly women, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals — have escalated dramatically, according to Amanda Litman, co-founder and president of Run for Something, a political action committee that helps recruit young, liberal candidates for office.
“It sucks that we have to have these conversations with folks,” she said. “But the goal of this violence is to stop good people from running.”
Litman said that her organization offers support for candidates, including safety protocols, digital privacy training and mental health support. But increasing political violence and the easy online access to officeholders and candidates has begun to change how they interact with constituents and what they share about their lives.
“We have candidates who may have not thought twice to share a photo of their family or post updates about their lives outside of political office,” Litman said. “But now there is a shift in being more deliberate about what is being shared, especially online, where people can send threats and other stuff into your DMs, and use that information to stoke even more fear.”
 Language matters

Leaders say that rhetoric characterizing opponents as evil has made violent incidents more likely.
“People have gotten very, very good at toeing the line just shy of actually threatening to kill people,” Pohutsky, the Michigan lawmaker, said.
“That’s sort of become normalized,” she said. “If you make this a righteous fight, if you convince people that someone is harming children, it’s much easier to incite violence against them. That language is intentional.”
The changes have accelerated in recent years. Returning home in 2015 after serving in combat zones as a U.S. Marine and working in post-conflict regions, Jake Harriman said he didn’t recognize the country he had fought for.
Harriman said the tactics he witnessed extremist groups use in conflict areas abroad to exploit fractured nations and warring factions — such as division, fear, isolation — he now sees playing out across the United States.
“What shocked me most,” said Harriman, founder of More Perfect Union, a veteran-led civic service group, “was the hatred — Americans dehumanizing each other in ways I had only seen in war.”
More people are finding a sense of self and belonging via partisan political groups, such as identifying as MAGA or as an opponent of MAGA, said Amy Pason, an associate professor who specializes in political rhetoric at the University of Nevada, Reno.
“This is because people are more isolated or finding social groups on social media — or the other media they consume — and they identity with that group,” she said. “This gets to be more problematic when belonging to that group is to also accept beliefs and shift your attitudes — that those not in your group are dangerous or out to harm your group.”
Despite condemnations of the Minnesota shootings from state lawmakers of both parties, some Republicans in Congress rushed to social media to falsely blame Democrats and liberals.
U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, a Democrat and friend of Hortman’s, confronted U.S. Sen. Mike Lee, a Republican, in person on Capitol Hill after he made inflammatory comments about the assassination on the platform X. The posts were removed soon after.
Oregon state Sen. Jeff Golden, a Democrat, said the Minnesota attacks were a wakeup call. He pledged to direct his public comments in the future “towards the substance of the proposal and not the character of the person proposing.”
“I do think it can be a thin line,” Golden said. “I probably have crossed it one time or another, and I’m gonna do everything I possibly can not to do it again.”
But politicians have incentive to keep their base motivated and engaged through inflammatory attacks on people they characterize as the enemy, which dehumanizes them and fuels political violence, said Donald Nieman, a history professor at Binghamton University in New York.
Nieman noted in an email to Stateline that fear for personal and family safety is increasingly common among elected officials — affecting even how they vote. While he believes the path out is clear — “tone down the rhetoric, emphasize common ground” — he’s not optimistic.
“In a polarized political system, politicians depend on (and fear) a loyal base,” Neiman wrote. “I fear that the discussion of political violence will take the same course as school shootings: We will lament them, propose solutions that go nowhere, and there will be more shootings.”
 Security measures

Just hours before the Minnesota shootings, Oregon lawmakers passed a bill that would make it harder for the public to obtain the home addresses of elected officials. Rather than having that information on the secretary of state’s website, as is currently law, the bill would require residents to submit a public records request to obtain those details.
In 2023, New Jersey lawmakers passed a bill exempting local officials from sharing their addresses publicly, but Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy declined to sign the measure, citing a technicality with its effective date.
“We’re in such uncharted territory when all of this data can be accessed by anyone and made into lists,” said Jaffer, the former New Jersey lawmaker, citing the “hit list” of 45 officials that law enforcement officials say had been compiled by alleged Minnesota attacker Vance Boelter.
“There needs to be more done to protect those who step up to serve, but we also need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of information,” she said.
Jaffer said a friend from another country was surprised to learn that she had no security detail while in office.
“We’re just normal people,” she said of state legislators. “It’s a great thing that we’re accessible, but it certainly makes us vulnerable.”
Following the Minnesota shootings, North Dakota officials announced they will take down lawmakers’ addresses from legislative websites. New Hampshire legislative leaders also pulled down pages with information about elected leaders, while ramping up security at the State House. Meanwhile, lawmakers in New Mexico are reviewing their security practices.
Litman, of Run for Something, said legislatures should consider funding security for local candidates and officials who may not be able to afford it.
“I think there’s a real fear that if Donald Trump, who has the best security detail in the world, can be attacked at a public event, then what about local officials who don’t have the budget to afford to keep themselves or their families safe?” Litman said.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s gross domestic product grew more slowly over the past decade than that of all other states except for one, according to a Department of Labor and Workforce Development analysis.
The state’s GDP – the value of all goods and services – rose by only 0.4% annually on average from 2015 to 2025 when adjusted for inflation, according to the analysis in this month’s Alaska Economic Trends, the magazine published by the department’s research and analysis section. Only North Dakota has slower growth during the period, averaging 0.2% a year.
In comparison, the national annual growth rate for the period, adjusted for inflation, was 2.1% over the period, and the median growth rate — with half the states above and half below — was 1.7%
Without adjustments for inflation, the state’s growth might appear robust: an annual average of 8.2% from 2020 to 2024. But that nominal rate is misleading because the period was marked by high inflation, the analysis points out.
It focuses instead on “real” GDP, which factors in inflation. In real terms, Alaska’s total GDP peaked more than a decade ago, when oil prices were highest. There were only three years between 2015 and 2024 when Alaska showed real GDP growth — 2017, 2021 and 2022 — which also were the only years when Alaska’s growth outpaced the national average, the analysis found.
The statistics demonstrate the state’s economic vulnerability, said Sam Tappen, the state economist who did the analysis and wrote the Trends article.
“The fact that we’ve had such long-term stagnation, I think, is troubling,” he said.
 

  Alaska’s gross domestic product, in real dollars, is shown in this graph that separates the oil-dominated mining from all other sectors.(Graph from Alaska Economic Trends/Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development Research and Analysis)
 

	The statistics reflect Alaska’s dependence on oil and the price of that commodity, which depends on world markets and global events beyond the state’s control.
The volatility of oil prices has an outsized impact on Alaska’s economy, he said. “Oil just tends to push around the total,” he said.
Beyond the period of high oil prices, there were two different years of steep drops: 2015, when a plunge in oil prices caused a 9% drop in GDP, and 2020, when Alaska’s real GDP fell 7.1% amid the global COVID-19 pandemic disruptions.
Not coincidentally, other states at or near the bottom — North Dakota, Wyoming and Louisiana — are also highly dependent on oil and gas.
The good news in the statistics is that outside of the oil-dominated mining sector, the state’s real gross domestic product has been increasing. “All the other industries are typically growing pretty steadily,” Tappen said.
But even that good news is tempered by the reality that nonoil sectors of the economy depend to a large degree on oil.
That includes the strong transportation and warehousing sector, which accounts for a little over 14% of Alaska’s total gross domestic product and is among the sectors with the highest real growth. More than half of the sector’s output is directly tied to the oil industry, Tappen pointed out.
Other sectors with notable growth, averaging around 3% annually, were leisure and hospitality, construction, private health and education. The oil-dominated mining sector declined at an average annual rate of 2.6%, and the natural resources sector, which includes seafood harvesting, declined at an annual average of 3.9%, Tappen’s research found.
Gross domestic product is just one measure of an economy, Tappen’s article points out. There are other measures, including employment and income.

Cameron Parker, a Republican from Campbell, presents a bill in the Missouri House in February (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).Missouri students majoring in business, biology, elementary education, psychology and nursing may soon be able to transfer more college credits between the state’s public universities.
State lawmakers negotiated a plan to make 60-credit-hour blocks in five degree programs universally transferable among public universities and community colleges in Missouri as part of a bill awaiting the governor’s signature or veto. The change is set to kick in by the 2028-29 school year.
The legislation’s original sponsor, Republican  state Rep. Cameron Parker of Campbell, has advocated for the bill for two years in hopes it can reduce the number of classes transfer students have to repeat.
“If you go to a community college in southeast Missouri and you transfer to a four year school in northwest Missouri, we want it to be a seamless transition across the state,” she told The Independent. “So if you go to any community college, you will know what any of the four-year schools are going to take.”
Parker chose the five degree programs in the bill because they were the most popular for community-college students. She sees the potential for colleges to extend similar agreements to other fields but understands the process is “daunting” for universities.
Four-year institutions have been the only pushback on the legislation — which garnered near unanimous approval from the Missouri House.
Paul Wagner, executive director of the Council on Public Higher Education, told a House committee in February that he wished the bill would allow for colleges to keep existing agreements for the five degrees intact. Wagner’s group represents Missouri’s public universities outside of the University of Missouri system.
“We still have some concerns that it is going to be throwing out the good in hopes that whatever the new thing is might be better,” Wagner told The Independent in an interview Wednesday.
But Brian Millner, president of the Missouri Community College Association, said in the House hearing that the current system is not working for students.
“Our transfer and articulation system is built on a house of cards of literally thousands of articulation agreements between a community college and a university for a particular program replicated over and over and over again,” he said. “We can do better for our students.”
Navigating these articulation agreements can be challenging, Millner said, and it increasingly hurts students who do not have a clear idea of which four-year college they will transfer to.

The issue expands beyond students and impacts Missouri taxpayers, Parker said, since many Missouri students use the state-funded A+ Scholarship Program to pay for community college. The A+ program pays for students to take 12 to 18 credit hours at a community college each semester for up to two years.
“If kids are taking 60 hours and then they’re transferring only 42, it is not fair to the kids. It is not fair to their parents, and it is not fair to the taxpayers paying for the A+ Program,” Parker said.
Since the 2018-19 school year, Missouri public universities have collaborated on a 42-credit-hour block of general education requirements, dubbed the CORE 42, thanks to a law passed by the General Assembly.
There were “fits” at the beginning of the program, Wagner said, but “implementation has worked really well.”
Parker’s legislation would expand the existing program, adding 18 more universally transferable credit hours for the five degree programs. Mirroring the implementation CORE 42,  a coordinating board of stakeholders will oversee the course-equivalency block.
As part of negotiations with universities, Parker edited the legislation to call for an equal number of representatives from community colleges and four-year institutions on the board. Her original bill called for one member per school.
The change, she said, helped tamp down some concerns and advance the bill this year.
“When everybody started coming to the table and sitting down and making these big fixes that helped everybody across the board, then I became pretty hopeful (that the bill would pass),” she said.

The political world saw her as a rising star in 2023; Jaffer, a Democrat, previously served as the nation’s first female Muslim mayor. But rampant harassment from online commenters and other politicians about her religion, as well as high-profile acts of violence against other public officials, made her reconsider her political future.
“I was concerned about my family,” Jaffer said in an interview. “They didn’t sign up for this. I didn’t want to put them in harm’s way.”
In the wake of the assassination of Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, as well as the wounding of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, more public officials across the country are taking stock of their safety. Some say death threats have become part of the job.
They fear that violence — real attacks and constant threats — will scare potential candidates away from seeking public office.

Michigan Democratic state Rep. Laurie Pohutsky said she has faced multiple death threats since 2020.
In one instance, a neighbor reported that a stranger was waiting at her house, demanding to know when she would return home.
“I have certainly considered somewhat frequently that I might be killed doing this job,” Pohutsky told Stateline. “But what really alarmed me [about the Minnesota attacks] and stopped me in my tracks was I had not considered that someone might enter my home and kill my family.”
Nationwide, lawmakers in both parties say political rhetoric that dehumanizes anyone who disagrees on an issue has created a charged atmosphere.
As politicians increasingly describe their rivals not just as wrong on policy but as the enemy, the message can embolden extremists to carry out violence.
“People treat death threats against government officials as a matter of course until someone is assassinated,” Pohutsky said. “It’s an impossible position, because the people who are carrying out these attacks want people to leave public office.”
In some states, lawmakers are discussing whether officials’ home addresses should be included in campaign finance forms and other publicly available documents. Elsewhere, political leaders are reviewing their security protocols.










In my time in politics, and as a South Carolinian, I've never seen this kind of thing going on. I think something is broken in our society. People are hurting their neighbors for no reason at all, putting people in danger, threatening people, scaring people. It's got to stop.

(Photo by Nicole Neri for the Minnesota Reformer)I once naively believed that the worst kind of loss in politics was at the ballot box.  
I learned the hard way about real loss in October 2002, when Sen. Paul Wellstone’s plane went down while he was traveling the state doing his job as U.S. senator and running for reelection.  
That loss shook the state and devastated his supporters. Many people said to me, “Paul spoke for me. Who will speak for me now?”  
But after some of the grief and mourning settled, something amazing happened. People turned the loss into a call for action. “Stand Up, Keep Fighting” was the motto, and a whole new generation stepped into politics declaring that they were ready to pick up where Paul Wellstone left off. 
As I try to process the horror of the assassination of Speaker Melissa Hortman and Mark Hortman, the incredibly moving message from their kids Sophie and Colin Hortman brought me back to those days after 2002. They wrote a list of activities we can do to honor Mark and Melissa, and here was the final item: “Stand up for what you believe in, especially if that thing is justice and peace.” 
To that I say yes! That is exactly what we must do.  
Sometimes a leader comes along who turns out to be the right person in the right place and time. Paul Wellstone was that person. Melissa Hortman was that person. Melissa’s impact on Minnesota and its people is huge. She was authentic, principled and strategic, not to mention funny, smart and relatable. These are ingredients for the best leaders. She built governing power by finding and encouraging a generation of community leaders around Minnesota to run for legislative office. The majorities she led governed justly, boldly and with compassion, through significant change and turmoil, finding the common good. Her hard work has put Minnesota in a good place and ready to take on the future.
She was stolen from us just as she was really getting going. That is just heartbreaking.  
But, in her leadership time here, she set a beautiful example, and always did right by Minnesota. 
So, just as with Wellstone two decades ago, we now need a thousand Melissa Hortmans. We need people to step up where she left off. People who get to climb on Melissa’s shoulders, get in there, fight for people and make a difference.  
People who will volunteer to serve their neighbors, knock on doors, join a local board, march in a rally, and, yes, run for office. And, once in office, to lead with integrity and courage. 
Will that be you?

Proposition 187, the Save Our State initiative, would bar undocumented immigrants across California from using public schools, taxpayer-funded social services and non-emergency medical care. 
“I had to get involved, so that families like mine, communities like mine, would not continue to be scapegoated or targeted,” Padilla, whose parents emigrated to the United States from Mexico, said in an interview in 2018.
That attitude put him in the political minority at the time. Backed by then-Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican who made the campaign a centerpiece of his reelection, Prop. 187 passed with a commanding 58%, including majorities in 51 out of 58 counties. That included Padilla’s Los Angeles County, where it won by eight percentage points.
California has changed in the three decades since, a political and cultural transformation that is in many ways personified by Padilla’s career. In just a single generation, the political clout immigrants hold in California has soared. So have the legal protections afforded even to those immigrants who are unauthorized to live here. On the whole, public opinion on immigration policy, border security and the rightful role of immigrants in American life has inverted from 31 years ago. Prop. 187 was voided by a federal judge shortly after its passage, but its effect on California politics endures.


Case in point: Padilla, the reluctant young activist, is now the first Latino U.S. senator to represent California. In that role he has become one of the most visible symbols of the clash of values between the nativism of President Donald Trump’s administration and California’s liberal consensus on immigration. After last week’s jarring altercation, in which Padilla was forcibly removed from a press conference held by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and briefly handcuffed, elected officials across California lined up to lionize and defend him. 
This isn’t Pete Wilson’s California anymore.
Immigration policy a ‘settled issue’ in California
Pollster Mark Baldassare has been chronicling the change for decades. In 1998, he and his colleagues at the Public Policy Institute of California began asking Californians a simple question: Are immigrants a “benefit” or a “burden” to California?
Respondents were evenly split in the first survey. Ever since, a majority — one that has grown with each decade — has come to see immigrants as a boon to our state. In February, when PPIC most recently asked the question, 72% of respondents chose “benefit.” That included 91% of Democrats and 73% of political independents, though only 31% of Republicans.
“This is pretty much a settled issue,” said Baldassarre. 
Part of that sweeping change can be explained by the state’s shifting demographics. If the U.S. is the land of immigrants, California is doubly so. More than a quarter of the state’s population was born abroad, and almost half of California’s children were born to an immigrant parent. More than half of California’s immigrants are naturalized U.S. citizens.And California’s immigrant community is diverse: 49% are originally from Latin American countries and 41% from Asia. For the past decade, more immigrants from Asia have entered California than from Latin America.
But California’s changing demographics are only part of the reason immigration politics have seen such a radical shift in such a relatively short period of time, said Adrian Pantoja, a political science and Chicano studies professor at Pitzer College in Claremont.

It’s not a law of nature that Latinos and other demographic groups with sizable immigrant populations should favor the Democratic Party. Plenty of Latinos and Asian Americans, for example, hold traditionally conservative opinions — on specific border and immigration-related policies and a host of other issues. 
Had the GOP “reached out effectively to Latinos, to Asian American voters — populations that were inclined and trending toward the Republican Party” the state GOP might still be an electoral force, said Pantoja. 
Instead, the state party hitched its political future to a ballot measure aimed at penalizing undocumented immigrants and their children — and hasn’t won a statewide race since 2006.Still, as in much of the nation, Latino support for Republicans in the last presidential election ticked up in California. In nine of 12 counties where Latinos are the largest demographic group, support for Trump increased from 4 to 6 percentage points between the last two presidential contests, depending on the county.
The legacy of Proposition 187
Three decades after that great California political rupture, the fruits of Prop. 187 are apparent in who holds power in California.
Padilla is California’s senior U.S. senator. Both chambers of the state Legislature have elected Latino leaders — Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas of Salinas and Senate President Pro Tem-elect Monique Limón of Santa Barbara. In the early 1990s, the count of Latinos in the Legislature bounced around the single digits. Today, there are a combined 42 members in the Democratic and Republican parties’ respective Latino caucuses out of 120 members. 
That rise in political power has translated to changes in policy.
In 2017, then-Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law Senate Bill 54, California’s sanctuary state law that largely bars state and local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration enforcement. The bill’s author, Kevin de Leon, also traces his start in politics to Prop. 187.
More recently, the state has expanded Medi-Cal, the state’s health insurance program for low-income Californians and those with disabilities, to all immigrants without legal status. Newsom signed successive expansions into law starting in 2020. 
Where Prop. 187 was authored to deprive undocumented immigrants of social services, California’s Medi-Cal expansion was its antithesis.The generational impact of that ballot measure was demonstrated in 2010, when immigrants were mobilized to vote and shift the state further to the left.By then, a quarter of the state’s electorate was Latino, said Thad Kousser, a professor of California politics at UC San Diego. 
“Latinos become this voting block that helps deliver the state to Jerry Brown, and then the state becomes Democratic in every single statewide office, in every election” since, he said.That year, Brown defeated billionaire businesswoman Meg Whitman in an acrimonious gubernatorial race, showcasing California as an outlier in the national red wave and ending a run in which Republicans won the governor’s race six times out of the previous eight elections. Democrats lost no congressional seats in California even as the party was routed nationally.By 2016, the respective leaders of the State Assembly and Senate were Latino, a first in California.

But not all efforts to reverse the conservatism of the 1990s in California have succeeded. In 2020, a ballot measure to largely reverse the state’s ban on using race, ethnicity or gender as factors in public university admissions and government grant-making failed to woo voters. In the state’s population center of Los Angeles County, a majority of Asian voters shot down the proposal while only 55% of Latino voters backed it.And immigrants or their children make up a sizable chunk of the GOP in the state capital. When voters in 2020 elected Redlands Republican Rosilicie Ochoa-Bogh, the child of Mexican immigrants, she became the first GOP Latina state senator in California’s history. Today the Republican Senate caucus has at least three members who are immigrants or whose parents were born abroad, according to their public biographies — 30% of the caucus. Before being elected to the Assembly as a Republican, Tri Ta became the first Vietnamese American to serve as mayor of a U.S. city.   
Medi-Cal rollback shifts views
Recent polling shows the latest wave of Medi-Cal expansions may have gone too far even for California’s immigrant-friendly electorate. A majority of Californians — 58% — oppose health coverage for immigrants without permanent legal status, according to PPIC’s June 2025 survey. 
Other polls show a majority of likely voters still support health insurance for immigrants.
This mixed picture emerges as California grapples with a third successive fiscal year of multibillion-dollar deficits and sharply increasing Medi-Cal costs. While those data may indicate softening political support for the boldest of California’s policies aimed at helping undocumented immigrants, it doesn’t spell a political realignment, said Kousser.
“California moved so far to the left that there’s almost nowhere to go other than the slight counter-reaction,” he said.
Baldassare of PPIC agreed, saying the Medi-Cal survey results may simply reflect a growing concern about the state’s finances. He noted that Newsom has proposed freezing enrollment.On some other measures affecting immigrants, Democratic lawmakers and Newsom have diverged. Last year the Legislature approved a bill to essentially adopt a novel legal theory to permit public college students without legal authorization in the U.S. to work on their campuses. Newsom vetoed the bill.
Anti-ICE protests: A new Prop. 187 moment?
There is some indication that California’s philosophical support for immigrants is, at least in part, accelerated by Trump. The share of respondents who called immigrants a “benefit” in PPIC’s surveys shot up during the first Trump administration and ebbed during Joe Biden’s stint in the White House. The most recent survey, the first since Trump returned to power, saw another spike.
That has some immigrant rights advocates hoping that the Trump administration’s current sweeping deportation policy will galvanize a new generation of political activists in California.
“Whether it’s post-Prop. 187 or post-9/11 for middle eastern South Asian communities, at some point you realize that you are being endlessly and inhumanely targeted and if you don’t speak up, and if you don’t practice your First Amendment rights, and if you’re not civically engaged, then you’ll be taken advantage of,” said Masih Fouladi, executive director of the California Immigrant Policy Center. “I think those are really the things that brought people together then, and what are bringing people to the streets now.”

He said if he were asked a few months ago whether California elected leaders were shifting to the center on immigration, he’d have said yes. But Trump’s immigration raids in Los Angeles are “allowing elected officials to come out more strongly” against the apprehensions, he said. Christian Arana, vice president of policy at the Latino Community Foundation, was just six years old when Prop. 187 was on the ballot. He has distinct memories of marching with his family, everyone clad in white shirts, surrounded by a wide array of his neighbors chanting delightfully brash slogans about someone named Pete Wilson.
“For six-year-old me, what I understood was that my parents, my neighbors, my community was under attack because some man — in that case the governor of California — was blaming California’s problems on them,” he said. “I wonder how young children are experiencing this moment now.”Fifteen-year-old Nathon Ponce has an answer: He feels vulnerable. The rising high school sophomore at USC Hybrid High College Prep stood with his aunt several hundred feet from law enforcement as they fired projectiles and less-lethal rounds at protesters in downtown Los Angeles on Saturday. He wants to see the government create a legal pathway to citizenship for immigrants without that status, “instead of pushing them away.” 
More broadly, he was there to support his community, which “some people consider a vulnerable group, like Hispanics and low-income working people,” he said. “And I just want to show my support by, like, actually attending a protest.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/061125-Prop-187-Protest-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C631&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-20 09:06:26.063566

In mid-April, the U.S. Department of Interior transferred 406 square miles of land to the U.S. Army, after which the Army made the land an extension of the Fort Huachuca Army installation in Arizona. That same day, the fort’s commander issued a security regulation designating the land as a restricted area. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Mexico then started charging people with trespassing on the land, now called the New Mexico National Defense Area.

A federal judge in mid-May dismissed charges against nearly 100 migrants charged with trespassing, who said the migrants couldn’t have known that they were entering a military zone when they crossed the U.S.-Mexico border.
The two convictions announced on Thursday were against two people who had previously been apprehended in the NMNDA, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s office, which cited two federal statues used to establish criminal penalties “for unlawful intrusions into areas designated as National Defense Areas. The two people convicted were:
• Andres De Los Santos-Martinez, a citizen of Mexico, pled guilty to re-entry after deportation, after being apprehended by U.S. Border Patrol agents on June 1 in Doña Ana County; he was previously apprehended in the NMNDA on May 7, 2025,
• Eduardo Herrera-Juvencio, also from Mexico, was apprehended in the area twice on the same days.
“These first convictions reflect the resolve of the United States Attorney’s Office to do its part in securing our nation’s southern border,” Ellison said in a statement. “I am tremendously proud of our staff in the Las Cruces Branch Office, the U.S. Border Patrol, and the U.S. military for their relentless efforts to secure our southern border. This partnership is a prime example of what can be accomplished through coordinated enforcement of existing federal laws. New Mexico—and the entire country—is more secure because of these efforts.”
According to Ellison’s office, the court ordered both defendants to remain in custody pending sentencing. Upon completion of their sentences, they will be subject to deportation proceedings.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image009-1024x827.jpg,,,2025-06-20 09:06:26.063566

Rukshan Samaranayake
Rukshan Samaranayake is a postgraduate student at National University and a U.S. Army veteran.


My journey to a college degree has been filled with detours. 
After high school, I attended college for two semesters before I joined the U.S. Army. When I concluded my service as a combat engineer — deployed overseas and with two Purple Heart medals to boast — I returned to California and enrolled in community college. But financial difficulties got in the way.
Unsurprisingly, money is the primary reason most students stop or drop out of college. I was fortunate to have GI Bill benefits to pay for my education, but most Californians don’t have that option. I eventually returned to college, completed my associate’s degree and transferred to National University, where I earned my bachelor’s.
Financial aid made all the difference in my college journey — and my life. California lawmakers have the opportunity to strengthen a financial aid program that’s serving as a lifeline for hundreds of thousands of Californians who are seeking a college credential to improve their lives.
This year, the Cal Grant program is supporting nearly 700,000 low- and middle-income Californians who are pursuing degrees at public and independent postsecondary institutions across the state. Two-thirds of new Cal Grant recipients are seeking to become the first college graduates in their families. Nearly a third are adult learners — many with family, job and other responsibilities — who are returning to school after time away from formal education.
Cal Grant makes it possible to pursue a credential at the institutions that have powered California’s economy for decades. Today, 56% of California adults have a postsecondary degree or credential, a nine-point increase since 2014. Enhancing the state’s financial aid program would help more Californians open up the pathways to high-wage careers that keep California globally competitive. But the award amounts from the Cal Grant program have not kept pace with the rising cost of college. 
Assembly Bill 402, which is now under consideration in the state Senate, would accomplish two critical things to support people like me who took a less traditional path.
First, by restoring Cal Grant scholarship amounts to 2001 levels, the bill would provide additional aid to eligible students. AB 402 would raise the maximum Cal Grant award to students attending independent institutions by $350 to $9,708 annually starting in 2025-26. This increase would directly support nearly 31,000 Californians attending private nonprofit colleges and universities.
Second, the bill would ensure that nontraditional students like myself who transfer from a community college to one of the more than 85 independent California colleges or universities can maintain their Cal Grant eligibility. 
In 2024, these campuses welcomed more than 3,300 community college transfer students. If transfer students can maintain Cal Grant eligibility, it would open up additional opportunities to better serve the diverse needs and realities for community college students.
Thanks to the financial aid that supported my college journey, I went from a college dropout to college graduate. In January, I earned my bachelor’s degree with distinction from National University. 
I chose to remain there to pursue my master’s while serving as vice president of the student veterans’ organization, volunteering through the California Volunteers program and supporting two military-affiliated organizations, The Mission Continues and the Wounded Warrior Project.
AB 402 represents a small investment in postsecondary opportunities that could make a big difference in peoples’ lives. Every college journey is different, but everyone should have a chance to get the financial support they need to reach the finish.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/050825_ESL-Class_JH_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-06-20 09:06:26.063566

She was appointed as commissioner of the Alabama Medicaid Agency in 2012 by former Gov. Robert Bentley.
Ashmore said that three “very qualified candidates” were selected to interview with the board, and the decision was not easy.
“I was impressed with the fact that you had one of the candidates who was the administrator of the state of Florida plan, who I’ve actually known for 25 plus years, and a very good candidate. You had the one that was selected, (who has) been Medicaid commissioner for quite some time. That’s a very large agency, and she’s proven herself over there. And we had an internal candidate that was ready to also take over on day one,” Ashmore said.
Azar will lead the insurance board at a time when the rise of health care costs is a concern. Bob Childree, a retired employees’ representative on the board, offered his support but also noted concerns about the board’s financial condition.
“I’m very concerned about the financial viability of SEIB,” Childree said.
Ashmore said after the meeting that the plan is financially sound, but for the previous 16 years, the board has not asked the Legislature for a rate raise. Ashmore said that this trend is unsustainable in the long term due to the evolving health care landscape, particularly at the federal level.
“We’ve talked about the Medicare Advantage and doubling of costs. We’ve seen plans that had their costs triple in those areas, and in order to continue to provide those benefits to our beneficiaries, which is our mission to do, we’ve got to have the funds,” Ashmore said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC01641-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-20 08:05:01.892770

When Louvannina Tsosie walked into The Door Christian Fellowship Church in Gallup, N.M., she expected the kind of church service she had growing up: worship, music, a sermon, prayer and some scripture reading.
What she didn’t expect was a stage performance aimed at Native people that included a condemnation of traditional Navajo beliefs — and those who embrace them.
“Unfortunately, it turned out to be a really disrespectful kind of play,” she said.
Among other scenes that trafficked in harmful stereotypes of Indigenous people, the play showcased a Diné Hataałii, or medicine man, being condemned to hell for practicing traditional Diné ways of life, including ceremony and traditional healing.
Hataałii protect and preserve all traditional ceremonies and customs of the Diné way of life, and they hold a special place of honor among the Diné people.
The Door showing the damnation of a Hataałii “wasn’t a misunderstanding,” Tsosie said, but rather a “direct attack on our beliefs and spirituality.”
The Door is an offshoot of the Potter’s House Christian Fellowship Church, which was founded in Prescott, and is part of Christian Fellowship Ministries located in Benton, Kentucky. Christian Fellowship Ministries has over 4,000 churches worldwide, with seven churches on the Navajo Nation.
“Our church here in Gallup was among the first few Southwestern works launched out of the Prescott congregation,” The Door’s website states. “From the earliest days, it has stood as a testimony to God’s power to transform lives and reach cities through evangelism, discipleship and church planting.”
The Arizona Mirror reached out to The Door and Potter’s House, but neither church responded.
The shock from the play prompted Tsosie to start recording a video of the over-the-top theatrical production on her phone. She then posted that video on her TikTok account with the caption: “The things you see in border towns.”
Her TikTok posts feature two parts of the play, which was set in a dark room with the stage illuminated by red lights, while ominous drum music plays in the background.
The music played throughout the show featured remixes of traditional songs, layered with sound effects to create a more menacing tone.
At the center of the stage,  a Navajo man dressed in traditional clothing kneels by a fire, holding an eagle feather in his hand. Kneeling next to the Navajo medicine man is an actor dressed in a demon costume, encouraging his actions.
Suddenly, another Navajo person appears, shouting at the medicine man and demanding to know what he did to his niece.
“She’s in the hospital. What kind of ceremony did you do?” the man shouts. The interaction escalates into violence, as the angry man stabs and kills the medicine man.
In the next scene, the medicine man — the murder victim — is standing at what is supposed to be the gates of heaven, surrounded by white light, interacting with an angel. That angel swiftly bars the Hataałii from heaven and condemns him to hell.

The stage suddenly bathed in red lights, demons surround the medicine man, taunting him. “Come on, let’s do a ceremony,” and “We don’t like tradition, do we?” they say.
The medicine man is laid on the floor, and the lead demon gives orders to his minions: “Let’s do a purification. I’ll purify your soul in the fiery pits of hell. Demons, take this pedophile and make him suffer.”
Since she posted the video, Tsosie said she has received an overwhelming response. The video has garnered more than 230,000 views on TikTok, with nearly 1,600 comments.
Tsosie said some of the comments in her videos claim she is taking the play out of context, misrepresenting the situation and she needs to find her way with Christ.
“It kind of felt like a big slap in my face,” she said.
Tsosie, 24, grew up in a Christian household in Tohlakai, New Mexico, on the Navajo Nation. She said she is familiar with the religion, even though she is no longer religious. She attended The Door’s service because a friend invited her.
In response to the play, Tsosie helped organize a peaceful protest across the street from the church on June 8. She said they want accountability, including a public apology. They have not received a response from the church, much less an apology.
Navajo elders and youth have reached out to her. Tsosie said the elders appreciate her speaking up about the incident because they thought they’d never see it happen. Youth have shared their feelings about forced religion and the cultural shame they encounter.
“It’s been emotional and overwhelming, in the best and hardest ways,” she said. “This moment is bigger than me, and it’s about our people realizing that we don’t have to stay silent anymore.”
‘It was absolutely revolting’
As she sat through the service, Tsosie said she noticed how utterly unbothered the predominantly Native audience was as the actors portraying the demons mocked Diné ceremonies.
“I guess it felt normal to them,” she said. “I think the painful part of the play was that most of the actors were themselves Navajo.”
Diné historian Dr. Jennifer Nez Denetdale said she has heard stories about The Door Church and how many Navajo people involved with the church actively participated in demeaning and derogatory remarks about their people.
Her niece witnessed this firsthand and never returned, appalled by their actions. Denetdale said demonizing the Diné people’s way of life is a long-term strategy of The Door Church.
Denetdale said the Navajo Nation has never really acknowledged or accounted for the extent to which the Navajo people have been Christianized since colonization began on their homeland.
“What follows the soldiers are the missionaries,” she said. “What follows the establishment of the forts is the missionaries and the priests.”
Denetdale holds a doctoral degree in history and serves as the professor and chair of American Studies at the University of New Mexico. Her research work focuses on settler colonialism, decolonization and Diné studies.
Denetdale is from Tohatchi, New Mexico, on the Navajo Nation. During her regular drives to Gallup, which is 25 miles away and the closest community with resources for many Navajo people in the area, she made it a habit to count the churches along the way.
“In that stretch, there are at least 16 Christian churches, and we’re talking about a remote area,” she said. “There’s an investment in continuing to Christianize Navajo people, and in that process, they must discount, vilify and demonize who we are and our foundation as Diné people.”
Due to how heavily Christianized the Navajo people are, Denetdale said their response to conflicts involving the church, such as what was depicted in Tsosie’s video, is often not to say anything — or to deflect by saying things like, “That’s not my church and that’s not us.”
“They don’t see it as problematic because they personalize it,” she added. “I think that’s part of the problem, and a question for all of us is to acknowledge just how Christianized we’ve become.”
Denetdale said she is not a Christian, and it is difficult for any Navajo person to say they are not a Christian because so many prominent leaders on the Navajo Nation are Christian. However, she said she is a historian and knows the history of Christianity, and “it is an ugly, ugly story.”
Denetdale said she doesn’t use the terms “culture” or “religion” to explain the Diné people’s way of life because they do not adequately describe who they are. She said that the Diné people’s knowledge and understanding of the world are rooted in a deep philosophy of Diné values.
When she saw the video, she said “it was absolutely revolting” and she shouldn’t be surprised that, in this day and age, one can showcase something that has “such incredibly grotesque depictions of Diné ways of being, and that medicine people, traditional practitioners, are demonized.”
“I’m shocked, but I shouldn’t be shocked — this is Gallup, New Mexico,” she said, a city with a long history of racism and discrimination against Indigenous people.
The City of Gallup was founded in 1881. It has been referred to as the “Indian Capitol of the World” due to its proximity to several tribal nations, including the Navajo Nation and the Zuni Pueblo Nation, whose tribal lands surround the city, as well as the significant contribution of Indigenous people to the local economy.
Indigenous people make up more than 52% of the city’s population, but like many border towns, Gallup has a history of racism and violence against Native people.
In response to public outcry, the City of Gallup released a statement indicating that, since its founding, it has been a place of diverse heritages, beliefs, and practices.
Due to the diversity of Gallup, the city stated that “conflict is inevitable,” and when it occurs, their priority is to ensure the public’s safety and that all rights are respected and protected.
The city stated it cannot intervene or take sides in matters of speech and expression. However, they can and will impose reasonable restrictions on time, place and manner in the public arena.
“Freedom of expression comes at a price,” the city wrote in its statement. “It requires an acceptance of and willingness to bear insult and offense, to hear and see what one may find hurtful or despicable.”
The Arizona Mirror reached out to the City of Gallup for comment, but it did not respond.
Navajo Nation Council issues letter to church
Navajo Nation Council Speaker Crystalyne Curley said that since the video was released, council delegates have been asked by constituents to address it. Curley called the church’s play very disrespectful.
“It was very gruesome and visual,” she said, especially with the sound effects. “They went above and beyond to do that.”
On the best way to move forward, Curley said that she consulted with faith-based leaders from various denominations and traditional practitioners to hear their perspectives on the incident.
“Many of them reiterated that this type of disrespect or depiction of discrimination should not be tolerated toward any faith,” she said in an interview with the Arizona Mirror.
Many expressed their disapproval of the church’s performance, she said, noting that it crosses the boundaries of respect among faiths.
“Navajo traditional practices are considered sacred by many of our people,” Curley said in a statement. “They are integral to Navajo identity, history, and our way of life.”
On behalf of the Navajo Nation Council, Curley issued a formal letter to The Door on June 11,  expressing disappointment and calling on the church’s leadership to take responsibility for the performance.
“As neighbors to the Navajo Nation, the City of Gallup and surrounding communities share not only a geographical proximity but also a cultural and social relationship with our people,” the letter stated. “It is within this shared space that mutual respect, understanding and coexistence must be nurtured.”
The Navajo Nation Council described the performance as a misrepresentation and mockery of sacred aspects of Navajo spirituality, stating that the portrayal is disrespectful and culturally insensitive.
“Navajo medicine men are spiritual leaders and should never be made a mockery in such a violent manner,” Curley said in a statement.
The letter calls on the church to take the concerns of the community seriously, Curley said, and she is more than willing to sit down with the church’s leaders to have a “respectful dialogue on what has happened.”
“Many of our people are still frustrated,” she said, adding that they have not received any type of response back from the church.
Curley said that it is essential to acknowledge the religious freedoms practiced on the Navajo Nation. However, she said that “freedom should never come at the expense of another person’s sacred beliefs or traditions.”
“My statement is not intended to play down or disrespect another religion, but there has to be some type of respect, even as neighbors,” Curley added. “This goes across all faiths. We have to stay respectful to one another.”
Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren has not released a statement about the incident. The Arizona Mirror reached out to Nygren’s office, but it did not respond.

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The Alabama State Board of Education (ALSBOE) unanimously approved an emergency rule for paid parental leave for educators last week.
The rule, as outlined by SB 199, sponsored by Sen. Vivian Figures, D-Mobile, allows public education employees to take eight weeks of paid leave after giving birth, having a stillbirth or experiencing a miscarriage after 12 weeks. It also allows a father to take two weeks of paid leave under those circumstances. If a couple adopts a child under 3, either parent may have eight weeks of leave if they are both eligible employees.

The emergency rule, State Superintendent Eric Mackey said in May, allows employees who are expecting a child at the beginning of July to use the benefit. With the emergency rule, there is a 35-day public comment period before the board adopts permanent rules at its meeting on July 8.
“We’re getting a lot of questions from superintendents and CFOs but feel pretty good about implementation of that,” Mackey said at the board’s work session Thursday.
The use of the benefit revolves around the birth of the child, so any employees that have a baby before July 1, which is the effective date of the law, would not get paid leave. Mackey said an employee has a full calendar year to use the benefit, so those that have a baby in July can wait until school starts to take their leave.
Mackey said the local superintendent must approve the leave, and it should allow the parent to bond with the child. He said that a school district asked if a teacher could take every Friday off as their leave, but that does not align with the purpose of the law. There is no appeals process for any proposed leave, he said.
“But the purpose of the bill is to allow moms and dads some time to adjust to a new baby or adoption, and to bond,” he said. “Obviously, taking every Friday off doesn’t meet that need, and so I’m going to turn that down as a local superintendent.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMG_9529-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-20 08:05:01.892770

(Photo by Lauren Lifke/Maryland Matters)The official swearing-in for new Prince George’s County Exective Aisha Braveboy was Wednesday. But the celebration was Thursday.
Braveboy took the oath of office a second time before hundreds of dignitaries, celebrities and county residents who packed a hall in the Samuel Riggs IV Alumni Center at the University of Maryland, College Park for the event. Many had the day off for the Juneteenth holiday — a date Braveboy said she chose deliberately.
“I said, ‘You know what? I want to be sworn in on a day that has meaning separate and apart from myself,’” Braveboy said. “This day is about emancipation. It’s about liberation. It’s about remembering how folks who look like me got to this country.” 
The two-hour event felt at times like a church meeting, at times like a political rally, at times like a reunion. There were benedictions by a rabbi, an imam and two ministers, a presentation of flags from dozens of countries represented in the county population, a musical presentation by a church choir and a serenade by sisters of Sigma Gamma Rho, Braveboy’s college sorority.
“I love my blue and gold, all that I know is there ain’t nothing like my SG Rho,” sang a group of about 20 women wearing the sorority’s signature colors.
Attendees were greeted by a wall-size poster of Braveboy with the logo, “The future is Brave,” and treated to an eight-minute video retrospective of her career. And there were speeches, by Prince George’s County Council Chair Edward Burroughs III and from actress Taraji P. Henson, who spent much of her time discussing rising youth suicide and the mental health foundation she founded in honor of her father, but said she is “excited for our partnership” with Braveboy.

Henson was followed by Gov. Wes Moore, one of many state and county officials in attendance. Braveboy was one of the first to come out and endorse Moore’s gubernatorial bid when he was a little-known hopeful in a large field of experienced Democrats seeking the governorship.
“I have had the honor of watching her work up close, and I can tell you from the work that I have already seen, you should understand why I’m so excited about the future of  Prince George’s County,” Moore said. “She’s someone who has shown that she doesn’t just have a vision for the future, but she’s someone who’s shown that she knows how to deliver upon that future as well.”
Braveboy, a former state delegate who was elected Prince George’s County state’s attorney in 2019, spoke of her time in that office, which ended with a conviction Tuesday in the disappearance and death of local teacher Mariame Toure Sylla in 2023 was an important case to her.
“What a way to end my tenure as state’s attorney,” Braveboy said.
She said she was humbled to have been elected to the office but said that, “in many ways, God elected me, too,” by placing her in a supportive and nurturing family.
Braveboy recognized previous county executives in the audience for their contributions to the county, including Jack Johnson — who was sentenced to seven years in prison on extortion charges related to development deals during his time as executive — Rushern Baker and Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), whose election last fall created the opening Braveboy is now filling. She also recognized interim Executive Tara Jackson, who moved into Braveboy’s position as county state’s attorney after Braveboy was electect executive.
She promised a “unified county government,” calling out several of the council members in attendance, and promised to hold regular town halls as part of a government that is “open, transparent and will ask for your ideas.”

In her half-hour address, Braveboy presented a vision for the county that was long on optimism, but short on details.
One concrete goal is to clean up the county’s roadways, because, “We have to make sure that our roadways are as beautiful as the people in this room.” Improving the county’s presentation would also help the county become “more competitive” when it comes to attracting business and development, she said.
On that front, she said the county won the competition to be the future home of the FBI headquarters — somehting President Donald Trump has threatened to halt — “fair and square” but that the county “can wait them out” at the federal level.
Braveboy also spoke of the need to purchase more from county businesses, promising to ease the process for county companies that do business with the federal government but cannot get a foot in the door for county government or county schools contracts.
Braveboy was active even before her swearing-in, naming a new chief administrative office, an interim schools superintendent, a new police chief and a new public safety director. Over the next few weeks, Braveboy said, she plans to roll out more appointments at both the entry level and senior level, and directed people who want to work with the county, whether at a high level or an entry level, to follow the “career seeker” link on her website, www.aishabraveboy.com/transition.
“I see a future filled with promise, filled with prosperity and filled with love,” Braveboy said. “My job as a county executive is to ensure that everyone feels that feeling each and every day.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC07867-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-20 08:05:01.892770

(Photo courtesy Governor's Office)The Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland renewed its call Thursday for a commission to study reparations, even as Gov. Wes Moore unveiled a series of measures that he said would close the racial wealth gap that is a legacy of past discrimination.
It’s the latest in a debate that began with Moore’s May 16 veto of Senate Bill 587, which called for creation of a commission to study the effects of historic racism on Black residents of the state today and to recommend “appropriate benefits” ranging from an official apology to monetary benefits.
“While the steps announced today are important, they do not replace the need for reparations,” said a prepared statement from the caucus. “Addressing the racial wealth gap, health disparities, our unequal justice system, housing access, and education outcomes requires a comprehensive approach—and reparations must be central to that effort.
In his veto message, Moore said there have been many studies on historic racial inequities and that this was not the time for another study, but for action.
Lawmakers confident they can override Moore’s veto, reinstate Reparations Commission bill

He pointed to efforts under his administration to increase the amount of state business for Black-owned businesses, boost funding for historically Black colleges and universities, expand home ownership and expunge cannabis conviction records, which disproportionately affected Black residents.
Those themes were repeated Thursday, Juneteenth, when Moore traveled to the Bethel AME Church in Cambridge to tout his administration’s accomplishments and announce an expansion of cannabis commutations and the start of the new “Just Communities” program.
Moore, according to a text of his speech, said the program aims to help atone for “placed-based policies of the past like historic redlining and mass incarceration and the urban renewal of the ’80s and ’90s and unfair appraisal values – which have been some of the greatest wealth thefts in American history.”
The Just Communities program gives priority for state investment to communities that can show they have been impacted by racial segregation, state or federal redevelopment programs that seized private homes, high rates of incarceration or exposure to environmental or health hazards.
Moore identified the first 419 such communities, in 16 counties and Baltimore City, that will be eligible for $400 million in funding for communities that have been “historically impacted by exclusionary policies.”
The governor also announced an additional 6,938 pardons for conviction of simple cannabis possession — on top of the nearly 170,000 pardons he issued for the crime last year. The new cases were discovered by court officials as they continue to pore through records.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Moore said racial inequality, through restrictive policies and denied opportunities, has coat the economy $16 trillion in the last two decades, and he repeated his call to action.
“We have a remarkable lineage of scholarship on this issue. We have more data now than ever before on this topic,” Moore said. “The work of repair doesn’t require more analysis. Because we cannot afford to simply “meet” about the situation before us… and delay progress… “We need action, and we cannot wait.”
The caucus statement said it “applauds Governor Wes Moore’s announcement today and his continued commitment to improving the lives of Black Marylanders,” and said it has been a proud partner in many of hte efforts cited by Moore.
The caucus, which has vowed to override Moore’s veto of the reparations bill, said it will continue working with the governor on that progress. But is said that the progress needs to include a reparations  commission.
“As we celebrate Freedom Day and reflect on meaningful progress, we remain focused on our unfinished work—particularly the creation of the Maryland Reparations Commission … the first-ever state action on reparations in Maryland,” the statement said. “It is a historic and necessary step toward repair and true equity.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/unnamed-7-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-06-20 10:06:43.702314

(Photo courtesy of Make the Road Nevada)In Assemblymember Cinthia Zermeño Moore’s North Las Vegas district the largest source of continuous turf and trees is a private golf course, the rest of her district is largely characterized by super heating concrete and asphalt.
During her campaign to be elected last year, Moore said she walked from door to door and heard story after story of residents who have been impacted by extreme heat and the lack of adaptation strategies in the state.
East Washington Avenue, which runs through Moore’s District 11, is an example of that lack of heat adaptation strategies, said Moore. Several bus stops along the route aren’t covered by any form of shade despite the city’s routine triple digit temperatures, while 20% of the district’s population depends on public transportation or walking.
Moore said there are several strategies local governments could take to help the public adapt to extreme heat, including extending operating hours for cooling stations, planting trees and installing water fountains along bus routes, and banning utility shuttoffs in the summer.
This year, Moore sponsored a bill to restrict utilities’ ability to shut off power due to nonpayment during extreme weather months. It would also require utilities to create payment plans for struggling customers who can’t make full payments.
The measure, Assembly Bill 456, didn’t get a hearing.
“One of the biggest expenses for people is rent, followed by utilities in the summertime. I was taken back by what I was hearing. At doors people were saying that they couldn’t pay their utility bill,” Moore said at an environmental justice panel organized by Make the Road Nevada, Chispa Nevada, and the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition.
“The utilities are aware that I plan on bringing this back next session. It’s something that I’m going to be working on during the interim, and it is something that is needed in Nevada,” she continued.
Advocacy groups organized the Wednesday panel for “National Heat Week” to advocate for protections for workers exposed to extreme heat conditions.
Organizers celebrated several legislative victories this session, and also mourned legislative losses, like AB 456 the utility shuttoff bill. 
Nevada Gov. Joe Lombardo did sign several environmental justice bills pushed by Make the Road Nevada, Chispa Nevada, the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition, and other conservation groups.
One of those measures was Assembly Bill 96, which requires the state’s two most populous counties to actively address extreme heat through urban planning strategies, like creating public cooling spaces, public water access, cool building practices, and shaded areas in their development plans.
An environmental justice bill focused on worker protections also made the cut. Senate Bill 260 mandates Nevada OSHA to create regulations with clear protocols and employer responsibilities when wildfire smoke degrades air quality. The agency will have until next year to propose those regulations.
Jackie Spicer, the coordinator for the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition, said once implemented Nevada will be one of the first states with OSHA regulations for wildfire smoke.
“We know in Nevada that wildfires are becoming more frequent, more severe and lasting longer due to hotter temperatures and the dry climate that we have in the West,” said Spicer.
“We now know it’s no longer appropriate to be sending people outside to be exposed to the toxic wildfire smoke,” she continued. 
Nevada is also one of few states with worker protection for extreme heat after Nevada OSHA implemented regulations in April. The regulations require employers to create a written plan that provides workers with portable water, rest breaks, and a way to cool down during extreme heat.
Spicer said those regulations are an improvement compared to what Nevada had a year ago. But those regulations are limited and overly vague, giving employers a lot of wiggle room. 
Nevada OSHA also has a limited number of case agents responsible for monitoring and reviewing worksites for extreme heat hazards, said Spicer.
“In Nevada we only have 40 OSHA inspectors statewide that are meant to cover every industry and every employer,” Spicer said. 
“We’ll see whether or not these regulations are actually working and making a difference, or if there’s anything that we can do to improve,” Moore added.
Advocates emphasized the need for local government action and community mobilization to address extreme heat and wildfire smoke impacts, particularly on frontline communities and low-income workers.
“These issues have real impacts, and people feel them, and cannot afford to maintain the status quo, and we have to be taking as much action and change as possible to improve people’s lives so that we can continue to live here in the long term,” Spicer said.
Yanci Hill, a member of Chispa Nevada, described an event last year when a faulty air conditioner left her and her family in triple digit temperatures for a week. Cooling centers in the area didn’t allow them to bring their dogs and closed by 5 p.m.
“We had to put one of the dogs down because he had liver disease and couldn’t take the extreme heat,” Hill said in her native Spanish. “It was so painful. She was the one that slept with me and was with me all the time.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC00342-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-06-20 08:05:01.892770

SPRINGFIELD — Immigration rights advocates in Illinois are anxiously awaiting the governor’s signature on legislation aimed at protecting K-12 students who may be in the country without legal authorization from being denied access to a free public education.

House Bill 3247, known as the “Safe Schools for All Act,” passed both chambers of the General Assembly in the final days of the spring session. It would prohibit schools from denying any child access to a free public education based on their actual or perceived immigration status, or that of their parents.

It would also prohibit schools from disclosing, or threatening to disclose, information about a student’s immigration status or the status of a person associated with the child. And it would require schools to develop procedures for reviewing and authorizing requests from law enforcement agents attempting to enter a school or school facility.

The bill is intended to buffer K-12 students in Illinois from efforts by the Trump administration to launch mass deportations of noncitizens living in the United States without legal authorization.

Speaking at a May 7 rally outside the Statehouse, where Democratic lawmakers and immigration rights advocates protested an appearance in Springfield that day of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, state Sen. Karina Villa, D-West Chicago, the chief Senate sponsor of the bill, vowed that Illinois would remain defiant of Trump’s political agenda.

“We are also going to protect our children,” she told the crowd gathered around a statue of Abraham Lincoln. “We’re going to make them feel safe in our schools by passing HB 3247. We are going to unite and we are going to get that done.”

On Jan. 20, the first day of the new administration, the Department of Homeland Security rescinded a Biden-era policy that prevented federal agents from conducting immigration enforcement actions in certain “sensitive” areas, including schools, churches and hospitals.

Fred Tsao, an attorney for the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, said during an interview that the policy change has had a chilling effect on the immigrant community, making many afraid to even show up in school.

“We have seen a decline in student participation, particularly among heavily Latino schools after this inauguration,” he said. “So we want to make sure that schools are prepared in the events that federal agents, or for that matter other law enforcement, come to their door in a nonemergency situation.”

Tsao said advocates have also been concerned about possible changes in other legal protections for immigrant students that so far have only been expressed in judicial opinions.

In 1982, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Texas statute that authorized local school districts to either deny enrollment to children who had not been “legally admitted” to the United States, or to charge them tuition, holding the law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th amendment.

Tsao, however, said there have been attempts in other state legislatures, including earlier this year in Tennessee, to pass legislation that would challenge that 43-year-old ruling. And while the effort in the Tennessee legislature fell short this year, he said advocates in Illinois wanted to act now to make sure the rights of immigrant students are protected in state law, should the Supreme Court precedent ever be overturned.

“Fortunately, our counterparts in Tennessee, the immigrant advocacy organizations and community leaders, bombarded the General Assembly with advocacy work and were able to persuade a number of legislators to vote against this legislation when it came down to it,” he said. “But you know, that's not to say that folks in Tennessee or folks in other states won't try again.”

As of Wednesday, June 18, HB 3247 had not yet been sent to Gov. JB Pritzker.
