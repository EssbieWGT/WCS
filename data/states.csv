California Democrats’ redistricting plan would split the state’s traditional Republican stronghold into a sprawling coastal district with Bay Area liberals. North State conservatives say it would silence rural voices.


Over several rivers and through even more woods, flags advocating secession from California flutter above hills dotted with cattle, which outnumber people at least sixfold.
This ranching region with a libertarian streak might have more in common with Texas than the San Francisco Bay Area. 
But it’s not Texas. Five hours northeast of Sacramento on an easy day, Modoc County and its roughly 8,500 residents are still — begrudgingly — in California. 
And California is dominated by Democrats, who are embroiled in a tit-for-tat redistricting war with the Lone Star State that will likely force conservative Modoc County residents to share a representative in Congress with parts of the Bay Area. 
Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom is proposing to split up the solidly Republican 1st Congressional District covering 10 rural, inland counties in the North State as part of his plan to create five more Democratic seats to offset a GOP-led effort to gain five red seats in Texas. 
That would mean Republican Doug LaMalfa, the Richvale rice farmer who represents the district, would likely lose his seat. 
Modoc County and two neighboring red counties would be shifted into a redrawn district that stretches 200 miles west to the Pacific Coast and then south, through redwoods and weed farms, to include some of the state’s wealthiest communities, current Democratic Rep. Jared Huffman’s home in San Rafael and the northern end of the Golden Gate Bridge, all in uber-liberal Marin County. 
“It’s like a smack in the face,” said local rancher Amie Martinez. “How could you put Marin County with Modoc County? It’s just a different perspective.”

The proposal would even likely force Modoc residents to share a district with the governor, who moved back to Marin County last year and splits his time between there and Sacramento. Modoc County voted 78% in favor of recalling him, and voters asked about redistricting there view it as a publicity stunt for Newsom’s presidential ambitions.
The ballot measure known as Proposition 50, on voters’ ballots Nov. 4, has sparked outrage in the North State. Yet for a region known for its rebellious spirit, residents are also resigned: they know they’re collateral damage in a partisan numbers game.
The map would dilute conservative voting power in one of the state’s traditional Republican strongholds. It would cut short the career growth of politicians from the state’s minority party and make room for the growing cadre of Democrats rising up from state and county seats, jockeying for bigger platforms.

But locals say they’re most concerned it’s a death-knell for rural representation. They worry their agricultural interests and their views on water, wildlife and forest management would be overshadowed in a district that includes Bay Area communities that have long championed environmental protection.
“They’ve taken every rural district and made it an urban district,” said Nadine Bailey, a former staffer for a Republican state senator who now advocates for agricultural water users and the rural North State. “It just feels like an assault on rural California.”
Though Modoc County supervisors have declared their opposition to Prop. 50, there’s little else locals can do. Registered Republicans are outnumbered by Democrats statewide nearly two-to-one. Rural residents represent an even smaller share of the state’s electorate. 
“It’ll be very hard to fight back,” said Tim Babcock, owner of a general store in Lassen County, a similar and neighboring community that’s proposed to be drawn into a different liberal-leaning congressional district. “Unless we split the state. And that’s never going to happen.”
An isolated county
Far-flung but tight-knit, the high desert of Modoc County has been an agricultural community for generations. 
In the west, cattle graze through a series of meadows and valleys into the hills of the Warner Mountains. Hundreds of them are sold weekly at an auction yard Martinez’s family runs on the outskirts of Alturas. The 3,000-person county seat consists of a cluster of government buildings, a high school and empty storefronts. In the east, migratory birds soar over vegetable farms on the drained Tule Lake bed that the U.S. granted to World War II veteran homesteaders by picking names out of a pickle jar. Not far away sit the remains of an internment camp where the government imprisoned nearly 19,000 Japanese Americans. 
The sheer remoteness and harsh natural beauty are a point of pride and a source of difficulty. Residents live with the regular threat of wildfires. A fifth of the county’s residents live below the poverty line. There’s no WalMart and no maternity ward, and there are few jobs outside of agriculture. Like other forested counties, local schools are facing a fiscal cliff after Congress failed to renew a source of federal funding reserved for areas with declining timber revenues.

It’s so sparsely populated that local Republican Assemblymember Heather Hadwick, who lives in Modoc County, represents 10 neighboring counties besides her own. She puts in hundreds of miles on the road holding town halls between Sacramento and home, and struggles to imagine a congressmember reaching her county, with winding roads and the Klamath Mountains between Modoc and the coast.
“It’s just not good governance,” she said.
Modoc County went for Trump by over 70% last fall. Its sheriff, Tex Dowdy, proudly refuses to fly the California flag over his station out of grievance with the state’s liberal governance. In 2013, Modoc made headlines for declaring its intent to secede from California and form the “State of Jefferson” with neighboring counties in the North State and southwest Oregon.
County Supervisor Geri Byrne said she knew it was a longshot — but thought, “when’s the last time The New York Times called someone in Modoc County?”
Byrne, who is also chair of the Rural County Representatives of California and of the upcoming National Sheepdog Finals, said the secession resolution was about sending a message.
“It wasn’t conservative-liberal,” she said. “It was the urban-rural divide, and that’s what this whole Prop. 50 is about.”
Even a Democratic resident running a produce pickup center in Alturas observed that her neighbors are “not that Trumpy.” Instead, there’s a pervasive general distrust of politics on any side of the aisle.
In particular, residents who live by swaths of national forests bemoan how successive federal administrations of both parties have flip-flopped on how to manage public lands, which they say have worsened the risk of wildfire and prioritized conservation over their livelihoods.
Flourishing wolves are a problem
At the moment, all anyone can talk about is the wolves. 
The apex predator returned to California more than a decade ago, a celebrated conservation success story after they were hunted to near-extinction in the western U.S. Now they’re flourishing in the North State — and feeding on cattle, throwing ranching communities on edge. Federally, they’re still listed as an endangered species under the landmark conservation law signed by President Richard Nixon. 
Under California rules, ranchers can only use nonlethal methods to deter the wolves, like electrifying fencing or hiring ranch hands to guard their herds at night.

“That whole issue is softened by the organizations that mean well for the animals, but this is our absolute existence here,” said Teri Brown, owner of a local feed store, who said she’s had cows go missing that she suspects were killed by wolves. 
It’s one of the rural issues Brown, a registered Republican, said voters closer to the Bay Area wouldn’t understand. She said she doesn’t support gerrymandering anywhere — in Texas or California. 
In town to visit his bookkeeper, rancher Ray Anklin scrolled through his phone to show videos of wolves trotting through his property and grisly photos of calf kills. He said last year, wildlife killed 19 of his cattle — a loss of over $3,000 per head. He’s set up a booth at a nearby fair, hoping to get public support for delisting wolves as an endangered species, and wants any representative in Congress to take the issue seriously.
As California’s battlegrounds increasingly take shape in exurban and suburban districts, rural North State conservatives at times feel almost as out of touch with their fellow Republicans as they do with Democrats. 
Few Republicans in the state and nation understand “public lands districts,” said Modoc County Supervisor Shane Starr, a Republican who used to work in LaMalfa’s office. “Doug’s the closest thing we’ve got.”

“This whole thing with DEI and ‘woke culture’ and stuff,” he said, referring to the diversity and inclusion efforts under attack from the right, “it’s like, yeah, we had a kid who goes to the high school who dyed his hair a certain color. Cool, we don’t care. All of these things going on at the national stage are not based in our reality whatsoever.”
At a cattlemen’s dinner in Alturas one recent evening, Martinez said she once ran into LaMalfa at a local barbecue fundraiser for firefighters and approached him about a proposal to designate parts of northwestern Nevada as protected federal wilderness. Her 700-person town of Cedarville in east Modoc County is 10 minutes from the state line.
Martinez worried about rules that prohibit driving motorized vehicles in wilderness, which she said would discourage the hunters who pass through during deer season and book lodging in town. Even though the proposal was in Nevada, LaMalfa sent staff, including Starr, to meetings to raise objections on behalf of the small town, she said. 
“I know we won’t get that kind of representation from Marin County,” she said.
Reached by phone, Huffman defended his qualifications to represent the region. 
Adding Siskiyou, Shasta and Modoc counties would mean many more hours of travel to meet constituents, but Huffman pointed out his district is already huge, covering 350 miles of the North Coast. And it includes many conservative-leaning, forested areas in Trinity and Del Norte counties. A former attorney for the environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council, he’s the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, where LaMalfa also sits.

Huffman said he would run for re-election in the district if voters approve its redrawing, and “would work my tail off to give them great representation.”
As for the wolves, he doesn’t support delisting their endangered status and said he only supports nonlethal methods of managing the population. 
“There are plenty of win-win solutions,” he said of conflict between ranchers and environmentalists. “I’m not an absolutist. I’m a problem solver.”
For Democrats, ‘I don’t think there’s any option’
On the other side of the aisle, North State Democrats are gearing up to support Prop. 50, even as parts of it make them uneasy. 
Nancy Richardson, an office manager at the free weekly paper in Modoc County (coverage of high school sports remains steady, along with a police blotter announcing a woman’s booking for eavesdropping), said she doesn’t like that it will cost the state as much as $280 million to run the statewide election on redistricting. 
But she thinks it has to be done. 
“I don’t like that Texas is causing this problem,” she said.
In Siskiyou County’s liberal enclave of Mt. Shasta, Greg Dinger said he supports the redistricting plan because he wants to fight back against the Trump administration’s targeting of immigrants, erosion of democratic norms and a federal budget that is estimated to cut $28 billion from health care in California over the next 10 years. 
The effects are expected to be particularly acute in struggling rural hospitals, which disproportionately rely on Medicare and Medicaid funding. LaMalfa voted for the budget bill.
Dinger, who owns a web development company, said normally he would only support bipartisan redistricting. But he was swayed by the fact that Trump had called for Republicans to draw more GOP seats in Texas. 
“Under the circumstances, I don’t think there’s any option,” he said. “There’s the phrase that came from Michelle Obama, ‘When they go low, we go high.’ Well, that doesn’t work anymore.”
In an interview, LaMalfa said the impacts to rural hospitals were exaggerated. He blamed impending Medicaid cuts instead on California’s health care system being billions of dollars over budget this year, in part because of rising pharmaceutical costs and higher-than-expected enrollment of undocumented immigrants who recently became eligible. (California doesn’t use federal dollars to pay for undocumented immigrants’ coverage.)
“Basically what it boils down to is they want illegal immigrants to be getting these benefits,” he said in response to criticism of the spending bill. “Are the other 49 states supposed to pay for that?”
LaMalfa has criticized Prop. 50 and said no state should engage in partisan redistricting in the middle of the decade. But he stopped short of endorsing his Republican colleague Rep. Kevin Kiley’s bill in Congress to ban it nationwide, saying states should still retain their rights to run their own elections systems. 
The proposed new maps would make Kiley’s Republican-leaning district blue. They would turn LaMalfa’s 1st District into a dramatically more liberal one that stretches into Santa Rosa. 
But LaMalfa said he’s leaning toward running for re-election even if the maps pass, though he’s focused for now on campaigning against the proposition. 
“I intend to give it my all no matter what the district is,” he said. 
He would likely face Audrey Denney, a Chico State professor and two-time prior Democratic challenger who has already said she’d run again if the maps pass. Outgoing state Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire, a Healdsburg Democrat who was instrumental in coming up with the proposed new maps, is also reportedly interested in the seat; McGuire’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
In her renovated Queen Anne cottage in downtown Chico, Denney buzzed with excitement describing how the proposition has galvanized rural Democrats. 
She emphasized her own family’s roots as ranchers in the Central Coast region, and said she has bipartisan relationships across the North State.

“I have credibility in those spaces, growing up in rural America and spending my career advocating for rural America and real, actual, practical solutions for people,” she said. 
Denney’s former campaign staffer Rylee Pedotti, a Democrat in Modoc County, shares her optimism — to an extent. A communications professional whose family also owns a ranch, she said she’s not worried Huffman couldn’t represent Modoc. 
“More often than not we actually do experience some of the same issues,” Pedotti said: water and irrigation concerns, the loss of home insurance, the rising costs of health care.
Yet she’s deeply conflicted about the proposal: on the one hand cheering Democrats for being “finally ready to play hardball as the Republicans have done so well for decades in consolidating power;” on the other fearful of the escalating partisan rancor and the disenfranchisement of her neighbors. She’s considering sitting out the election.
“We’ll still be heard,” she said, if the new maps pass. “But I understand the concerns of folks who are on the other side of the aisle. It feels like their voice is being taken away.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090425-Redistricting-Modoc-County-MG-CM-43.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-18 08:59:01.866958
,California,2025-09-18 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,‘These are not normal times’: Why Alex Padilla changed his tune on nonpartisan redistricting,Jim Newton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/alex-padilla-congress-midterm-redistricting/,"Sen. Alex Padilla says ""there's too much at stake"" for Democrats to remain idle in a political arms race between red and blue states. Meanwhile, he plans to introduce legislation that would establish independent redistricting commissions in every state.","As a United States senator, Alex Padilla does not have much personally at stake in the congressional redistricting skirmish now sweeping through Texas, California and potentially other parts of the union. He represents a whole state, the nation’s most populous, so district boundaries do not affect his electorate.
But Padilla, a quietly influential member of his party and of the Senate, is invested in the struggle for power and advantage underway in Washington. He is a committed critic of President Donald Trump. Padilla’s attempts to stand up for the immigrants who undergird the life and culture of California crested in a memorable confrontation earlier this year when he showed up at a news conference hosted by Homeland Security secretary Kristi Noem, only to be wrestled to the ground by federal officers.
The incident was captured on video and stands as one of the hallmark moments of the Trump regime’s dubious resort to force as it stampedes through American cities, rounding up people who look Latino and shipping them off to faraway lands. 
Padilla has supported independent redistricting commissions in the past and backed the current structure in California, which was built to minimize partisanship in the business of drawing lines for members of Congress and others. But now, as Trump and his allies work to game the nation’s politics, Padilla is a supporter of California’s proposed response.
He is backing Proposition 50, which will appear on a special election ballot in November and would redraw California’s congressional maps to give Democrats the advantage in five more races. That’s a direct response to Texas, which, under instructions from Trump, has approved new maps that draw five seats in that state with Republican majorities.
This is politics, not math, so none of these schemes are foolproof. Even if the new maps go into effect, actual candidates need to run and win, and voters have a way of foiling the best-laid plans. But tilting majorities is intended to shape the field for the party doing the drawing.
In “normal times,” Padilla told me this week when we met in his Capitol Hill hideaway off the Senate floor, he would support nonpartisan commissions and that redistricting take place once every 10 years, in conjunction with the census. “But these are not normal times. There’s too much at stake.”
For Padilla, this is about more than voting systems or niceties. It’s about climate change, immigration, access to health care — the full panoply of assaults that the Trump administration has waged and that it intends to sustain by holding the House of Representatives in the midterms. It’s a goal so important that the administration has made clear it’s willing to cheat to achieve it.
Notably, Padilla said, the administration is not attempting to do that by trumpeting its record since taking office in January. Trump and his allies enjoy a rare moment of dominance in the nation’s life, holding the presidency, both houses of Congress and, in effect, the Supreme Court, which has regularly avoided direct confrontations with the president by giving him what he wants — even when it stretches logic and constitutional norms, as it did on abortion and presidential immunities.
The administration could run on its record, Padilla said, but that record is, by every measure, deeply unpopular. Most voters object to the substance of Trump’s signature legislative achievement, his so-called Big Beautiful Bill, with its cuts to medical and health services in order to pay for tax cuts for the very wealthy.
And voters also have registered their discomfort with Trump’s militarized sweeps through American cities, starting with Los Angeles, in order to deport gardeners and nannies and other working men and women under the guise of targeting dangerous criminals. As of this week, 39% of voters say they approve of Trump’s job performance, compared to 57% who disapprove, the lowest point of his presidency. And Trump’s support from Latinos, which surprised many analysts during the election, is falling. 
That leaves Trump and his allies in a quandary, Padilla argued.
“The only hope they have to stay in power after the midterms is to rig them,” he said.
That has touched off the rush to redistrict, first by Texas and then by others. Padilla said he’s convinced that the push would not have stopped with Texas, and that necessitated California’s response. In any case, he said, it’s required if liberal states have any hope of holding their own against conservative line-drawing.
Underscoring that point, the senator is today introducing a new bill, the Redistricting Reform Act of 2025. It would bar states from redistricting mid-decade unless ordered by a court, and it would require states to create an independent redistricting commission to supervise the drawing of congressional lines. That would end the arms race now underway, but it will surely draw opposition — let alone go anywhere in a Republican-controlled Congress — since it would strip redistricting away from legislatures and governors eager to use it to gerrymander lines.
It was the immigration roundups that prompted Padilla to show up unannounced at Noem’s June press conference in Los Angeles. When he tried to ask a question, FBI agents tackled him to the ground. She claimed to have felt threatened by him, but video recordings of the incident make clear he never got close. He is a United States senator after all, asking a question of a cabinet officer, for which he was manhandled and detained.
Dismissing the incident a few days later, Vice President J.D. Vance referred to the senator as “Jose” Padilla, a remark that could only be heard as a racial slur. I’ve known Padilla a long time, since his days as a Los Angeles City Council member. It’s clear how much the confrontation with Noem and the disrespect by Vance affected him.
And so the partisanship, the invective, the smuggery that Trump has brought to the White House continues to erode efforts at moderation. Now it forces Democrats, including Padilla, into an uncomfortable position: Do they stand by nonpartisan districting commissions and let Trump rig the system in Texas and elsewhere, or do they stoop to his level and jimmy districts in the states that they control?
I suggested to Padilla that the old maxim “two wrongs don’t make a right” might be appropriate here. He politely disagreed.
“Two wrongs don’t necessarily make a right,” he acknowledged, “but in this case, one wrong could be disastrous.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/081425_Redistricting-Rally_TS_CM_14.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-18 08:59:01.866958

What happened?,Carolyn Jones,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/k-12-education/2025/09/ethnic-studies-california/,"The ethnic studies class was meant to focus on the cultures and histories of African-Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans and Latinos. The state’s curriculum also encourages schools to add additional lessons based on their student populations, such as Hmong or Armenian.","In summary
The ethnic studies class was meant to focus on the cultures and histories of African-Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans and Latinos. The state’s curriculum also encourages schools to add additional lessons based on their student populations, such as Hmong or Armenian. 


This fall, every high school in California was supposed to offer ethnic studies — a one-semester class focused on the struggles and triumphs of marginalized communities. 
But the class appears stalled, at least for now, after the state budget omitted funding for it and the increasingly polarized political climate dampened some districts’ appetite for anything that hints at controversy.
“Right now, it’s a mixed bag. Some school districts have already implemented the course, and some school districts are using the current circumstances as a rationale not to move forward,” said Albert Camarillo, a Stanford history professor and founder of the university’s Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity. “But I’m hopeful. This fight has been going on for a long time.”
California passed the ethnic studies mandate in 2021, following years of debate and fine-tuning of curriculum. The class was meant to focus on the cultures and histories of African Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans and Latinos, all of whom have faced oppression in California. The state’s curriculum also encourages schools to add additional lessons based on their student populations, such as Hmong or Armenian. 
The course would have been required for high school graduation, beginning with the Class of 2030. 
But the state never allotted money for the course, which meant the mandate hasn’t gone into effect. The Senate Appropriations Committee estimated that the cost to hire and train teachers and purchase textbooks and other materials would be $276 million. Some school districts have used their own money to train teachers and have started offering the class anyway.
Accusations of antisemitism
Meanwhile, fights have erupted across the state over who and who isn’t included in the curriculum. Some ethnic studies teachers incorporated lessons on the Gaza conflict and made other changes put forth by a group of educators and activists called the Liberated Ethnic Studies Model Curriculum Consortium. That’s led to accusations of antisemitism in dozens of school districts.
Antisemitism has been on the rise generally in California, not just in schools. Statewide, anti-Jewish hate crime rose 7.3% last year, according to the California Department of Justice. In Los Angeles County, hate crimes — including slurs— against Jewish people rose 91% last year, to the highest number ever recorded, according to the county’s Commission on Human Relations.
Those numbers in part prompted a pair of legislators to propose a bill addressing antisemitism in California public schools. Assembly Bill 715, which is now headed to Gov. Gavin Newsom, would beef up the discrimination complaint process in schools and create a statewide antisemitism coordinator to ensure schools comply. Another bill, which died, would have directly addressed antisemitism in ethnic studies classes by placing restrictions on curriculum.
‘On life support’
But the delays and public controversies have taken a toll. No one has tracked how many schools offer ethnic studies, or how many require it, but some say the momentum is lost.
“It’s already on life support and this could be one more arrow,” said Tab Berg, a political consultant based in the Sacramento area. 
Berg has been a critic of ethnic studies, saying it’s divisive. A better way to encourage cultural understanding is to eliminate segregation in schools and ensure the existing social studies curriculum is comprehensive and accurate, he said. “We should absolutely find ways to help students appreciate and understand other cultures. But not in a way that leads to further polarization of the school community.”
Carol Kocivar, former head of the state PTA and a San Francisco-based education writer, also thinks the class may be stalled indefinitely.
 “I think the people who supported ethnic studies didn’t realize they were opening a can of worms,” Kocivar said. “Until there’s an agreement on the ideological guardrails, I just don’t see it moving forward on a broad scale.”
Kocivar supports the ethnic studies curriculum generally, but thinks it should be woven into existing classes like English, history and foreign language. That would leave room in students’ schedules for electives while still ensuring they learn the histories of marginalized communities.
Schools moving ahead 
In Orange County, nearly all high schools are offering ethnic studies as a stand-alone elective course or paired with a required class like English or history. Teachers use curriculum written by their districts with public input, drawn from the state’s recommended curriculum. They also have the option of adding lessons on Vietnamese, Hmong or Cambodian culture, reflecting the county’s ethnic makeup.
“The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive,” said Marika Manos, manager of history and social science for the Orange County Department of Education. “Students see themselves in the curriculum and in the broader story of America. … It’s a wonderful opportunity for them to get some joy in their day.”
A handful of districts are waiting to see if the state authorizes funding, but the rest have found their own money to hire and train teachers and purchase materials. There was some pushback against Santa Ana Unified when two Jewish civil rights groups sued, claiming the district’s ethnic studies courses contained antisemetic material. The district settled earlier this year and changed the course curriculum.
Polarized political climate
Camarillo, the Stanford professor, said the national political climate “no question” has had a significant effect on the ethnic studies rollout. Parents might have genuine concerns about what’s being taught, “but we’re also seeing the impact of extremist groups that are fomenting distrust in our schools.”
He pointed to book bans, attacks on “woke” curriculum and other so-called culture war issues playing out in schools nationwide. 
But the fight over ethnic studies has been going on for decades, since the first student activists pushed for the course at San Francisco State in the 1960s, and he’s hopeful that the current obstacles, especially the fights over antisemitism, will eventually resolve.
“I hate to see what’s happening but I think there’s hope for a resolution,” he said. “Ethnic studies can help us understand and appreciate each other, communicate, make connections. I’ve seen it play out in the classroom and it’s a beautiful thing.”
‘A really special class’
In Oakland, Summer Johnson has been teaching ethnic studies for three years at Arise High School, a charter school in the Fruitvale district. She uses a combination of liberated ethnic studies and other curricula and her own lesson plans. 
She covers topics like identity, stereotypes and bias; oppression and resistance; and cultural assets, or “the beautiful things in your community,” she said. They also learn the origins of the class itself, starting with the fight for ethnic studies at San Francisco State.
Students read articles and write papers, conduct research, do art projects and give oral presentations, discuss issues and take field trips. She pushes the students to “ask questions, be curious, have the tough conversations. This is the place for that.”
She’s had no complaints from parents, but sometimes at the beginning of the semester, students question the value of the class. 
“When that happens, we have a discussion,” Johnson said. “By the end of the class, students learn about themselves and their classmates and learn to express their opinions. Overall students respond really well.”
Johnson, who has a social studies teaching credential, sought out training to teach ethnic studies and feels that’s critical for the course to be successful. Teachers need to know the material, but they also need to know how to facilitate sensitive conversations and encourage students to open up to their peers.
“It’s a really special class. I’d love to see it expand to all schools,” Johnson said. “The purpose is for students to have empathy for each other and knowledge of themselves and their communities. And that’s important.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/032823_EthnicStudies_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-18 08:59:01.866958

As is common practice, the PUC asked an administrative law judge to hold a contested case hearing, where advocates argued the sale’s pros and cons. In the end, The administrative law judge wrote a report to the PUC with findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations. 
Administrative Law Judge Megan McKenzie’s conclusion could not be clearer. The sale: “would result in net harm to the public interest.”
Will the PUC listen?
The PUC is charged with improving “the lives of all Minnesotans by ensuring safe, reliable, and sustainable utility services at just and reasonable rates.” And yet, it has not always shown an interest or ability to stand up to incumbent utilities or large corporations. It approved construction of Enbridge’s Line 3 crude oil pipeline in 2018 over the objections of state experts who were specifically involved to represent the public interest.
BlackRock’s financial and political power dwarfs Enbridge. Its $11.5 trillion in assets “exceed the GDP of every nation except the United States and China,” according to the Citizens Utility Board of Minnesota, known as CUB. If there ever was a company that was too big to regulate, BlackRock would be it.
BlackRock and CPP are willing to pay well above market value. Allete accepted their $67 per share offer, McKenzie’s report said. It was $1.5 billion more than Allete’s book value, or 22% above its share price prior to the sale’s announcement. Allete’s shareholders, not ratepayers, would get all the financial windfall. 
Allete and BlackRock have very different business models. Allete is a publicly-traded company “focused on energy and utility service,” said ALJ McKenzie. BlackRock is a global asset manager. It’s in the business of making money for its large, private investors.
Private equity firms “are not in the business of providing safe, reliable, and affordable electric service to northern Minnesotans” McKenzie wrote. “Private equity firms often target gross investment returns of 15 to 20% per year.”
The alleged benefits of the sale are not backed up 
Of particular concern, Allete and its potential buyers have made claims about the sale’s benefits that are at odds with the facts.
The public has no way to assess corporate claims. Important information was redacted from the public record because it was deemed confidential trade secret information. However, McKenzie, the administrative law judge, had access to the redacted information.
In spite of Allete and BlackRock’s claims that Minnesota Power customers would not suffer excessive rate hikes, McKenzie concluded that the buyers “are planning on significant rate increases.” The sale “creates an unacceptable risk of rate increase and rate shock in a critical and economically vulnerable area of Minnesota.”
Allete said access to new capital was a “primary benefit” from the sale, the administrative law judge wrote. However, the buyers “have not, in fact, promised to provide capital to Allete. Allete did not even ask for some commitment to provide equity. ”
Allete cited BlackRock’s “expertise” on utility infrastructure and renewable energy as a benefit. The administrative law judge disagreed, saying the buyers’ expertise “is unlikely to provide a material benefit to Minnesota Power or its ratepayers. Allete already has quality management and ‘near perfect’ reliability for its electric service.”
Allete has stated the sale will benefit Minnesota because the new partners “were intentionally and strategically chosen” to achieve Minnesota’s carbon-free goals. However, “the evidence shows the Partners were ultimately the only bidders for the company and were chosen based on their willingness to pay a stock premium” ALJ McKenzie wrote. 
BlackRock’s commitment to carbon-free goals is murky at best. “The nonpublic evidence reveals the buyers’ intent [is] to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”
BlackRock’s website says it pursues ethical investments, prioritizing companies with strong environmental, social and/or corporate governance, known as ESG objectives.
CUB, a party to the contested case, has challenged that image: “BlackRock just left a coalition aimed at aligning the asset management industry with global climate goals, causing the coalition to suspend its activities,” it wrote. “Further, BlackRock oversees an enormous amount of shares in fossil fuel companies and has a history of opposing climate-related shareholder motions at these companies.”
Finally, ALJ McKenzie said the buyers had shown a “lack of cooperation” during the proceedings, raising trust issues and the risk they won’t be transparent if they buy Minnesota Power.
Should the PUC approve the sale in spite of the overwhelming evidence against it, it would be one more painful example of how large industries have captured our state’s regulatory system, making the agency’s purpose of “protecting the public interest” more of a slogan, not reality.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2165923397.jpg,,,2025-09-18 08:59:01.866958

Amsterdam, New York
Died July 28, 2025
Helena, Montana


After seven years of fighting to recover from severe spinal degeneration and paraplegia, Thomas Alan Yager died unexpectedly on July 28, 2025. Tom was born April 8, 1948 to Christopher Yager and Jeanne Salak Yager in Amsterdam, NY. He had four brothers: Douglas Lasher, Barrett Lasher, Micheal Yager, and Robert Kravis. Tom graduated in 1966 from WH Lynch High School in Amsterdam NY, and in 1970 from Syracuse University and SUNY College of Forestry. His father and uncle instilled a love of farming and deep satisfaction from growing and harvesting crops (when all went well). Tom was inspired throughout his life by his father, from whom he learned extensive mechanical and building skills, which he, in turn, passed on to his children (along with some rules about physics).
Tom lived his life as a father, a forester, a farmer, and a friend to all. He fathered 2 children with Karen Rounds Yager: Erik Yager and Kristen Yager. He married Janet Kennedy Mack in 1992, and was stepfather to Katherine Mack and Corey Mack. He was highly respected in the wood-products industry as he made improving the hardwood forests of Vermont and New York his life’s work. After graduation from college, he spent one year with International Paper Co. and then 50 years with The A. Johnson Co. of Bristol, VT as their Senior Forester.
Tom and Janet bred and raised Morgan horses, hay, and Christmas trees on their farm in Waltham, VT for 30 years before selling it and moving to the Helena area of Montana in 2021. Tom served on the Mt. Abraham School Board in Bristol for 15 years before moving to Waltham, where he served as Lister and delegate to the Addison County Regional Planning Commission for 18 years. Tom loved to play and watch basketball (Go SU!), hunt, fish, ride horses, work with his tractor, build stone walls, and to compete with their home-bred Morgans on the regional and national level with his wife and children.
Tom’s hard work and determination showed in everything he did, including his recovery from paraplegia. The day he died, he reached his goal of successfully walking 20 feet in the PT hallway at St. Peters Hospital without any walking aids. We know he was extremely grateful for the years of help and support he received from Dale Koch, Mary Beth Stevens, and his entire recovery team to reach his recovery goal, and was so grateful and appreciative of his friends and neighbors in Vermont and Montana. Tom is deeply loved and missed by his wife Janet of Clancy, MT; brother Bobby; children Erik (Jacki), Katherine, and Corey (Faye); six grandchildren Rachel (Jake), Samantha (Christian), Emma (Taylor), Ali, Emmett and Audrey; and great-grandson Roman.

(Courtesy of the Utah Office of Homeless Services)As the vision for a new, 1,300-bed homeless “campus” recently sited in northwest Salt Lake City begins to crystalize, a discussion in front of a panel of lawmakers this week showed that the state’s top homeless services leaders see it as a key component to the state’s response to President Donald Trump’s July controversial executive order titled “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets.” 
To do so, they’re proposing the campus not only include additional homeless shelter, but also hundreds more beds to expand the state’s capacity for involuntary civil commitment and drug addiction treatment. 
Under a yet-to-be-approved proposal drafted by Randy Shumway, chair of the Utah Homeless Services Board, the campus would include a “certified community behavioral health clinic” with 300 to 400 beds reserved for people who are civilly committed — or court ordered into mental health treatment. 
Shumway’s proposal also envisions the campus including a “secure residential placement facility that provides substance use disorder treatment as an alternative to jail,” where people would “receive care in a supervised environment where entry and exit are not voluntary.” He called it an “accountability center” during a presentation in front of the Health and Human Services Interim Committee on Tuesday.

“An individual would be sanctioned to go there. It would not be voluntary. They would be there for a period of probably 90 days with the opportunity to detox in order to get mental and behavioral health care, to get substance use disorder support, to get physical health care, and to be surrounded by a community that’s helping them in healing,” Shumway told the committee while presenting his proposal. 
Shumway’s proposal is his recommended action plan to align the state with Trump’s executive order — something he said he “wrote at the request” of the state’s top Republican leaders. He emphasized that it hasn’t been presented to or approved by the Utah Homeless Services Board, which is a powerful body that oversees the state’s homeless system and distributes funding to homeless providers. 
On July 29, five days after Trump’s executive order on homelessness, Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, Senate President Stuart Adams and Gov. Spencer Cox wrote a letter urging the Utah Homeless Services Board to act, including by accelerating “progress on a transformative, services-based homeless campus that prioritizes recovery, treatment, and long-term outcomes, not just emergency shelter.” 
Advocacy groups like the National Alliance to End Homelessness have condemned Trump’s executive order. They warn it imposes “a multitude of harmful, ineffective, and outdated policies and practices for addressing homelessness” while retreating from long-maintained federal “Housing First” strategies that prioritize federal funding to programs that provide immediate housing. 
They also worry it will also increase focus on “punishing” people experiencing homelessness by encouraging states and cities to more widely arrest people on the streets and expand their use of civil commitment to force people into mental health or drug addiction treatment. 
Trump executive order raises fear among advocates for people experiencing homlessness

Republican leaders of Utah, however, have warmly welcomed Trump’s executive order as aligned with their goal to make the state’s homeless system more “accountable” while emphasizing efforts to increase “public safety” on city streets. 
Cox, Schultz and Adams wrote that Trump’s executive order “aligns with the values and expectations that Utah has long championed, namely, that chronic homelessness is tied to mental illness, substance abuse, and the loss of human dignity.” They also wrote they “do not support ‘Housing First’ policies that lack accountability.”
“President Trump’s executive order reinforces what many of us in Utah have long understood: that effective solutions to homelessness require both accountability and support,” Cox, Schultz and Adams wrote, adding that the order “presents an opportunity to accelerate our efforts toward a more results-driven system that matches Utah’s guiding principles to end homelessness” that “emphasize comprehensive, wrap-around services anchored in real accountability and community-based support.”
They also directed the board to “ensure any funding requests are accompanied by a clear strategy that aligns with the President’s executive order, with a focus on reprioritizing existing resources.” 
Mental health, other services already underfunded
During Tuesday’s committee discussion, both a Democratic and Republican lawmaker pointed out that the state’s existing system, including mental health treatment, has long been underfunded. 
“I wonder if it’s not necessarily inefficiencies but underinvestment in the infrastructure that we do have,” said Rep. Jen Dailey-Provost, D-Salt Lake City. 
Dailey-Provost added that she’s “concerned” about building a homeless campus in a remote area of Salt Lake City that’s “far away from the services and infrastructure that we do have — that we’ve designated as not being successful, but not because the infrastructure isn’t correct but because we’ve underinvested in it.”
“If we’re going to be efficient, I want to make sure we’re having a really hard conversation about investing in infrastructure that we have built, that we know works if it’s properly invested in,” she said. 
Rep. Steve Eliason, R-Sandy — a lawmaker who has a long track record of passing legislation related to homelessness, mental health and civil commitment — also hearkened back to his comments in front of the Utah Homeless Services Board more than a year ago, when he warned the state has been facing a major shortage of mental health beds. 
That shortage remains acute today, and even if the state homeless campus is built to accommodate 300 or 400 more civil commitment beds, there would still be hundreds more lacking, barring a major expansion elsewhere in the system. 
Utah’s new homeless board is warned of major mental health bed shortage

“As of a few days ago we had 1,461 individuals in the state on civil commitment,” Eliason said, noting that about 220 of those are in the Utah State Hospital, plus “maybe several dozen” in other mental health facilities. 
“That probably leaves at least 1,000 people currently under civil commitment on the streets,” he said. “So while I don’t disagree that applying civil commitment is a critical tool, currently our system is completely overwhelmed where people that are on civil commitment are not, in the vast majority of cases, receiving inpatient services. So that’s something we have to work on.” 
Shumway, in response to Eliason’s comments, pointed to a line in his proposal that says the 300 to 400 civil commitment beds would be federally funded with reimbursed Medicaid dollars. He said “we’re in close collaboration” with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development on the proposal. 
“We’ve got to come to the rescue from a mental and behavioral health care standpoint,” Shumway said. 
Eliason said he “appreciated” Shumway’s comments, but “unfortunately if you look at the history of recent construction of psychiatric facilities in the state … inpatient beds are running about a million dollars a bed, just to be built to the standards that the federal government has required.” 
“So it’s a huge price tag,” Eliason said. 
Shumway’s proposal, however, said that under Trump’s executive order, “every federal housing, health and justice agency is instructed to link grants, waivers, and personnel to states that are investing in effective practices,” including opening “more in-patient psychiatric beds” and launching “jail-based competency-restoration units.”
But Senate Minority Leader Luz Escamilla, D-Salt Lake City — who was critical of the homeless campus being sited in west-side Salt Lake City — noted “there’s already a bunch of lawsuits” challenging Trump’s executive order. 
She urged Shumway to “engage with everyone” in the Legislature while formulating next steps. 
“Because it will require not only the funding of the Legislature, but also policies,” she said. “I mean, we’re going to have to change laws, and a lot of these are policy calls.” 
A low-income advocate’s concerns
Bill Tibbitts, deputy executive director of Crossroads Urban Center, a low-income advocacy nonprofit based in Utah, raised a slew of concerns about Shumway’s proposal in an email to Utah News Dispatch on Tuesday.
While state officials have said they expect the campus’ infrastructure to cost about $75 million — plus north of $30 million a year for ongoing operations — Tibbitts said what’s being proposed will likely need much more. 
“The cost of building a second state mental hospital, a large substance use treatment facility, and a shelter with 600 -1,300 beds will be much higher than $75 million,” Tibbitts said in his email, adding that it sounds like it could be even more expensive than Salt Lake County leaders’ failed proposal to use a $507 million bond to fix the county’s jail crisis. 
Tibbitts also worried about a possible chilling effect by building a civil commitment facility in proximity to homeless shelter beds.
$507 million bond meant to fix Salt Lake County’s jail crisis is on track to fail. Now what?

“A 300-400 bed mental and behavioral health facility that people are not allowed to leave is not a shelter but an incarceration option,” Tibbitts wrote. “Having such a facility colocated with a shelter would probably lead to a sense that if you do not follow the rules in one facility you could be moved into the other.” 
Tibbitts said Shumway’s presentation made it sound like services at the homeless campus would entail “a law enforcement presence at the shelter and an involuntary detention center for people unable to follow the rules.” 
“Would wandering away from the shelter without permission be something that gets you placed in the detention center? If so, how long before it is completely full?” Tibbitts questioned. 
Tibbitts also said it’s “worrisome” that the campus is envisioned to be a “regional entry point for homeless services.” 
“A senior citizen who had their rent increased beyond what they could afford is not going to want to go to a quasi correctional facility to get help finding a place to live that they can afford,” Tibbitts said. “The majority of the people who visit a shelter are not chronically homeless — they just need a place to stay following a short term period of financial hardship.”
During Tuesday’s presentation, both Shumway and state homeless coordinator Wayne Niederhauser emphasized that they envision Utah’s system helping move people along a “pathway” of rehabilitation and recovery and more efficiently placing people where they need to be in order to succeed. 
In response to a request for an interview about his comments during Tuesday’s meeting, Shumway declined, telling Utah News Dispatch in a text message that what he shared was “simply my vision and hasn’t yet been presented to the full (Utah Homeless Services Board).”
“We’re still very much in the early planning stages, so it’s a bit premature for a detailed conversation,” Shumway said. “Once we’re further along, I’d be happy to share more.” 
Asked whether what’s being proposed could be characterized as a “homeless jail” or something similar, Shumway said the envisioned “accountability center” is focused on “recovery, healing and reintegration.” 
“Participants receive a full suite of wraparound services, including mental and behavioral health care, physical healthcare, substance use disorder treatment, counseling, and education,” Shumway said. “The goal is simple: to break the cycle of crisis.  By addressing root causes, reducing recidivism, and saving lives, an Accountability Center offers a better path forward — an investment in people’s recovery and in stronger, safer communities.”

Harris expressed concerns over federal funding cuts to public health in a report released Thursday by Trust for America's Health. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Alabama’s top health official said in a report released Thursday by the Trust for America’s Health (TFAH) that unpredictable federal funding and changes at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regarding vaccines will have ramifications for public health.
The report, released Thursday, encourages Congress to reinforce funding for public health in the fiscal year 2026 budget, which has not passed. The fiscal year begins in two weeks. 
Dr. Scott Harris, Alabama’s public health officer, said public health work is usually done “behind the scenes.”

“We are doing things to keep people healthy that the public doesn’t know or think about. People go out to eat and don’t worry about getting sick or drink tap water and aren’t concerned about it being unsafe,” Harris said in an August interview with TFAH. “The reason for all of these things is public health. When we lose the ability to do these things because our funding goes away, there will be negative consequences.”
Dr. Nadine Gracia, CEO and president of TFAH, said in a virtual press conference Wednesday proposed federal cuts to the CDC will directly impact communities. In President Donald Trump’s proposed FY26 budget, the CDC’s funding is cut 39%. About half of the cuts are in public health emergency preparedness, she said. 
“These cuts would make communities across the country less prepared for outbreaks as well as natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, wildfires and heat waves, at a time when the frequency and intensity of such events are increasing,” Gracia said.
Funding for public health is not only essential, she said, but provides a large return on investment because it will bring “reduced health care spending, better health outcomes and increased economic productivity.”
Gracia said the purpose of the report is to document what has happened in public health under the new administration and to encourage educated decisions. 
Harris is also current president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO). Dr. Joseph Kanter, the CEO of ASTHO, said in the virtual press conference that he was alarmed by the report’s findings and the threat to public health funding.
“The reductions and instability in public health funding highlighted in this report are deeply troubling, and I think warrant further examination of the potential effects on the health of communities across the country,” Kanter said. 
He said that although public health works, like disease prevention, are often not seen, if the prevention funding goes away hospitals will become more dangerous.
“A couple examples of this are controlling the spread of tuberculosis outbreaks in a community, food borne outbreaks that could threaten a restaurant chain or grocery store or food that ends up in people’s kitchens. Doing the hard work on the back end to identify and contain contaminated food before it grows and puts more families at risk,” Kanter said. “Hospital safety, working with health departments and hospitals to make sure that hospitals remain safe and free of very dangerous pathogens and a safe place for people to receive care.”
Lori Freeman, CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, also in the virtual press conference, echoed Kanter on prevention funding.
“These investments are seriously being threatened right at this moment, not just investments, the actual expertise at the federal level that helps guide us in these areas, is lost,” Freeman said. 
Harris, in his interview with TFAH, said more communication from the Trump administration would be helpful. The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) was reprimanded in August by the administration for violating Trump’s executive order on DEI, but ADPH said they were not told the specific nature of the violations. 
“We fully expect that when there’s a transition at the national level there will be changing priorities. That’s how our system works. The new administration gets to set the agenda,” Harris said in the TFAH interview. “We respect that and want to work with that. But what we need is something orderly, and what we would love is for someone to consult with us.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_0336-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-18 08:59:01.866958

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Representatives from nearly every taxi and limousine company in Southern Nevada say a plan by a subsidiary of Elon Musk’s Boring Company to operate Teslas as taxis in the Las Vegas tourism corridor will destroy their industry. 
Musk’s effort is designed to let his Vegas Loop tunnel project, which could take decades to complete, take immediate advantage of traffic at Harry Reid International Airport. 
Airport officials say they were unaware of the plan and confirmed the Boring subsidiary, Paradise Transportation, has not entered into an agreement with Reid International to have an on-site staging area, a requirement for all transportation services. 
A draft order filed by the Nevada Transportation Authority last month indicates the agency is poised to approve Musk’s effort to transport passengers throughout the tourism corridor and to and from the airport. 
The NTA did not respond when asked whether it ascertained that Paradise has obtained the entitlements required for the service it intends to provide. The matter is expected to be decided at the Oct. 10 meeting. 
Musk seeks to bring Vegas Loop’s tunneled Teslas to surface as taxis 

Dan Reaser, the chairman of the NTA’s sister agency, the Nevada Taxicab Authority, says he has doubts about whether the NTA has jurisdiction over the project. 
“I suggest the NTA carefully consider whether it’s granting an application that’s in our jurisdiction, as opposed to in their jurisdiction, and that that be articulated clearly on any public record that is made before that agency, so that if they’re creating precedent, we understand what that precedent is in administering our statutes,” Reaser said.  
Matters of jurisdiction are typically addressed “by the governor’s office of some other administrator,” Reaser added. 
Gov. Joe Lombardo did not respond to the Current’s inquiries. Dr. Kristopher Sanchez, director of the Department of Business and Industry, which oversees both the Taxicab Authority and Transportation Authority, also did not respond. 
“What they are attempting to do is to operate what amounts to meterless taxis above ground,” Cheryl Gibbons of zTrip, an app-driven taxi service, said last month at the Nevada Taxicab Authority meeting. “Their rates are in direct competition to taxi cab rates.”
Desiree Dante of Lucky, Western, and Ellis Cabs noted that with “104 more vehicles in that congested little area, it’s going to be impossible” to navigate the airport corridor. 
Cab and limousine companies want Paradise to be regulated by the Taxi Authority rather than the Nevada Transportation Authority, which regulates transportation network companies, such as Uber, and special services providers, the designation Paradise seeks. 
Industry insiders, who declined to speak on the record for fear of retaliation, say Musk is willing to lose money by undercutting competitors and potentially putting them out of business in order to prove his underground transit concept works.
The above-ground service, according to its application, sought to charge fares other modes of transportation can’t match: $5 for trips up to three miles, $10 for four to six miles, and $12 for trips of more than six miles. The approved draft order says Paradise has increased each fare by $2 since filing its application. 
The Livery Operator’s Association (LOA), which represents limousine and other chauffeured transportation in Southern Nevada, is protesting Paradise’s application. The LOA asserts Paradise is seeking to serve the same area as the limo drivers and that the designations sought by Paradise for special services and airport transit don’t reflect the operation it’s proposing.  
The protest also states the Boring Company failed to include in the Paradise application any documentation of the company’s safety record in the tunnels it is digging beneath the tourism corridor.  
Earlier this month, a Boring company worker suffered a “crushing” injury in a tunnel beneath Paradise Road, according to news reports, and was taken to the hospital. 
Attorney Kim Maxson Rushton, who represents the LOA, did not respond to requests for comment on why Boring’s underground safety record is relevant to Paradise Transportation’s application for above-ground transit. 
Transportation industry representatives fear Musk’s company, which applied to charge a per capita rate, will charge just one fare to multiple riders in the same vehicle with the same destination.  
“We already have people that drive 12 hours and barely pay their bills,” Mario Locascio of Deluxe Taxi told the Taxicab Authority. “I don’t know what the goal is. They are trying to just destroy the industry of cab and limos and bussing.” 
Boring is also soliciting job applicants in Southern Nevada to test his driverless cars for public transit.

,California,2025-09-18 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,How Gavin Newsom channeled Jerry Brown 1.0 with his flip-flop on oil and gas,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/gavin-newsom-flip-flop-oil/,"A year ago, Newsom was denouncing gasoline refiners for gouging consumers and pocketing huge profits. During the just-concluded legislative session, however, he and legislators acted to increase oil production in California. What happened?","Over the last half-century, California has had seven governors — counting Jerry Brown twice — who varied widely in temperament, ideology and efficacy.
One variable trait has been consistency, whether their positions on issues have changed and, if so, whether they own up or duck accountability.
Brown, who held the position from 1975 to 1983, was particularly prone to policy pirouettes, most spectacularly regarding Proposition 13, California’s iconic taxation limit.
Prior to its overwhelming approval in 1978, Brown repeatedly labeled the measure a “rip-off.” After its passage, however, Brown immediately declared himself a “born-again tax cutter” as he ran for reelection that year. He also sponsored a state income tax cut and a subsequent spending limit ballot measure. He even ran for president in 1980 (unsuccessfully) as an advocate of reduced spending and a balanced federal budget.
There were other notable flip-flops during Gov. Brown 1.0, including one on taxation of international corporations that he blamed on receiving “flaky data” from the state’s top tax official.
When asked about his frequent changes of position, Brown would cite Ralph Waldo Emerson’s aphorism that “a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines,” implying that those with high intellects should be exempt from accountability.
Brown’s two Republican successors, George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson, made few promises other than managerial competency and largely delivered. They were followed by risk-averse Democrat Gray Davis, who nevertheless was recalled in 2003, and replaced by Republican action movie star Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Schwarzenegger promised to shake up state government with tight limits on spending but quickly learned that he could not outmaneuver a Legislature dominated by professional Democratic politicians — nor persuade voters to pass his ballot measures. However he didn’t try to evade responsibility for his failures.
When Brown returned to the governorship in 2011 nearly three decades later, he was a much different person. Not only was he older but he was less prone to flights of political fancy. He promised merely to address bread and butter issues such as the state’s budget deficit and its deteriorating highways.
That brings us to Gavin Newsom, who is — in a sense — Brown’s nephew from the decadeslong intertwining of the Newsom and Brown families.
Newsom’s governorship has resembled Brown’s first stint: promises of bold action on issues such as single-payer health care, housing shortages, homelessness and climate change, followed by backtracking with excuses.
He has termed campaign promises such as creating single-payer health care and building 3.5 million new homes as “aspirational,” rather than doable, and blamed local officials for not attacking homelessness effectively. As Newsom enters the last phase of his governorship and appears to be preparing for a presidential campaign, ala Brown 1.0, he is navigating his biggest flip-flop.
A year ago, Newsom was denouncing gasoline refiners for gouging consumers and pocketing huge profits. He demanded that the Legislature help him crack down.
During the just-concluded legislative session, however, he and legislators acted to increase oil production in California. Meanwhile, the oversight agency Newsom sought to curb refiner profits is at least temporarily inactive.
What happened? The 2024 presidential election revealed popular angst about the cost of living. Meanwhile, two refineries announced plans to shut down, possibly leading to gasoline shortages and much higher prices, which would backfire on a Newsom presidential campaign.
Bloomberg reported this month that Newsom and legislators are even considering giving one of the refineries millions of dollars to remain open.
“We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas. No one’s naive about that,” Newsom said at a recent press conference. “So it’s always been about finding a just transition, a pragmatism in terms of that process.”

The board unanimously approved benefit changes and a withdrawal from the Retirees Trust Fund on Wednesday.(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The State Employees’ Insurance Board (SEIB) Wednesday approved withdrawals from a trust fund and increases to certain deductibles and co-pays for state employees to address a deficit caused by increasing health care costs.
Under recommendations by CEO Stephanie Azar that the executive board approved earlier this month, the board withdrew $30.4 million from the Retiree Trust Fund for the remainder of fiscal year 2025, which ends in two weeks. Azar said the goal was to avoid a greater financial burden in FY26. 
“We just saw the $26.9 million deficit and potential deficit for fiscal year 2026,” she said.

Withdrawals are limited to 10% of the trust’s fair market value on the last day of the previous fiscal year, Azar said, which was $304.7 million. The last time money was taken from the trust, she said, was in fiscal years 2015 and 2016, also to address funding shortfalls. 
The board also approved benefit changes that Azar said will save SEIB about $3.7 million per year. The changes do not impact members’ premiums:

Major medical calendar year deductible (from $300 to $350)
Inpatient hospital stays (from $250 to $300 deductible, and from $25 to $50 copay)
Emergency room visits (from $0 copay to $250 copay excluding accidents and $300 copay including accidents)
Specialist and ER physician visits (from $35 copay to $40)

“On a premium, every member would have to pay any increase in a premium, but on a benefit plan change, it’s only going to impact that member if they go to a specialist,” Azar said after the meeting.
Lastly, the board approved a motion for Azar to request a $1,175 per member per month rate from the Legislature for FY27. That is a $150 increase over the FY26 state share. Whether or not the rate is increased will depend on the Legislature, as the share comes from the General Fund budget. 
If the Legislature approves the $1,175 rate for SEIB’s nearly 32,000 active members, it will cost about $447 million, which is about a $57 million increase over FY26.
Alabama Director of Finance Bill Poole said that there was no guarantee the Legislature would approve an increase. 
“We can suggest raising the rate as high as we want, but the Legislature is not going to be able to generate that type of revenue in FY27 out of the General Fund budget,” Poole said. “So we have reached, or are reaching, the point of some very difficult decisions.”
Azar, however, said she has been in touch with legislative leadership about the increase.
“We’re going to work really, really hard at SEIB to procure proper funding on that state rate increase,” Azar said.

The 2024 Annual Housing Progress Report, which was released last month by the state Housing Division and tracks affordable housing inventory across jurisdictions in Washoe and Clark counties, found overall in both counties there was a 3% increase in affordable housing units created from 2023.
Of the 1,062 affordable units the report identified as created or renovated to add to the inventory, all but 36 were located in Washoe County. The City of Reno created 1,011 units while the City of Sparks added 15 units. 
Both the cities of Las Vegas and Mesquite lost existing affordable units after they reverted back to private market rates. According to the report, there were 39 units converted from affordable to market rate housing in Las Vegas and 31 in Mesquite. 
The City of Mesquite was the only jurisdiction in Clark County to add to the affordable housing inventory and created 36 entirely new units in 2024, the report found, which left the city with a net increase of five units.
In an email to Nevada Current, the Nevada Housing Division wrote the lack of affordable housing added in Southern Nevada last year wasn’t entirely unexpected in the aftermath of the pandemic adding that “the supply chains, and other construction factors in the two-three year window in which new construction projects are developed.”
“It is important to note that this should be the last year of these impacts as the Division foresees the use of Clark County Community Housing funds, the Home Means Nevada Initiative funds, the Nevada Attainable Housing fund, in addition to our traditional LIHTC funding, to create and preserve over 5800 affordable units anticipated to be placed in service in the next few years in Clark County, including this year.”
Another 8,218 affordable units statewide are scheduled to be developed over the next few years, according to the report. Of the units in the pipeline, 3,351 dedicated toward very low income households, or those with incomes below 50% of the area median income. 
The housing division said projects typically take two to three years but that it’s “it’s difficult to quantify a specific date for occupancy.”
The Ogden Pines complex in Las Vegas was demolished, which led to the city losing 39 units, but a new affordable housing project built in its place will have 51 units, said Jace Radke, a spokesman for the City of Las Vegas.
“While those units were ‘lost,’ it is temporary between demolition in 2024” and when the new complex is completed in either 2026 or 2027 and will have 12 more units than the old complex, Radke said.
Nevada, like the nation, is contending with a shortage of affordable and available housing. 
The state’s yearly report compiles information provided by jurisdictions in Clark and Washoe in order to “analyze trends to the degree possible and highlights notable efforts to establish and maintain affordable housing.”
Housing inventory included in the report consists of units funded with federal, state, or local subsidies that restrict how much rent can be charged to tenants to ensure they aren’t paying more than 30% of their income. 
“To be included within the inventory, properties must either have project-based rental assistance, or agreements restricting the income levels of occupants or their rent levels,” the report reads. 
There are approximately 32,944 total units that met that definition as of last year. The previous year had 31,952 the year before. 
The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 allocated billions of dollars of federal relief to Nevada. The state allocated roughly $500 million in funding to go toward developing and preserving affordable housing. 
The report notes that while Southern Nevada jurisdictions “reported a year-over year decrease due to lost units and little or no” additional properties, the nearly 33,000 affordable units developed statewide in 2024 was “an all-time high.”
 A 3.1% increase in total units between 2023 and 2024 outpaced the 2.0% increase from 2022 to 2023, the report notes. The previous year’s housing analysis found that the state created 690 new affordable units in 2023, during which Clark County was responsible for 470 units.
In addition to dearth of new developments, Southern Nevada’s loss in affordable housing stock in 2024 was due to the 71 units in Las Vegas and Mesquite converting to market rate. That includes the 39 units that were in the old Ogden Pines complex.
Nonprofit contractors and privately owned developers can secure tax credits in exchange for allocating a portion of their units at affordable rates, but those units are typically only locked into those rates for 15 or 30 years. 
Fair market rent in Nevada is roughly $1,400 a month, meaning a minimum wage employee earning $12 an hour would have to work 91 hours to afford the rent that doesn’t exceed more than 30% of their income, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
Nevada state lawmakers in 2021 passed legislation to provide localities and tenants a 12-month notification before units are no longer deemed affordable in an attempt to preserve existing stock of affordable housing units. The intent was to give municipalities a chance to work with developers to keep properties from transitioning to market rate or, if need be, relocate low-income tenants. 
“Losing the existing inventory is weighing us down,” former state Sen. Julia Ratti said at the time. “We can build all the new units in the world, but if we can’t keep the ones we’ve already got we’re not making any progress.”
In an email, the city of Mesquite said that the 31 single-family units “were originally built for the low-income population.” 
“The homes are currently owned by individuals, who purchased at affordable rates, and they are currently no longer subject to affordability restrictions,” according to the city.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Housing_RondaChurchill_012-aerial-vista-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-18 08:59:01.866958

Jay Nixon answers a student’s question after giving the 60th John Findley Green Foundation Lecture as part of the 20th Annual Hancock Symposium on Monday at Westminster College in Fulton (Elia Mast/Missourian).Democracy is under strain, and the right question to ask is whether anyone cares enough to make a difference, former Gov. Jay Nixon told a crowd Wednesday afternoon at Westminster College in Fulton.
“Do we care enough about the principles of our democracy to preserve it? And what can each of us do to rekindle that necessary spark?” Nixon asked during the John Findley Green Foundation Lecture in Champ Auditorium.
Since 1937, the John Findley Green lecture has been delivered by Winston Churchill, Harry Truman, William Fulbright, Hubert Humphrey, George H.W. Bush and Ralph Nader, among other esteemed speakers.
On Wednesday, Nixon spoke with urgency about the state of democracy, calling on all Americans to “resist apathy with action.” He also listed decisive actions people can take to effect change.
Join a faith community, he said. Volunteer. Become part of a civic organization. Seek out someone who disagrees with you and just listen.
“Find a life affirming activity that reminds you that all people are deserving of respect and compassion, and finally, vote,” he said.
Nixon was the most recent Democrat to serve as governor of Missouri before leaving office in 2017. Before that, he served as Missouri’s attorney general and as state senator representing Jefferson County. He is now a partner with the Dowd Bennett law firm in St. Louis.
During the speech, Nixon repeatedly abstained from engaging in partisan criticism, opting instead to emphasize issues that bring people together. But he did not shy away from pointing to the threats
“In Washington and across the country, we see … abuses of power and self-dealing demands for unquestioned loyalty, suppression of dissent, the use of fear and force to compel obedience rampant lies and disinformation,” he said.
He reminded the audience that the source of power in our democracy lies not in politicians or violent actors, but with the public.
“We need leaders who understand that the purpose of our government is to help make people’s lives better,” Nixon said, “but more important than the action of our leaders are the actions each of us must take at the ballot box on election day and each day in between — in church pews, around kitchen tables, and in college classrooms.”
When the former governor spoke about topics fueled by mean-spirited rhetoric, he chose to do so in a balanced manner.
“This administration’s threats to target people for being critical of Charlie Kirk’s ideology is an insult to his memory and an affront to our values,” he said. “That also means no more cancel culture.
“We need to stop treating political correctness as a substitute for political progress. We need leaders of radical honesty and integrity.”
Nixon brought attention to a coincidence he has seen between the erosion of public trust in American institutions with decades of hyperpartisan politics intended to divide us against ourselves, rather than unite us for the common good.
“Misinformation, disinformation and bald-faced lies now spread faster than the measles,” he said. “Untethered from actual reality, we are now free to create and foster our own. The more time spent there, any solidarity we once felt for our neighbors has been effectively atomized.”
He called courage the most important asset to achieve. It is telling the truth, admitting mistakes and rejecting violence and hatred in it all its forms.
“Courage is not silence in your critics. That’s cowardice,” he said. “Courage is not bullying the vulnerable, that’s cruelty … Courage is telling the truth even when it’s hard standing up to bullies, behaving ethically, even when it demands personal sacrifice.”
Like the Americans who came before us, Nixon said, we control the means to become more divided or to mend the rift if we so choose.
“We are the great, great-great grandchildren of slaves and those who enslaved them,” he said.
“The first families who inhabited these lands, and those who drove them from it,” he added. “A nation of scrappy strivers stitched together by our ideals, marked by our original sins, but redeemed by the courage and sacrifice that saved us from fascism and unleashed freedom and prosperity — the envy of the world.
“This is the true story. We need to tell the promise we made to each other — that we are still working to keep.”

,DC,2025-09-18 11:10:19+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"US rolls toward a 'terrible' government shutdown, no exit ramp in sight",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-rolls-toward-terrible-government-shutdown-no-exit-ramp-sight,,"WASHINGTON — Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill have entered a stalemate over whether to fund the government for seven weeks or begin a shutdown that could last considerably longer, amid high partisan tensions.Lawmakers, it seems, did not learn from two earlier shutdowns that produced zero results for Republicans who tried to force their policy preferences on Democrats.The 2013 shutdown that lasted 16 days began with GOP demands to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and ended with it remaining the law of the land. The 2018-2019 shutdown started when President Donald Trump insisted on additional funding for a border wall, but concluded 35 days later with the same amount of money included in the original appropriations bill. This time around, however, it’s Democrats making demands ahead of a funding deadline and striking a markedly different tone from just a few months ago.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said earlier this year that shutting down the government would cede considerable power to the Trump administration and represented a far worse option than advancing a Republican-drafted stopgap spending bill.“President Trump and Republican leaders would like nothing more than to pull us into the mud of a protracted government shutdown,” Schumer said in March. “For Donald Trump, a shutdown would be a gift. It would be the best distraction he could ask for from his awful agenda.”But that has all changed in the six months since.

Schumer, who fielded considerable blowback from the Democratic base in March, now says his party will not help GOP leaders advance a seven-week temporary funding patch ahead of the Oct. 1 shutdown deadline, since — encouraged by Trump — they didn’t negotiate the bill. “Democrats don’t want a shutdown, but Republicans cannot shut Democrats out of the process and pretend like the last nine months have been business as usual,"" Schumer said. ”Republicans know that these abuses can’t just continue as if everything is just fine.”If Schumer sticks to that stance and is joined by enough other Democrats and independents, the Senate will not have sufficient votes for the funding patch. Republicans hold majorities in both chambers of Congress but cannot advance legislation in the Senate without the support of at least 60 lawmakers, which typically forces bipartisanship on major issues. Schumer on a ‘fool’s errand’?Republicans and Democrats interviewed by States Newsroom said the most recent shutdowns show that forcing a funding lapse doesn’t lead to policy wins or political victories. But they appeared to acknowledge the increasing likelihood of one beginning next month.  West Virginia Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito referred to the prior government shutdowns as a “misery march” and deferred to Democrats on how exactly lawmakers would get out of a funding lapse if one begins. “When a shutdown gets predicated on a policy position that's never going to work — which I think is what Schumer's brought to (Majority Leader John Thune) — I think that it's a fool's errand, quite frankly,” Capito said. “And it's unfair to the American people.”

Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy said Schumer should consider what Trump will do in the event of a shutdown, when the president has considerable authority to determine which federal workers and operations are exempt and which are not. “He will have pretty much unfettered discretion, at least in his mind, to do whatever he wants to do,” Kennedy said. “And I personally think the president will make it very painful.”Exempt federal employees continue to work during a shutdown and often handle the preservation of life or property, or national security issues. Non-exempt workers are essentially furloughed. Both categories receive back pay once a shutdown ends. Trump bars negotiations with DemsHawaii Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz said that Trump telling Republicans not to negotiate a short-term stopgap bill with Democrats led to the impasse.“Shutdowns are terrible and they should be avoided. And Donald Trump may or may not know that the only way to avoid a shutdown is to work with both parties,” Schatz said. “And yesterday morning … he said, ‘I don't need to deal with the Democrats.’ And so, Godspeed.”

Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said nothing can be accomplished unless Republican leaders begin serious talks over government funding. “Right now, we don't even have a negotiation,” Murphy said. “The basic responsibility of a majority party when you're working on a budget is to negotiate with a minority. You need our votes. So who knows what's possible because right now, they're refusing to talk to Democrats.”Alabama Republican Sen. Katie Britt said Schumer’s change in stance on shutdowns is largely political and stems from the criticism he experienced from his own party earlier this year after helping advance the March stopgap. Nearly every House Democrat voted against that six-month stopgap bill and many voiced frustrations after Schumer aided Republicans in advancing the bill through the Senate. “This is all about political theater because, unfortunately for all of us that are trying to actually get something done, he's afraid of his own shadow. And that shadow’s name is AOC,” Britt said, referring to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who is rumored as a potential Democratic primary opponent when Schumer faces reelection in 2028. Dems want health care subsidy extension  House Appropriations Committee ranking member Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., said there’s still time to avoid a shutdown if GOP leaders begin serious bipartisan negotiations on funding and health care. “​​We still have time. We can negotiate a continuing resolution,” DeLauro said. “But there are, as I said, Democratic priorities. And look, the American people are very concerned about what's happening with health care. It's already out there. So, you know, they're going to hear about it. They'll hear about the fight that we're going to make on this.”Democrats have said for weeks that they want Republicans to negotiate an extension of the enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the calendar year. The credits are used by people who purchase their own health insurance on the ACA market.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said earlier this week that he views that as “a December policy issue, not a September funding issue,” even though open enrollment in that health insurance marketplace begins on Nov. 1 and ends on Dec. 15. There are several health policy provisions in House Republicans’ stopgap spending bill, though none addressing that particular issue. Johnson hopes to pass the legislation this week amid a razor-thin majority and some opposition from within his own party. House approval, which is far from guaranteed, would send the bill to the Senate, where it likely will not get the votes to become law before the deadline.Complicating matters is a week-long recess for Rosh Hashanah. Both chambers are set to return on Sept. 29, with very little time to broker a bipartisan agreement and hold votes, though leaders could cancel part of that break. No pay for feds during shutdownThe two most recent shutdowns began after GOP lawmakers believed it was the best way to bring attention to significant policy disputes and force Democrats to back their proposals. But the status quo remained after both shutdowns. Despite those experiences, Democrats appear ready to gamble they’ll have better luck amid the unprecedented actions of the second Trump administration to challenge the congressional power of the purse and more, though that’s far from a guarantee.

Any shutdown, especially a prolonged one, would cause considerable financial strain for federal employees and Americans who rely on many government services. Since none of the dozen annual government funding bills have become law on time, all federal workers would go without pay during a shutdown, including those at the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Interior and Transportation.Staff for members of Congress, who weren’t affected by the last shutdown, would miss their salaries this time around if a shutdown begins with the new fiscal year on Oct. 1.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-09-18 07:57:34.850516

Thomas/Getty Images)Washington state will backfill lost Medicaid dollars for Planned Parenthood after a court ruling last week. 
At the same time, advocates continue to push for restored funding for abortion access that lawmakers cut in Washington’s new state budget.
In the so-called “big, beautiful bill” congressional Republicans approved in July, they included a prohibition on Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood clinics across the country. Unlike many of the law’s other provisions, the one-year moratorium took effect when President Donald Trump signed the law. 
Gov. Bob Ferguson committed in July to backfilling more than $11 million Planned Parenthood stands to lose in Washington without a year’s worth of federal Medicaid reimbursements. 
In response to a lawsuit from the nonprofit, a federal judge quickly blocked this part of the law after its passage. 
But last week, a Boston-based appeals court allowed the federal government to stop Medicaid spending for Planned Parenthood services. The ruling could jeopardize medical care for more than 1.1 million patients using Medicaid nationwide, including nearly 43,000 in Washington, according to the organization.
“The real victims in the Trump Administration’s political, cruel attack on reproductive rights are Washingtonians who will lose their health care provider. I will not allow that to happen,” Ferguson said in a statement. “Washington will step into this temporary gap to ensure women continue to have access to critical health care.”
Planned Parenthood clinics will submit claims to the state Health Care Authority for Medicaid reimbursement, as usual. But now that money will come only from state coffers, with no federal help. 
“The experience for Planned Parenthood and its patients will remain the same,” said Jennifer Martinez, spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates. “The only thing that’s changing is where the money is coming from.”
Medicaid, which provides health coverage to low-income and disabled Americans, is jointly funded by the federal government and states. Federal dollars under the program already can’t pay for abortions except in cases where the pregnancy endangers the mother or is the product of rape or incest. 
The new moratorium targets Planned Parenthood’s other services, including primary care and cancer screenings. The organization says that abortions make up just a fraction of the services it provides.
In Washington, Planned Parenthood’s 30 health centers serve over 100,000 patients each year, according to the nonprofit. Planned Parenthood has previously closed clinics in Washington due to low Medicaid reimbursement rates. In Washington, Medicaid is known as Apple Health.
Elsewhere, Planned Parenthood has said a block of Medicaid funding puts many of its health centers at risk of closure. Democratic state lawmakers in Oregon are forming a work group to brainstorm ways to reimburse Planned Parenthood centers. 
Abortion Access Project
Reimbursements are coming as leaders of Planned Parenthood press Ferguson and state lawmakers to restore the $8.5 million cut to the Abortion Access Project in the current two-year budget. The project funneled money to Planned Parenthood and other groups.
Washington created the Abortion Access Project following the U.S. Supreme Court decision to overturn the Roe v. Wade ruling, which guaranteed the right to an abortion. The loss of dollars could mean reduced hours and staffing cuts at clinics and less security for patients, advocates say.
This week, they learned the state Department of Health, which would oversee the money, did not ask the governor to include it in the supplemental budget he will release in December.
While there is no formal request, a spokesman for the Office of Financial Management said it is anticipated the issue will be part of the conversation as the budget is developed.

Martinez, from Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, said she understood agency proposals needed to be “narrow and limited in scope.”
Planned Parenthood stood to receive $6.8 million of the state funding over two years. Martinez said service reductions are not imminent and the organization is “committed to keeping its doors open and serving patients.”
“We remain cautiously optimistic that this funding will be included in December’s budget,” she said, adding the organization “is in the midst of a perfect storm — increasing health care costs, workforce shortages, and attacks from a hostile Trump administration. The last thing Planned Parenthood providers and patients need is a funding cut from the state government.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/planned-parenthood-sign-2025-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-18 07:57:34.850516

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Lawmakers who voted to implement work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries next summer will have to wait another six months before they can take effect, and the state is still waiting to hear if the federal government will approve other portions of the health care plan.
Meanwhile, Indiana’s financial toll under a new federal law is beginning to take shape, though final numbers are currently under review, according to comments before the State Budget Committee on Wednesday.
More than 652,000 Hoosiers are enrolled on the Healthy Indiana Plan, or HIP, as of August. State lawmakers voted earlier this year to impose work requirements on the low- to moderate-income Hoosiers starting in July — though many are already working and others may qualify for exceptions such as child care commitments or substance use treatment.

But the federal government won’t let Indiana move forward with work requirements until 2027, when all Medicaid expansion enrollees must meet that condition as part of President Donald Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill.” He signed that into law this summer.
Other parts of Indiana’s HIP 3.0 proposal are still under consideration, including an expansion on provider taxes, cost-sharing requirements and wellness incentives.
“We are attempting to revise the benefit package to reinsert personal responsibility and give people carrots as well as sticks,” said Mitch Roob, the secretary of the Family and Social Services Administration. “The Big, Beautiful Bill gives them several sticks. Regarding cost-sharing requirements, we’d like to provide them with several carrots.”
For example, he said, getting a flu shot would decrease someone’s cost-sharing requirement under Indiana’s proposal — which may not be possible under federal rules. 
Roob previously led the administration under former Gov. Mitch Daniels, introducing the first version of HIP nearly two decades ago. 
Overall, Medicaid is Indiana’s fastest-growing expense, increasing from $2.1 billion in 2017 to nearly $5 billion in 2027. 
Part of those increases can be attributed to Applied Behavior Analysis therapy and PathWays attendant care costs, he said. The first is a popular option for parents with autistic children while the second pays individuals caring for those 60 and older.
Additionally, expenses for Federally Qualified Health Centers grew during that time. In the 2021 fiscal year, costs were under $300 million. This year, it’s roughly $500 million.
The sites provide low-cost and free health care services to underserved populations, though costs vary from clinic to clinic. One center, Roob noted, cost the state $600 per visit. 
“We’re working with the federal government to try to get this under control. We have very little control because the … rules put in place by the federal government,” Roob said. 
 Impact of the Big, Beautiful Bill

Following pushback from rural providers, which have a disproportionately high number of patients who rely on Medicaid, Congress created a $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program. 
States must apply to get those funds by Nov. 5, 2025, with $10 million available annually for the next five years. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the program has five strategic goals: improving rural health, increasing access, workforce development, investing in innovative care models and fostering technology adoption. 
State agency plans aggressive new budget method to control growing Medicaid costs

For Indiana, Roob floated the possibility of improving Indiana’s emergency services in light of the rural ambulance shortage or bolstering prenatal and postpartum care for pregnant women. 
But the law threatens Indiana’s finances in other ways, specifically by capping provider taxes. By taxing hospitals at 6%, the state leverages an increased federal reimbursement to those providers and uses those dollars to fund its HIP obligation. The federal government pays for 90% of HIP expenses while the state uses provider taxes, along with taxes on cigarettes, to pay for the last 10%. 
The new federal law would limit that provider tax to 3.5%, limiting the money Indiana could collect. That 3.5% cap would also apply to provider taxes imposed on managed care entities — a levy Indiana doesn’t have, though other states do.
The limits, overall, “are unfortunate for us,” Roob said, though they won’t go into effect for a few years. Until then, Roob and other Indiana leaders hope the federal government will allow Indiana to impose a 6% tax on managed care entities until then.
“This will create significant stress for the Indiana Medicaid program, not necessarily in 2027, 2028 and 2029,” Roob said. “But in the years after that, it looks tough.”
Indiana will also have to pay more to administer food benefits — also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. For the next fiscal year, Indiana will pay $36 million more. After that, costs go up to $50 million moving forward, he said.
 Reining in health care costs

Indiana’s Medicaid costs don’t exist in a vacuum, rising and falling with overall health care costs. High hospital prices, in particular, drive costs up for government and private insurers alike — though Roob said health outcomes were “substandard.” 
Twenty years ago, he said, the assumption was that hospital prices were high because of the state’s large uninsured population. 
“Today, despite near universal insurance coverage, hospital costs have skyrocketed without corresponding improvements in outcomes,” Roob said.

Hospitals resisted a legislative effort earlier this year establishing so-called “price caps,” delaying any associated penalties until 2029. Under that law, the state will calculate an “average hospital rate” based on Medicare for certain inpatient and outpatient services.
Roob unveiled a new state effort to use Medicaid reimbursements as a tool to lower hospital costs. 
The formula for Medicaid rates will vary, taking into account whether the facility is a county, critical access or rural hospital. Those whose commercial rates are significantly higher than Medicare rates will receive less from Medicaid, and vice versa.
Medicare covers seniors and has its rates established by the federal government — while Medicaid covers low- and moderate-income Hoosiers and is operated by the state.
Though hospital prices — and general health care cost increases — push up Medicaid expenses, Roob has sought to control the state’s responsibility with aggressive budgeting tactics and monthly financial reviews.
“Unfortunately, we have built a health care delivery system that we can no longer afford. And it’s time that we face that reality and make the necessary changes in that delivery system because every dollar we send to a hospital is one dollar we don’t send to a school,” Roob said. 
Committee member Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, said he disagreed with that assessment.
“It is probably correct from your perspective as the secretary of FSSA. From my perspective as a legislator, we have few critical functions as a state to deliver to the public: education is one, health care is two, public safety is three (and) infrastructure is four,” Qaddoura said. 
He criticized state spending on “misplaced” priorities, including economic development initiatives and prison upgrades. 
“To me, it is not either or. It is not a choice between health care and Medicaid. It’s a sick child that needs health care and still needs to go to school,” Qaddoura said. 
Specifically, he said the state could improve if it invested more in preventative health care and insurance reform.
The budget committee will meet again at the end of October.

Gov. Mike Kehoe created the Missouri School Funding Modernization Task Force in an executive order in January and appointed members from a wide swath of backgrounds, including a leader from the Missouri Soybean Association and a senior director from the Herzog Foundation, one of six educational assistance organizations that help distribute private school scholarships under the state’s MOScholars program.
Now, with work groups meeting, the number of people guiding the discussion has more than doubled. Among those joining the effort are Linda Quinley, who serves as senior director of school finance for the Missouri School Boards Association, and Premier Charter School’s director of finance Andy Vien.
Between the two working groups that met Wednesday, seven of the new advisors have experience as superintendents or other administrative positions for public school districts.
The groups will meet six times through the end of the year and are expected to give a report to the larger task force in January or February.
Wednesday’s meetings of the local effort and performance incentives work groups largely served to orient members to their mission.
The local effort task force is charged with finding solutions to adapt a new funding formula to varying property values and tax rates statewide.
The current foundation formula calculates local funding with an assumed tax rate of $3.43 per $100 of assessed valuation. This is multiplied by the assessed property values within a school district from the 2004-05 school year.
Now, 20 years later, school districts with shrinking property values or with tax rates below 3.43% are shortchanged.
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education’s recently retired finance chief Kari Monsees, who led Wednesday’s meetings, said the group should find a way to unfreeze property values.
“Is there another way we can calculate this local revenue that remains more accurate over time?” he said. “It’s going to be a moving target, but we just need to be thinking about how we try to make our recommendations more immune to those policy shifts over time.”
Complicating the group’s efforts are conversations statewide about property-tax policies and a push from the Missouri State Tax Commission to increase residential assessments.
Monsees raised the idea of adding local income levels as a factor.
The second group meeting Tuesday is charged with creating additional sources of funding for high-performing schools, following Kehoe’s call for “incentives based on performance of schools and educational outcomes.” This would be a new addition to Missouri’s school funding formula.
“What is it that we want to incentivize? We have to be able to do it mechanically, but it also needs to be for the right reasons, for the benefit of students,” Monsees told the group.
He recommended that the incentives adapt to districts’ various socioeconomic conditions.
“Some are more advantaged or disadvantaged than others,” he said. The suggestion is we avoid something that would just automatically reward those with low poverty with more money.”
The state of Tennessee adopted a formula in the past few years that gives extra funding when students reach certain targets. Students identified as English-language learners, economically disadvantaged or disabled who reach targets earn more for their schools.
Tennessee’s performance-based funding is a small portion from the state’s formula, Monsees pointed out.
The group suggested a variety of factors that could earn districts a bonus. 
Monsees recommended third-grade literacy or college readiness as factors to incentivize. But he also questioned whether the state has enough data to be able to look into student success after graduation.
“I would describe our data systems here within our state as less than robust,” he said. “So that’s a challenging area, especially if we want to get something that tries to connect the K-12 setting with post-secondary outcomes.”
Mike Podgursky, a semi-retired economics professor from the University of Missouri-Columbia and affiliated scholar at the Sinquefield Center for Applied Economic Research, suggested using Missouri’s growth model.
“Missouri has a growth model which does adjust for prior achievement and does a very good job of leveling out the playing field,” he said.
The growth model is part of the state’s school accreditation program and has drawn questions in recent years, with school superintendents asking for more transparency in how growth is calculated.
Other suggestions included incentivizing schools who meet five days a week and looking at teacher effectiveness. A bill passed in 2024 gave a small financial incentive to have classes five days a week.
Working groups studying funding targets and student counts are scheduled to meet Tuesday.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-18 11:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘They’re sitting on money while people die’: Mississippi is years behind other states in using opioid settlements to address addiction,Allen Siegler,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/18/years-behind-opioid-funds/,"Three years into managing money intended to address this crisis, state and local leaders have committed less opioid settlement money to prevent overdoses than every other state in the country — both in total dollars and as a percentage of settlement shares.","Opioid overdoses have killed thousands of Mississippians in the last decade, and Attorney General Lynn Fitch and the state Legislature have said the crisis requires effective, bipartisan solutions. 
But three years into managing money intended to address this crisis, state and local leaders have committed less opioid settlement money to prevent overdoses than every other state in the country — both in total dollars and as a percentage of settlement shares. 
Elected officials have reported using less than $1 million of the over $124 million in opioid settlement funds they manage for direct measures to combat addiction, according to public records Mississippi Today requested. The other 49 states, including ones receiving significantly less money, have allocated at least $3 million each from the lawsuits to address the public health problem.  
About $109 million of Mississippi’s money has been sent to the state government, according to a public record requested from Fitch’s office. The state has used roughly $20 million of that to pay the Ridgeland law firm of John Davidson, the attorney general’s outside counsel for the opioid lawsuits. 
The state Legislature controls the remaining $89 million. But lawmakers only this year created the Mississippi Opioid Settlement Fund Advisory Council, which is tasked with making recommendations about how to spend the funds to address the overdose crisis. The recommendations the Legislature approves are expected to be allocated in July 2026, when the next state budget goes into effect.
The rest of the money is with Mississippi’s towns, cities and counties. The localities have received over $15.5 million of opioid settlement money, according to a Mississippi Today investigation. Officials have spent $945,000 on strategies the settlement’s plaintiff lawyers recommend for curbing the crisis. 
They spent about $5.4 million on a variety of purposes not related to fighting addiction, such as routine government expenses, police body cameras and new city vehicles.
Fitch — unlike attorneys general in at least 34 other states — did not require any of the money local governments receive to be spent on addiction-related purposes, and she also did not require localities to report their expenses. 

Elected officials and Davidson expressed more urgency when arguing for this money in court. When the state filed a lawsuit in 2018 against companies that flooded towns with addictive and deadly opioid prescription painkillers, then-Attorney General Jim Hood and Davidson wrote that these dollars were necessary to respond to the “public health epidemic that these Defendants have created.” That lawsuit and other similar ones are expected to pay Mississippi around $421 million through 2040.
The public health crisis has ramped up in the roughly seven years since the lawyers wrote that. More people are dying of overdoses in Mississippi and the U.S. than in 2018, and there have been over 1,300 Mississippi drug deaths since the national settlement managers wired Fitch’s office the first payment in September 2022, according to the Mississippi State Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
The state Health Department has counted more than 4,600 non-fatal overdoses in the first six months of 2025 alone. And Mississippians still have trouble finding resources. Many in the state with opioid use disorder aren’t treated with the gold-standard medications and can’t find safe sober-living options, according to recent studies. 
“There’s been three years now that people have been dying for no reason,” said Melody Worsham, a Harrison County peer support specialist for the Mississippi Recovery Advocacy Project. “They’re sitting on money while people die.”

After being presented with these findings in a letter, Fitch did not answer a question about whether she and the Legislature have done enough with the settlement dollars to prevent Mississippians from overdosing. 
Her chief of staff, Michelle Williams, said in a statement the public health crisis has cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and the lawsuits themselves allow for some of the settlement money to pay for prior expenses made to address the epidemic.
She added that Fitch’s office was pleased the Legislature passed a law in the spring to start distributing most of the dollars with recommendations from the settlement advisory council. She said the office is looking forward to working with the committee’s members.
Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and Speaker of the House Jason White did not respond to emails asking if the Legislature had done enough to address addiction with these dollars over the past three years. Davidson didn’t respond to a similar email.

Delbert Hosemann, a Republican, right, speaks with reporters, Wednesday, Dec. 6, 2023, after a meeting of the Joint Legislative Budget Committee in Jackson, Miss., while former House Speaker Philip Gunn, R-Clinton, center and Speaker Jason White, R-West, left, listen.

One factor that could have delayed Mississippi’s opioid settlement spending is that state elected officials altered the distribution plan as they were receiving the dollars. In 2021, Fitch and local government leaders agreed to a plan that would send 70% of the settlement funds to the University of Mississippi Medical Center for a new addiction medicine center. 
But the Legislature overrode Fitch’s contract. Lawmakers passed a bill this spring to create the advisory council that makes recommendations about which private and public addiction response projects the dollars should go toward — recommendations lawmakers can approve or reject. 
Dr. Caleb Alexander, a Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health epidemiologist who studies drug safety, said it’s a better plan for states to use the settlements for multiple addiction response strategies. 
“No one in their right mind, I think, would argue that the money should all be dumped in a single bolus,” he said. 
But he also said overdose deaths continue to be an urgent health crisis requiring swift action. While he expects states to take time to thoughtfully set up their distribution processes, he was surprised more Mississippi money hasn’t been used to address the emergency. 
“I think three years and less than 1% represents a problem,” he said.
Another reason so little money has been spent to address addiction has been Fitch’s communications with cities and counties controlling opioid settlement dollars, according to public health experts. Representatives for the attorney general’s office have repeatedly told the local governments they don’t have to document their spending or use the money to address addiction in letters, emails and legal opinions.
Attorneys general in states such as Utah and North Carolina provided detailed guides for local governments on how to prevent more overdoses with the funds.
Dr. Rahul Gupta, the former Office of National Drug Control Policy director, served as an expert witness for the plaintiffs in many of the opioid settlement lawsuits. He said the local payouts weren’t meant to be spent secretly or for plugging budget holes. Rather, they were supposed to address addiction issues facing specific communities, while the state dollars could focus more on issues that impact large swaths of Mississippi.

“The whole goal of 100% of the funds is to use them in unison,” he said.
After her son died while struggling with addiction in 2019, Pine Belt resident Jane Clair Tyner has worked to make Mississippi addiction response resources more accessible. Her goal is to prevent more of the type of irreparable harm done to her family. 
She said she sees public service announcements throughout the state claiming that help is available for anyone with substance use disorder. But that wasn’t the experience she had with her son, at least for options that were affordable. 
Tyner said she wants Fitch and local government leaders to show a commitment and urgency to preventing more overdoses, and she wants them to be good stewards of this money.
“That is not at all what is being done,” Tyner said. “It’s being squandered.”

(Courtesy of James Leuschen for Congress)OMAHA — Another Democrat with ties to Washington, D.C. is running to be the Democratic nominee for Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District.
James Leuschen, an Omaha native and a 20-year congressional staffer, told the Examiner this week that he is running because President “Donald Trump’s policies are hurting Nebraska families and hurting our community.” 
“We need to stop him,” Leuschen said. “This is an existential election.”
He joins a crowded field of Democrats trying to represent the Omaha-based 2nd District. The list of Democrats includes State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, business owner and political action committee co-founder Denise Powell, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades and Navy veteran Kishla Askins.
Leuschen moved back to Nebraska earlier this summer.
Mark Johnston withdrew from the Democratic field earlier this year because he said he lacked the infrastructure to raise funds. Evangelos Argyrakis said he was running as a Democrat. He has switched parties before, including to the Libertarian Party in early August. This week, he was registered as a Democrat. 
Leuschen has been working as an economic policy staffer for several House members over the past two decades. He served as a policy director for former Democratic Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, working to pass the Affordable Care Act under former President Barack Obama and expand the child tax credit. 
He also worked with the last Democrat to represent the 2nd District – the late U.S. Rep. Brad Ashford – to get an Omaha VA medical clinic built. Another connection between Ashford and Leuschen: John Ashford, his son, will serve as his campaign treasurer. 
“The VA medical facility in Omaha wouldn’t exist without James Leuschen,” John said. 
Leuschen is banking on his Washington experience to separate him from the other Democrats in the race.
“I have more experience to get to Washington and push back against the Trump administration … I know how Washington works,” Leuschen said. “I know how to lower costs for Nebraska families.”

That effort, if elected, will be his primary focus, he said, to “bring down costs for Nebraska families.” He says Trump’s tariffs and his budget and tax bill that passed earlier this summer are increasing the cost of groceries, utilities, and health care. 
Leuschen called Trump “the king of promising populist policies and … not following through.” He said he would push back against Trump’s ability to impose tariffs without congressional approval and work to protect Social Security and Medicare. Leuschen describes himself as a “common sense Democrat.” 
National Democrats are attempting to emerge from the political wilderness at a time when Trump and Republicans have made gains with blue-collar voters and voters of color.  The 2nd District race is increasingly critical for Democratic efforts to retake control of the House in 2026.
Nebraska Democrats are hoping that the backlash to the second Trump administration will help them make gains. 
Leuschen said, “Democrats get stuck in sort of technocratic or perfectionist policy” and look past what normal folks are looking for. He said regular people are primarily focused on the cost of living and “issues that folks talk about around their kitchen tables.” 
Part of what is luring more Democrats into the race is the announced retirement of U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb. Another reason: Democratic House nominees have lost the 2nd District four straight times by single digits.  
Leuschen said the district, which includes all of Douglas and Saunders County and part of western Sarpy County, has an appetite to hold Trump accountable. The GOP’s contested primary is not as crowded, but it has two experienced candidates in Omaha City Council Vice President Brinker Harding and former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha. 
National and state GOP strategists acknowledge that Democrats can win an open-seat 2nd District race, but they emphasize that Republicans can hold the seat with the “right candidate and the right messaging.” 
“This district has rewarded folks who have focused on solving problems,” Leuschen said. “That’s what I’m doing.”

Phil Murphy's administration has put more than $42 billion into state pensions since he took office in 2018, putting the funds on a path to recovery.","Gov. Phil Murphy's administration has put more than $42 billion into state pensions since he took office in 2018, putting the funds on a path to recovery. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)Pensions are poised to top Gov. Phil Murphy’s list of achievements regardless of what else the term-limited Democrat accomplishes before he leaves office in four months.
Since his initial election as governor in 2017, Murphy has boosted annual pension payments — long ignored by governors of both parties — to record highs, reversing declines in a key metric used to measure the health of the funds that pay retirement benefits to public workers at all levels of New Jersey government.
“I think it’s probably paragraph one or bullet point one under making New Jersey a more responsible state again, a state you can trust,” Murphy, a Democrat, told the New Jersey Monitor in an interview.
New Jersey’s pension problems began their downward trajectory in 1997 under Republican Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who cut about $590 million from the state’s annual pension payment — a roughly 86% reduction at the time — and borrowed nearly $2.8 billion to cover obligations and balance the state budget, including large income tax cuts.
Subsequent governors of both parties largely did not move to restore pension funding. Gov. Jon Corzine, a Democrat, made pension payments of just over $1 billion in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, but the havoc wrought by the Great Recession on New Jersey’s budget brought pension payments back down to zero for fiscal years 2010 and 2011.
Pension payments edged up under Republican Gov. Chris Christie, their growth aided by changes that placed more retirement costs on workers and delayed some pension-related cost increases. By Christie’s final budgetary year, the state was paying nearly $2.5 billion into its pensions, but even that was only half of what actuaries said was needed to restore the fund.
The disinvestment ballooned pension funds’ debts while denuding their assets and driving funding ratios — a key measure of pension health that compares a pension’s assets to its liabilities — down to among the lowest levels in the nation. Only Illinois had worse-funded pensions, according to researchers from the Pew Charitable Trusts, with that state’s troubles driven by a similar pattern of disinvestment and fallout from the Great Recession.
“Prior administrations, and even the first years of Murphy administration, needed to weigh pension funding versus other policy and moral funding issues such as K-12 aid, property tax relief, health care, support for developmentally disabled and other programs to support vulnerable communities,” said David Rousseau, a former state Treasurer under Corzine.
The level of contributions needed to restore fund health rose alongside debt. Had the disinvestment not occurred, administration officials and Murphy say, the state would only be required to pay about $1 billion annually. Instead, New Jersey actuaries say the state needs to pay roughly $6.9 billion.
New Jersey is expected to pay more than $7.2 billion into its pensions this year, including contributions from the state lottery. That would bring aggregate contributions under Murphy to above $47 billion, more than twice the $22.7 billion paid by other governors since the 1997 fiscal year.
“It’s like paying off a mortgage,” said Charles Steindel, who was the state’s chief economist under Christie from 2010 to 2014. “You’re paying off current unfunded liability.”











I think it’s probably paragraph one or bullet point one under making New Jersey a more responsible state again.


– Gov. Phil Murphy



Still, the health of New Jersey’s pensions remains precarious. Funding ratios across the state’s major pension funds, which, according to Treasury disclosures, cover more than 720,000 state workers, continued to decline until the state made its first full payment in the 2022 fiscal year.
Most of New Jersey’s pensions — and its large funds in particular — remain well below the 80% funding ratio experts consider indicative of a healthy pension fund, and those funds are expected to take a decade or more to reach that level.
Apart from two small pension funds that, combined, covered just 49 workers in the 2024 fiscal year, the state’s pension funds are not expected to reach a 100% funding ratio until about 2050, at which point the state’s annual pension payment would drop dramatically over only a couple of years, according to state actuarial reports.
But whether or not the pensions recover to that point will depend on how future governors treat the state’s pension obligations.
“I think we’ve succeeded in drawing a line in the sand above which we will have good behavior in the years ahead, regardless of Democratic or Republican administrations,” Murphy said. “We will put the sort of bad budget behavior in the past.”
The two major-party nominees vying to succeed Murphy, Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D) and former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli (R), have both said they would continue to fund state pensions if elected.
Though reducing pension payments would not immediately imperil benefits, cutting them may be difficult for the same reasons cutting Social Security is difficult at the federal level: Workers have paid into those funds for years or decades.
“A pension, after all, is nothing more than a deferred salary,” Steindel said. “You pay people their salaries.”
Economic shocks, whether from a recession or a more constrained downturn in financial markets, could also delay pensions’ recoveries. Pension funds are invested, and officials set a baseline expectation of 7% annual returns on those investments. Better returns could accelerate the recovery.
“Are the pension problems over? The answer is no,” Steindel said. “But the big deal — this heavy lift of this huge increase of state appropriations for the pension funds — that’s pretty much over.”
Pension payments increased under Gov. Chris Christie, but the payments were half of what actuaries said was needed to restore the pension fund. (Hal Brown for New Jersey Monitor)
Cost-of-living adjustments to pension benefits that have been paused for more than a decade under a bipartisan 2011 bill signed by Christie could also delay pensions’ eventual recovery by increasing the benefits New Jersey is required to pay to retired public workers.
Under the provisions of the 2011 law, pensions are barred from indexing the benefits they pay to workers until their funded ratio reaches at least 80%, a level the funds could reach late next decade.
Cost-of-living adjustments are not required, though the political pressure in their favor from labor unions and retirees who’ve unsuccessfully lobbied for increases is likely to be fierce. A retiree earning a $50,000 pension in 2011 would require $71,450 in benefits this year to maintain the same purchasing power.
It’s not likely future administrations would seek to raise pension benefits by such a degree, if only because doing so would likely strain state coffers and significantly delay pension recovery. How costly any future adjustments end up being would also depend on how the increases themselves are structured.
Reviving annual cost-of-living adjustments would drastically raise aggregate pension costs over the long run, Rousseau said, though other methods could be less costly.
“If it’s a one-time thing that’s then going to stay in the base, it’s expensive but not as expensive as doing it every year,” said Rousseau.
New Jersey’s spending on its pensions could save the state money elsewhere. Credit rating agencies’ view of the state’s ability and will to meet its debt obligations helps determine the interest rates charged on state-issued bonds. Higher ratings allow New Jersey to bond on more favorable terms, though the impact of prior downgrades was limited in New Jersey.
“Even when ratings were going down, New Jersey got decent interest rates since there were usually more bids for bonds than bonds being offered, which allowed rates to be negotiated down,” Rousseau said.
Ratings agencies have, among other things, cited pension payments under Murphy in a series of credit upgrades to the state. Those upgrades could also broaden the pool of potential bond buyers, since some investors are barred from buying lower-rated bonds, Steindel said.

All manner of plant and wildlife that reside in Wyoming’s Red Desert are adept at surviving the area’s sparse precipitation, poor soils and seasonal extremes. But a warming climate threatens to push this place to the brink of cascading degradation, Christiansen explained to a group of journalists during a tour of the desert by wing, tire and boot earlier this month.
“Normally, we’d have 80 or 90 fawns for every 100 [pronghorn] does,” he said, noting the ratio is down by about one-third for the Sublette Herd.
“There’s example after example of this kind of stuff, and you can see it in the vegetation monitoring,” Christiansen added. “It all goes back to the climate and how we’re drying out.”
Aside from a two-track road here and there, the vantage point where Christiansen and his audience stood revealed a vista devoid of rooftops, highways or power transmission lines — a place where only the hardiest of plant and animal species have evolved to flourish in the harsh, arid landscape. In this particular spot, an area on the northern edge of the Red Desert dubbed “The Golden Triangle,” resides the largest intact concentration of sagebrush and the largest concentration of greater sage grouse in the world.

The hearty sagebrush-steppe biome, a feature beyond The Golden Triangle and throughout the desert, also provides sustenance for thousands of pronghorn and mule deer that migrate out of the surrounding mountains and foothills to survive western Wyoming’s brutal winters, Christiansen explained. Retired after a 33-year career as a Wyoming Game and Fish Department biologist, Christiansen has studied everything “from mice to moose.” 
That biome is an increasingly rare commodity, he added, noting sagebrush-steppe habitat is disappearing and degrading at a rate of 1.3 million acres per year in western North America. The northern Red Desert, in his mind, is sort of an accidental ecological refuge.
“One of the reasons we still have this open landscape here — it’s not because of our intensive and intentional design to keep it wild and free and open. No,” he said. “It’s because the soil sucks and the precipitation sucks. 
“We’re already on the edge of existence,” Christiansen continued. “You can’t turn this into a wheat field. If you could, it would have been done. It’s not out of the goodness of our hearts that it’s still sage-grouse habitat.”

Yet the fate of this desert refuge will be no accident, according to Christiansen and the Wyoming Outdoor Council, which organized the tour. Christiansen serves as secretary on the council’s board of directors. 
The group, along with Friends of the Red Desert and others, are hoping to elevate the “invaluable” qualities of the Red Desert in the hearts and minds of the American public as federal officials retool a management plan that will determine the future of this place as it undergoes increasing climate-related threats such as wildfire and invasive plant species.
Resource management in limbo
The U.S. Bureau of Land Management updated its Rock Springs Resource Management Plan in December, establishing conservation, agricultural and industrial development and recreational priorities for some 3.6 million acres in southwest Wyoming, including much of the Red Desert.
The plan blocked about 1.1 million acres from new industrial-scale development, mostly in the northern portion of the desert — the accidental ecological sanctuary, as Christiansen suggests — in part because it already lacks oil, gas and mining infrastructure. Though the BLM initially wanted to block about 2.5 million acres, conservation groups still cheered the smaller implementation of rights-of-way “exclusion areas.”

There’s a logic, both conservationists and — at the time — the BLM agreed, in not only protecting the unique environmental and cultural values of the northern region, but in recognizing there already exists an industrialized east-west swath of oilfield, mining, pipeline and powerline infrastructure following Interstate 80 and the railroad “checkboard” in the southern portion of the desert. Even with the expansion of rights-of-way exclusion areas, about 75% of the 3.6-million-acre BLM Rock Springs Field Office management area is already leased or technically available for energy development, according to a Wilderness Society report.  
But the plan, after being savaged by conservative critics for being overly restrictive, is in limbo.
Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has said the Rock Springs management plan will be “reviewed and, as appropriate, revised.” The BLM is “preparing to amend” the Rock Springs plan under the Interior’s Secretary Order 3418, which aligns the agency’s actions with President Donald Trump’s Unleashing American Energy executive order, according to the Wyoming BLM office. That process will begin “in the near future,” and will include an environmental assessment “with some public scoping,” an agency official told WyoFile via email. 
Conservation groups like the Wyoming Outdoor Council worry the Trump administration might exceed even what energy industry officials have asked for in terms of relaxing environmental protections. In addition to bolstering fossil fuel development on public lands, the administration proposes to roll back the BLM’s Conservation and Landscape Health Rule, rescind the Forest Service’s Roadless Rule, rescind the “endangerment finding” (the basis for limiting greenhouse gas emissions), to end a greenhouse gas reporting program and dozens of other actions to undo federal climate and conservation measures.

“The Trump administration has obviously led with prioritizing extractive industries over all other uses on public lands,” Wyoming Outdoor Council Conservation Director Alec Underwood told WyoFile. “Our concern would be … they might target some of those areas that are now closed to oil and gas via rights-of-way exclusions.”
Federal staffing concerns and new oil and gas assessment
When tour attendees climbed out of a gaggle of vehicles to chat with a local rancher near the Whitehorse Creek Overlook, a breeze was pungent with the sweet, earthy smell of sage. The unsettled sky above threatened to rain. But, true to the nature of this place, the timidly humid air merely added to the olfactory senses, and nary a drop was felt.
“It’s very dry — the driest we’ve ever seen,” said Jim Helleyer, who helps run a family cow-calf operation that, in part, relies on range in the desert. To cope, the ranch recently reduced its stock by half, he added.
A lifelong Lander resident and University of Wyoming graduate, Helleyer proudly described a recent upgrade to the ranch’s Red Desert grazing range, which encompasses a lot of BLM-administered surface. It included a water well that contributes to a small riparian area and new fencing (wildlife friendly, Helleyer noted) to keep cattle from trodding through it and to generally help sustain cattle grazing along with other natural resource benefits.

Even though the small project fit nicely with the BLM’s stewardship priorities, it took nearly 10 years to get permitted, he lamented. Outdoor Council members on the tour said they worry whether the BLM will be sufficiently staffed to steward whatever activities — and climate challenges — come next, given recent staffing reductions across all federal agencies via the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency program.
Asked whether there’s much oil and gas activity that intermingles with the ranch, Helleyer said no. Decades ago, Amoco drilled a deep well near here, he said, “and didn’t stick around.”
You can find evidence of similar attempts to tap petrol all over the northern Red Desert, according to those familiar with the place. If companies had struck paydirt, there’d be oil and gas fields here, they say.
But, just months after the Trump administration took office this year, the U.S. Geological Survey published a new assessment proclaiming a massive volume of oil and natural gas previously “undiscovered” and now “technically recoverable” under a large region of northwest Colorado and southwest Wyoming. The unrealized bounty, according to the report, stretches into the northern reaches of the Red Desert.

The potential riches weren’t exactly unknown, according to Wyoming oil and gas industry officials. It’s just that they were considered technically uneconomic to recover in terms of now outdated conventional methods.
“We’re constantly advancing [drilling] technology, and this new available science says that there’s a significant amount of recoverable oil and gas in the area,” Petroleum Association of Wyoming Vice President and Director of Communications Ryan McConnaughey said. 
Though perhaps not all of the reserves identified in the USGS assessment are economically viable to tap today, McConnaughey added, “that may very well change in the future. So we don’t want to see a potential area locked up forever.”
McConnaughey said he believes drilling can advance into previously undeveloped areas of the desert without compounding climate-related stresses that conservation groups point to as a reason for blocking the activity. “Oil and gas production in Wyoming is done in a more sustainable and environmentally sensitive way than anywhere else in the world.” 
For now, the northern Red Desert remains “remarkably intact,” the Outdoor Council’s Underwood said. 
“When you look at the various values up there, including the recreational opportunities, hunting, fishing and the cultural resources, what you see is one of the highest quality landscapes to go out and enjoy the outdoors,” Underwood said. “It also happens to be one of the most ecologically significant areas in the United States of America. If that place isn’t worthy of protection, I don’t know what is.”

Francesca Hong sits for a photo in her office in the Capitol in 2022. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)State Rep. Francesca Hong, a Madison Democratic Socialist, chef and bartender, is joining the growing Democratic field for governor — saying she hopes to be a relatable candidate who can bring working class people together to foster a government that works for them. 
Hong launched her campaign with a 90-second ad shot in the kitchen of L’Etoile, a high-end restaurant across from the Capitol in Madison and in the dining area of the adjacent restaurant Graze. Hong points towards the Capitol, which is labeled in the ad “MAGA-controlled Legislature,” and says that “a lot of people in that building don’t get why it’s so hard to get by right now.” 
“Working hard doesn’t mean you can always keep up. One wrong step can lay you out flat. This is by design,” Hong says.
Hong told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview that she is running because she sees the current moment as ripe for a “movement” for “building working class power,” as “more and more people are realizing that the system is rigged.”
“It’s about politics rooted in care — where we care for ourselves, our children, our small businesses and our workers. The movement requires building coalitions, meeting folks where they are, honoring and receiving all different types of talents and treasures and time that people are willing to give to engage with others. It’s happening, and it needs to happen faster here in Wisconsin.” 
Hong said she feels a sense of urgency because of the direction the Trump administration and Republicans are taking. 
“We have an authoritarian regime that endorses mass suffering, gutting food from children and gutting health care from working people and dismantling public education and programs,” Hong said. “It’s irresponsible to be thinking about incrementalism as a way to make this moment. I think it’s unrealistic to rely on incremental policy, and what working class people are demanding is that they have their needs met… Wisconsinites, they f-ing hustle, and they deserve a governor who is going to be working as hard as they are.”
Four other Democratic candidates are already in the open race, including State Sen. Kelda Roys of Madison, Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley and Mukwonago beer vendor Ryan Strnad.
Two Republican candidates have entered the race on the GOP side so far: Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien and Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany has said he will make a decision about entering the race by the end of the month. 
Hong was first elected to the state Assembly in 2020, becoming the first Asian American to serve in the body. At 36, she is the youngest candidate to join the race so far.
Gov. Tony Evers’ decision not to seek a third term opened the way for a competitive primary. “I think that this is probably the only time where someone like me can run for governor and win,” Hong said. 
She acknowledged that her campaign will be different in style and substance from more traditional campaigns. “I think there’s going to be some skepticism that’s going to come from the establishment folks in political circles about some of the campaign strategies we may lean on, especially when it comes to creative digital,” she said.
Hong formerly owned Morris Ramen, a restaurant in downtown Madison she opened with Matt Morris and restaurateur Shinji Muramoto in 2016 and closed last year. She currently bartends and picks up shifts at another restaurant every once in a while. She is also a single mother who rents her home in Madison.
“It’s going to sound corny, but I really love this state,” Hong said. “It’s where I have failed and succeeded. When it comes to my culinary career or winning an election and being sent to the Capitol. It’s where George [her son] was born. It’s my parents’ home. They’ve lived here longer than anywhere else, and the state has given me and my family a lot.” 
She says she began considering running for governor after the recent state budget process.
Hong voted against the budget and called on other Democrats to do the same because it made no increases in general state aid to Wisconsin’s public schools. During her time in the Legislature, Hong has also been a champion for providing school breakfasts and lunches to all students free of charge. 
This session Hong joined the Legislative Socialist Caucus. She said she identifies as a Democratic Socialist. 
“That means I’m dedicated to building working class power where everyone has their basic needs met to be able to take care of themselves and the people that they love and their neighbors and somebody that they don’t know,” Hong said. 
Her campaign comes at a moment when other Democratic Socialists are running high-profile campaigns across the country. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders has been traveling the country on a “Fight Oligarchy Tour” that made stops in Wisconsin. In New York City, state Rep. Zohran Mamdani recently won the Democratic nomination for mayor.  
Hong said Mamdani’s message  resonated with her. 
“Mamdani has showed us that meeting voters where they are, building a diverse, multi-generational, multi-faith, multi-racial and multi-ethnic coalition is how you build trust with voters,” Hong said, adding that she appreciates his focus on  “affordability and concrete ways that government can do its job and be a force of good.” 
The policies that she has proposed in the Legislature have been “practical,” Hong said.
Hong was a leading sponsor on a state law that requires schools teach Hmong and Asian American history. Hong, the daughter of Korean immigrants, also helped launch the state’s first Legislative Asian Caucus alongside two of her new colleagues this session and has authored resolutions to proclaim 2025 as the year of the snake and celebrate 50 years of Hmong, Lao, Cambodian and Vietnamese people residing in Wisconsin.
This session, she has also coauthored a resolution to declare that Wisconsin have an Economic Bill of Rights and a bill to prohibit state employees’ cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in public buildings without a warrant. 
“We can make better possible when there are universal policies that support working class people — universal child care, guaranteed paid leave, fully funded public schools, access to capital for small businesses and investing heavily in a care infrastructure where we can take care of our seniors,” Hong said. “Regardless of political identity, these types of social insurance programs are designed to ensure that working class people can not only get by, but be able to take care of themselves and their families in the ways that they see fit.” 
Hong said it is “imperative” that Democrats flip the state Assembly and Senate to make progress towards those policies. New legislative maps adopted in 2024 brought that goal into sight for Democrats for the first time in many years.
Hong said she is going to do everything she can to support candidates running for the Assembly and to help flip districts currently represented by Republicans. The Wisconsin Legislature has been led by Republicans since 2010.
This will be Hong’s first time running for statewide office. Hong said she is anticipating an array of challenges for her campaign. She said she will continue putting in a lot of hours as a state lawmaker, and she may not be able to pick up as many shifts at Gamma Ray, the Madison bar she works at.
Hong said she is also committed to meeting people where they are in a wide variety of places, including bowling alleys and pro wrestling matches and the rodeo. She said those are the places where people might be willing to share their stories. 
Hong recalled stopping at a bar in Chippewa Falls. She said she got her usual Miller High Life, while two men next to her had a Miller Lite light and a regular Miller Lite. She said she made a comment along the lines of “you might as well just be drinking water at that point” and it led to a conversation about concerns one of the men had about hospital access in a part of the state grappling with recent hospitals closings.
“He was worried that his elderly mother, who was almost 90 and still drives herself to the hospital… she’s not going to get the care she needs,” Hong said. “That is real. Health care is very real for folks, health insurance is too expensive. We have policies that are going to help make health insurance cheaper, both for small businesses and for workers. 
Hong hopes she can give people the sense that “there’s somebody in their corner,” and show them that she “can be a strong messenger for helping people realize that together we can make better possible.”

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Usually, the Idaho Attorney General’s Office legally represents state government agencies. 
But in 2024, the Idaho Legislature and Gov. Brad Little approved a law to carve out the Idaho Department of Lands as an exception, directing the agency to have its own attorney that is independent of the Attorney General’s Office.
Then this June, the Idaho State Board of Land Commissioners voted to extend that exception to itself. The Land Board manages the state’s public lands, including deciding whether to sell land. 
Now, attorneys for the Land Board and Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador are squabbling about that policy in court — in an unrelated federal lawsuit about access to land in the Boise foothills, which neither agency is a party to. 
“The statutes setting forth who may represent state officers and entities in Idaho are not complex,” Labrador’s attorneys wrote. Quoting a state law about the attorney general’s duties, they wrote “The Attorney General has the authority and obligation to ‘represent the state and all departments … [and] boards’ in ‘all courts.’”
In response, attorneys for the Land Board and the Department of Lands argued Labrador lacked authority to even get involved in the federal lawsuit — and that the Legislature was clear about its intention.
“The Legislature expressly repealed the AG’s authority to represent the State’s interest in state land and timber matters,” they wrote.

 How did legal representation for the Land Board change?

The Land Board provides direction for the Idaho Department of Land’s management of about 2.5 million acres of state endowment lands.
Idaho Land Board votes to hire outside legal counsel instead of AG Raúl Labrador

Under the state’s constitution, the attorney general serves on the Land Board, along with several other state constitutional officers, including the governor. 
But until the Land Board’s new policy went into effect, Idaho’s attorney general also served as the Land Board’s legal counsel. 
This year’s decision for the Idaho Land Board to have its own attorneys is part of a years-long dispute over concerns that the attorney general had too much power in the governing body, even before Labrador took office in 2023.
In 2016, Idaho lawmakers considered amending the state’s constitution to remove the attorney general from the Land Board, the Spokesman-Review reported. That came years after the former attorney general, Lawrence Wasden, successfully sued the Land Board in 2010, the newspaper reported. 
Labrador was the only member of the Land Board to vote against approving the new legal representation policy, which states that the “land board shall be represented by its legal counsel in all courts.”
At the time, Labrador claimed the policy was contrary to state law and the state’s constitution. 
That dispute has boiled over into court.
 In court, Labrador’s attorneys claim new policy violates state law. Land Board’s attorneys argue the Legislature ‘repealed the AG’s authority.’

Labrador’s attorneys’ legal filing on Aug. 22 asked a federal judge to strike the Land Board’s request to file an amicus brief, which is when someone outside of a case wants to weigh in — because it was filed by the Department of Land’s in-house attorneys.

“The attorneys who submitted the motion for leave to file the amicus brief have no authority to represent the State or the Land Board in court, and the Attorney General — who does have that authority — did not authorize the motion,” Labrador’s attorneys wrote.
Labrador’s attorneys say that the Legislature “did not authorize the Department of Lands’ counsel to represent the State of Idaho,” and argued that the Land Board’s recent policy “violates the plain text of Idaho law — as the Attorney General advised the Board before it was adopted.”
In a legal filing last week, attorneys for the Land Board asked the judge to deny the Attorney General’s Office’s request, arguing that Labrador lacked authority and that the Idaho Supreme Court would be a better jurisdiction to consider the issue. 
“The allegation that the AG has supreme constitutional authority to represent the Land Board and ‘State of Idaho’ in state land matters is contrary to the Constitution, statute, caselaw, and the Idaho Rules of Professional Conduct,’” the Land Board’s attorneys wrote. 
The Idaho Attorney General’s Office could not be immediately reached for comment.

Organizations including the Idaho Conservation League, the Idaho Trails Association, the Sawtooth Society, Idaho Rivers United, the Sawtooth Interpretive and Historical Association, the Wood River Trails Coalition and the Environmental Resource Center have partnered with the U.S. Forest Service for the annual cleanup event.
The cleanup campaign began Monday and runs through Sept. 29.
For the event, interested volunteers can sign up online and pick the date they would like to clean up the Sawtooths.
Volunteers can select a cleanup mission in the front country (which organizers define as areas that can be reached by car, such as a developed campground) or in the backcountry (which organizers define as an area that can only be reached by foot, such as a trail in the Sawtooth Wilderness where motorized travel is not allowed).
“While this is a volunteer opportunity and there is a service aspect to it, this is also a great opportunity to go out and enjoy yourself on our public lands and appreciate those lands for yourself and reconnect with why public lands are so special and so important,” said Lexi Black, a Ketchum community engagement associate with the Idaho Conservation League. 
Black said the cleanup campaign is a self-directed effort where volunteers select the date and areas they would like to volunteer on within the Sawtooth National Recreation Area in Central Idaho. The online sign up page lists potential sites for volunteers to choose to protect, such as Pettit Lake or campgrounds at Stanley Lake. But volunteers can also select their own spot to clean up even if it is not listed.
Once they sign up online, volunteers will receive an email with instructions and an opportunity to pick up any materials they will need. 
Last year, 51 volunteers signed up for the cleanup. 
 How recreationists can ‘Leave No Trace’

This year’s public lands cleanup campaign could be especially significant because of federal cuts that reduced the U.S. Forest Service staff, and resulted in reduced hours and cutbacks at local offices in Idaho, including Sawtooth field offices.

One of Idaho’s crown jewels, the Sawtooth National Recreation Area includes jagged mountain peaks, crystal clear alpine lakes, wild rivers, miles of hiking trails and a diverse fish and wildlife habitat. Congress protected the Sawtooth National Recreation Area in 1972 to preserve it.
During the cleanup, volunteers may collect garbage, remove human waste and dismantle illegal fire rings and other artificial manmade structures.
Once they are in the field for the cleanup project, Black encourages volunteers to think about what their area would look like if the previous users practiced Leave No Trace principles. Leave No Trace principles for outdoor recreation include properly disposing of or packing out all waste, minimizing campfire impacts, respecting wildlife and camping and traveling on durable surfaces.
Essentially, Leave No Trace users seek to preserve the outdoors in its natural state and never remove anything natural from the environment.
“When they go through an area, we always encourage them to look for areas where other folks might have left a trace and then going through the effort of undoing that for them,” Black said.
The annual Sawtooth public lands cleanup campaign got its start in 2020. Since the beginning, volunteers have removed a total of 240 industrial size garbage bags full of waste from the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, organizers said.

Beginning October 7, Tennessee will no longer formally track or publicly report on the demographics of individuals interviewed, hired or promoted to jobs in the executive branch of state government. 
Also eliminated is a requirement that state agencies take steps to recruit, promote and hire women and minorities if they are underrepresented in the state government workforce.
The rule change drew pushback from Democrats, a minority on the Republican-dominated Joint Government Operations Committee.
Republican supermajority passes bills to “dismantle” DEI in state, local government

“We won’t have the data to know if there’s a problem or not,” said Rep. G.A. Hardaway, a Memphis Democrat.
The rule redefines Tennessee’s so-called equal employment opportunity plan, which spells out data-gathering requirements for the executive branch.
The data has been used for decades to guide government hiring managers into proactively taking steps to find, recruit and hire qualified individuals from demographic groups that are underrepresented in the government workforce.
The plan was formerly described as “a statistical document that identifies patterns in the participation and utilization of women, minorities, individuals with disabilities and veterans in the workforce.”
The new definition describes the plan as a “statistical document which identifies and analyzes patterns in the participation and utilization of certain groups in the workforce, based on federal and/or state law requirements.”
The rule change was necessary to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order ending affirmative action in government employment for women and minorities and recent state laws that bar Tennessee from taking race, ethnicity, sex or age into account in employment decisions, according to Melanie Koewler, deputy general counsel for the state’s Department of Human Resources. 
Koewler said the state of Tennessee will still be required to track its employment of veterans and people with disabilities under separate federal laws. 
“If you recognize there are deficiencies with women or other socioeconomic groups, will you be able to address those with affirmative steps or not?” Hardaway asked.
If lawmakers or members of the public want to learn how many women or minorities occupy state jobs, they will have to ask, Koewler said.
“Any information that is a public record any citizen can request a report,” she said. “We would receive it and process it just like any other public records request.”

(Photo courtesy of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library) The Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library in Medora may not open to the public until July 4, 2026, but the education and virtual learning events for the 26th president begin next week.
The library is hosting a virtual programming series featuring book talks, discussions of Roosevelt’s favorite recipes and a behind-the-scenes virtual tour of the library. 
Matt Briney, chief communications and marketing officer, said the library plans to hold about two virtual events every month, continuing after the facility opens. In addition, the library will hold in-person events once it opens, including single-day and multi-day symposiums, he said.
“You can fully expect a complete schedule from us moving forward,” Briney said.
The first event on Sept. 22 will feature David Gessner, a creative writing professor for the University of North Carolina Wilmington, and his book, “Leave It As It Is,” which retraces Roosevelt’s footsteps and conservation legacy. 
Many of the virtual events will feature authors who published books on the president that explored a specific time during Roosevelt’s life, such as the 1912 election, his time exploring the Amazon or his time at his North Dakota ranches, according to the event website.

Susan Sarna, senior curator of collections for the library, said those authors provide unique and detailed aspects of Roosevelt’s life, and together give a greater view of the former president’s life as a whole.
With the virtual learning series and exhibits, Sarna said the library is accumulating a one-stop shop of information and artifacts on Roosevelt. About half of the pieces that will be on display are from private collections and never before seen in a public setting, such as a diary Roosevelt kept after the deaths of his wife and mother occurred on the same day, Sarna said.
“At the library, we really try to start from scratch and go all the way through to after his death and how the world was affected by his death,” Sarna said. “No other site has the time, the square footage, to cover all of this and I think that’s one of the most exciting things is that you are going to get a full picture of this man.”
Construction of the library remains on track for its July 2026 grand opening, Briney said.

(Photo courtesy of Tandem Lens)Making America great again.
We’ve heard all about that for more than a decade, with political parties sharply divided over what constitutes greatness. Politicians will continue to grapple with that topic.
For my money, what makes America great again – while putting a shine on the Gem State that is as bright as the morning sun – are the roughly 300 people who attended the recent Idaho Nonprofit Center’s annual conference. Collectively, they had compelling stories to tell, a passion for their causes and a desire to make their communities a better place.
Bea Black is an Idaho success story worth celebrating

Donna Murray-Brown, who delivered a splendid keynote address, described what she saw on the faces in the crowd.
“I saw what I see every day in this sector: extraordinary individuals who believe with every ounce of their being that they can make a difference – and, that working alongside other visionaries, they will make a difference,” she said.
Murray-Brown has plenty of expertise in the field. She is principal of the Louisville-based DMB Coaching and Consulting, LLC, which helps strengthen leadership, culture and strategies for nonprofits nationally and beyond. She’s a former president and CEO of the Michigan Nonprofit Association and served as vice president of strategy and development at the National Council of Nonprofits in Washington, D.C.
“Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of speaking with and learning from nonprofit leaders across the country,” she said. “And no matter where I go, I see the same spirit I saw in Boise – people fueled by vision, driven by purpose and determined to serve their communities in ways that create lasting change.”
Over the two-day session, I met with some of those nonprofit leaders. There’s not enough space to mention them all, but the leaders I met had a clear purpose for their work and a vision for what they want to accomplish. They are dedicating their lives to solving real-life problems in their communities, and not waiting for the government to take action.
In Sandpoint, there’s an organization called Panhandle Special Needs, which focuses on training adults with disabilities in independent living skills that empower them to lead more self-sufficient and fulfilling lives. 
In Twin Falls, there’s a place called Valley House, a shelter for people facing homelessness. It’s not a hand-out, but a hand-up for those wanting to get back on their feet. There are strict requirements for their services, along with some tough love. The winners are those who come out at the other side as productive citizens.
I visited with a representative of the Salmon-based Mahoney House, which offers support and services to survivors of domestic violence (men included) and sexual assault. And there was the Mental Health Coalition of Teton Valley, which serves a gorgeous part of the state where too many suicides occur.
My experience over those two days was educational and exhilarating. But it was a mere sample of what Murray-Brown sees in her travels.
“The energy is inspiring, even as I know many are carrying heavy burdens: growing demand for services, limited resources, staff shortages and lingering burnout from years of serving through crisis,” she said. “My keynote was meant to encourage them and to offer practical ways to keep moving forward while serving the public good day by day.”
Yes, these are the people who are making America great – again and again. Murray-Brown hits the target with her thoughts.
“As a community called America, we all benefit from nonprofits. They are catalysts for change and the source of human solutions to our toughest challenges. And there is great power when each of us contributes – whether by giving our time, our treasure, or our voice – to fuel this work. That investment makes stronger communities possible in every corner of our country.”
Murray-Brown provides leadership and inspiration where it counts.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)The chances that National Guard troops will soon patrol Louisiana cities grew more likely this week when Gov. Jeff Landry voiced support for President Donald Trump’s proposal to send the military into Democrat-led urban centers.
The governor has previously endorsed the president’s idea to direct the Louisiana National Guard into New Orleans, but he’s stopped short of asking Trump to do it. Landry, as governor, has the power to mobilize the Guard on his own and does not need permission or action from the president.
Echoing Trump, Landry framed the idea as a way to curb violent crime in cities, saying the troops can be used as a “force multiplier” to support local police.
“I think the president recognizes that our cities in America are way too violent,” Landry said. “People say, ‘Oh, this is a militarization of our big cities.’ Our cities are already war zones. Too many people are already dying.”
The governor’s comments came at a news conference Tuesday that detailed new state economic development efforts, which Landry said was another reason to curb crime in Louisiana. 
“You can’t have economic opportunity in the face of violence,” he said. “I applaud what the president’s doing. I think what he did in Washington, D.C., is remarkable.”
Trump used his federal authority to bring National Guard troops from around the country to the nation’s capital, despite opposition from Democrat D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. The forces on the ground include 135 military police from the Louisiana National Guard.
The president also supported mobilizing Guard soldiers to Memphis, Tennessee, which also has a Democrat mayor, at the request of Republican Gov. Bill Lee.  
Trump also ordered 700 Marines and more than 4,000 Guard soldiers into downtown Los Angeles to assist federal immigration enforcement against the wishes of Mayor Karen Bass and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, both Democrats who have been highly critical of the president.
Chicago, Baltimore and St. Louis are other Democrat-led cities Trump has mentioned as possibilities for military deployments. 
For weeks, Trump has also mentioned New Orleans as a destination for military troops, and speculation intensified over the weekend after the Washington Post published leaked Pentagon plans to send 1,000 National Guard members to Louisiana. One of the documents, a memo from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, suggests the plan would only move forward if the governor first asked Trump to send the troops. The Guard would be sent to “urban centers” such as New Orleans and Baton Rouge to assist with law enforcement operations, according to the report.
Crime rates are already at a 30-year low in Washington D.C. and a 25-year low in Memphis, according to federal crime data. 
The same has been true for New Orleans, which has seen violent crime plunging over the past few years. Data the FBI has compiled show violent crime rates in New Orleans have fallen significantly over the past several years, reversing what was an upward trend that began around 2010. The federal database includes homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault in its violent crime category.  
Recent local data reveal a similarly significant decrease in New Orleans following a nationwide violent crime spike in 2022. 
So far this year, the city’s homicide rate is down 57% from 2022. Non-fatal shootings, carjackings and armed robberies are all down by even greater amounts, according to the Metropolitan Crime Commission, which analyzes New Orleans Police Department data. 
FBI data indicate a similar plunge in Baton Rouge, with violent crime falling 72% from 2022 through 2024. 
Other cities, such as Lafayette and Shreveport, saw violent crime increase over the same period 79% and 47%, respectively. However, preliminary figures for 2025 show significant improvements in both cities, according to the FBI database. 
Overall, the state reached a 25-year low in violent crime last year, which was 39% below the 1999 mark.
Landry framed the potential National Guard deployment to New Orleans as no different than its assignment after the Jan. 1 terror attack on Bourbon Street. Troops were used to help secure a large section of downtown ahead of the Super Bowl on Feb. 9 and again through Mardi Gras parade season from Feb. 26 through March 6. 
Landry already implemented an alternative to deploying the military in New Orleans by establishing a state police presence there last year. Troop NOLA is a detachment of roughly 40 Louisiana State Police troopers who supplement New Orleans Police efforts with additional patrols in the French Quarter and other neighborhoods. 
The latest proposal from the governor and president differs from the Guard’s time in New Orleans earlier this year, said retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, who’s best known for taking over the military response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. 
The federal government designated the Super Bowl and Mardi Gras as top-level security events, while the proposed deployment would be for routine law enforcement, Honoré said. 
“It’s not a normal mission for the guard to do crime fighting,” the general said. “But they have provided security before.”
Troops would not likely be used in any sort of investigatory roles, Honoré said. They could detain people until law enforcement arrives, but their primary use would be as a visible crime deterrent, he added. 
Honoré said using Guard troops to detain or arrest people would likely require them to be armed, and he believes the ideal soldiers for that role would be the Louisiana National Guard’s military police batallion, which the governor sent to D.C. last month Honoré said. 
The use of National Guard troops to achieve political purposes, such as Trump’s immigration crackdown, crosses a line, the general said. 
“That’s the mission I’m most uncomfortable with,” Honoré said. “I’m concerned about the immigrant community and what’s gonna happen to our essential workers.”
The Louisiana National Guard did not respond to a request for comment for this report.
Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser, who oversees tourism promotion for Louisiana, said he’s been fighting for years to bring crime down in tourist areas such as the French Quarter. Speaking on the phone from a promotional tour in Montreal, Canada, Nungesser said Landry’s establishment of Troop NOLA has been beneficial to tourism and questioned whether the military would be necessary.
“As far as whether it’s actually needed to fight crime, I don’t really have a strong feeling about it one way or the other,” he said. 
Nungesser said a better solution would be for the president to send more money to the state to fund law enforcement agencies here. 
“I think a grant from the president could do a lot more long term instead of just sending some troops down temporarily,” he said.

(Photo courtesy of State Senate Democratic Committee) City of Racine transit and mobility director Trevor Jung is running as a Democrat for southeast Wisconsin state Senate District 21 — the final of three districts that Democrats aim to flip in 2026 to help them capture the Senate majority. 
“I owe everything to my hometown,” Jung, who was born in Russia and raised in Racine, told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview. “This is a special place with a lot of warmth and compassion… The state really has turned its back on places like the neighborhood that I grew up in, and whether you’re in Racine or Franklin or Greendale, the state has really neglected us.”  
Jung launched his campaign on Tuesday from the waterfront in Racine, and was joined by some current lawmakers, including Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison) and Sen. Dora Drake (D-Milwaukee). 
“For me, this is about giving back to the place that gave me everything, and focusing on affordability, good paying jobs and making sure that we avoid what everybody is really sick of, which is the nastiness, the politics that too often turn people,” Jung said. 
Democrats, who haven’t held a majority in either legislative chamber in over 15 years, need to flip two seats and hold their current seats in order to win the Senate majority in 2026.  
Along with SD 21, Wisconsin Democrats are aiming to flip are Senate District 17, currently represented by Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green), and Senate District 5, currently represented by Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield).
The 21st district’s incumbent, Sen. Van Wanggaard (R-Racine), has served in the Senate for the last decade. He was first elected to the Senate in 2010, but lost a recall election in 2012.  Wanggaard was unchallenged during his most recent general election in 2022. In his 2018 reelection bid, he beat the Democratic candidate with nearly 60% of the vote.
But this year the district has changed considerably under new maps adopted in 2024.The current district encompasses part of Racine County, including the northern part of the city, and part of Milwaukee County, including Franklin, Hales Corner, Greendale and Greenfield. 
According to an analysis by John Johnson, a research fellow at Marquette University, the area encompassed by the new district lines leaned Democratic by 1 percentage point in the 2024 presidential election and by 2.2 percentage points in the 2024 U.S. Senate race. 
“You’re going to have to earn every vote,” Jung said of the district. “We’re going to be out there. We’re going to be listening to people. We’re going to be having conversations about what priorities residents of the district have, and we’re going to make sure that folks know that this is not about left or right. This is about building relationships and solving problems and having honest conversations about how the state can work together with the private sector and local government to make the quality of life better for people who live in southeast Wisconsin.”
Shortly after Jung’s campaign announcement, Wanggaard criticized the Democratic candidate in a statement.
“While Trevor is a nice, friendly, soft spoken young man, he uses that to hide his crazy liberal ideas that are more at home in San Francisco than in Milwaukee and Racine counties,” Wanggaard said. “Do not be mistaken — he is every bit an extreme Madison/California liberal as there is. He will vote in lockstep with everything the Democrats stand for — from raising taxes to allowing boys in girls’ locker rooms.” 
Wanggaard said in a statement that he plans to make a decision about whether to run near the end of this year. In his most recent campaign finance report, he reported raising only $0.80 this year.
“My timeline for making a decision whether or not to run for another term remains the same,” Wanggaard said. “As I stated last November, last January, and in July, I will continue to discuss another term with my family and friends.”
Wanggaard said that he has been receiving support and encouragement to run. 
“The priorities for the next term will remain the same, and what I’ve heard throughout the district — grow the economy, improve public safety, eliminate fraud and abuse, and protect the vulnerable,” Wanggaard said. 
Jung said he will run a positive campaign focused on the issues that matter to people in the district.  
“While my opponent is going to try to make whatever the national narrative is that’s focused on politics and name calling, we’re going to be focused on having a vision for making people’s lives better in Wisconsin,” Jung said, adding that it is still unclear who his opponent ultimately will be.
Jung said his campaign is about responding to people’s needs. 
“We’ve got dramatic cuts in shared revenue to make sure that we’ve got proper public services and public safety,” Jung said. “You have the state of Wisconsin ranking 27th in spending per pupil in our public schools, when just a generation ago, we were one of the best states in the nation in terms of making sure our students have what they need to succeed.”
Jung said the 2023 changes to shared revenue were a “Band-Aid” for local communities such as his and that he wants to ensure public schools have adequate funding. 
“We’re funding two education systems, and that’s not efficient,” Jung said, referring to the expansion of taxpayer-funded private schools — though he fell short of saying he’d want to see an end to the state’s school voucher system. 
Jung said in his current position in Racine city government, he and others have worked to expand transit service to the Social Security office as a way to ensure that elderly and disabled residents are able to access their benefits. He said they have also worked to prioritize savings, by helping bring down the cost of public transit, service, by ensuring people get the most out of public transit and sustainability, through environmentally conscious decisions. 
In his current role, which he plans to continue as he runs for state Senate, Jung said that he has seen the state of Wisconsin fail to be an adequate partner. 
“Instead of being an ally in that work to save local government money and to deliver better service, in large part, they’ve been an adversary,” Jung said. “They too often focused on national politics rather than getting stuff done for people at the local level.” 
This isn’t Jung’s first time running for public office. He previously served as the youngest member of the Racine Common Council, elected at age 23. He ran for the office after graduating from University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee with a degree in urban studies and a focus on urban planning. 
His position on the common council, Jung said, “gave me a really good insight into, because of levy limits and revenue constraints and shared revenue, cuts that we had to make — really difficult decisions that we shouldn’t have had to make because of the state turning its back.”
Jung said that he has several priorities that he would want to work on in the state Senate that boil down to what he calls the “five Ts”: talent, training, transportation, technology and tourism. 
“If we get those right, Wisconsin can be one of the fastest growing states in the union,” he said. 
“What do we do to keep young people here and attract the next generation of talent in order to be a competitive place?” Jung asked rhetorically. “We need to work with organized labor and create a pipeline for the skilled trades so that people have access to family-supporting jobs.” 
Jung said that the state also needs to support public transportation, “whether that’s a robust public transportation system that gets people to work, doctor’s appointments, school or investing in alternatives to the personal vehicle, like transit and rail.” 
“We’ve got this new revolution in robotics and green energy and advanced manufacturing,” he added. “What can we do to make sure that Wisconsin is a place that is a leader in these new sectors?”
“This is the most beautiful state in the country,” Jung said, laying out his argument that tourism can do more for the economy. “Southeastern Wisconsin has an incredible architecture on the shores of Lake Michigan. We have a beautiful opportunity to make sure that visitors coming here can sustain the quality of life for residents who live here.” 
Jung said the state needs new energy and leadership that rejects “austerity” in favor of “investment.” 
“We need a positive vision for the future,” Jung said. “I’m excited about the youthful energy that we can bring to this campaign, but also looking forward to collaborating with people of all different walks of life to make sure that this is a well rounded and informed effort.”

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A coalition of Colorado environmental groups is crying foul over a settlement state officials quietly reached with Suncor Energy over the terms of a water quality permit for its Commerce City refinery earlier this year.
The settlement agreement stems from a challenge that Suncor filed to an updated water discharge permit issued by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment in 2024. The department’s Water Quality Control Division agreed in the July 23 settlement to suspend several key permit requirements, including a provision sought by environmental and community groups to require public notification any time a water quality limit was exceeded.
“The agreement walks that back significantly, and creates this complicated three-tiered structure on just how bad it has to be before there’s any public notification,” said Ian Coghill, an attorney with Earthjustice. “All that data is still going to be public, but it’s going to take a lot longer for people to be able to have access to it, or know that any exceedances or violations actually happened.”

The sprawling Suncor facility, one of Colorado’s largest sources of air pollution, has also drawn scrutiny in recent years for its repeated violations of water quality standards. Under the federal Clean Water Act, Suncor has a state-issued permit to discharge into Sand Creek, a 14-mile-long tributary that flows into the South Platte River just north of the refinery site.
Concerns from environmental groups center on pollutants like benzene and PFAS, a set of compounds known as “forever chemicals” that can lead to a variety of adverse health outcomes. Water regulators at CDPHE toughened restrictions on Suncor through a series of permit renewals beginning in 2021.
Critics, however, say the new restrictions didn’t go far enough. Represented by Earthjustice, a coalition that includes Denver Trout Unlimited, GreenLatinos, and the Colorado Sierra Club has filed its own appeal to Suncor’s March 2024 discharge permit, seeking lower PFAS limits, an accelerated compliance schedule, groundwater protections and more. That appeal, filed last year, is still pending.










Communities living in the shadow of Suncor have borne the brunt of toxic pollution for decades, and once again their voices have been shut out.


– Jessica Herrera, counsel with GreenLatinos


The same groups had also intervened as parties in Suncor’s own appeal process. But despite their intervenor status, they say they weren’t notified of CDPHE’s July 23 settlement with the company “until several weeks after it had been signed.”
“It’s really the behind-the-scenes way that all this has operated that’s one of the most concerning elements of it,” Coghill said. “No one’s approved it, no one was involved in the negotiations. It was just kind of dumped.”
Some permit conditions take immediate effect
In a statement, Kaitlyn Beekman, a Water Quality Control Division spokesperson, said the groups were aware of settlement discussions, and the agreement “ensures faster public health protections without the uncertainty of litigation.”
“This agreement is a win for Colorado and for nearby communities because it allows the vast majority of the new, stronger permit conditions — especially those tied to public health protections — to take effect immediately,” Beekman said. “This means stronger limits for PFAS and other organic chemicals, tighter inspection and public notice requirements, and greater accountability without delay.”
The settlement agreement will also allow Suncor to avoid the 2024 permit’s limitations on salt effluent. High salinity levels can impact wildlife and agriculture but “there are no acute public health effects associated with these levels,” Beekman wrote.
Denver Trout Unlimited has advocated for strengthened water quality protections for Sand Creek since an angler’s discovery of an oil spill near the refinery in 2011 led to scrutiny of the waterway’s benzene levels. Meanwhile, Suncor’s location amid the predominantly low-income and Latino neighborhoods on Denver’s north side has long sparked environmental justice concerns.
“Communities living in the shadow of Suncor have borne the brunt of toxic pollution for decades, and once again their voices have been shut out,” Jessica Herrera, counsel with GreenLatinos, said in a statement. “A closed-door deal that weakens permit protections is not just a bureaucratic failure, it is a betrayal of the Latino, immigrant, and working-class families who live, work, and play along these waterways.”

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)A Memphis lawmaker who opposes the deployment of National Guard troops to the city’s streets is urging Tennessee’s governor to place them under the “direct leadership” of the local police chief.
Democratic Rep. Jesse Chism said he recognizes the “seriousness” of Memphis’ public safety problems but wants to make sure troops ordered to Memphis by President Donald Trump, with the approval of Gov. Bill Lee, work with city police rather than undermining the force.
“The National Guard should supplement trained law enforcement, not replace it,” said Chism, chairman of the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, in a letter to Lee.
Memphis Police statistics show crime is down some 22% over the last year, because of new strategies and community efforts, he said.

“It is vital that these gains are not lost and that our city is not made to look or feel like a military state. Residents need to see that this deployment is about reinforcing their safety, not instilling fear,” Chism’s letter said.
Backed by Lee, U.S. Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty and federal officials, Trump set up a “Memphis Safe Task Force” this week and directed the Tennessee National Guard to the majority Black city. The force will include the U.S. Marshals Service, FBI, Drug Enforcement Agency, Homeland Security Investigations and U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.
Trump is further testing the bounds of the law by ordering troops to a city. At least one appeals court found his deployment of the California National Guard to Los Angeles amid protests over his immigration policies was illegal.
Chism is requesting the force be placed under the direction of Memphis Police Chief C.J. Davis. He points out Memphis officers have the expertise to deal with local residents and should lead a coordinated effort.
In addition, Chism asked federal and state governments to keep providing resources for law enforcement, community programs and other initiatives that strengthen schools and economic opportunities.
While Chism is calling for a “unified command,” Memphis City Council member Jerri Green, a Democratic candidate for governor, introduced a resolution with five colleagues urging Lee to reverse his stance and stop Guard troops from going into Memphis. 










Sending in troops is not a solution – it distracts from the real work of tackling poverty, strengthening families and creating opportunity.


– Memphis Councilmember Jerri Green


With a vote expected Sept. 25, she is backed by Memphis Interfaith Coalition for Action and Hope (MICAH), Memphis for All, labor unions and Tennessee Immigration & Refugee Rights Coalition.
“Public safety comes from opportunity not occupation,” Green said in a statement. “Sending in troops is not a solution – it distracts from the real work of tackling poverty, strengthening families and creating opportunity.”
The League of Women Voters at local, state and national levels also opposed the deployment, saying Memphis is the “latest target” of the Trump administration’s attack on U.S. cities, despite a reduction in crime and without consultation with Shelby County and Memphis officials. The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the move as well.
Shelby County’s Republican lawmakers have largely supported the troop deployment to Memphis.
Republican Rep. John Gillespie of Memphis filed House Bill 1445 Wednesday creating a fund to recruit law enforcement officers to departments with 10% vacancies. A release from the House Republican Caucus said Memphis hit a 20-year low in police staffing this year, according to the Memphis Police Association.
Lawmakers would need to approve the funding, and the state treasurer could invest money to bolster grants.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island had a higher percentage of children living in poverty in 2024 than any other New England state, according to an analysis of new census data.
Last year, the Ocean State’s child poverty rate rose from 13.4% to 16.3%, which made it the highest in New England. The Ocean State ranked 33rd nationally, according to new American Community Survey (ACS) data analyzed by Rhode Island KIDS COUNT.
The survey conducted annually by the U.S. Census Bureau counted 32,549 children experiencing poverty, up from the 26,901 children in 2023.
In 2024, the federal poverty threshold was defined as $26,650 for a family of three with one adult and two children, and $32,150 for a family of four with two adults and two children.
While this ACS data does not offer more granular breakdowns — like the percentage of children living in deep poverty, defined as living with less than half of the federal threshold — Rhode Island KIDS COUNT’s Executive Director Paige Parks said the news is still a cause for concern.
“I think sometimes in Rhode Island, we may feel like we are different than other states,” Parks said. “New England is very much known for doing well in many rankings, but this is where we are not, and we cannot ignore how many children are living in poverty in Rhode Island. I mean, we rank last in all of New England.”
KIDS COUNT examines the ACS estimates every year as one dataset which informs its annual Factbook, a compendium of data on children in Rhode Island and their wellbeing. The Rhode Island outfit of KIDS COUNT is one state-level affiliate of the nationwide Annie E. Casey Foundation, which collects data and produces similar reports in all 50 states. 
Children who live in poverty — especially those who experience poverty for a long time — “have many negative outcomes into adulthood that follow them,” Parks said.
“It is the indicator that is connected to every single data point that we collect in the Factbook,” Parks said.
A 618-page consensus study by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2019 titled “A Roadmap to Reducing Child Poverty” concluded that the evidence is strong and plentiful for childhood poverty causing negative outcomes, rather than just being correlated to them. The report’s recommendations include expanding public health insurance, Earned Income Tax Credits, and food stamps to improve children’s outcomes.
The academies also estimated that childhood poverty dents the U.S. GDP by about 4% to 5.4% every year, which amounted to about $800 billion to $1.1 trillion in 2018. The expert panel cited Impoverished children growing up to earn less as adults, incurring criminal justice system-related costs, or suffering poorer health and its negative consequences as contributing factors.
Housing and inflation are culprits
A number of pandemic-era social supports expired in 2024, but the end of these subsidies did not alone create Rhode Island’s jump in child poverty, Parks said.
“The cost of housing continues to increase. Inflation continues to increase, and the pay that families are receiving just is not keeping up with the increase in cost of living in Rhode Island,” Parks said. “That’s a major contributor to this.”
According to the Factbook, the average rent was $2,316 for a two-bedroom apartment in Rhode Island in 2024. A person needed to make about three times the minimum wage — $44.54 an hour, or about $92,671 a year —  to afford that rent without being cost-burdened, defined as spending more than a third of income on housing. Overall, rents have risen by 17% since 2020.  
A slightly more recent annual report from Washington D.C.-based Out of Reach found Rhode Island renters need to earn $31.71 an hour, equivalent to $65,954 a year, to afford the typical two-bedroom apartment priced at $1,614 a month. That report also noted that costs swing by region, with places like Aquidneck Island exhibiting pricier estimates.
A report released Tuesday by the Providence City Council’s Housing Crisis Task Force further underlines the housing market’s escalating costs and pressures in the capital city, where there have been more than 24,000 evictions since 2020. 
“Nationally, households with children are twice as likely as other households to be threatened with eviction, and Black renters are about five times more likely to be evicted than white renters,” according to the KIDS COUNT Factbook.
Federal changes cause for concern
The survey data shows that the rate of children lacking health insurance also climbed modestly — a little under one percentage point — to 3.7% in 2024. That means about 8,087 young Rhode Islanders under 19 were without health coverage, although the state still ranks high nationally on this metric and is 12th overall.
A sea change in federal funding policies — including cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or colloquially as food stamps — has organizations like KIDS COUNT worried about the future.
Parks cited H.R. 1 — legislation perhaps best known by its sobriquet, The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, as an uneasy omen for programs affecting children’s welfare. Signed into law on July 4, the bill package installs new requirements for social programs. 
An Urban Institute estimate from May 2025 found that about 13,000 Rhode Island families — including an approximate 3,000 families with children — would lose some or all SNAP benefits under the legislation’s expanded work reporting rules, for an average per-family monthly loss of about $227. Parks said these losses could then ripple to services like free school lunches and breakfasts, which often use federal markers like SNAP enrollment to determine eligibility.
“When we see national reports about how people in poverty are impacted by federal changes, I hope Rhode Islanders are not misled to think that they’re not talking about us,” Parks said. “We’re talking about us. We’re talking about our kids. We’re not doing great by our kids in poverty.”
Parks called for continued investment in Rhode Island Works, the state’s cash assistance program. Rhode Island Works now pays eligible families a monthly benefit that varies by income, housing situation and family size. Monthly earnings would include $701 for a family of two, $865 for a family of three, and $990 for a family of four.
Parks also said the state could improve its earned income tax credit of 16%, which lags compared to 40% in Massachusetts and Connecticut.

Jared Polis, a Democrat, to call a second special session of the Colorado Legislature to address crime in the state. 
U.S. Reps. Lauren Boebert of Windsor, Jeff Crank of Colorado Springs and Gabe Evans of Fort Lupton said in a letter to Polis that the Legislature needs to make changes to several crime-related bills that have passed since the governor took office. The bills are related to cash bail, personal recognizance bonds, sentencing, competency to stand trial, and cooperation with federal law enforcement on immigration enforcement. 
The letter says surveys and data show that Coloradans don’t feel safe and worry about crime daily, and that the state and Denver by some measures are both ranked as dangerous.

“Coloradans know the truth — that despite the meager improvements in some crime rates from their record highs in 2022 — they still don’t feel safe in our state,” the letter says. 
State data shows that violent crime and property crime in Colorado have both decreased over the last two years. Denver data shows that violent crime and property crime have decreased in the city over the last three years as well.

In a press call on the letter, Evans said the crime issue in Colorado is unique to the state and is tied directly to Democratic policies approved at the state Capitol. 
“We can’t work together when the rhetoric coming out of the state Capitol says one thing, and the policies and the bills that get signed into law are 180 degrees the opposite direction,” Evans said. 
The Republicans’ letter said Denver was ranked as more dangerous than Washington, D.C., where President Donald Trump has activated National Guard troops to address crime in the city. Trump has deployed military troops to other American cities controlled, like Denver, by Democrats, such as Los Angeles and Memphis. Evans said that action in Washington, D.C., is unique to that city because it is “at all times under federal control,” and federal law is “really clear” that “federal troops can’t engage in policing actions” unless there are specific circumstances and exceptions. 
“You have to have state governors involved any time that there’s a National Guard deployment for a policing action, which of course brings us right back to the fact that we have a governor who is unwilling to engage in making communities safe and unwilling to allocate the resources necessary,” Evans said. 
Bill passed with bipartisan support
U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat, refuted the claim that crime in the city she represents is growing. She said in a statement that “my colleagues from outside of Denver should worry about the crime rates in the cities they represent.”
The letter came in response to a Sept. 8 post on X from the Weld County Sheriff’s Office alerting residents that a person being released from custody presented “a potential danger to the community” after courts deemed him not competent to stand trial. The post attributed the release to House Bill 24-1034, which limits how long a person can remain in custody once deemed incompetent. 
That bill passed the Legislature with bipartisan support and passed the Senate unanimously. The Republicans said in their letter that they “could not help but respond with bewilderment” to Polis’ reaction in a post on X calling the Weld County situation “absolutely unacceptable,” even though he signed that bill into law. 
Boebert, Crank and Evans said they would have welcomed Polis naming public safety as a subject of the special session he called in August to address an approximately $750 million gap in the state’s budget that followed the passage of the federal tax cut and spending law, also known as H.R. 1, in July. 
In a statement, Polis said he will collaborate with local officials and the federal congressional delegation to improve public safety, even if that means “fixing or eliminating any bills that are hurting public safety.” Evans said addressing public safety needs to be a collaborative effort, too, but added “the state does not want to be part of that team” and that “the rhetoric is all right, the policies are all wrong.” 
The Republicans in Congress who wrote to Polis “are attempting to distract Coloradans from issues they own,” Polis said, noting that cuts in H.R. 1 are what led to the recent special session. The Trump administration is withholding public safety funding from Colorado, Polis added, which he said he hopes will draw “the same outrage from these members of Congress.”
“Many of the laws in this letter had bipartisan support at the legislature. I’ll partner with anyone to reduce crime, and we are actively working with District Attorneys, the Colorado Department of Human Services, and legislators on a policy solution related to HB24-1034,” Polis said in a statement. “I would encourage these members to do their part to support Coloradans and help fix the problems within the federal government.”
In a letter responding to Boebert, Crank and Evans, Polis said they should focus on avoiding a government shutdown and advocate the extension of premium tax credits to avoid rising health insurance costs. He mentioned the federal public safety funds being withheld from Colorado and asked them to “get to work and get us our public safety money.”
Crank said in the press call that Polis is “gaslighting and blaming it on someone else” by focusing on federal policies in his response. He said if Polis does not have enough funding to reduce crime, “it’s because he didn’t make it a priority.” Concern about crime is “one of the top issues” Crank said he hears from constituents in his district.

The street — a thoroughfare for Lewisburg — is home to restaurants, art galleries, boutiques and more. (Photo by Chris Jackson/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia is so poor, miserable, and misgoverned that it bans abortion and suicide in desperation to make people live here. Former Gov. Jim Justice paid people and businesses to move in. As for the current Gov. Patrick Morrisey, I suspect his proposed artificial intelligence farms are part of a secret plot to manufacture and sneak in robot West Virginians programmed to vote anti-woke.
If our governors and Legislature were actually awake, maybe they would get the bright idea to populate West Virginia adequately by improving the quality of life here. It would also encourage incoming people to stay, like doctors with foreign backgrounds who often hang around only a few years (including my cancer doctor who grew up in Brooklyn).
But don’t expect West Virginia’s stuck-up ruling class to do much for the rest of us: It is not their way. Instead, we must find our own ways, whatever they might be. Here are a few West Virginia ways of life that I recommend for us common folk:
Country
If you were raised like me (or even weren’t), you might be attracted to country roads. I grew up in a house built by my father and maternal grandfather (no running water, electricity or phones). My father worked in the coal mines while my mother kept house, gardened and raised chickens and hogs. And surprise, they had no bills and a growing bank account.
With no television or electronic games, my three brothers and I spent half our time in the woods and streams or reading. My mother canned stuff, and we all fished and hunted (everybody a crack shot). We ate a healthy, even gourmet diet. When was the last time you had crackling cornbread, squirrel and dumplings, or delicious roast groundhog (vegetarian-fed)?
If you have or can acquire land in the country (often cheaply), hold on to it: It is a key to independence and happiness for you and your immediate family and to pass on to following generations. It’s still possible to live a good country life, especially now with all the modern conveniences and automobiles.
I know families who live in quiet parklike settings, grow their own pesticide-free organic vegetables, have full freezers of deer and turkeys they shoot from their back porch, and spend much of their time outdoors. They tend to work at jobs as needed and change often, since most pay low wages anyhow.
Today a lot of country property comes with housing, sometimes old and rundown, but it can be fixed up gradually. If there’s no housing, you can install a trailer permanently or while you build your own dream house and shape the landscaping, preferably away from floods and forest fires caused by the changing climate.
Computers
 My ideal house is something like the Farnsworth House in Plano, Illinois., by architect Mies van der Rohe, or Fallingwater in Mill Run, Pennsylvania, by architect Frank Lloyd Wright. These are architectural masterpieces, originally very expensive, now museums. Just their cost of admission is out of my price range ($42 for Fallingwater).
But potentially, with West Virginia’s tradition of glassmaking, supply of cement and rock (even mine waste) and heavy equipment, affordable housing using similar techniques and fire-resistant materials could be mass-produced here, maybe in modular form. With cement or steel girders, such houses could be firmly attached to hillsides and perched on ridges.
This upscale lifestyle, supported by computers and other communication devices, might attract retirees, business owners and remote workers escaping cities and seeking cool breezes and scenic views. Yet some parts of West Virginia are close enough to big cities like Cleveland, Ohio; Pittsburgh and Washington, D.C., for occasional commuting.
As mentioned above, West Virginia has an incentive program to attract remote workers and business owners (see Ascendwv.com). They should check tax laws to avoid possible income tax in two states. Unfortunately, people already living in West Virginia are not eligible.
Communes
At the other extreme are the many West Virginians struggling economically or personally. Sometimes they can find or create communal living arrangements, where people share equally, socialize and provide each other moral support, reflecting some old West Virginia traditions. These arrangements typically need startup funding or property from governments, charities or individuals but then are expected to sustain themselves.
An example is the network of well-run drug-and-alcohol rehab centers that have grown up in West Virginia in response to the state’s drug crisis, now staffed mostly by people in recovery and attracting clients from other states. It is uncertain how much this vital program will be damaged by expected cuts in Medicaid.
Other examples (not necessarily found in West Virginia but needed) are more long-term or permanent, like homes for autistic adults or the homeless, communal farms or other co-ops, employee-owned businesses and retirement centers owned and run by the seniors themselves.
Some people join communes just because they enjoy the lifestyle, like the flower children of my generation or the lost and lovelorn of today. The more the better, I say.

(Campaign photo courtesy of Hendrickson)Calling affordability the top issue, child care provider and advocate Corrine Hendrickson launched her bid Wednesday to be the Democratic nominee for the state Senate’s 17th District seat in 2026.
“A lot of people are getting priced out of their homes because property taxes are too high, because our state refuses to invest in the local school districts, the local fire districts, municipalities, highways, counties — and so the local people have to absorb the cost themselves or go without the services,” Hendrickson said in an interview.
“And so communities that are doing OK are increasing their own property taxes, but it’s pricing people out of their houses,” she added. “Other communities can’t do that.”
The 17th District encompasses Crawford, Grant, Green, Iowa and LaFayette counties and the southwestern corner of Dane County. Sen. Howard Marklein (R-Spring Green) currently represents the district.
Hendrickson formally filed to run Sept. 2, but rolled out her campaign Wednesday with an announcement in a local park in her hometown of New Glarus.
Two other Democrats have announced campaigns in the district: State Rep. Jenna Jacobson (D-Oregon) and Lisa White of Potosi, a small business owner.
Hendrickson said most of the counties in the district have lost population — a symptom of unmet needs in rural Wisconsin.
“Something that we really need to look at is the infrastructure of our communities and how do we bring businesses and people back in and how do we make them vibrant again,” she said. “And we really just need to start investing — and that means fair taxation.”
It also means funding services such as quality child care, Hendrickson said, rather than saddling parents with the entire cost.
Hendrickson has been steeped in the child care issue, operating a home-based family child care business for 18 years, and founding with her friend and care provider colleague, Brooke Legler, the advocacy organization WECAN to push for more state child care funding. The name stands for Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed.
While the 2025-27 state budget included some direct child care funding for the first time, Hendrickson is among providers who were frustrated that the amount — $110 million for one year — fell short of the nearly $500 million that providers spent months campaigning for. After the budget was signed, she closed her child care operation at the end of August because she felt the state support wasn’t enough to sustain it.
While virtually every Democratic hopeful for the state Legislature has mentioned child care support as a talking point, Hendrickson said she brings to the subject “the personal lived experience” of a care provider.
But she said she has also gained knowledge from care providers and child care experts across the country and studied how states such as Vermont and New Mexico have begun to include broad support for child care in their state budgets.
“I have the opportunity to talk to people within the actual field and bring the ideas to them and say, ‘how does this actually work for you in your business?’” Hendrickson said.
As a candidate her agenda is broader than child care, and as an elected official, she would consult the expertise of others on public policy, she said.
“We shouldn’t have to be experts in everything,” Hendrickson said. “We should know experts in everything that we can then turn to and ask — whether they voted for us or not — like, is this a good idea? Does it solve the problem? Does it create new problems?”
Hendrickson served one term on the New Glarus school board from 2020 to 2023. She also has been involved in her community, leading Cub Scouts, active in parent-teacher organizations and building WECAN with Legler, she said.

Instead of recommending broad availability, the agency restricted access only to people aged 65 and older, or those under 65 with a high risk condition. And just last week, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. nodded to vaccine restriction in his new MAHA report, which is essentially a list of 128 health priorities he hopes to achieve.
Now, there is another major group that will have limited access to COVID-19 vaccines: health care workers.
The shift in vaccine policy is more than just a technical medical change. RFK Jr. has disrupted the evidence-based, established process for approving and determining who will benefit most from vaccines. Although RFK Jr. pledged he wouldn’t “take away anybody’s vaccines,” the recent actions by the FDA will significantly decrease health care personnel access to COVID-19 vaccines. That carries real risk for patients and providers alike.
I know this because I’ve experienced it firsthand.

As an infectious disease physician in Colorado, I have treated many patients with COVID-19. Patients like Ms. J., who was a young healthy college soccer player who ended up on a ventilator in the critical care unit. Thankfully, she survived with the support and dedication of her critical care team, specialty physicians, nurses, advance practice practitioners, and respiratory therapists.
Health care personnel, or HCP, treated her each day in homemade hair covers, eye shields, respirators and gowns even before the availability of the vaccine. We did it to uphold our duty and calling to heal the sick and save lives, and to improve the health of individuals and communities throughout Colorado and beyond. However, being on the front lines is not without risks. After watching patients and sometimes even staff acquire infections in the hospital, I now specialize in infection prevention, and am on a mission to ensure health care is safe for patients and HCP alike.
The evidence is clear that HCP are known to be at increased risk for exposure to COVID-19. Assisting patients with activities of daily living and working in a hospital — rather than other health care settings — has been shown to be particularly high risk for acquiring COVID-19. In addition, health care workers can serve as a source of transmission of COVID-19. This can lead to outbreaks of hospital-acquired COVID-19 among staff and patients in hospitals.
COVID vaccines have proven safe and effective for preventing symptomatic COVID-19 among HCP. Vaccination of HCP helps reduce staffing shortages and maintains a healthy workforce, ensuring that we do not see a repeat of hospital beds filling up and patients denied care. It is true that many HCP choose not to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, with coverage rates between about 15% to 30%.
However, they had a choice. We should not take immunization choices away from those who would choose protection. If it is not recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, whose members were ousted and replaced with new decision makers, several of whom have made anti-vaccine claims, many health care facilities may not not offer it due to logistical considerations of requiring a prescription, eligibility determination, and cost.
Amidst all these changes, there has been limited explanation to the reasoning behind major decisions such as leaving out HCP when it comes to COVID vaccine recommendations.
Did they deliberately leave HCP off the list? Or was it an oversight due to side-stepping the previously established, rigorous, multistep vaccine approval and recommendation process?
Similar to the move to restrict COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women — despite the overwhelming evidence that the vaccines are safe and effective — there has been very little explanation given to the public for not recommending COVID-19 vaccines for HCP. These inconsistencies in the new recommendations underlie the importance of a transparent and evidence-based vaccine approval process.
It is unclear if the ACIP will amend the list of high risk conditions. If they do, they should remember the nation’s doctors, nurses, caretakers and other critical HCP. Due to the increased risk to HCP and to patients, COVID-19 vaccines should be available to all HCP who would like protection. Their choice — and protection — should not be taken away because of political beliefs without scientific evidence.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Early voting begins Friday in Virginia’s high-stakes general election, opening a six-week window for voters to cast their ballots in races for governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, all 100 seats of the House of Delegates and some local offices. This year’s early voting period arrives with several notable changes to state election law, including a shorter registration deadline and new reporting requirements for provisional ballots.
According to the Virginia Department of Elections, in-person early voting runs from Friday, Sept. 19 through Saturday, Nov. 1. The agency reminds Virginians that every county and city must offer early voting, but that voters are only allowed to vote early in the jurisdiction in which they are registered.
On the gubernatorial ticket, Democrat Abigail Spanberger faces Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the GOP nominee. For lieutenant governor, state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, is opposed by conservative radio show host John Reid. In the attorney general contest, incumbent Republican Jason Miyares is being challenged by Democrat Jay Jones.
This fall marks the first general election under a revised registration schedule. The deadline to register is now 11 days before an election — Oct. 24 this year — instead of the 22-day cutoff that applied in previous years.
After that date, Virginians can still register through same-day registration, but those ballots are cast provisionally and verified later. Registrars must also now report the number of provisional ballots at the precinct level, a change state officials say will improve transparency.
Early voting locations vary by locality; some jurisdictions operate multiple satellite sites with different hours of operation, while others rely on a single registrar’s office. Voters must bring an acceptable form of identification to cast a ballot, though anyone lacking an ID can still vote provisionally. 
Curbside voting remains available for Virginians over 65 or those with disabilities, and voters with visual or manual dexterity impairments can mark absentee ballots using electronic tools. 
Absentee voting also begins Friday, with ballots mailed to military and overseas voters as well as those who have already requested them. 
Any registered voter can apply for an absentee ballot online, by mail, or in person without giving a reason. The deadline to request a mailed absentee ballot is Oct. 24. Completed ballots may be returned by mail, delivered to a registrar’s office, or placed in designated drop boxes during the early voting period or on Election Day. To be counted, mailed ballots must be postmarked by Nov. 4 and received by noon on Nov. 7.
Election officials and candidates alike are urging Virginians not to wait. 
“With early voting in Virginia’s general elections beginning on Friday, I encourage all eligible Virginians to get registered, double check their registration status, and make a plan to vote early or on Election Day,” Spanberger, the Democratic nominee for governor, said in a statement. 
The expansion of early voting in Virginia is still relatively new. Lawmakers approved no-excuse absentee voting and broadened access to early in-person voting beginning in 2020, aligning the commonwealth with many other states. 
Studies have found those reforms boosted participation. Analysis by the Center for Election Innovation & Research shows that voting before Election Day has steadily increased since the changes, helping reduce long lines at polling places and raising turnout overall.
In fact, Virginia’s turnout in the 2024 presidential election was estimated at 73%, well above the national average. Election experts say the extended early voting period, combined with mail-in options, made it easier for people with demanding schedules or long commutes to participate. 
“The one thing we know above all about early voting is that it’s very popular. A lot of people would prefer to vote ahead of time, particularly if they don’t have to provide an excuse,” said Stephen Farnsworth, a political scientist at the University of Mary Washington.  
“The people who vote early are usually the most intense partisans, people who vote Democratic or Republican, no matter when they voted,” Farnsworth said. “This enables the campaigns to focus on those voters who are less likely to turn out, or maybe more persuadable. And so it serves a great purpose for the campaigns to have those partisan voters locked in early.” 
Analysts also note that the elderly and military families have made particularly heavy use of absentee ballots in recent cycles.
“It’s important to know that this is a great assistance to older voters who might find it more difficult to get to the polls on Election Day in terms of transportation, and to military voters, who are away from their home precincts,” Farnsworth said. 
​​State officials are hopeful that momentum continues this fall, given the stakes of the 2025 election. Control of the governor’s mansion and the full House of Delegates will shape policy decisions on issues ranging from taxes and health care to education and criminal justice. The election is also widely seen as a referendum on the first year of President Donald Trump’s second term in the White House. 
With party control in Richmond potentially up for grabs, both Democrats and Republicans are mounting intensive get-out-the-vote efforts designed to maximize early turnout and bank votes before Nov. 4.
The Department of Elections is directing voters to its website to check registration status, locate early voting sites and find acceptable forms of identification. Those with questions can also call the department at 1-800-552-9745 or the nonpartisan Voter Assistance Hotline at 844-482-8683.
Election officials stress that voters should not assume hours and locations are the same as in past years, since each locality sets its own rules within the state framework.
Key dates remain front of mind for election officials: the Oct. 24 registration and absentee ballot request deadline, the Nov. 1 close of early in-person voting, and Election Day itself on Tuesday, Nov. 4, when polls will be open from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.

(Courtesy of Project:HOMES)Over the summer, the University of Richmond launched the Live and Learn website, a new feature of a study examining the connection between housing segregation and educational inequality in Richmond and its surrounding areas released last year. 
The new interactive site will help inform educators, experts, and policymakers about the local links between housing and education.
Michelle Quach, a recent graduate from Richmond, was one of the students who worked on the project. The Henrico County native helped with the visualizations and came away from the experience feeling “grateful,” she said. 
“It was really cool for me, specifically to have the opportunity to work on this project, especially as an undergrad,” said Quach, who graduated with a double major in health studies and geography and a minor in data science. I think I was the youngest person in the room at times, and it was still really cool to be able to be part of these conversations and to understand a little bit more about where I grew up and where I came from.”

Some of the visualizations revealed unequal educational opportunities and outcomes for some Central Virginians, which were linked to housing segregation and funding disparities. Researchers focused on eight localities in the metro Richmond area: Richmond, Henrico, Chesterfield, Hanover, New Kent, Goochland, Powhatan, and Charles City.

The second release of the study, based on data collected between 2011 and 2024, revealed several notable data points that showed the region becoming more racially and economically diverse, Black students facing racially disproportionate discipline and being excluded from school at twice their enrollment rate, and schools in higher-poverty areas having higher percentages of inexperienced or provisionally licensed teachers.
Researchers also found that four school divisions — Charles City, Chesterfield, Henrico, and Richmond, all with a majority of students of color — had inadequate funding to meet the national average assessment scores for their students.
Tom Shields  — one of the co-authors of the report — said that researchers have known that localities are often segregated by race and income, but the pairing of the data was able to reveal how zoning also “creates segregated schools.”
The report lays out a series of policy recommendations to address housing and educational equity at the state and local levels. Lawmakers have already been working on some of these ideas. 
Researchers recommend that lawmakers remove education barriers by creating more regional school choice options, helping students learn multiple languages by teaching them in two languages, and combining school districts. 
Another idea is to address equity concerning resources by allocating more funds to schools with a high proportion of disadvantaged students, offering incentives for top teachers to work in schools that need them most, and improving how the state measures school success. 
Over the past three years, Gov. Glenn Youngkin, state lawmakers and education leaders have taken major steps to improve public K-12 education through investments and reform efforts. However, what remains unsettled is overhauling the funding formula, which determines how schools receive their funds.
Va. lawmakers prepare to overhaul decades-old school funding formula

Under the researchers’ list of housing policy ideas, one recommendation is to fund the 5,000 Families program. The idea is a bipartisan state budget amendment that Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Chesterfield, and Del. Carrie Coyner, R-Chesterfield, have carried.
If implemented, the program would provide rental relief to certain families with school-age children to prevent displacement during academic years.
Researchers also suggested more robust funding for Richmond’s Eviction Diversion Program, and adjusting local zoning to allow more flexibility on the types of housing that are allowed to be built. They recommended redrawing the school zone lines to “help break the neighborhood-school segregation link,” the study states.
Zoning is a local issue that city councils and boards of supervisors have authority over, but state lawmakers have proposed ways to incentivize stagnant boards to allow for increased density in certain areas. The legislation advanced through this year’s legislative session for a time before eventually being voted down. 
“We’ve been relying on localities to do this for long enough,” HOME policy director Laura Dobbs recently told The Mercury, of localities’ efforts to support affordable housing. “They just aren’t going far enough or not keeping up with the demand.”
The organization was involved in crafting the report and interactive website and has lent its policy insights to state lawmakers when working on legislation. 
Shields concurs that “state laws are where we could get a lot more bang for our buck.”
But there are still local tools to utilize, he added. 
For instance, the report recommends that the Richmond region adopt small area fair market rents that could allow Housing Choice Voucher administrators to calculate payment standards at the zip-code level rather than the metro levels. The idea is that it would help ensure payment standards reflect local markets and help voucher-holders find homes. 
In the meantime, nonprofit organizations like Housing Opportunities Made Equal, have stepped in to take on discrimination cases for voucher-holders or help them find homes when they struggle to land one.
Virginia housing nonprofits and residents are monitoring federal cuts, fraying state safety nets

Another recommendation was a bill that cleared the legislature this year before meeting Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s veto pen. Carried by Del. Elizabeth Bennett-Parker, D-Alexandria, the bill would have allowed localities a right of first refusal when subsidized housing is up for sale in order to help preserve it from becoming market rate. 
Youngkin explained his veto as an “intrusion” on local government. If such a bill passes the legislature again next year, gubernatorial candidates Winsome Earle-Sears or Abigail Spanberger could potentially sign or veto it. 
The study team consisted of researchers from the University of Richmond, Virginia Commonwealth University, the Partnership for Housing Affordability, Housing Opportunities Made Equal of Virginia and the Commonwealth Institute.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Last week, George Mason University Board of Visitors’ Rector Charles “Cully” Stimson pushed back against calls for him to resign, spurred by the publication of a report entitled “Uncovering Radical Efforts to Disguise DEI” by conservative think tank Heritage Foundation, where he serves as senior advisor to the president.
George Mason University rector rebuffs Va. Senate Dems’ request for his resignation

As rector of GMU’s board, Stimson bears the highest fiduciary duty to Virginia’s largest public university. That duty is clear: board members must act with loyalty, prudence, and care — always prioritizing the university’s interests. This responsibility is not optional; it is the core principle of governance for every nonprofit and public university board.
Stimson — who said he is “fully walled off from Heritage’s work concerning education policy” — wants us to see him as just another citizen sharing his personal views and professional background. However, the rector of a public university is not a private citizen. He serves as the presiding officer of the board and has a fiduciary duty of loyalty that requires him to prioritize the university’s interests over his own or those of his employer. To act otherwise undermines the gravity of the office he holds.
Yet in his recent letter responding to concerns from the Senate leadership,  Stimson demonstrated a profound misunderstanding of what fiduciary duty of loyalty requires. His defense — that he has compartmentalized his work at the Heritage Foundation and that he cannot be held accountable for the writings of his colleagues — misses the point entirely. 
Fiduciary duty isn’t about building walls in one’s head. It is about eliminating conflicts so deep that the public can be certain your judgment is undivided. His claim that he can simply “check his personal views at the door” is not a standard recognized in law or governance. Fiduciary loyalty requires more than a promise of compartmentalization — it requires the elimination of conflicts that erode public trust.
The Heritage Foundation, where  Stimson serves as senior advisor to the president, has publicly attacked George Mason University by name and called for federal funding to be withdrawn. That stance directly harms the very institution he is sworn to protect. No “wall” can resolve that conflict. The duty of loyalty requires he choose: serve Heritage or serve Mason. He cannot do both. Whether Mr. Stimson himself writes Heritage’s attacks on Mason is irrelevant. Fiduciary duty is not limited to specific topics. When your employer seeks to cut off federal funding to the university you oversee, your loyalties are irreconcilably divided.
What makes this lapse worse is that  Stimson is not just an ordinary person; he is an attorney. Thirty years in the Navy Judge Advocate General’s Corps should have taught him that duty involves not only avoiding impropriety but also the appearance of it. Stimson highlights his JAG service and his unanimous confirmation in Richmond, but these credentials make his failure to understand the duty of loyalty more, not less, concerning. Senate leaders have now clearly stated that his dual roles present “an untenable ethical conflict.” Credentials alone do not resolve conflicts of interest.
Nor is this the first time  Stimson has betrayed a core ethical duty. In 2007, while serving as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Detainee Affairs, he publicly encouraged corporate clients to penalize law firms representing Guantánamo detainees. The backlash was swift and bipartisan, leading to his resignation. At that time, NYU law professor Stephen Gillers coined the term the “Charles Stimson Rule”: never attack lawyers for representing unpopular clients.
The New York Times took a firmer stance in a 2007 editorial titled ”Apology Not Accepted.” As the Times stated: “It is hard to render a convincing apology when you are not really apologizing…” 
The editorial condemned his “loathsome attempt to punish lawyers.” It argued that his “appalling behavior should not be overlooked by the relevant bar disciplinary committee,” emphasizing that the legal profession imposes “a higher duty on those holding public office to obey proper standards of behavior.”
Back then, he criticized lawyers for defending detainees; today, he undermines the university he is sworn to defend. Different stage, same failure to understand ethical responsibility.
Stimson also fails to mention another revealing part of his record: During President Donald Trump’s first term, he was twice nominated to serve as General Counsel of the U.S. Navy. Both times, his nomination did not advance to the Senate floor for a vote, even in a chamber controlled by his own party.
Stimson assures us that the  board is “securing the University’s funding.” Yet his employer has publicly urged Congress to withhold federal support from GMU. No Rector can credibly claim to protect funding while working for an organization that calls for stripping it away.
The Senate leadership clearly stated in their recent letter that this represents an “untenable ethical conflict.” Stimson claims he can separate his roles, but fiduciary duty involves unwavering loyalty, not divisions.
The Times’ 20-year-old judgment still holds today. For George Mason University and for Virginia, the message needs to be even clearer now: “Excuses not accepted.”

(Courtesy of the campaign team of Daira Smith-Rodriguez)Another anti-establishment Democratic candidate has entered the race against long-time Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine. 
Daira Smith-Rodriguez, a union member and U.S. Air Force civilian contracting officer, officially launched her campaign on Thursday, though she filed to run with the Federal Election Commission last month. 
In her campaign launch video, she shared stances — such as calling what’s happening in Gaza a genocide and what’s happening in America an oligarchy — similar to those that have led many progressive Mainers to be drawn to Graham Platner, another Democratic candidate who had a splashy campaign launch in August and has been endorsed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. 
The two candidates also have teams that include progressive strategists with records of successfully running against establishment Democrats. Like Platner, Smith-Rodriguez’s campaign is staffed by some of the same people working for New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani. Her team also includes pollster Celinda Lake, a prominent Democratic pollster who worked for former President Joe Biden’s campaign.
Platner has also tried to appeal to Maine’s independent thinking by rejecting the label of liberal while embracing a working man’s pitch to appeal to some supporters of President Donald Trump. 
Smith-Rodriguez’s pitch to Mainers strikes a similar tone, with a focus on fair labor and affordability. But she’s also focusing on other issues that have been of concern to MAGA voters, such as “Big Food,” national security and government oversight.  
“Food labeling, broken. Food safety, broken. Supply chains, broken,” she said in her campaign video. “And nobody is looking out for us. But keep your receipts. Send them to me. I can tell you exactly why it’s making you sick, and why it’s so damn expensive.”
While Smith-Rodriguez highlighted her ties to the military like Platner has, she’s doing so with a particular focus on national security. 
“My dad was a test pilot. My husband is a Maine Air National Guardsman and I’m a decorated civil servant,” she said. “National security is the family calling.”
She said she did “aggressive auditing and oversight” for the Air Force and vowed to do so in the Senate. She’s against American tax dollars being used to send weapons to Israel. 
“America is not a business, no matter what they tell you,” she said at the conclusion of her video. “We’re dreamers and patriots and families. We’re one people with one more chance.”

(Photo by Lourdes Balduque/Getty Images)Kitty Larochelle, who has worked for more than 30 years in child care and now serves as director of The Growing Years Early Childhood Center in Manchester, traveled to Washington, D.C., alongside child care workers from across the country this week to meet with federal lawmakers about the challenges facing early care and education.
She said taking care of her staff, both in terms of mental health and wages, was the biggest concern she brought to lawmakers.
“Because as you know we’re not making a million bucks here,” she said.
Larochelle said she met briefly with Sen. Maggie Hassan and spoke more in depth with her team and the teams of Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Rep. Chris Pappas. She said they were “eager to hear from us” and she’s hopeful the three — all Democrats — will be able to work with Republicans on bipartisan solutions, particularly increasing staff wages. The trip was organized by Save the Children, an international humanitarian organization.

“I’ve been raising the flag about that for a few years, that we’ve got to take care of the workforce or there will be no workforce,” she said, “Child care is the workforce behind the workforce. We support all businesses in taking care of children of all ages and from all over the state. So if we’re not here, then parents can’t go to work and can’t do their jobs and can’t pay their rent and can’t do a lot of things.”
Research backs this up. A February report from the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute suggests New Hampshire businesses lost between $36 million and $56 million in 2023 because of staffing disruptions from employees forced to quit or decrease hours to take care of children. Families in New Hampshire lost an estimated $114 million to $178 million in earnings because they couldn’t find suitable child care, the report found. The report also estimated this may have resulted in $9 million to $14 million in lost state and local tax revenue.
State lawmakers recently appropriated $15 million in federal funding for child care workforce development to alleviate staffing challenges that drive up child care costs. However, Larochelle doesn’t think that’ll be near enough.
Larochelle said it takes around $50,000 to $60,000 to give each of her staff (26 employees) a $1-per-hour raise. The Growing Years is a large operation, caring for around 100 children ranging from infants to 9-year-olds. She said roughly 85% of the center’s revenue goes to payroll. But the dollar amount of the appropriation isn’t the only problem. Questions remain about how much flexibility the state will have to apply the federal funds toward workforce grants. 
Larochelle also hopes the USDA, which provides free and reduced-price meals for some of the children at The Growing Years, will increase its support.
“I would love to see the USDA just cover all early childhood programs,” Larochelle said. “Period. End of story. Forget the eligibility piece, because during COVID, they took care of public school. They just said everybody was eligible for free meals, yet we had to prove eligibility continually throughout all of that time and again, there is such great importance to the first five years of life, so if we’re able to ensure that we’re providing healthy meals and snacks to kids, that’s going to help their overall health and learning capabilities and help to support their early childhood journey.”
The average cost to put an infant in center-based child care in New Hampshire was $16,040 per year in 2023, according to a recent report from Child Care Aware of America, a nonprofit that surveys child care supply and pricing. That’s 11% of the median annual income ($150,029) for a New Hampshire married couple and 36% of the median income ($45,086) of a New Hampshire single parent. For a toddler, the average annual cost was $14,870.
“​We cannot expect that parents can continue to pay more and more and more for the rising cost of child care solely,” Larochelle said. “That’s a big ask of parents.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/childcaretoyskids-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-18 05:56:28.598563

“Drought doesn’t obey county or state boundary lines,” said Kelsey Eigsti, who co-led the tool’s development out of the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. “It crosses regions and so being able to look at that broader regional context is really important for communicating about drought.”
The river is one of the world’s busiest commercial waterways and provides drinking water to more than 50 cities. Two years ago it hit historically low water levels, which caused commercial ships to run aground and lowered the river’s water quality. 
That was the impetus for making a dashboard that provides past, present, and predicts future drought conditions across the basin. 
Users can view data for the entire basin, zoom into smaller sub-basin regions, view original data sources, download map images with custom boundary lines and otherwise customize the data to communicate the state of drought in the basin. 
The dashboard is a multi-agency collaboration between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Geological Survey and state and local partners. 
The new tool was announced to the public Wednesday at the annual meeting of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative and is online now at www.drought.gov/watersheds/mississippi-river-dashboard. 
The data it uses already exists: for example, it has a section of current drought conditions in the basin, which it pulls from the U.S. Drought Monitor, a nationwide tool to assess dry conditions. But the dashboard gathers data from scattered sites in one place for the first time. 
“There’s a lot of data out there,” said Sean Duffy, executive director of the Big River Coalition, which represents the Mississippi River navigation industry. “We want it more streamlined. We want it where it’s easier to understand, so a 12-year-old can understand it and to put it into one website, instead of having to glean it from 10 or more, which often still happens.”
Eigsti said the dashboard is primarily aimed at drought communicators — such as local governments and journalists  — but was also created with decision-makers in mind. A separate tab on the website has educational information on the impacts of drought. 
Missouri State Climatologist Zack Leasor said the new dashboard makes his job of drought assessment and communication easier.
“This is the entire hydrologic cycle,” he said. “You’ve got precipitation, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and then lots of hydrologic data as well. So kind of a one-stop shop here.”
Leasor said having access to basin-wide data at his fingertips is useful because how those metrics look in one area can have downstream — and upstream — effects to the rest of the region. 
“Impacts don’t always align exactly where the drought’s occurring, especially when we talk about economic impacts and large-scale hydrologic impacts,” he said. 
Those impacts can be significant. 
For example, when water is low, it can degrade the river’s water quality. In the lower Mississippi, low flows can cause saltwater from the Gulf of Mexico to run upriver, causing issues for people who depend on it for drinking water. 
To mitigate those impacts, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers sometimes constructs an underwater barrier to stop saltwater intrusion. That had to be done in 1988, 1999, 2012, 2022, 2023 and 2024. 
The barriers, along with low water levels more generally, can slow down barge movement on the river. 
Approximately 175 million tons of freight are moved on the upper Mississippi each year, according to the National Park Service. 
“The Mississippi River is the primary transportation mechanism for agricultural products from the central United States to the rest of the country, the rest of the world,” said Texas State Climatologist John Nielsen-Gammon. “When the river is running low, barge traffic is limited or potentially shut down completely, and makes it quite challenging for producers to get their products to market.”
Duffy said low — and high — water events have been happening more frequently.  But communicating these trends, which he refers to as increased “climate variability,” to people in the navigation industry can be challenging. He’s hoping the easy-to-use dashboard, which he helped beta test, makes communication easier. 
“There are very few people that really look at the water and understand the system and the places where you’re exposing your king,” he said. “The channel is king, and everything we do is to try to protect it and keep everything moving.”

Republish photo only with original story.)Attorneys representing the state of Ohio and women’s health clinics made oral arguments Tuesday over whether other provisions in the state’s 2019 six-week abortion ban law can be maintained, even though the ban itself has been struck down.
During oral arguments in front of three judges from the First District Court of Appeals, both the state and attorneys for the reproductive health clinics made it clear that the six-week abortion ban itself was not up for debate, and was settled when a trial court struck down the ban in October of last year.
The trial court’s decision came after 57% of Ohio voters approved a reproductive rights amendment to the Ohio Constitution in 2023.
The 2019 law had been blocked by courts from the time it was signed by Gov. Mike DeWine until the U.S. Supreme Court struck down nationwide abortion rights in 2022. When the June Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade came down, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost moved quickly to implement the state’s six-week ban, which included no exceptions for rape or incest.
The ban was in place for several months before being held up by an Ohio court injunction. As that court case was proceeding, voters passed the new amendment, after which the trial court concluded the law had been rendered unconstitutional.

While the state is not fighting the rejection of the six-week ban, the reason the state Attorney General’s office appealed the case was to fight for the other provisions in Senate Bill 23, the state law under which the six-week abortion ban was enacted.
Yost’s team argues provisions such as record-keeping for abortions could stand on their own.
The state has consistently argued that the other provisions can stand under a “severability” clause of the law, which is a legal way of allowing certain parts of laws to stay in place even if another part of the law has been removed or successfully challenged in court.
“There’s basically two issues (in the appeal),” Deputy Solicitor General Stephen Carney told the district court on Tuesday. “What did the legislature intend and, separately, are (the provisions) capable to function by themselves.”
Carney argued the language of the state law clearly states if anything in the law is declared invalid, “it shall not affect any other sections.”
The specific language states that the law’s provisions are “severable.”
“In particular, it is the intent of the General Assembly that any invalidity or potential invalidity of a provision of (the law) is not to impair the immediate and continuing enforceability of the remaining provisions,” according to the Ohio Revised Code.
The state also pointed to previous record-keeping regarding abortion that existed in state law before the Dobbs decision and the six-week abortion ban.
Attorney Cassie Mitchell, of the law firm WilmerHale, represented Preterm-Cleveland, Planned Parenthoods in Southwest and Greater Ohio, Women’s Med Group Professional Corporation, and Northeast Ohio Women’s Center, along with an individual physician in the case, in partnership with the ACLU of Ohio.
Mitchell argued that provisions that were included in Senate Bill 23 along with the six-week ban should also fall because they are directly connected to enforcement of the ban itself.
Laying out the provisions at dispute in the case, Mitchell said four “just clarify the scope of the ban,” including definitions of the law, the fact that the ban didn’t apply to ectopic pregnancies, and that a pregnant individual wouldn’t be held liable, among other provisions.
“Those don’t just stand on their own; they have no meaning without the rest of the ban in place,” Mitchell told the court.
Another four provisions specify punishments for violating the six-week ban, including felony charges and license revocation for medical professionals.
“S.B. 23 created a new punishment for failing to check for cardiac activity that was the same, very severe punishment for actually performing an abortion after the detection of cardiac activity,” Mitchell said. “It was clearly intended to prevent any runarounds of the six-week ban … and it didn’t exist prior to S.B. 23.”
For the state, Carney said a ruling by the appeals court saying the entire law is struck down not only would be “doing something radical that no one has ever done before,” but would also have consequences in other cases on completely different topics.
“You’re threatening how courts review environmental laws or anything else, and then we’re going to feel obliged to appeal that because we’re here because of the effect on all state laws,” Carney said.
The deputy solicitor general went on to say the rejection of the six-week abortion ban section of the law “did not create a super abortion exception” that applies to all provisions of all Ohio laws.
“All we’re asking is that you follow the rule of law, the normal rules of the road that every plaintiff has to meet, versus creating this radical roadmap for everyone to strike down a lot of state laws,” Carney said.
On behalf of women’s clinics, Mitchell said the court could allow closure in the case by giving its ruling as the final say, rather than sending the case back to the previous court to re-litigate a case that has already been down that road.
“This court can resolve this now, it can give plaintiffs and their patients the certainty they need as to what the requirements of Ohio law are, and we can just all move on,” Mitchell said.

(Photo by Scott Eisen/Getty Images)When the U.S. Department of Justice asked Kansas Republican Secretary of State Scott Schwab to turn over a copy of his state’s full voter list, including sensitive personal data, he responded with gratitude for the Trump administration.
“We appreciate the efforts of DOJ and other federal partners to assist in ensuring states have access to federal resources” to maintain voter rolls, Schwab wrote in an Aug. 21 letter to the agency.
But Schwab did not provide the full data the Justice Department wanted. Instead, the second-term state secretary of state and candidate for governor wrote that he was “initially” giving its lawyers only publicly available voter information.
As the Trump administration demands that states turn over voter data, some Republican state officials are pushing back.
At least four states with Republican chief election officials have offered public data but not the sensitive information — driver’s license and partial Social Security numbers — sought by the Justice Department, even as they take pains not to pick a fight with President Donald Trump. Another has refused to turn over any data.
One state so far has given the federal government everything and another appears likely to follow.
On Friday, Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales, a Republican, confirmed he provided the Justice Department with all the requested data, making Indiana the first known state to hand over sensitive personal information. And in South Carolina, the state Supreme Court has cleared the way for election officials to share its data.
Many Democrats and even some Republicans fear Trump wants to use the voter data to build a federal database of voters he can use to target political opponents or hype rare instances of noncitizen voting. At the same time, supporters of the effort say the Justice Department is focused on maintaining accurate voter rolls.
For Republicans, the demands pit the traditional conservative belief in states’ authority — and their skepticism of federal power —  against the will of a president who holds a vise-like grip over their party. They also come after Trump spent years advancing the false claim that he won the 2020 election.
The Justice Department, controlled by Trump allies, has contacted over half of the states and signaled it will eventually reach out to all of them, ensuring more GOP officials will likely confront choices over what to give the administration. Their responses will go a long way in determining whether the department succeeds in obtaining personal data on tens of millions of American voters.
“It raises concerns to me about trust, about transparency, about the potential for politicizing a process that folks on all sides of the political spectrum need to feel comfortable and confident is being handled appropriately,” said Matt Germer, director of the Governance Program at the R Street Institute, a center-right think tank in Washington, D.C.
Germer, who calls himself a pro-democracy conservative, said others like him, as well as many Democrats, “have some worry that this is less about building a case against specific incidents of fraud and more about sowing fear in election processes.”
Trump wants states to feed voter info into powerful citizenship data program

While Republicans have taken varied approaches to the demands, Democratic election officials have largely spurned them. They warn Trump is encroaching on the authority of states to run elections and are fearful of how he may use the data. Some Democrats have pointed the administration to publicly available data, but others have fully refused the requests.
The Justice Department on Tuesday announced it was suing the Democratic secretaries of state in Maine and Oregon over their refusal to provide voter data. The lawsuits mark the first legal challenges the department has brought against states in its effort to obtain voter registration records across the country.
At least 27 states have so far received a demand from the Justice Department for voter data, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, which tracks the requests. Fifteen of the states were won by Trump.
Along with Kansas, Republican election officials in Alaska, Florida and Utah have so far offered only public voter data. New Hampshire’s Republican secretary of state has turned over no data, citing restrictions in state law, and Texas officials have said they can’t currently provide a copy of their voter rolls because of ongoing technical upgrades.
Since taking office in January, Trump has tried to exert unilateral control over elections, mostly unsuccessfully. Federal courts blocked an executive order in March that attempted to require voters to prove their citizenship when registering. He threatened to sign another order purporting to ban mail-in ballots but has so far not followed through.
The Constitution gives states the authority to administer elections and Congress the power to step in and set national election standards and regulations. Federal legislation that would implement a proof-of-citizenship voter registration requirement passed the U.S. House this spring, but hasn’t advanced in the Senate.










President Trump today in 2025 is more popular, more influential, more powerful within the Republican Party than he was in 2017.


– Former Kentucky Republican Secretary of State Trey Grayson


Even without a nationwide proof-of-citizenship requirement, the Trump administration is assembling a patchwork operation to find noncitizen voting, which is an extremely rare phenomenon. As the Trump administration presses states for voter rolls, it confirmed last week that the Justice Department is sharing voter data with the Department of Homeland Security, which runs a powerful online search program that can identify noncitizens and verify citizenship.
Several election experts question whether the Justice Department has the authority to demand the voter data and say it’s misinterpreting federal law. “There is zero federal law that entitles the Department of Justice to that sensitive data,” said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research.
The Justice Department said in a statement to Stateline that Congress gave the department authority under multiple federal laws to ensure states have proper voter registration programs and procedures to keep voter rolls free of ineligible voters. The requests for voter rolls have been made under that authority, it said.
“States simply cannot pick and choose which federal laws they will comply with, including our voting laws, which ensure that all American citizens have equal access to the ballot in federal elections,” Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon, who leads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, said in the news release announcing lawsuits against Maine and Oregon.
Navigating DOJ demands
In New Hampshire, Republican Secretary of State David Scanlan has twice refused the Justice Department. Scanlan first declined to provide the state’s voter list in July; after the agency pressed him again, he sent a four-paragraph letter reiterating his position.
Dhillon responded to Scanlan in a letter Aug. 18 that the department was entitled to the voter data under federal record retention laws. She wrote that the agency needed the data to determine whether New Hampshire is complying with the Help America Vote Act, a 2002 federal law that revamped election administration in the wake of the disputed 2000 presidential election.
Scanlan has said New Hampshire law is clear in only permitting the secretary of state to release voter lists, without sensitive personal information, in limited circumstances. Political parties, political committees and candidates may request the list; other outside organizations and agencies, like the Justice Department, cannot.
Scanlan, first elected in 2022, has avoided politically charged rhetoric during the dispute over the voter list. He will be up for reelection next year, but not before voters. In New Hampshire, the Republican-controlled legislature elects the secretary of state every two years.
In an interview with Stateline, Scanlan said he’s approached the situation in a “matter of fact” manner.
“I know other states may have different statutes that allow them to provide that information and beyond that, I really don’t have strong feelings about where this goes,” Scanlan said.
“I’m just going to administer the New Hampshire statutes, taking into consideration what may apply at the federal level through statute or through the courts,” he said. “But for the time being, I think our position is pretty clear.”
Schwab, the Kansas Republican secretary of state, will face voters next year — but as a candidate for governor. A former state lawmaker first elected secretary of state in 2018, he is running in a large Republican primary field where candidates, including him, are competing to link themselves to Trump.
But Schwab has also long taken a clear stance against election denialism and knocked down false claims about Kansas elections. In 2022 he won a primary election, 55%-45%, that pitted him against a Republican activist who promoted conspiracy theories about the 2020 presidential election.
As the Justice Department push for voter rolls moves forward, Schwab has attempted to find a middle ground. He provided only Kansas’s public voter data, but held open the possibility of turning over more. And in his August letter to the department, he praised the Trump administration’s priorities on election security.
“We agree that routine voter maintenance is critical to ensuring accurate voter rolls and confidence in elections,” Schwab wrote.
Schwab declined Stateline’s interview request. In response to questions, John Milburn, a spokesperson for the Kansas Secretary of State’s Office, wrote in an email: “We remain in conversation with the DOJ and have no further information or comment at this time.”
Trey Grayson, a former Republican Kentucky secretary of state in the 2000s, said if he was in office, he could see potentially providing publicly available voter data to the Justice Department. The department is an entity “you have to take seriously,” Grayson said, though he added he wished it would disclose more about how it plans to use the information.
There’s also politics.
“President Trump today in 2025 is more popular, more influential, more powerful within the Republican Party than he was in 2017,” said Grayson, who sits on the board of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, a nonprofit organization that works to build confidence in elections.
Indiana, South Carolina support data sharing
Morales, the Indiana Republican secretary of state, invoked Trump when he announced last week he had shared full voter data, including driver’s license and partial Social Security numbers, with the Justice Department.
“If providing the Justice Department information can help Indiana with ensuring our voter list is accurate and up to date, we will do so. We will take all the help we can get. I am proud to work with President Trump and his administration to strengthen election integrity,” Morales said at a news conference on Friday.
A former aide to Mike Pence while he was governor of Indiana, Morales was elected in 2022 after calling the 2020 election a “scam” and writing the “outcome is questionable.”
DOJ is sharing state voter roll lists with Homeland Security

Morales made the disclosure about the voter list in response to reporters’ questions, but he had called the news conference to highlight an alleged case of noncitizen voting by a man with a Mexican passport who had voted six times since 2018. He didn’t identify the man, and criminal charges don’t appear to have been filed.
The decision to turn over the data disappointed Julia Vaughn, executive director of Common Cause Indiana, a voting rights group. She said her organization is prepared to challenge in court any unlawful sharing of the voter list for illegal purposes.
“We’re concerned about his willingness to allow the federal government to interfere in the administration of Indiana elections,” Vaughn said.
In South Carolina, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster went to court, fighting to allow officials to share the full voter list with the Justice Department. After the South Carolina State Election Commission received a request for the voter list in August, a registered voter sued to block its release.
Last week, the South Carolina Supreme Court, in a decision on procedural grounds, cleared the way for the state to hand over the data while the lawsuit plays out in court.
Speaking with reporters earlier this month, McMaster cast the sensitive data as already in the possession of the government and pointed out that the federal government created Social Security.
McMaster noted the South Carolina Constitution contains a right to privacy, but said the Justice Department’s request wasn’t an illegal overreach. “The federal government does have the authority to ask for these things,” he said.
But as the Trump administration seeks voter lists, Germer, of the R Street Institute, voiced concern about what the demands could mean for the future. The collection effort is beginning to set a precedent and a mechanism for future data grabs, he cautioned.
“It’s important to remember that these kinds of actions don’t occur in a vacuum,” Germer said, adding that “we live in a world where one president takes action and the next president builds upon it.”

No one had published a full accounting of the extraordinary amounts of public money spent on housing since 2020. We pieced it together. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont poured hundreds of millions of dollars into housing during the pandemic. What has it built?.","This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.

After the Covid-19 pandemic hit, Vermont’s long-simmering housing crunch reached a boiling point. Home prices jumped dramatically, the state’s rental vacancy rate constricted, and its unhoused population tripled. 
During that time, Vermont leaders funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into affordable housing development — including from federal pandemic stimulus packages, state surplus revenues, and other sources — an opportunity dubbed by many as “historic.”
“We need to put this money to work for working families,” Gov. Phil Scott said during his annual budget address in early 2022, about using federal stimulus funds to help plug Vermont’s housing deficit. “They’re depending on us, and with some creativity, and these historic resources, we can make this happen.”
There has been no comprehensive accounting of how much money the state poured into building housing in the first half of the decade, and how many homes it helped create.
VTDigger/Vermont Public gathered data on housing spending from the three major entities who oversee public funding for housing development in the state: the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board and the Agency of Commerce and Community Development.
An analysis by the news organizations found that between 2020 and 2024, the state directed over $789 million of public funds toward building new apartments and homes for sale, and rehabilitating housing that had fallen into disrepair. That dollar figure includes money from state and federal sources, and encompasses programs new and old — including state initiatives begun in the months after the pandemic hit, and federal financing streams like tax credits that have been available for decades.
That total does not include funding spent on homeless shelters and upgrades to manufactured home communities, nor does it include funds overseen by municipalities. It also excludes funding specific to flood recovery efforts. (Read more about our methodology here.)
The influx of public money has helped create 2,249 new homes. Another 1,156 units were rehabilitated — a catchall term that includes everything from creating new apartments in an old school to preserving an existing complex as subsidized housing. Additionally, a new initiative aimed at renovating vacant apartments that had fallen into disrepair and building accessory dwelling units in homeowners’ backyards helped create 1,015 homes. 
Generally speaking, housing projects need an affordability requirement to receive public funding, so the vast majority of these homes include some kind of income-restriction or cost cap for potential tenants and buyers. Some are still in the development pipeline and have not yet opened their doors.
 
‘Not enough yet’
Looked at one way, the windfall of federal funds helped kick the state’s affordable housing builders into “hyperdrive,” said Alex Farrell, commissioner of the Department of Housing and Community Development, who helped guide spending decisions after he began his tenure with the state as deputy commissioner in 2021. 
Building permits have trended upward over the last five years for all types of housing, and the influx of funds helped shore up the low- and moderate-income end of the market during a particularly vulnerable moment, Farrell noted.

Looked at another way, though, the skyrocketing cost of building during this timeframe meant Vermont got far less bang for its buck than it would have in a pre-pandemic economy. 
Couple that fact with the lengthy process involved in cobbling together funding sources for large-scale projects — along with lengthy government approvals, construction delays and legal challenges launched by neighbors in some cases — and it’s clear that the state has still yet to see the full impact of this windfall. 
 
According to data provided by the Vermont Housing Finance Agency from its directory of affordable rentals, 866 new apartments opened up to potential tenants between 2020 and 2024. That’s only a modest jump from 696 new rentals first occupied in the previous five-year period, before Covid – highlighting just how long it takes for many larger-scale affordable housing developments to come online.
“So far, our inventory of all the affordable housing in the state doesn’t yet show the big increase in homes that has resulted from this massive infusion of money,” said Maura Collins, executive director of the Vermont Housing Finance Agency.

And publicly-subsidized affordable housing only makes up a modest fraction of the overall market. Against the backdrop of the state’s severe housing shortage, the boost in funding during the Covid years did not prove enough on its own to correct course. About 2,400 building permits for all residences – not just affordable housing – were issued annually between 2020 and 2024. But recent assessments show the state must double or triple that pace to get the housing market to a healthy state. Meanwhile, homelessness remains at record levels.
For the people who gained an affordable place to live because of the state’s massive investment in home construction, the funding made a world of difference, said Gus Seelig, executive director of the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board.
But “if you look at it from the way the housing market has changed, you’d say: ‘Not enough yet,’” he said.
New neighborhoods
As this money began flowing into the state, developers began charting out some of the biggest affordable housing projects in Vermont in recent memory. On the large end of that scale: entirely new neighborhoods. 
One such development is tucked behind a mattress store and a Nepalese restaurant in Shelburne, once home to an Econo Lodge motel. The nonprofit developer Champlain Housing Trust purchased the property more than a decade ago to operate it as emergency housing for people experiencing homelessness, but the trust’s leaders had long dreamed of redeveloping the five and a half acres off of Route 7 into something more.

That transformation is now nearly complete. One morning in early August, construction workers buzzed around the property, putting the finishing touches on 68 income-restricted apartments which will stay affordable in perpetuity. 
Some homeowners had already moved into more than two dozen brand-new, shared-equity condominiums, their potted plants lining balconies overlooking a freshly-paved road. Those condos are selling for under $190,000 each. Their market values are estimated at more than twice that amount — around $485,000 for a three-bedroom, according to the trust’s website.

Michael Monte, the trust’s CEO, took in the scene. “When you see people beginning to own their own homes and are just so happy when they move in, or when people move into their rental housing and finally have stable housing…” He paused as a power tool roared. “Big difference.” 
This Shelburne project, called Bay Ridge, is among the largest recipients of the state’s Covid-era windfall. 
 
Publicly-subsidized affordable housing projects typically bring in funding from a wide array of sources, and Bay Ridge is no exception: a funding source breakdown provided by Monte includes 25 different budget lines. A few of the biggest streams of funding for the project stemmed from the pandemic-era funding push, including more than $10 million of federal stimulus funding for the rentals, along with a $4.8 million from a Covid-era program dedicated to building middle-income homes for purchase. The single largest funding source was over $14 million in private equity from federal tax credits.
The total price tag for the project came to about $55 million, for both the rental and homeownership portions. That means it cost about $584,000 on average to build each of the 94 total homes. That’s not a far leap from the average per-unit development cost of new affordable rentals last year, which was over $500,000.
“It’s sometimes shocking to me to look at the dollar amounts that we’re talking about,” said Collins, from the Vermont Housing Finance Agency.

Collins often thinks about the number of homes Vermont could have built with this money under pre-Covid economic conditions. But high interest rates and a rapid rise in construction costs in the pandemic years dampened how far the funding could go. According to a 2019 VHFA report, the median per-unit development cost of affordable rental housing in Vermont between 2009 and 2018 was about $228,000.
“It has been daunting to watch the amount of money going out the door, creating not as many homes as [it] would have been five years ago,” Collins said.
Those factors have hampered building throughout the entire housing market. Yet building affordable housing with public funds has its own distinct cost-drivers.
When developers piece together state and federal funding sources, they must then comply with a thicket of state and federal rules. Some federal funds in recent years came with requirements to source materials inside U.S. borders, a rule that has proved onerous for many affordable housing developers. Within Vermont, developers might seek to make a building highly energy efficient to get priority access to funding, or build in a downtown location that might have toxic soils that need to be cleaned up, or need to set aside a share of units for people exiting homelessness and provide services for those tenants.
“When we say we’re building affordable housing, we’re doing so much more than that,” Collins said. “But…when public money comes with too many rules and regulations, then we need to look at if there are quicker, easier, better ways — so that we’re not inadvertently adding to the cost of housing through the way we do things.”

‘A lot of units at a very low cost’
At the opposite end of the spectrum, state officials also used Covid stimulus funds to dole out relatively modest grants for small-scale housing projects, like helping homeowners build accessory dwelling units and rehabilitating apartments that had fallen into disrepair.
The state’s main vehicle for these types of projects is the Vermont Housing Improvement Program, or VHIP, which launched in 2020. VHIP continues to provide funds to landlords and developers to fix up existing vacant rentals that need repairs in order to meet safety codes, add new units onto existing buildings and construct small apartment buildings.  
Between 2020 and 2024, the state spent $38.7 million on VHIP grants and loans, which helped produce 1,015 homes. The average grant is $38,000, according to state data. Property owners have to match at least 20% of the funds they get with their own money.
“What’s exciting about VHIP is it delivers a lot of units at a very low cost,” said Farrell, the housing commissioner.
David Begin stumbled upon the VHIP program when catching up on the news in 2020. A master plumber with a family rental business in Canaan, a town of fewer than 1,000 residents in Vermont’s far northeastern corner, Begin decided to apply for a grant. He received $30,000 to rehab an abandoned duplex, he said.
“There’s a family of four kids and mom and pop living in it. Been there for five years,” he said. The four-bedroom apartment rents for $950 a month.

VHIP has a different philosophy than most large-scale affordable housing developments in Vermont. Rather than require that the homes stay affordable permanently, VHIP’s original iteration stipulated that the rentals remain under the federal government’s “fair market rent” standard for five years. (The current version of the program has a 10-year loan option.) The program also mandated that funding recipients prioritize vulnerable tenants, like people exiting homelessness and refugees.
As the rules start to lift this year, some landlords will face a choice: keep renting to their current tenants at below-market rates, or raise prices and threaten eviction.
According to data provided by the Department of Housing and Community Development, 68 homes will hit the end of their affordability-compliance period in 2025. Another 157 will hit that cliff next year.
 
Farrell, the housing commissioner, said initial conversations have led him to believe many landlords intend to keep renting at below-market rates.
Begin is one of them. 
“We got good tenants…and we’re happy with what we’re doing,” he said. He was pleased enough with his first VHIP experience that he went on to get a second grant to work on three apartments in an old post office building in town. “I don’t do that Airbnb thing. I’m more – take care of the local people,” he said.

A blip?
For now, groundbreakings and ribbon cuttings for affordable housing projects that received Covid-era funds keep getting announced. But in the near future, as the federal dollars get used up, many housing leaders expect those celebrations to wind down.
“We’re going to see, two years from now, production of new units really fall off — unless, as a state, we make a choice that we’re going to figure out how to raise revenue,” said Seelig, from the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board.
The Democrat-controlled Legislature, which holds Vermont’s purse-strings, has yet to make that choice. In 2024, a bill that would have created new taxes on higher-earners to fund affordable housing production passed the House but died in the Senate. Lawmakers did not consider a similar proposal this past session. Some affordable housing boosters, like Monte from Champlain Housing Trust, hope legislators will take up the idea again in 2026. The prospect of success appears dim, though, as tax-averse Republicans have gained more traction in the Statehouse with the backing of Scott, a Republican.
 
That political dynamic leaves Vermont leaders with less funding to pour into affordable housing as federal support for housing and homelessness is threatened under the Trump administration – and as Vermont’s need for more homes remains stark.

As the Covid-era stimulus funds have run dry, lawmakers and the governor have enacted other policies to try and tamp down housing costs and spur more building, from land use reforms to financing tools aimed at boosting the infrastructure needed for new construction. 
In an executive order aimed at boosting more homebuilding issued this week, Scott noted that despite the “unprecedented, focused commitment of state resources” during the pandemic years, Vermont still has a deep housing deficit – which, he argued, “can only be addressed through more private investment, and substantial regulatory reform.”
Collins, from the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, sees plenty more room to streamline the homebuilding process. Vermont must flood the overall market with homes to regulate supply and demand, she noted. 
“But if there’s not funding…then I’m worried that while we’ll be helping all housing, we may run the risk of having affordable housing – and housing for the lowest-income Vermonters – fall short,” she said.
If Vermont strays from its focus on the housing issue, she said, the Covid-era boost in building affordable homes will be nothing but a blip.
Methodology
VTDigger and Vermont Public gathered data on housing spending from the three main agencies that oversee housing funds in the state: the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board and the Agency of Commerce and Community Development.
We looked at funds spent on housing development between 2020 and 2024. Our dataset includes funding that flowed through the three agencies from federal Covid-era stimulus packages like the 2020 Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act. It also includes state General Fund surplus funding – because it was the result of additional federal aid statewide – as well as regular state and federal financing streams for housing spent during this timeframe.
Our goal was to look at new units added to Vermont’s housing stock with these funds. That was not always possible based on how the agencies reported whether units were “new” or “rehabbed.” In inter-agency datasets provided to us by VHFA and VHCB, for example, “rehab” is a broad term that includes both existing affordable housing projects getting renovations to increase longevity, as well as older buildings getting turned into apartments for the first time. We opted to include this broader category of “rehab” units in our analysis in order to capture a fuller picture of new homes added to Vermont’s housing stock, and because removing them from the datasets would have required project-by-project research.
Apartments rehabilitated through the VHIP program need to be vacant by definition, with the repair money going toward bringing the unit back up to health code standards. (In a small number of cases, grants have been awarded to occupied rentals for urgent health upgrades; in those instances, property owners were required to house tenants elsewhere while renovations took place.) Therefore, these are effectively apartments reentering Vermont’s housing stock – so we included them in our analysis.
We opted to exclude certain kinds of rehab projects that did not straightforwardly add homes to Vermont’s housing stock, including funding for homeowner health and safety repairs and infrastructure work at manufactured home communities. We also excluded funding for housing projects that serve hyper-specific subpopulations, including farmworkers and people with intellectual and development disabilities. We excluded shelters for people experiencing homelessness.
We thoroughly reviewed the data sources to remove duplicate projects between different agencies and different years. We also fact-checked our methodology with each agency to ensure accuracy.
Regardless, with any data project there are some caveats. To arrive at the total amount of funding, we combined different programs that utilized a combination of tax credits, loans and grants, meaning that when and how money was outlayed could vary from project to project. While we researched many projects in the course of our reporting, we did not fact-check the details of every project with its individual developers. 
We also included two additional data sources in the story to help contextualize the Covid-era funding figures. One is the Vermont Housing Finance Agency’s online database of affordable rentals, which allowed us to look at the overall construction of affordable rental housing before and after the start of the pandemic. The other was the U.S. Census Bureau’s survey of building permits, which captured new construction of both affordable housing and market-rate housing in Vermont.

(Stock photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)A bipartisan pair of Ohio Senators are working to rebuild a housing safety net program aimed at lower income seniors and disabled Ohioans.
The Ohio Housing Finance Agency’s Save The Dream program started during the COVID-19 pandemic, and gave eligible homeowners help with mortgage payments, utility bills, and property taxes.
State Sens. Hearcel Craig, D-Columbus, and Michele Reynolds, R-Canal Winchester, want to restart that program by authorizing the agency to spend up to $10 million in homeowner assistance grants.
Save The Dream
In 2022, the Ohio Housing Finance Agency launched Save The Dream with $280 million in federal funds. The idea was to reduce foreclosures and utility shut-offs brought on by financial hardship tied to the pandemic.
Applicants had to fall below an income threshold — about $100,000 for an individual or just shy of $148,000 for a family of four — and the program capped assistance at $25,000.

According to Ohio Housing Finance Agency reporting, that program wound up spending $260 million of its total appropriation and helped almost 35,000 households.
The lion’s share of that funding, more than $213 million of the total, went to mortgage assistance. It handed out another $27 million to help cover property taxes and about $15 million in utility assistance.
Although it set a relatively generous income cut off of 150% of the area median income, the vast majority of recipients made far less than that.
More than 60% of the households who received assistance reported incomes at or below 50% of the area median income.
The housing finance agency Public Affairs Director Penny Martin said they heard from people “regularly” about how helpful the program was.
“It helped them kind of, I’m going to use the term rebound, from the impacts of the pandemic,” she said. “We still do get calls every now and then asking if the program’s going, if the program is still available.”
The state proposal
The program Sens. Craig and Reynolds envision takes the federally funded program as a model, but it’s dramatically smaller.
Instead of the Department of the Treasury authorizing $280 million, the senators are talking about $10 million. And with that smaller nest egg, eligibility is narrower, and the support available is smaller.
Under Craig and Reynolds’ Ohio Senate Bill 255, homeowners would need less than 75,000 in income to qualify. They’d also need to a senior, disabled, or the caretaker of someone who’s disabled.
Like the federal program, S.B. 255 caps the total amount of assistance a homeowner can receive. Instead of the $25,000 ceiling under the original program, the state plan caps assistance at $3,000.
Still, Craig contends the proposal will deliver important assistance even if it does so on a smaller scale. A missed mortgage payment or utility bill, “can quickly spiral into foreclosure or loss of basic needs,” he said.
“The need is there,” he added, “as you look across the landscape in Ohio.”
Ohio electric bills likely to keep going up after latest PJM auction

For many Ohioans, the financial strain from the pandemic never really went away.
Some have had to find multiple gigs to make up the one job they lost. The inflation rate is no longer flirting with double digits, but costs haven’t gone back to pre-pandemic levels.
Meanwhile, Ohioans are seeing higher utility costs and property tax bills.
Craig thinks a new Save the Dream program could help lighten the load.
“We believe that there’s lots of integrity in the process,” he said. “And it certainly is a process that is needed, and even more valuable now, since you know, things have grown exponentially with regard to access to affordable housing (and) keeping seniors in their homes, certainly. And so, we believe that it has great merit and it’s a process that certainly needs to continue.”
It seems some other policymakers are considering the same issue. City leaders in Columbus, for instance, are rolling out a rental assistance program to soften the impact as a federal rent program expires.

To qualify, a Columbus State graduate must be an Ohio resident, file a Free Application for Federal Student Aid annually, be a full-time Ohio State student, and have a family adjusted gross income of $100,000 or less. 
Buckeye Bridge will cover all tuition and mandatory fees for up to eight semesters at Ohio State. 
“It’s about eliminating uncertainty for students and families,” Columbus State President David Harrison said. “It’s about creating a clear, predictable, guaranteed, debt-free pathway.”
More than 1,000 students per year transfer from Columbus State to Ohio State. 
“This effort will strengthen the associates to bachelor’s pipeline for central Ohioans, creating new pathways for students, further their education, and earn the skills necessary for many of our state’s in-demand jobs,” Ohio State University President Ted Carter said.  
This initiative is about access and opportunity for Ohio students, he said. 
“Every student who’s willing to work hard should have the opportunity to pursue a four-year degree no matter their background,” Carter said. “Programs like Buckeye Bridge send a message to our young people that we want you here, and we’re working hard to reduce barriers to a college education.” 
This will also benefit Ohio’s economy, he said. 
“More Ohio students will have the opportunity to earn their bachelor’s degree, building a strong pipeline of talent for Ohio employers and meeting the need for more highly skilled graduates to fill in demand jobs across our state,” Carter said. 
Imanie Williams, a computer information systems student at Columbus State, will be graduating with her associates degree in the spring and plans to transfer to Ohio State to earn her bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. 
“From a young age, I faced obstacles that could have discouraged me — from losing my sense of home to navigating my 20’s as a caretaker for my grandmother, all working long hours,” said Williams, who was born and raised in Columbus. “Becoming a first-generation student has been a battle, but has built my resilience and strengthened my determination.”
Columbus State helped make her dream of going to college a reality and she is excited to be part of Buckeye Bridge next fall. 
“It shows Ohio State not only believes in hard working students, but is also committed to making sure students like me have the resources we need to succeed even after we transfer,” she said. “This support removes the many barriers I faced and allows me to fully focus on my studies, building my career, and to be able to give back to the community that has raised me.”
More than 60 companies have recently moved or expanded into Ohio, Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel said. 
“There are going to be so many opportunities for our Ohioans to reach their God-given potential,” he said. “This is going to be a great message for the rest of the state that let’s find ways to get together, because we have the greatest opportunities we may have ever had in the history of our state.”

(Photo by Marty Schladen, Ohio Capital Journal.)The largest educator unions across Ohio have filed a lawsuit against the state for removing their voices from the retired teachers’ pension fund.
On Tuesday, the Ohio Education Association (OEA), the Ohio Federation of Teachers (OFT), and the Ohio Conference of the American Association of University Professors (OC AAUP) sued the state, arguing the State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) board changes are “unconstitutional and discriminatory,” according to a press release.
“This policy is the latest in a long line of attacks against educators in Ohio,” said Glenetta Krause of Cincinnati Public Schools in the press release. “Statehouse politicians have underfunded our public schools, rolled back our collective bargaining rights, fully eliminated Ohio’s elected State Board of Education, and told us what we can and can’t teach. Now they’re taking away our representation on our own retirement board. This lawsuit is about restoring fairness and protecting our fundamental right to have a say in how our retirement is managed.”
A last-minute provision in the state budget changed the makeup of the board from seven elected teachers — five contributing and two retired — to three elected, after seats are phased out over several years.
Two of the educator seats will be for active educators, and only one retiree seat will be available.
Under the current statute, signed into law by Gov. Mike DeWine, those four removed educator seats will be filled with newly appointed members.
Right now, the governor gets to appoint one investment expert. The Speaker of the House and the Senate President jointly appoint an expert. The treasurer gets an appointee, and so does the director of the Department of Education and Workforce.
Eventually, the treasurer will get two appointees, the legislative leaders will get one each and one combined, equalling three.
The chancellor of the Department of Higher Education will get one, and the governor and the Department of Education and Workforce each get one.
The lawsuit alleges that the policy violates educators’ right to equal protection under the law because only STRS was changed, not the other four Ohio public employee pension funds.
The educators also take issue with the manner in which the provision was passed, without having it be considered on at least three different days, and that it was included in legislation that was more than one subject. The budget, which was thousands of pages, covered everything from tax policy to STRS to LGBTQ+ rights.
Lawmakers made the decision due to the past year of controversy, they said.
“We stand by the law that was passed and look forward to the law being upheld in court,” state Rep. Adam Bird, R-New Richmond, said Tuesday. “We believe the change was needed to provide stable governance to protect the pensions for hardworking teachers, current retirees, and future retirees.”
Bird was the one who drafted the provision. House Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, was among those unhappy with how the pension fund has been run.
“I think there’s been pretty widespread concern about some of the management of the state teachers’ retirement system,” Stewart said during the budget process.
WEWS’s extensive reporting was cited in the press release.
In summary, there has been constant fighting, two board resignations, and allegations of both public corruption schemes and the mishandling of funds. There has been a senior staff dismissal and at least two senior staff resignations.
A 14-page whistleblower memo given to DeWine in May alleged a massive public corruption scandal brewing and moving quickly within STRS.
Attorney General Dave Yost soon after filed a lawsuit to remove former members Wade Steen and Rudy Fichtenbaum from the board, stating they were participating in a contract-steering “scheme” that could directly benefit them.
The lawsuit accuses the pair of “colluding” with investment startup QED Technologies, run by former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Seth Metcalf and Jonathan (JD) Tremmel, to secure a contract giving them 70% of the STRS assets — about $65 billion at the time. The memo accuses QED of helping to elect board members who may be more sympathetic to their proposal.
Steen and Fichtenbaum have continued to maintain their innocence, arguing that Yost and DeWine are part of a “political scheme” to prevent educators who want more transparency and to change the investment structure. The men are seen as the leaders of the “reform movement.”
This fight began from a debate on how STRS should invest money through the current system of actively managed funds versus an index fund.
Active funds try to outperform the stock market, have more advisors, and typically cost more. Index funds perform with the stock market, are seen as more passive, and typically cost less.
In short, “reformers” want to switch to index funding, while “status quo” individuals want to keep actively managing the funds. Recent elections have allowed the “reform-minded” members to have a majority of the board.
Steen and Metcalf, the men with the relationship at the center of the conversation, also spoke with me in response to the governor’s comments in their own Q&A that can be found here.

(Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)I recently emailed Kansas’ senior senator, Jerry Moran, to ask about life in Washington, D.C.: “How does it feel to live in an occupied city?”
As President Donald Trump moves the country ever closer to a full-fledged autocracy, I wrote: “I wish I could say that I was surprised you have, as far as I can tell, said nothing. But I’m not. In fact, at this point, I would be surprised if you raised your voice (or even said NO with your Senate vote) in any meaningful way. It is past time to stand up and demand some real ‘Kansas Common Sense’ in the spirit of Thomas Paine’s clarion call for ‘Common Sense’ of 1776. If Trump’s cruel takeover of America is not stopped, what will be left to celebrate on the country’s 250th?”
Fifty years ago, as our country readied itself for the bicentennial, this was not the case. At that time, Kansas still had Republican leaders capable of independent thought and action, and our senior senator, James B. Pearson, was one.
Pearson (1920-2009) moved to Johnson County after service in World War II. He engaged with Republican Party politics, served a term in the state senate, and identified with the party’s moderate or progressive wing. After U.S. Sen. Andrew Schoeppel died in January 1962, Pearson’s friend and political ally, Gov. John Anderson, appointed him to the vacant seat to which he was reelected twice (1962-1978).
Pearson became known and respected for bipartisan legislating and a willingness to challenge his party’s administration when he thought it was wrong: Vietnam, nuclear weapons policy, judicial and cabinet nominations, and so on. This did not stop in the wake of the Watergate scandal that took down his party’s president.
Pearson was a prominent minority party member of the Special Committee on the Termination of the National Emergency (later the Special Committee on National Emergencies and Delegated Emergency Powers) chaired by his friend and frequent collaborator, Sen. Frank Church, an Idaho Democrat. The committee conducted an investigation and held hearings in 1973 and 1974, and it introduced “A bill to terminate certain authorities with respect to national emergencies still in effect, and to provide for the orderly implementation and termination of future national emergencies.”
The National Emergencies Act passed the Senate in October 1974 but did not become law until amended in the House, accepted by the Senate, and signed by President Gerald Ford on Sept. 14, 1976. Although admittedly imperfect from the outset, the NEA should be used to reign in the Trump administration before it moves into more “blue cities” across America.
Pearson made his case for reform in this area via an editorial published in the Wichita Eagle and Beacon on Aug. 18, 1974, just nine days after Richard Nixon resigned rather than face almost certain impeachment, conviction, and removal from office.
“To say that a contemporary president would not likely abuse emergency power available to him is no guarantee that some future president under unforeseen conditions might not do so,” Pearson wrote.
Even when done with best of intentions (and clearly this is not Trump), executive orders and the application of emergency powers are a convenient way for the president to make “decisions which should be properly shared with the Congress. … If we are to maintain a proper balance of power over the long haul,” warned the senator, “we must continually be on the alert to prevent the unnecessary exercise of presidential power and the undesirable decline of congressional authority.”
And, I would add, an erosion in the rule of law.
Unfortunately, it does not appear that Moran, who really does seem care about the state and its people at one level, will rise to the occasion and take on the role of statesman, not the mere partisan. Kansas once had members of Congress who understood that abuse of power can come from within one’s own party and acted against it. I am hoping against hope, however, that Moran will follow Pearson’s example and do the right thing at this perilous juncture in our nation’s history.
As Paine wrote in 1776: “I’ll tell you friend … in America THE LAW IS KING. … In free countries the law ought to be King; and there ought to be no other.”

(Courtesy of the Buffett Early Childhood Institute) In early 2025, Step Up to Quality, the Nebraska Department of Education’s voluntary quality-improvement program for early child care providers, reached an exciting milestone: More than 1,000 providers now participate in our program.
This is an important achievement, not only for our expanding community of providers, but also for elevating the caliber of early childhood education in Nebraska. Since launching our program in 2014, nearly 54,000 children in the state have benefitted from enriched learning environments.
Step Up to Quality helps great child care providers become even better through a five-step program that provides specialized training, access to professional coaches and financial incentives. The program also helps parents find high-quality care in their area.
Early childhood is one of the most important times in a person’s life. High-quality early child care and education are crucial to a child’s future success, with 90% of brain development occurring before age 5. Early learning builds the foundation for skills needed in school, work and life.
Children who receive quality early child care and education are more likely to show improved reading and math skills, graduate high school, attend college, have a job and earn higher wages.
In Nebraska, there’s a pressing need for high-quality early child care and education. As of March 2025, 10 of Nebraska’s 93 counties reported no child care providers, according to an analysis by the Buffett Early Childhood Institute. As of 2023, nearly 111,000 Nebraska children under the age of 6 needed child care, according to the 2024 Kids Count in Nebraska Report, the state’s most comprehensive resource on child well-being.

This shortage has a direct impact on Nebraska’s economy. The Kids Count report noted that 74.6% of children under age 6 had all available parents in the workforce in 2023. But when parents don’t have access to care, they can’t work. Estimates show Nebraska loses nearly $745 million a year due to inadequate childcare access, and nearly $1.4  billion a year when factoring multiplier effects across the broader economy, according to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln’s Bureau of Business Research.
At Step Up to Quality, we’re working to bridge this gap. Our community of rated providers currently operate in 86% of Nebraska counties, a number that has grown significantly since the program started in 2014. We’re proud that so many early childhood educators are stepping up and making the effort to improve the care they provide through Step Up to Quality.
When we invest time and other resources into early childhood education, everyone benefits. Investment in early childhood education returns over $7 for every dollar invested, particularly when reaching disadvantaged families, according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. These investments reduce remedial education costs, increase high school graduation rates and increase earnings and tax revenue.
When we invest in our young people, we invest in the health and well being of our entire state.
By joining Step Up to Quality, participating child care providers commit to defining and elevating quality for Nebraska’s children. They exceed licensing requirements by attending extra training, analyzing their business operations, updating their educational offerings to match best practices and continuously improving the quality of the care they provide. The 1,036 Nebraska child care programs participating in Step Up to Quality (as of June 2025) include child cares in homes, centers, Head Start and public school preschools and private preschools.
At Step Up to Quality, we are committed to continual improvement ourselves. We recently redesigned our website, stepuptoquality.ne.gov, adding a search function, consolidating parent and provider resources and partnering with an accessibility consultant to ensure the new site is as accessible as possible, including color contrast, image descriptions and short summaries at the bottoms of main pages.
In addition to joining a community of supportive, like-minded professionals in early childhood education, Step Up to Quality offers advantages to participating child care providers. Since the program began in 2014, 4,820 people have completed our orientation, 361 programs have received free guidance from a professional coach and more than $542,000 has been awarded in incentive bonuses for quality.
These incentives are designed to support existing providers and encourage new providers to enhance the quality of their care, ensuring our children receive the building blocks they need for a bright future.
Lauri Cimino is the director of Step Up to Quality. She has served in early childhood education roles in public schools, nonprofits, federal government programs and privately run child development centers.

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)The Maine Legislature has debated how aggressive the state should be in protecting consumer privacy online for the past several years. But competing proposals — along with sizable behind-the-scenes influence from lobbyists — have left the state still without a comprehensive data privacy law.
When lawmakers return in January, the issue will again be in play. However, this time, they will have insight into how the more stringent version of such law actually works in practice.
Deviating from the more than a dozen states that have adopted a model favored by industry groups, Maryland passed a version that places stricter standards on what data companies can collect or sell, similar to the proposal in Maine that has been favored by the majority of the Judiciary Committee. That law will take effect on Oct. 1.
In an interview with Maine Morning Star, Maryland Sen. Sara Love (D-Montgomery), one of the lead sponsors of the soon-to-be law, said it took several years and intentional countering of a sizable lobbying effort to get it passed. Quoting Maine Morning Star’s 2024 article on lobbying in Maine and across the country, Love said it was like “death by a thousand cuts” with trade organization lobbyists backed by Big Tech asking for more and more amendments.
“A legislator wants to work with groups and compromise with them, but all of a sudden you realize, if you do that, you have nothing — you have a bill that is not worth the paper it’s written on,” Love said. “So we decided ahead of time, what are the most important things to us? Where can we compromise, and where are we drawing the line?”
What ultimately got the bill over the finish line, Love said, was supportive committee chairs and “I think for us, the tech community overplayed their hand.” Another effort to undermine the Maryland law was attempted this year with a bill that Google explicitly supported, though it failed.
In Maine, there is still steep opposition from some lawmakers and local businesses to the proposal most similar to Maryland’s law. Some of the resistance is similar to that seen in Maryland, including concerns about untested language, but an uncertain economic landscape is now also part of the picture, including impact from President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
‘Death by a thousand cuts’: A look at Big Tech’s efforts to influence data privacy

The proposals in Maine
Lawmakers started 2025 with three separate proposals.
The one favored by the Judiciary Committee was carried over into next year and, despite not actually making it to a vote in the Maine Senate or House of Representatives, it drew the most lobbying spending. This bill, LD 1822 sponsored by Rep. Amy Kuhn (D-Falmouth), would make Maine have some of the strictest consumer protections in the country.
The committee nixed a competing plan that was the favorite of business interests, LD 1224 sponsored by Rep. Tiffany Roberts (D-South Berwick), unanimously voting it down in an attempt to limit the number of proposals considered by the full Legislature.
A similar plan, LD 1088 sponsored by Rep. Rachel Henderson (R-Rumford), did make it to the floor but died upon adjournment after the House rejected it. But Henderson plans to propose her version again as an amendment to LD 1822 next year.
Disagreement over what the fundamental framework of such a law should be remains.
Kuhn’s bill relies on a data minimization standard, which broadly means limiting the collection of personal information to only what is necessary to fulfill the consumer service. This is the standard Maryland’s law uses.
The version businesses favor uses what’s referred to as an opt-in model, allowing companies to collect data as long as consumers agree to it.
“The whole point of a data privacy law is to reduce the amount of data overall that is collected about us, and this, in fact, would do that,” Kuhn said of her proposal.
Whereas Henderson said, “I know for sure that it does not go too far,” referring to her proposal’s regulations on businesses, “and that isn’t something I can say for LD 1822.”
Roberts did not respond to Maine Morning Star’s request for comment.
How will the proposals impact small businesses?
In both 2024 and 2025, a key point of pushback from businesses to the stricter proposal was that it would limit their ability to do targeted advertising, a tactic opponents say is disproportionately relied on by small businesses with limited marketing dollars.

Kuhn built her bill off of one considered in the 131st Legislature and said she met with small businesses to try to address remaining concerns before the 132nd Legislature began.
She preserved exemptions that had already been negotiated, including for entire companies whose data collection is already regulated by federal laws. She also made a handful of tweaks based on feedback from businesses.
Notably, she eliminated data identifying an individual’s “online activities over time and across 3rd party websites or online services” from the definition of sensitive data, which would have reduced the ability to track cookies.
“It is critically important that Maine small businesses have access to these digital marketing tools,” Kuhn said. “That question is not in dispute.”
However, business interests are not satisfied.
Targeted advertising
Kuhn’s proposal wouldn’t restrict a business’ ability to do targeted advertising to existing customers, Curtis Picard, CEO of the Retail Association of Maine, which testified against LD 1822, told Maine Morning Star.
But Picard said it would place limits on how they can target new customers — a claim that Kuhn argues is false.
Picard gave the example of someone coming across an ad on social media that they engage with and then after the company pushes an ad or an email giving that person a discount on their first purchase.
“This is an example of a commonly stated generic concern — ‘businesses won’t be able to reach future customers’ — that has been frequently made without any substantiation,” Kuhn said.
Kuhn pointed out that, in that scenario, if a consumer is presented with an ad on social media and then clicks on the link, the consumer has requested a product or service — in this case, access to the website — and received it. Therefore, she said, cookies can be attached and subsequent ads are permitted.
Kuhn’s proposal sets two thresholds for data collection.
It would restrict the collection of personal data (information that can be reasonably linked to a consumer) to only what’s “reasonably necessary and proportionate” to provide the service requested by a consumer. It would also restrict the collection of sensitive data (such as race, citizenship, genetic and other information as defined in the bill) to only what’s “strictly necessary” in that scenario, and outright ban such information from being sold.
Appeals court rules provision of digital ad tax violates First Amendment protections

“A lot of well meaning small businesses are saying it’s going to hurt them but they can’t articulate how,” Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn), a co-sponsor of Kuhn’s bill who also sits on the Judiciary Committee, told Maine Morning Star. “The only answer we’re getting back is uncertainty, which is, in Augusta speak, we don’t actually have any policy concerns with the bill anymore.”
At a work session on May 23, Kuhn asked Stacy Stitham, managing partner at Brann & Isaacson who was working on behalf of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, “Where in the bill is there a barrier to reaching a new customer?”
Stitham responded, “You have to go back to basically the first sentence of the statute which limits the collection of data to what’s reasonably necessary and proportionate to provide or maintain a specific product or service requested by the consumer,” which is the data minimization standard.
This mirrors the Maryland law. Stitham added, “As we know, the Maryland law is not in effect yet. We don’t know how that’s being interpreted, but it’s much different than the standard that’s used by other states which talk about disclosed purposes.”
During the final work session for the bill this year on May 30, ​​Maine Assistant Attorney General Brendan O’Neil from the consumer protection office said, “I don’t see a restriction on targeted advertising in the bill.”
There is currently a patchwork of state laws and parts of federal legislation governing internet privacy, as there remains no one overarching federal law, despite several proposals. Connecticut was the fifth state to enact an omnibus privacy law in 2022 but its version, the one favored by industry groups, has been the model adopted by most states that followed.
In the work session, O’Neil pointed to the Connecticut’s attorney general’s recommendation for its state Legislature to amend the law to strengthen data minimization provisions rather than rely on its current “exploitable” consent model.
Reading from the officer’s report, O’Neil summarized, “‘serious privacy and data security concerns could have been offset, if not fully alleviated, if companies had properly minimized the data they collected and maintained.’ That’s really what LD 1822’s data minimization standard aims to do.”
Connecticut tweaked its law in several ways this spring, but did not ultimately adopt the data minimization standard as seen in Kuhn’s proposal and the Maryland law.
Consumer consent
On May 29, a coalition of business groups including the Maine State Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee outlining their major concerns, notably the data minimization standard.
But the letter also took issue with the sensitive data restrictions — which mirror those in Maryland’s law — arguing instead that data use should be tied to consumer consent, not based on data type.

This was another common argument brought up by those who favored Henderson’s version.
“They want to completely remove consent so that a consumer can’t even consent to have their information used to get discounts or to be marketed to and I want to keep that consent piece,” Henderson said.
Stitham, representing the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, made a similar point this spring.
“While clearly intended to be more consumer protective,” Stitham said, “by shifting the focus from consumer consent to disclosed purposes to whatever the business can characterize as needed to provide or maintain a requested product or service, the bill actually eliminates consumer choice and control, and potentially leaves room for businesses to justify broad data collection practices without the consumer’s clear, informed consent.”
Kuhn and lawmakers who favor her proposal said this argument rests on a false contention that Maine consumers engage in informed and voluntary consent now.
Sen. Anne Carney (D-Cumberland) said Henderson’s bill “was essentially preserving the status quo with regard to the protections that consumers currently have in the absence of any data privacy law.”
It would take the average person more than 40 hours per month to read the privacy policies that an American consumer typically encounters each month, according to testimony given to the committee and affirmed by recent studies.
Kuhn gave the example of health tracker apps that require consumer consent to the terms and conditions in order to use the product when saying, “That’s not voluntary consent. It’s a mandatory threshold.”
Henderson drew a distinction between lengthy terms and conditions and what would be required in her bill. “It has to be clear, conspicuous, bold,” she said of the privacy notice allowing consumers to opt out of having their data sold or used in marketing.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
When asked to comment on their latest stance on Kuhn’s bill, L.L. Bean deferred to the company’s testimony, in which legal counsel Christy van Voorhees argued LD 1822’s data minimization standard effectively bans the vast majority of personalized, targeted advertising.
This testimony echoed that of many businesses, but also underscored that the current political landscape is another key factor.
“These restrictions are being proposed at a historically challenging time for Maine retailers,” van Voorhees said. “The ongoing retreat of Canadian customers from U.S. businesses, coupled with the increased costs associated with new universal and threatened reciprocal tariffs, is squeezing marketing budgets. That means that the marketing investments we do make have to be efficient. Personalized, targeted ads are among our most efficient marketing investments.”
Concern of economic uncertainty — which was also raised by industry associations such as HospitalityMaine and individual businesses like Union River Lobster Pot restaurant — makes Kuhn believe the decision to carry over her bill to the next session was the best choice, as well as opportune timing with the start of Maryland’s law.
With an effective date of Oct. 1, Maryland’s law will provide three months of results by the time the Maine Legislature returns in January, though there is also a cure period, giving entities 60 days to adhere after a notice of violation from the Maryland Attorney General on or before April 1, 2027.
“We’ll be able to see, what impact did this phrasing, this language, have on small businesses in Maryland?” Kuhn said. “Were they able to continue to draw ads just as they can now?”
As Maine has considered a data privacy law, businesses have stressed the importance of interoperability between states.
“I’m getting tired of Maine being this petri dish for national groups trying to get first-in-the-nation type of legislation,” said Picard, of the retail association. “I do think Representative Kuhn was trying to make it work, but ultimately it ends up being convoluted and complex language that has been untested.”
Now, Kuhn and supporters of her proposal say Maryland’s law will provide that test, affording a preview of how passing such a law would go in Maine.
But others say it’ll be too soon to tell.
“You’re not going to see the sky fall in a few months,” Henderson said.
Kuhn and Henderson said if either version of a data privacy law is finally passed next session, continuous adjustments will still be needed. Both of their bills would require annual reviews by the state attorney general, similar to those required in other states.
Currently, LD 1822, Kuhn’s bill that was carried over, is still in possession of the Maine House. It’s unclear whether the body will recommit it to committee or take action on the floor when lawmakers return.
Other than shifting the implementation date back, Kuhn doesn’t plan to amend her proposal, but she said she’s leaving the possibility open if any glaring need for changes become apparent once Maryland’s law is in effect.
There is also a concept draft, LD 595 sponsored by Carney, being carried over into next year. It currently reads that it could “further update certain consumer privacy laws in response to recent developments in federal and state consumer privacy laws.”
Carney said she originally filed the placeholder bill not knowing what the changes would be made to Connecticut’s law or possible federal law. The legislation will now serve a similar purpose next year as a way for the Judiciary Committee to address the moment — whatever it may look like — if needed.

(Ocala-Marion County webpage)Florida has three national parks — Everglades, Biscayne, and Dry Tortugas, all in the southern end of the state. Now newbie U.S. Rep. Randy Fine of Brevard County wants to create a fourth one, this time in the north end, for Florida’s springs.
He’s filed a bill, H.R.4656, called the “Path to Florida Springs National Park Act.” It directs the secretary of the Interior Department to conduct a study to “determine the suitability and feasibility of establishing Florida Springs National Park in Central and North Florida.”
“When I saw these Florida springs, places unlike anything else you’ll find in Florida, unlike anything else you’ll find in America, unlike anything else you’ll find in the world, I thought these, too, are worthy of designation,” Fine said during an Aug. 25 press conference at Juniper Springs to unveil his bill. “We literally are the Yellowstone of springs.”
The study area, spelled out in Fine’s bill, covers about 2,800 square miles between Jacksonville, Orlando, and Gainesville. That’s bigger than Biscayne (270 square miles), Dry Tortugas (100 square miles), and even Everglades National Park (2,350 square miles).
Sounds pretty good, doesn’t it? But not everybody thinks Fine’s bill is so fine.
In fact, as the Daytona Beach News Journal reported last week, there’s now a petition opposing it. As of Wednesday, the number of signatures topped 8,000.
“While we value public access to natural spaces, this bill threatens the long-term health of one of Florida’s most ecologically sensitive regions,” says the Change.org petition.
They’re concerned that Fine’s park plan is just a ploy to promote commercial development in areas that are now quite placid.  
I wondered, who’s right? Whose vision for the springs truly springs from a desire to do right by these natural gems?
Measureless caverns
I have to say that Fine is not wrong about the wonderful qualities of our springs.
We have more springs gushing up from our aquifer than any other place on earth. Florida’s ancient inhabitants regarded them as sacred places.
Doug Stamm via Facebook
“One has to look at springs as the first Floridians would have, seemingly magical waters rising from the forest to provide a source of perpetual fresh water and food and a place to stay,” Doug Stamm, author of the authoritative guidebook “Springs of Florida,” once told me. “Who would not think that was a sacred gift of the Creator to be treasured?”
Pioneering naturalist William Bartram’s account of Florida’s springs inspired Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s poem about Kubla Khan and his “caverns measureless to man.”
The springs were our earliest tourist attraction. Unscrupulous hucksters convinced wealthy Northerners that the cure for what ailed them was to sit and soak in Florida’s therapeutic waters, even the ones that smelled like rotten eggs.
They’re still a major tourist draw. Who wouldn’t want to splash around in cool, bubbling waters on a hot summer day? Florida State University says just one, Wakulla Springs State Park, contributes about $20 million annually in tourism spending. Think of how much a dozen or so bring in!
Yet former Gov. Rick Scott and sitting Gov. Ron DeSantis have done an incredibly poor job of taking care of them. Lots of our springs now suffer from a loss of flow due to overpumping from the aquifer, as well as pollution caused by leaky sewer lines and septic tanks plus fertilizer and animal poop in stormwater runoff.
The springs were showing a steep decline in 2016 when the Legislature became alarmed. Legislators passed a law that said the Department of Environmental Protection “shall adopt uniform rules for issuing permits which prevent groundwater withdrawals that are harmful to the water resources and adopt by rule a uniform definition of the term ‘harmful to the water resources’ to provide water management districts with minimum standards necessary to be consistent with the overall water policy of the state.”
The law said the DEP had to complete that assignment by 2017. Instead, the agency gave itself another year, then another, then another, and so on. They kept hitting the snooze button, meanwhile issuing more and more of those damaging permits.
Imagine if you could do that with any law or order you didn’t like: “Sorry, Gov. D, I know you want this rainbow crosswalk painted out, but I’m giving myself another three years to comply.” It wouldn’t go over well, would it?
Then, in 2022, the DEP finally unveiled its new rules. They were pretty much the same rules as the ones in 2016 that had doomed the springs.
Ryan Smart via LinkedIn
An environmental group, the Florida Springs Council, has been fighting for years to get DEP to follow the law, so far with little success. I was curious about what their longtime executive director, Ryan Smart, thought of Fine’s national park proposal.
The answer: Not much.
“I can’t see any way in which it will benefit Florida’s springs,” he told me.
Restoring the springs
The idea of creating a national park featuring a lot of Florida springs has been floating around for several years, Smart told me. To him, it’s never made much sense.
For one thing, all of the springs within the proposed park are already permanently protected. They’re part of various state parks, state preserves, state forests, and national forests.
The ones that are state parks will be protected even better than a national park might, Smart said. Just this year, the Florida Legislature passed a new law to block any efforts — by the governor or anyone else — to bring golf courses, fancy lodges, pickleball, or some other not-a-park use. That means no commercial development can threaten them.
The state parks have another advantage over the national kind, he said. Local residents have input on management plans for the state parks. National parks are managed from Washington.
“Changing state parks or state forests into national forests or national parks,” Smart said, “doesn’t do any of the things that need to be done to actually restore the springs.” 
Hopeful but doubtful 
I talked to some more smart people besides just Smart.
Stamm told me that he thinks the national park study might be a good idea. But it would probably take too long and cost too much money to do the springs any good.
“I’m hopeful,” he told me, “but I doubt it will ever happen.”
Clay Henderson via subject
I made sure to call Clay Henderson, a former Florida Audubon president who has also written the definitive history of environmental land preservation in Florida, “Forces of Nature.”
He pointed out that a chunk of the study area lies within the Ocala National Forest, established in 1908 by order of President Teddy Roosevelt.
Thousands of people live within the forest boundaries, and they’re allowed to hunt there. If it were a national park, they would have to put their guns away.
“You can’t hunt in a national park,” he said.
He also reminded me that, under the sitting president — who Fine endorsed and who returned the favor when Fine ran for Congress — the budget and personnel for the National Park Service have been slashed to the bone.
Since the goal of the park service these days is to downsize, not add new parks, he said, “I don’t expect to see a favorable report.”
Re-run of a reject
The most interesting insights came from Haley Moody, executive director of the Howard T. Odom Florida Springs Institute. First opened 15 years ago, the institute in High Springs has done more than anyone else to take a deep dive into what makes the springs work and what’s harming them.
Haley Moody via Linkedin
According to Moody, her organization has already looked into protecting the springs by creating a national park — and rejected the idea.
“In 2021, we got a small grant from the National Parks Conservation Association,” Moody told me. “We worked on it for a couple of years to see if the idea had legs. We held several stakeholders’ meetings.”
A lot of the folks who live in the area “were not receptive to the idea of the federal government acquiring all the land,” she said. That doomed it.
Instead, she said, her organization is proposing something different: a Florida Springs National Heritage Area, which would not be as restrictive as a national park. It would cover the northern two-thirds of the state — everything north of Lake Okeechobee, basically. And the people who live in the area could contribute ideas on how best to protect it.
Fine would know all that if he’d just asked.
But he didn’t, so now we’re headed for a re-run of what the Florida Springs Institute rejected.
An expert visitor
I had a telephone chat with the congressman about all this. I confess I approached the call with some trepidation. When he was in the Legislature, Fine was widely regarded as the biggest hothead since the Fantastic Four’s Human Torch.
But perhaps being elected to Congress cooled him off. Rep. Fine and I had a very civil discussion, by which I mean he insulted other people but not me.
He told me he became interested in the national parks because he’s been taking his kids to visit as many of them as possible. So far, they’ve traveled to 61 out of the 63.
“I consider myself an expert on the national parks as a visitor,” he told me.
When he first saw the magnificence of a Florida spring, “I thought that the Florida springs should have a national designation too.”
When I asked why he didn’t consult any springs experts, he said that’s why he’s calling for a study. Let the experts weigh in then, not before the study gets off the ground.
When I mentioned the Change.org petition opposing his bill, he snapped, “How many are real people?” He compared the thousands of petitioners to the thousands of chatbots who follow his X account.
“The feedback I’ve gotten from actual humans has been good,” he told me.
He conceded that one of the petitioners’ concerns — that a national park would attract commercial development – is legitimate. But he had a response for that.
 “I thought there was a desire for more economic development,” he told me. “You can get a factory in there, or you can get something that protects the natural resources.”
When I mentioned some of the reservations I’d heard from people like Smart, he didn’t want to hear it.
“This bill should not be controversial on its face,” he said. “Anyone who opposes this idea is not a real environmentalist.”
Stop wasting time
When Fine told me he didn’t talk to any springs experts, he didn’t mean he didn’t discuss this with anyone, period. One person who did consult with the congressman on it was Jonathan Rubin, executive director and president of the Clean Earth Initiative.
Moody met him at the congressman’s press conference. She’d never heard of his organization before. Neither had Smart.
Jonathan Rubin via Linkedin
Maybe that’s because Rubin’s organization is fairly new. The Palm Beach County native started it less than a year ago. Before that, he spent four years running an organization in Boca Raton called Fresh Florida Farms to promote hydroponic crops.
Clean Earth Initiative’s website says it was set up to bring together a lot of different Florida environmental groups because “together, our voice is stronger and more effective.”
The 25 organizations who have joined so far range from the well-known Tropical Audubon Society to more obscure ones, such as the Crustacean Plantation. None of them are specifically for springs. In fact, most are from the southern half of the state.
Now Rubin is pushing the Florida Springs National Park and has even produced a video about it featuring Fine.
It occurred to me that the Clean Earth Institute might get the contract to do the study called for in Fine’s bill. When I asked Rubin about that, he said the decision would be up to the National Park Service.
I asked Rubin if he wrote the bill for Fine. After some hemming and hawing, he said he did not write it, but “I provided the proposal that his staff used to write the bill.”
He said the study will need to address important questions: “Do we close some of it to hunting or all of it? Do we allow commercial development on it or none?”
But those are questions that the Florida Springs Institute has already addressed. Why spend money that the National Park Service doesn’t have now, to study something that’s already been reviewed and rejected?
What would make more sense is if Fine were to use his clout with the Trump administration to put pressure on DeSantis to do his job. Maybe the White House could encourage him to focus on fixing the springs’ flow and pollution problems, instead of wasting his time painting over all those colorful crosswalks.

Driven by big dreams, tempered with strong work ethic and the resilience to overcome hardship, immigrants from every part of the world call this state home. This is as true today as it has been for generations. Immigrants have been integral to the state’s economic success, founding new businesses and developing world-changing inventions that have brought prosperity to native-born and immigrant alike.
Examples abound. The helicopter was invented by Connecticut’s Igor Sikorsky, who immigrated from Kiev, Ukraine – and for whom Sikorsky Aircraft is named.  Electric Boat, today the economic engine of Eastern Connecticut, was founded by immigrant Isaac Rice.  Holocaust survivor Joseph Gerber founded Gerber Scientific in Connecticut and revolutionized global manufacturing.
The hard work of immigrants is often hidden in plain sight – in the food we eat, the groceries we buy, the places we work.  Stop & Shop was founded by an immigrant family in New England, as were Big Y, Cumberland Farms, Sam’s Food Stores, and TJ Maxx.  Immigrants like Frank Pepe made New Haven the pizza capital of the world, and immigrant restaurateurs like Lobster Landing’s Enea Bacci and Mill On The River’s Helmar Wolf continue to shape our culinary culture today.  Carlos Mouta’s Parkville Market is a melting pot of cuisines brought to Connecticut from every part of the world.
The very face of our state was shaped by immigrants.  Hartford’s iconic Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Arch was designed by immigrant architect George Keller.  Another Irish immigrant, Kevin Roche, designed New Haven’s Knights of Columbus Building and Danbury’s Corporate Center – among many other famous works across the U.S.  Holocaust survivor David Chase revitalized Connecticut’s cities through the construction of Hartford’s Gold Building and Stilts Building, and New Haven’s Connecticut Financial Center.  The construction firms Gilbane, Manafort Brothers, and Tomasso Group, responsible for many of the largest projects in our state, were all established by immigrant tradesmen.
The next generation of thinkers and innovators are being educated at the University of Connecticut – led by an Immigrant Heritage Hall of Fame inductee, President Radenka Maric.  Yale’s School of Nursing is led by Persian immigrant Dean Azita Emami, and Yale’s School of Management is led by Guyanese immigrant Dean Kerwin Kofi Charles.  The chancellor of the CT State Colleges & Universities system, John Maduko, is the son of Igbo-Nigerian immigrants.
Immigrants continue to help our farmers raise crops, pick tobacco, and run Connecticut dairies.  It is hard and oftentimes dangerous work.  Yet, without the grit and determination of immigrants seeking a better life, there could well be no food on our tables.  This has been the case for each new generation: our state saw waves of Jewish, Swiss Apostolic, Italian, and Portuguese farmers over the course of just the 20th century alone.
Yet, every generation of immigrants has faced similar hostility from groups of Americans who mistakenly feared their differences.  Most who fear and reject immigrants today are descendants of immigrants who were similarly demonized.  The first Catholic immigrants were seen by many New Englanders as an existential threat.  It is now hard to imagine New England without their contributions.
At a time when newcomers face similar hostility, it is important that we remind ourselves, and others in our communities, of the contributions continually made by those who have come to this country and our state with an unyielding determination to build a new life for themselves and their families – and in pursuing that objective, contribute mightily to making America a better place.
Connecticut’s state motto, “Qui Transtulit Sustinet,” translates from Latin as “He who is transplanted, still sustains.”  Immigrants “transplanted” from elsewhere have indeed sustained  and thrived, and in doing so have strengthened the fabric of our state and nation.
Inspiring stories of immigrant achievement are celebrated at the Immigrant Heritage Hall of Fame’s annual induction ceremony.  


On September 25, we add four exemplary Connecticut immigrants to an impressive roster of inductees who have not only overcome obstacles to attain personal success, but who give back to the broader immigrant community and all who live here:

Ali Antar: emeritus professor of physics, founder and co-president of the Islamic Association of Greater Hartford, co-founder of the Muslim Coalition of Connecticut, interfaith leader, and a founding member of We Refuse to Be Enemies in coalition with Muslims, Jews, and Christians.
Dana Bucin: one of the most respected immigration attorneys in Connecticut, representing immigrants and refugees, including Afghan nationals applying for humanitarian status, and Ukrainian refugees following Russia’s full-scale invasion.
Demetrios Giannaros: economist, educator, and elected official, he served for 16 years in the Connecticut legislature, was Deputy Majority Leader and the first foreign-born individual to serve as Deputy Speaker.  Giannaros has served in numerous immigrant community nonprofit organizations, including the Connecticut Immigrant & Refugee Coalition.
Homa Naficy: founder of Hartford Public Library’s American Place, nationally-recognized for its work helping immigrants learn English, study for the citizenship exam, and succeed in their new homeland. Naficy was appointed by President Obama to serve on the National Museum and Library Services Board and served until 2023.

When residents from across Connecticut gather to honor these accomplished individuals, express our gratitude for their enduring contributions, and reflect on the remarkable history of immigrants in our state, past and present, it will be an appreciation well-earned and well deserved.  Evident as well will be the earnest hope that our shared pride will resonate not only here but well beyond Connecticut.

The easy grab, history shows, is authority-driven retaliation.","The picture remains blurred on the personal conflicts and motivations driving a 22-year-old video gamer, with developing thoughts on politics, to allegedly assassinate conservative political activist Charlie Kirk.
However, it’s clear we live in times again of deep social and political unrest, including inflammatory social, political, and cultural comments daily, similar to 1968, when the assassination of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. also occurred in a charged environment.
Emotion often outruns reason, then tragedy strikes.
The Kirk shooting is only one of many horrendous, violent physical, verbal, and strategic attacks occurring as often as sipping water or targeting video game characters to die and resurrect with infinite resets of life. It’s also a time when we feel bodacious and entitled to be heard and forcefully thrust our beliefs on others.
In such a climate, we must be careful of the slippery slope of blaming fiery words as the cause of these actions and attitudes. The easy grab, history shows, is authority-driven retaliation, shrinking freedoms, and dissenters branded as enemies of law, order, reason, and the public good.
The paradox here is that fiery words come from all sides.
As an adjunct professor at Manchester Community College, I found this week a teaching moment —unlike most others— to discuss free speech, hate speech, and inciting speech with my students. The class at first was rooted in strong opinions without discernment between the expression of opinion and avoiding a blanket legal prohibition of those they find offensive.
What is acceptable one day could be unacceptable another, so how should we decide? I asked them.
The answers were all feeling-based, as I expected from 20-somethings. They haven’t the backgrounds, beliefs, or experiences to remember the 1960s; many can’t even express a clear understanding of the civil rights movement. They haven’t lived enough of life in many respects.
For them, as much as for the general public, it was an opportunity for educational understanding about the true value of their freedoms.
People make the polarized climate, I started explaining. Behavior about national issues stretches into your neighborhood, too. That same reflex plays out in local communities’ social media posts and public meeting comments, veering from unsettling to unhinged, some pushing the boundaries of what comes next.
So we must ask: What do we do about speech we strongly dislike —even hate— when the stakes are high, opinions differ, and emotions run strong, whether about national issues or local zoning, school, town, or city policy matters?
We, first, must hold two truths:

Yes, people’s words can harm —and the law must act when people cross clear lines.
But yes, a free society requires the freedom for people to speak, even when their speech offends. It is freedom for the thoughts we hate that matter most.

The legal standard is clear. Under Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), speech can only be punished if it is (1) intended to incite unlawful action, (2) imminent, and (3) likely to produce that unlawful act.
A second, more recent rule comes from Counterman v. Colorado (2023): true threats—particularly online— are only criminal if the speaker acted with at least recklessness. That means they knew their words could be seen as a threat and spoke anyway.
These standards draw a bright line. Ugly, outrageous, or offensive speech may still be legal. But direct incitement and true threats, made knowingly or recklessly, can and should be prosecuted.
What about social media? The law still applies.
Dean Erwin Chemerinsky, of the University of California’s Berkeley Law School, notes that Counterman helps courts distinguish real threats from hyperbole. University of California, Los Angeles’s Eugene Volokh adds that punishment should be limited to speech narrowly tied to imminent crime —not just because it’s inflammatory.
Nadine Strossen, former American Civil Liberties Union president, advocates “counter speech, not censorship” unless legal standards are met. Law scholar Danielle Citron argues that laws on threats, stalking, and “intimate privacy” already cover most online abuse. Other legal scholars, like Jack Balkin and Kate Klonick, remind us those platforms —not government— enforce most digital speech rules.
Where’s balance?
At a rally following the Kirk shooting, law professor Stephen E. Sachs urged the crowd to think differently about how we argue. It’s about how people handle their thoughts and feelings, separate considerations.
He drew on the writing of psychiatrist and essayist Scott Alexander (a pen name), who once noted that a short-term focus may be part of the problem.
As Sachs put it, “Everyone … knows that they are right. The only remaining problem is how to convince others. Go on Facebook and you will find a million people with a million different opinions, each confident in her own judgment, each zealously devoted to informing everyone else.”
Sachs acknowledged that debate can feel frustrating, slow, and rarely decisive. Yet he defended its worth, saying, “Logical debate has one advantage over narrative, rhetoric, and violence: it’s an asymmetric weapon. That is, it’s a weapon that is stronger in the hands of the good guys than in the hands of the bad guys.”
The professor contrasted the enduring strength of reason with the fleeting impact of coercion or force.
“You didn’t develop your opinions after a five-minute shouting match. You developed them after years of education and acculturation and engaging with hundreds of books and hundreds of people. Why should they (opponents) be any different?” Sachs said, urging patience and persistence.
He closed by reminding listeners that lasting change comes from teaching people “ways to distinguish truth from falsehood,” even when that learning must withstand blustery counterforce or competition in the marketplace of ideas for acceptance.
The path forward
Our laws regarding speech and incitement are meant in part to also help foster cooler heads. They also are directed at sending a message about prosecution to those who want to ignore the need in a democratic society for reason.
Reasoning —discernment— helps to define what is a harsh expression of opinion from a direct provocation that mobilizes or causes people to bring imminent harm to others or the country.
We have had much debate, especially with the Jan. 6 riots at the end of the last Trump administration, over that precise meaning.
As more facts emerge about the Utah shooting, let us mourn— but not lose our heads. Let’s also cool the often-inflammatory rhetoric on social media. Whether discussing national politics or town political or policy issues, let’s pause, observe, and ask: What is my intent? What’s the likely result? Can I disagree using discernment?
Let’s teach and model for our kids about that precise and detailed thinking, even if schools aren’t doing an adequate job with it. Parents and guardians need to be the controlling force.
We do this not because we’re hard on hate, but because we’re strong on liberty.
Student comments during and afterward were interesting, and the teaching moment broad and penetrating.
“Charlie did what a lot of people fear doing, which is ‘speaking out’ and ‘public speaking,’” one student said. “He took his freedom of speech and started a following with people who have the same beliefs and grew a platform, but he did more than that.”
“He also invited the people who didn’t have the same values/views as him, showing that freedom of speech isn’t just about expressing ideas but making room for difficult and uncomfortable conversations,” she added.
Yet, for most of these students and as mirrored by a CNN commentator this week, determining the line between “actionable” speech and vicious commentary is hard to distinguish.
Another student offered, “One crosses that line once the words they are saying start to entice violence against other groups, or just downright accepting violence, like when Charlie Kirk stated, ‘I think it’s worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment to protect our other God-given rights’…or when he said, ‘Happening all the time in urban America, prowling Blacks go around for fun to go target white people, that’s a fact. It’s happening more and more.'”
“These statements accept violence and can be interpreted to entice violence against certain groups of people, and if left unchecked, this can turn into a 1930s Germany situation where people are calling for the extermination of certain ethnic/social/political groups (Jews, homosexuals, and Communists),” he added.
These and other kinds of comments required clarification, debate, discernment, and questioning —complex, difficult, and delayed in gratification for expressing a feeling or emotion,but needing to reconcile it with their thinking-level skills.
It is something many found startling in the face of discernment, but understandable as I, a nearly 70-year-old professor teaching nearly 40 years, looked at the youthful faces. They had much more of life to wrestle with yet.
The answer to hateful speech is not to ban all tough talk —but to uphold the law and protect the space for debate that includes thoughtful —perhaps sharp, even belligerent— commentary, but that avoids imminent provocation. It’s a thin line, almost impossible to define. It’s also one that preserves real free speech.
Let’s keep the Republic sane, I concluded. On that, they all agreed.

Sears",,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/09/17/lawmakers-call-for-hearings-to-review-broken-social-services-administration/,"Maryland lawmakers plan to hold hearings in coming weeks on reports that the Social Services Administration may have let children in its care be housed with registered sex offenders, just one of many allegations in an audit of a ""broken"" agency.","Maryland lawmakers say they expect to hold hearings in the coming weeks on a new audit that uncovered a litany of problems at the Social Services Administration.  (File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Maryland lawmakers plan to hold hearings in coming weeks on reports that the Social Services Administration may have let children in its care be housed with registered sex offenders, just one of many allegations in an audit of a “broken” agency.
“We need to make sure that the state — who is charged with overseeing their care — is doing so in the best way possible and ensuring the safety of these children,” said Sen. Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County), co-chair of the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee, which received the audit on the administration Wednesday.
Hettleman said she expects the committee will hold a hearing in the near future to investigate issues at the administration, a unit of the Department of Human Services that oversees the delivery of care by the state’s 24 local social service departments to about 24,000 children.
The 70-page report from the Office of Legislative Audits found that, among other problems, the state may have approved the placement of children in  homes at addresses that were also listed as the address for seven registered sex offenders. Auditors also found that one group of foster care homes had an employee how had been convicted of sexual abuse of a minor, and another vendor that provided care for children being housed in hotels had an employee who was convicted of murder in 1990 — although it was not clear if that employee had access to children.
State may have put children in homes where registered sex offenders lived

Lisae Jordan, executive director of the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault, said that many children end up in foster care because of sexual assault — she said 28.4% of the child abuse or neglect in Maryland in 2020 was sexual abuse. Placing those children in the care of registered sex offenders is “beyond irresponsible,” she said.
“Rather than protecting them [children], the state is apparently exposing them further,” she said. “They’re one of the most vulnerable people in Maryland and they deserve better.”

Auditors said that many of the problems identified in the newest report were included in previous of the administration, but that they have not been addressed. The audit concluded that the SSA’s accountability and compliance level was unsatisfactory for the third audit in a row, with some repeated findings dating back to 2008.
That did not surprise Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Howard and Anne Arundel), who chaired the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee three years ago when it held a hearing to review the same issues at the administration.
“This goes back a long way, you know,” Lam said Wednesday. “While it still continues to this day, this extends as far back as audits that go only back to 2017 and there have been repeat audit findings that have come up in the past.”
Lam agreed with the auditors’ conclusion that job vacancies at the SSA “contributed, at least in part” to the problems. The audit said that the administration reported a vacancy rate of 12% to 22% over the last four years, and that as of June 30, 2024, about 19% of the agency’s 141 positions were vacant.
“You’re operating with an agency that’s very hollowed out … and so I think they probably are understaffed and don’t have enough people to be able to address all these concerns as well,” Lam said.
In a statement from the Maryland House Republican Caucus, GOP lawmakers said the audit’s findings were “not just disgusting and infuriating, but absolutely heartbreaking.”
“These are children who are under the care and guardianship of the state and deserve every protection we can give them,” said Assistant Minority Leader April Rose (R-Frederick and Carroll) in the statement. “This is a complete failure of the state’s most basic responsibility.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Chief Deputy Minority Whip Wayne Hartman (R-Lower Shore) concluded the statement by saying there is “no excuse, absolutely no excuse, for “this level of complete negligence.”
Lam cited what he thinks is a “void in leadership” at the administration to address the problems.
“I think it’s clear from this audit that this is a broken agency, that the Social Services Administration has a long way to go in reforming their practices, bringing it up to standards and ensuring the safety of those that are under their care,” he said.
He said lawmakers could withhold funding from the administration, but said doing that to an already understaffed and underfunded agency “doesn’t seem incredibly appetizing.” The other option, he said, is “to redouble our efforts to hold their feet to the fire and make sure that they’re accountable in response to these concerns.”
“So then we’re only left with the other tool, which is every couple years, bringing them up before the joint audit committee and hoping that public shaming will be effective in getting them to step up and address these significant fundamental shortcomings in their processes,” Lam said.
“Unfortunately, that doesn’t seem to have had much of an impact either, because we’re facing a lot of the same findings of a broken department,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/IMG_0490-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-17 23:56:29.279187

(Stock photo/Getty Images)School reform desperately needs to be jolted out of its disastrous policy and political stalemate. But not the big jolt in the big education tax credits in President Donald Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill.
The tax credits seriously threaten the survival of public education. Here’s why.
For many years, Republicans have been zealously pushing school choice, like vouchers, and making headway in red states. I have warned of the dangers in this trend. But the tax credits under the BBB are a national gamechanger.
Parents of school-age children will be able to get a $1,700 tax credit for contributions to a nonprofit scholarship-granting organization (SGO). SGOs can distribute the funds to almost any school, with private secular and religious schools being the recipients sought by conservatives.
There are many open questions about how it will work. But the Treasury Department, under Trump, has great leeway in promulgating regulations that are sure to maximize the potential damage.
Liberal opponents cite many objections. First, it will accelerate a mass exodus of parents from public schools, costing schools precious funds and leaving them students who are mainly poor and of color. This will happen because parents with incomes of as much $300,000 in Maryland and other states could qualify.
Parents of disadvantaged students can get the credits too. But they are much less likely to apply because they lack the know-how to access the application process; and the $1,700 tax credit will not come close to paying the full cost of private schools.

Second, the tax credits will further erode the separation of church and state. Religious groups will probably be able to form their own SGOs, and in states with voucher programs, the vast majority have been used for religious schools. This means that all taxpayers are funding religious schools.
Third, while the tax credits will be paid out of federal funds, those funds could be better spent on public schools. The BBB credits will cost as much as $51 billion, which greatly exceeds the $30 billion in current federal aid for poor and disabled students. The stratospheric cost of the credits destroys even the remote possibility of more federal funds for public schools in the years ahead.
Under the BBB, states can opt out of the tax credit program. But that’s more political curse than blessing for elected officials in blue states. If they opt out, many constituents will lose valuable benefits, thus accelerating Democrats’ freefall from their former political superiority over Republicans on education policy.
Polls show growing support of Democrats for choice programs like tax credits. The CEO of Democrats for Education Reform says, “We’re not delivering policy-wise and are losing support politically.”
The dilemma is causing governors in blue states to sweat and waffle. Gov. Wes Moore is one of them.
But they may have a partial escape route.  A Brookings Institute report points out how tax credits “could become a boon for educational choice in red states and educational enrichment in blue states.”
The liberal journalist, Paul Gastris, encourages blue states to “Tutorize, Don’t Privatize, Public Schools.” Conservative efforts, like the BBB credits, “could be a golden opportunity for Democrats.”
How so? The BBB allows scholarship funds to cover a wide range of student services, not just tuition, but tutoring, services for students with disabilities, supplies like books and computers, and transportation.
Moreover, states can regulate requirements for SGOs and prohibit them from discrimination based on sexual orientation or religion.
So, how is all this likely to play out? That’s hard to say until the regulations are finalized.
One key variable involves how SGOs will be required or allowed to select which parents get what amounts of money. Another revolves around the mandate that SGOs are not allowed to earmark contributions for students whose parents were donors. This provision is certain to provoke intrigue and political maneuvering as donors seek favoritism.
The one certainty is continuing controversy. In the meantime, governors like Moore must confront the policy options and political trade-offs.
It’s hard to say exactly what those options are until the Treasury regulations are finalized. But it seems to me that, because of the wide political appeal of the tax credits, they have little choice but to embrace them in some way.  Sadly, chalk it up as another Trump triumph over the future of public education.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-115093584-scaled-1-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-09-17 23:56:29.279187

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Officials at the University of Alaska said this week that previously announced cuts to federally funded programs for Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian students will be worse than initially thought. 
At the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the canceled funding will amount to an estimated $8.8 million, and University of Alaska Southeast programs will also be affected but to a lesser degree. 
“​​It was quite a shock, because there was no forewarning to this,” said Bryan Uher, interim vice chancellor for rural, community and Native education at UAF in a phone interview Wednesday. 
Uher said the elimination of the grant funding for the University of Alaska Fairbanks affects programs at the Bristol Bay campus in Dillingham and in Fairbanks at the Community and Technical College focused on career training and workforce development, as well as student services. 
In total, for the five year grant programs, Uher said the cancellation is estimated at $8.8 million of $12.9 million in grant funding previously awarded.
“This award funding is unique in that it funds faculty for new program development, and then it also funds staff for student support — so advisors, outreach, individual wellness coordinators, admissions, graduation – student services, essentially,” he said. 
Uher said new programs in development that will be impacted — for students in person or through distance education — include American Sign Language, information technology technician training and private pilot ground school, helping students train for their pilot’s license.
Uher said those programs will continue through this academic year, and then the university will evaluate whether or how to continue them. University officials say they were given one year to close out grant-funded programs. 
UAF includes campuses in Fairbanks, Dillingham, Bethel, Nome and Kotzebue. Uher said while these programs must have at least 20% Native students to be eligible for the funding, they serve a wider student population, especially student services at rural campuses that serve wider regions of rural Alaska. 
“They provide follow ups, financial aid support like, how do you apply for financial aid? Are there scholarships out there?” Uher said. “They provide financial literacy to students. So it really is a comprehensive service that we provide to these students who are not living in or located in urban centers like Fairbanks or Anchorage.”
An estimated 17% of the University of Alaska student population identified as Alaska Native in 2024, or 3,254 students statewide, and roughly 1.3% or 266 students identified as Native Hawaiian. 
UAA and UAS expect less impact
University of Alaska Anchorage has grant-funded programs for Native students, but officials say they are not expecting them to be affected.
University of Alaska Southeast Chancellor Aparna Palmer said in a university-wide email Monday that a grant-funded program on its Sitka campus to support student services is already set to end this month, and the university is authorized to continue to spend remaining funds for another year. 
“I want to assure you that we will continue to support the many ways in which we are rooted in Alaska Native culture, history, language, and arts,” Palmer said, adding emphasis by underlining her statement.
Palmer said programs and courses in Indigenous studies, as well as support for Indigenous students, will continue. “Our programs and courses in Indigenous Studies at UAS are strong and will continue to thrive and grow. The UA President, Pat Pitney, and I are fully aligned on this,” she said. “Our Native and Rural Student Center will continue to be a space that provides support for Alaska Native students while welcoming all students.”
Faculty union president Jill Dumesnill, professor of mathematics at UAS, said by email on Monday that the announcement also disrupts future programs, faculty positions and student services.
“Writing these grant applications takes an enormous amount of faculty time and effort, and the Sitka proposal would have provided two additional faculty on the Sitka campus. That loss is significant because there are currently no Alaskan Native faculty members on the Sitka campus,” she said. “You don’t make campuses welcoming simply by calling them welcoming.”
Alaska’s U.S. Senators say they’re working to fund higher education
U.S. Sen Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said in a statement Wednesday that the funds are already legally authorized by Congress, and support students as well as address workforce shortages in the state.

“I am working with my colleagues to reinforce to the administration that these are statutory grant programs authorized and appropriated by Congress that align with the President’s goal of providing career technical education to the next generation for high-impact workforce needs such as fisheries, healthcare, skilled trades, and energy,” Murksowski said.
“As Alaska partners with this administration on several large-scale and exciting projects that can help transform our state, we need a local workforce trained to meet this moment,” she said. “Cancelling these funds takes us further away from that objective.” 
A spokesperson for U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, also repeated the impact on career training and workforce development education.
“Senator Sullivan and his team are in touch with the Department of Education regarding these grants. The University of Alaska serves thousands of students across the state, including Alaska Natives, and provides critical programs, such as job training and technical education, that build up Alaska’s trained workforce. President Trump’s Day 1 executive order to ‘Unleash Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential’ makes it clear we must be training the next generation to power projects like the Alaska LNG pipeline and keep these good-paying jobs in Alaska,” said spokesperson Amanda Coyne by email on Tuesday. 
“Senator Sullivan will continue to work with the administration to fund secondary education and job training to continue building up Alaska’s economy and workforce,” she said. 
Alaska’s U.S. House Representative Nick Begich did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. 
The announcement follows the Trump administration’s move to cancel $350 million in congressionally approved grant funding for minority-serving institutions last week, saying the funds will be allocated elsewhere. 
There are an estimated 5 million students enrolled in 800 minority-serving institutions nationwide. The grant funding is aimed at supporting students of color and from low-income backgrounds to pursue and complete higher education.

Mike Dunleavy’s decision to name a former attorney to a public seat on Alaska’s judge-picking board, saying the choice was within the governor’s powers under the Alaska Constitution.
The governor’s choice of John W. Wood has been challenged by lawsuits filed by Juneau resident James Forrer and Alaskans for Fair Courts, a group devoted to the defense of the court system as an independent, apolitical branch of government.
They argue that if Wood’s appointment stands, it would give attorneys four of the six seats on the Alaska Judicial Council, the state board that accepts applications for judicial vacancies, selects nominees and forwards them to the governor for final selection.
Under the Alaska Constitution, the council consists of three attorneys picked by the Alaska Bar Association and three non-lawyer members of the public appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature. In ties, the chief justice of the Alaska Supreme Court may cast a seventh vote.
The state contends that Wood is no longer an attorney and that he was a valid pick for an open seat. Both sides have asked for summary judgment, allowing Judge Yvonne Lamoureux to decide the case short of trial.
Wood’s appointment has been challenged on three main points. First, was the governor’s choice a valid recess appointment? Second, is Wood an attorney? Third, was he employed by the state at the time of the appointment?
Dunleavy appointed Wood in a letter dated May 29, filling a position that had been vacant since March, when a prior appointment expired. That was after the Legislature had adjourned for the year.
Under the Alaska Constitution and state law, a governor may fill vacant positions on boards and commissions when the Legislature is out of session, but the appointee will be subject to confirmation during the next regular legislative session.
Attorney James Reeves, arguing on behalf of Alaskans for Fair Courts, said his group contends that because a position on the Judicial Council became vacant during the legislative session, Wood may not begin serving until a confirmation vote takes place.
That contradicts existing practice, and Alaska Department of Law attorney Claire C. Keneally said in court on Wednesday that “it’s also not supported by the history of the (Alaska) Constitution” or the clause of the constitution that deals with appointments that take place when the Legislature is out of session.
“This is not a new or novel practice,” Keneally said of Dunleavy’s decision to not fill a March vacancy until May.
In 2015, then-Gov. Bill Walker filled a public seat on the Alaska Judicial Council in October; that seat had also been vacant since March, when the Legislature was in session.
Because of that timing issue, Keneally argued both in court and in writing, the case should be dismissed. Other arguments would be ripe for discussion only if the Legislature approves Wood’s appointment.
Wood was granted a law license in 1972, but it was suspended in 2000 because of a failure to pay dues to the Alaska Bar Association. Under a sworn affidavit, Wood said he has not practiced law since 2000 and has no intention of practicing law.
But in court on Wednesday, Reeves with Alaskans for Fair Courts said, “the Constitutional Convention history, which both sides have cited, indicates that the framers who discussed this understood the word non-attorney to mean layman or lay member. Is a lawyer who chooses not to practice law a layman?”
Reeves and attorney Joseph Geldhof, who was representing James Forrer in a separate but combined lawsuit also challenging Wood’s appointment, argued that because Wood held a state consulting contract at the time of his appointment, he was ineligible to serve on the Judicial Council.
The contract calls for Wood to advise the Alaska Department of Law on labor relations matters and to provide advice to the governor’s office when needed.
The Alaska Constitution states that no member of the Judicial Council may hold “any other office or position of profit under the United States or the state.”
But Keneally noted that the Alaska Supreme Court has previously interpreted that phrase to mean “salaried, non-temporary employment” with the state, and that other members of the Alaska Judicial Council, including some current members, have also held state contracts while serving on the council. 
Lamoureux, who heard Wednesday’s arguments, said she intends to issue a written order within 30 days, the timeline requested by both sides of the case in order to allow a speedy appeal.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/220728-Alaska-Beacon-1024x735.jpg,,,2025-09-17 22:57:05.141376

It's time to acknowledge that the way Massachusetts and other states have largely been teaching science isn't getting the job done and look for better options and bright spots.
The post Declines in science scores should prompt big change in schools appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","ON VISITS TO Chelsea Public Schools, I’ve observed 6-year-olds enthusiastically discussing what materials to use to design a scoop that removes trash from water. They draw on observations from testing paper, foam, and plastic screens. Each group selects the material that worked best. Then, with their teacher, they examine the class data, lining the materials up in rows to make a physical bar graph. 
It’s a lesson in math, science, and engineering all at once, and the engagement and learning are off the charts.
New science scores released last week from the Nation’s Report Card, also known as the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, indicate we need more of these kinds of innovative approaches to science instruction in K-12 schools across Massachusetts and the country.
Scores in science show that eighth graders nationwide experienced a four-point score drop since 2019, the last time the test was administered. Only about a third of students are working at the NAEP proficient level, which is the goal and means they can do challenging work. Nearly 40 percent aren’t even reaching the basic level, indicating they likely can’t identify characteristics of mammals or the function of a human organ system like the circulatory system.
At the state level, Massachusetts’s MCAS scores also highlight a need for concern—in 2024 only 39 percent of students in grade 8 and 45 percent in grade 5 scored “meeting expectations” or higher on the science, technology, and engineering test.
The slide in science comes on the heels of reading and math declines. Because there’s been such an emphasis on improving achievement in those core subjects, which are at the center of federal school accountability policies, science instruction has been increasingly deemphasized, particularly at the elementary level.
But the Chelsea example shows things don’t have to be this way. By integrating subjects, we can add more science and engineering into the curriculum and help students improve academically across a range of critical subjects.
The scores aren’t the only signs of trouble in the latest results from the Nation’s Report Card. Accompanying survey data show student enjoyment in science class is down, as are opportunities for hands-on, inquiry-based learning. Students report spending less time in school, for example, designing experiments to answer research questions or using evidence from experiments to explain a scientific phenomenon.
In other words, textbooks, worksheets, and lectures are probably how most kids are learning science. While there’s a place for these, they shouldn’t dominate science instruction because the approach is too passive and fails to foster student engagement or build skills like critical thinking and collaboration.
Schools sometimes have trouble finding research-based, high-quality, hands-on science lessons and instructional materials. For help, they can look to STEM organizations. The Museum of Science, where I lead STEM learning, offers free pK-8 STEM curricula. Other organizations that create science-based instructional materials include OpenSciEd, the Smithsonian Science Education Center, and the Lawrence Hall of Science. 
The decline in NAEP science scores, like in other areas, was steepest for low-performing or academically struggling students, who can especially benefit from hands-on approaches that allow them to demonstrate their learning in multiple ways. In Chelsea, we’ve tried to improve access to STEM lessons in the school day as well as through afterschool, summer school, and family programs. 
Students also thrive when they connect their coursework to the world around them. Science and engineering are ideal for this kind of interdisciplinary, real-world learning. For example, as second graders learn about plants, they can nurture them in a classroom container or school garden and explore their favorite fruits and vegetables with friends and family. 
Such a unit weaves together science topics like life cycles of plants and pollinators, math themes like measurement, and engineering practices like designing hand pollinators. Importantly, students enjoy learning this way—when Chelsea piloted this approach, students, parents, and educators all wanted more of it.
Isn’t that what we want for all our kids?
STEM fields are a vital and growing part of the economy. But whatever path students choose in life, they’ll need a solid K-12 foundation in science.
It’s time to acknowledge that the way Massachusetts and other states have largely been teaching science isn’t getting the job done and look for better options and bright spots. Let’s get creative, give kids the chance to learn STEM and other subjects on a deeper level, and maybe even let them have some fun along the way.
Christine Cunningham is senior vice president of STEM learning at Boston’s Museum of Science and a member of the National Assessment Governing Board, which sets policy for the Nation’s Report Card.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)The elected vice chairperson for the Montana Democratic Party resigned his post just days after taking office following remarks critical of former U.S. Sen. Jon Tester.
This weekend at their state convention, Montana Democrats elected new executive leadership, including Shannon O’Brien as chairperson and Max Johansen as vice chairperson.
O’Brien pledged a fresh start for Democrats, according to media outlets at the convention including the Montana State News Bureau. Democrats have lost elections handily in Montana in recent years.
O’Brien is a former state senator from Missoula, previous head of Missoula College and education policy advisor to former Gov. Steve Bullock. She ran an unsuccessful bid for Superintendent of the Office of Public Instruction in 2024.
Just days after the Sunday convention, the Montana Democratic Party released a statement from O’Brien on the resignation of Johansen as vice chairperson on the executive board. O’Brien did not respond to voicemails requesting comment this week.
Johansen is chairperson of the Park County Democrats.
“This morning, I accepted the resignation of Max Johansen, creating a vacancy on the Montana Democratic Party Executive Board,” O’Brien said in the statement Wednesday. “Mr. Johansen resigned after acknowledging that certain comments he made following the convention were disruptive and inconsistent with the direction of the executive board.”
The Montana Free Press reported that Johansen criticized Tester, a Democrat who lost his bid for a fourth term in the U.S. Senate in November 2024, after the election at the convention in a conversation with reporters.
Johansen said “a lot of people” are upset with Tester for not being as aggressive as he could be in opposing Republican U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy, who ousted him, according to the Free Press. He also said Democrats need to “stop running” from the word “socialist” in reference to “direct aid” to vulnerable groups.
In a “Grounded” podcast episode following the convention, Tester responded. “Grounded” is a conversation between Tester and journalist Maritsa Georgiou, and Georgiou raised Johansen’s claims in the episode.
Tester, who could not be reached for comment Wednesday, said on the show Johansen “doesn’t know Jacks–t,” he doesn’t know Montana, and he’s dangerous to Democrats.
“The Democrats have a fox in the henhouse, and if they don’t clean it up, there won’t be any eggs to pick,” Tester said.
The Daily Montanan could not reach Johansen for comment late Wednesday.
At their convention, the Montana Democrats said they also selected the following leaders, in addition to other district members:
Treasurer: Lance Fourstar
Secretary: Melody Cunningham
Eastern District Chairperson (Female): Hannah Nash
Eastern District Chairperson (Male): Jakob Miles
Western District Chairperson (Female): Linda Schmitt

WASHINGTON — Ramona Klein admits she was “an instigator” at Fort Totten Indian Boarding School in North Dakota.
“We didn’t have toys. We didn’t have anything to play with. And we went to bed at 6:30 as little girls,” she told a crowd Tuesday, Sept. 16, at a National Day of Remembrance recognizing boarding school survivors and descendants.

Klein, who attended the school from 1954 to 1958, would wake up in the middle of the night and wake the other girls. They’d whip the scratchy, rough, Army-issued blankets on the floor while two girls sat on it and “we’d get sparks.”
“It’s like [the] Fourth of July. So we would laugh. That was fun,” she said. Then they’d get bored and slide down the stairs on the mattress.
The beatings that inevitably followed didn’t break her.
“I would not cry,” she told the crowd. “I distinctly remember saying, ‘You’re not going to get the best of me.’”
More than two dozen people gathered Tuesday on a rainy day in the nation’s capital for the event hosted by the National Native American Boarding School Coalition at the Indian Gaming Association. The organization, known as NABS, advocates for Native peoples affected by U.S. federal Indian boarding school policies.
The remembrance included a candlelight vigil, songs, and talks by survivors and their families.

Since 2021, the organization has informally observed Sept. 30 as the National Day of Remembrance for those who attended U.S. federal Indian boarding schools, survivors, their communities, and their families. This year the organization recognized it a bit early to coincide with the National Congress of American Indians’ Tribal Unity Impact Days in Washington, D.C.
‘A little bit more joy’
Klein, the first vice president on the organization’s board of directors, uses her experience and voice to encourage other survivors to speak up.
The organization has been traveling around the country to permanently document the experience of boarding school survivors, the Oral History Project, as part of the U.S. Department of Interior’s Federal Indian Boarding School Initiative that was started by former Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland, Laguna Pueblo.
Klein, Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, recently traveled to the northwest for the project and witnessed five generations in one family speaking up, including the 90-something-year-old great-great-grandma.
“I think it’s the first time some of them really spoke with feeling, of their feelings with each other and helped understand some of what some people might call dysfunction,” she said. “But I think we’re used to functioning that way. … You know, it’s not necessarily dysfunction.”
It’s because of the U.S. federal Indian boarding school experiences and trauma that they are the way they are, she said. And to release that now, after so many years, is cathartic for many.
“To see people after they share their story, especially people who share their story maybe for the first time, they seem lighter,” she said. “There’s a little bit more joy.”
Ponka-We Victors-Cozad, NABS director of policy and advocacy, said the organization is still advocating for legislation in the U.S Congress to establish the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policies Act. A bill proposing the commission was introduced in July 2025 by Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, and Oklahoma Republican U.S. Rep. Tom Cole, Chickasaw, will be introducing one in the House soon. Victors-Cozad is Tohono O’odham and Ponca.
The Senate bill outlines that it will establish the Truth and Healing Commission and that the commission must investigate the impacts and ongoing effects of the Indian boarding school policies, under which American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian children were forcibly removed from their family homes and placed in boarding schools.

The bill calls for the commission to develop recommendations on ways to protect unmarked graves and accompanying land protections; support repatriation and identify the tribal nations from which children were taken; and discontinue the removal of Indigenous children from their families and tribal communities by state social service departments, foster care agencies, and adoption agencies.
The Office of Army Cemeteries has begun the disinterment process at the former site of the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, with 19 graves this fall – the highest in a year. One of the children disinterred is a Seminole Nation of Oklahoma student, Wallace Perryman, who was one of the last to be buried at the school at age 20. His remains are set to go home to the Seminole. The Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes will repatriate the remains of 18 other children.  Both tribes declined to comment about the repatriations.
 Paving the way for others

Klein and Deb Parker, the organization’s outgoing chief executive officer, reminded everyone that the Day of Remembrance is a time of celebration “because we’re survivors.”

(Photo by Charles Fox for ICT)

Parker, who is Tulalip, Yaqui and Apache, said as tribal nations are growing, it is important to remember those who paved the way to get there — those who survived and those who didn’t.
“That’s including those who were beaten if they spoke their language,” Parker said. “And yet, so many of those children wouldn’t give up their language. They kept speaking in corners. They kept speaking behind buildings, so that they would never forget who they are. And so it’s because of those children we carry on with our culture, with our language, with our identity.”
She continued, “And so where it’s a time of reverence, a time of introspection, it’s also a time of celebrating those who made it home and honoring those who carried those teachings forward, so that we can be here today.”
Other events are set for Sept. 30, which is a national holiday in Canada now known as the National Day for Truth and Reconciliation. Canada’s remembrance started as Orange Shirt Day, named on behalf of a First Nations woman whose orange shirt, a gift from her grandmother, was taken from her when she arrived at residential school in Canada.
The use of orange shirts as a symbol of support for the boarding school students and their families has now spread broadly, and officials are encouraging people in the U.S. to wear an orange shirt to honor the survivors and support community healing.
Among the celebrations scheduled this year are a National Day of Remembrance on Sept. 30 at the Heard Museum in Phoenix, Arizona, and a film screening and gathering on Sept. 29 at the University of Nevada Las Vegas Student Union Theater.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Law enforcement investigators have confirmed an accidental display of the 1985 Jackie Chan movie “The Protector” was the source of nude images seen on state Superintendent Ryan Walters’ office TV.
Oklahoma County Sheriff Tommie Johnson III discussed the investigation with reporters Wednesday afternoon after county District Attorney Vicki Behenna announced her office would not pursue criminal charges against Walters over the incident.
“It is truly, purely an accident,” Johnson said.
He said his investigators showed clips from “The Protector” to the two Oklahoma State Board of Education members who reported seeing naked women on the TV in Walters’ office during the board’s July 24 meeting. The board was in the middle of a private portion of its meeting, called executive session, at the Oklahoma State Department of Education building.
The board members, Becky Carson and Ryan Deatherage, confirmed to the Sheriff’s Office that the movie was consistent with what they saw on the TV, Johnson said. “The Protector” includes multiple scenes involving nude women.

Carson said criminal charges didn’t cross her mind when she first filed a complaint about the explicit images, but “silence was never an option for me.”
“The DAs decision today doesn’t change anything,” Carson wrote in a message to Oklahoma Voice. “It doesn’t change the facts of what happened. It doesn’t change the fact that Oklahoma is still 50th in Education. It doesn’t change the fact that there isn’t a plan to move us from that position. It doesn’t change the fact that we as a board have a job to do.”
Deatherage did not return a request for comment Wednesday.
The District Attorney’s Office determined the evidence in the case is insufficient for criminal charges, Behenna announced Wednesday morning, more than a month after the Sheriff’s Office turned over the investigative findings for prosecutors to review.
Although investigators confirmed Carson and Deatherage’s report of seeing naked women on Walters’ TV, the state superintendent on Wednesday again accused the board members of falsehood.
“This concludes the biggest witch hunt in Oklahoma history,” Walters said in a statement. “Lies were spread about me and my character. Not only did the liberal lying media and my accusers sacrifice the truth, they worked to create a narrative to tear my agenda down and mission to reform Oklahoma schools and put parents back in charge. Liberal lies lost again.”

During a visit to Walters’ office on July 28, the sheriff’s investigators turned on the TV and found it was already set to Samsung’s Movie Hub Action channel. 
Samsung later shared the channel’s broadcast schedule with the Sheriff’s Office, and investigators confirmed “The Protector” would have been showing on Movie Hub Action at the time of the state Board of Education meeting, Johnson said.
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, was the first to reveal an accidental showing of “The Protector” as the likely source of the controversy. Hilbert also obtained the channel’s broadcast information from Samsung, and he shared his findings in a public report on Aug. 5 while law enforcement was still investigating.
Johnson said Hilbert’s report “came out prematurely.”
“He just wanted to bring it to a close, as well,” Johnson said. “Not the appropriate way to go, but his heart was in the right place.
“You saw a guy just trying to solve a problem. We’ve talked through it.”
Walters also came out too soon with public statements about the investigation, Johnson said. A day after Walters interviewed with investigators, he held a press conference and claimed he had been fully cleared of wrongdoing.
“To suggest we would run a 24-hour investigation, that is not the case,” Johnson said.

Josh Shapiro said at a press conference. “We need to do better as a society.""","Governor Josh Shapiro and the Pennsylvania State Police commissioner offer details on a shooting in York County that left three police officers dead. (Photo courtesy of Commonwealth Media Services)*This is a breaking news story. We’ll move quickly to provide the best information we have at the time.*
Three law enforcement officers were shot and killed in North Codorus Township, York County, on Wednesday during an investigation into a “domestic-related” incident that happened at a home there the previous day, state police said. 
Two others were wounded and were in critical, but stable, condition Wednesday night. The suspect was killed by police, according to State Police Commissioner Col. Christopher Paris.
As of 6:15 p.m. Wednesday evening, there was no active threat to the public, Paris said at a press conference.
“Our hearts and prayers go out to them, to the families of the deceased and the families of those officers who were wounded,” Paris said. “There are simply no words that I can offer to assuage the grief that this community has experienced, and unfortunately will continue to experience.”
The injured officers are being treated at WellSpan York Hospital. Paris did not share which law enforcement agencies the officers who were shot worked for, and noted that many details would not be made public until the investigation progresses.
It’s the second time a York County officer has been killed in the line of duty this year. In February, West York Patrolman Andrew Duarte was killed during a hostage situation at UPMC Memorial Hospital in York.
Gov. Josh Shapiro, who made a speech against political violence last night in Pittsburgh at the Eradicate Hate Global Summit, travelled to York County Wednesday.
“This kind of violence isn’t ok,” he said at a press conference. “We need to do better as a society. We need to help the people who think that picking up a gun, picking up a weapon, is the answer to resolving disputes. We need to do better when it comes to mental health.”
It was the deadliest single day for law enforcement in the commonwealth since the Pennsylvania Fraternal Order of Police began keeping track on their fallen heroes page, which dates back to 2012. On April 4 2009, three officers were killed in a shooting in the Stanton Hill neighborhood in Pittsburgh after responding to a domestic call. Two others were wounded.

The name of the suspect in Wednesday’s shooting was not released, but the incident took place near a home on Haar Road.
Phoebe Luckenbaugh, who lives several houses away from where the shooting happened, said the property with a farmhouse and a red barn close to the road was home to a young family.
Craig Zumbrum, who is listed in property records as the owner with his wife, Elizabeth, died in 2023. His widow and four children, including two teenagers, still live in the home and were often seen in the yard, Luckenbaugh said.
“They’re a nice normal country family,” she said, adding that she has no first-hand knowledge of what happened at the farm Wednesday. Since Craig Zumbrum’s death, a relative has raised crops on the farm for the family, Luckenbaugh said.
State Police are asking the public to avoid the scene.
Paris said that state police will lead the investigation, in collaboration with York County District Attorney Tim Barker. He added that state police have been in touch with the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s office in Philadelphia.
“I can assure you that all of the resources of the Pennsylvania state police are being brought to bear,” Paris said. He added that, for the time, state police will be taking over calls for service for the Northern York County Regional Police Department.
Shapiro said he was contacted by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who he said “shared with me we have the full support of the federal government.”
“We so appreciate law enforcement at every level, and we of course appreciate our federal partners,” Shapiro added.
Bondi said in a post on the social media platform X that the FBI and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms were on the scene.
“Violence against law enforcement is a scourge on our society and never acceptable,” she wrote. “Pray for the officers involved.”
Attorney General Dave Sunday, who previously served as the York County District Attorney, said on social media that he was travelling to the county after hearing about the incident.
“Learning that three officers were killed in York County where I worked for many years as a prosecutor, and where I still call home, is unfathomable,” he said in a statement. “Having served alongside these officers, I know of their caliber, their professionalism and the lasting impact they had on our community. This loss is a heart-wrenching reminder of the sacrifices police officers and other first responders make every single day.”
Shapiro has ordered flags in the commonwealth to be flown at half-staff until the officers are interred. No date has been set yet.

Ibarra and Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/09/covid-vaccine-western-alliance/,"Leading medical organizations informed the state's new guidelines, announced as part of a western states alliance. A new law requires insurers to cover vaccines for most Californians.","In summary
Leading medical organizations informed the state’s new guidelines, announced as part of a western states alliance. A new law requires insurers to cover vaccines for most Californians.


In anticipation of restrictive federal immunization rules, state health officials issued their own vaccination guidelines on Wednesday, recommending that all Californians 6 months and older who want protection from the COVID-19 virus get this season’s updated vaccine.
Gov. Gavin Newsom and state health officials released the recommendations as part of the state’s newly formed health alliance with Oregon, Washington and Hawaii. Leading medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, informed the recommendations, according to the state’s announcement. Simultaneously, Newsom signed Assembly Bill 144, which among several things, requires insurance plans to cover the vaccines the state endorses.
“We are here to protect our communities,” Dr. Erica Pan, director of the California Department of Public Health, told CalMatters. “Many of us have dedicated our lives to doing that. We feel really strongly and want to show our unity” as medical, scientific and public health experts.
Pharmacies across the country started dispensing the vaccine in recent weeks, but anecdotes and news reports reveal a patchwork of access, with some people having no difficulty getting the shot, while others still unable to get it. 
Last month, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of an updated COVID-19 vaccine but only for seniors and for people ages 5 to 64 who have an underlying condition that puts them at high risk for complications from a COVID-19 infection. This is more restrictive than in previous years, when the federal drug agency approved the vaccine for nearly everyone. Leading medical groups and some states immediately pushed back on the agency’s decision. 
California’s guidance comes just two days ahead of a key meeting where a federal vaccine panel will review the updated COVID-19 vaccine. Public health experts anticipate this panel will restrict access to the vaccine. 
That’s because U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. who is, known for anti-vaccine activism, in June dismissed all 17 members of this panel known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. He replaced them with 12 new members, some of whom are documented vaccine skeptics. 
Typically, after the FDA approves a vaccine for use, this federal committee makes recommendations on who should be immunized. In the past, insurers have based their vaccine coverage on the guidelines issued by this group. 
Pan said California’s actions are necessary because the committee’s credibility has been “compromised”. Now with the state’s separate guidance, the CDC group’s recommendations will carry no weight for Californians.
“Whatever comes out of [this committee], our new law is independent of that,” Pan said. 
Easier access under state rules 
The new law accompanying the state’s independent guidance ensures that most Californians will be able to get a COVID-19 vaccine, including young children, pregnant people and those without underlying medical conditions, said Dorit Reiss, a professor at UC Law San Francisco and an expert on vaccine law. That’s in part because it allows pharmacists to independently prescribe and administer the shot so long as the state health department recommends it. 
Many people rely on pharmacies for seasonal vaccines like the flu shot and COVID-19 booster, Reiss said. Now if somebody who does not meet the more narrow federal guidelines goes to a CVS or Walgreens they won’t need a separate doctor’s prescription.
The law also grants the state health department broad authority over other vaccine policies. Many of the state’s immunization laws, including school vaccine schedules, insurance requirements and prescriber authorization, had also been tied to recommendations made by the CDC advisory committee. The state health department’s recommendations now take precedence.
Under these new policies, the department will be able to respond to future threats to vaccine availability and access, Pan said.
“We do anticipate there may be other issues that we would like to be unified on again,” she added.
It also comes amid reports that Kennedy intends to change the childhood vaccine schedule.
Pan said California and the other states in the alliance will base immunization recommendations on the work done by “trusted medical groups” that have independently assessed vaccine safety for years. 
Insurers to cover state-endorsed vaccines
Most Californians have insurance through state-regulated health plans, which now must cover the updated COVID-19 shot without copays. The new law also requires Medi-Cal, the state run insurance program for low-income residents and people with disabilities, to cover the COVID-19 shot and other vaccines recommended by the state health department.
Mary Ellen Grant, a spokesperson for the California Association of Health Plans, said the state’s policy changes “will greatly reduce the amount of confusion” among patients and ensure they have access to vaccinations. 
About 5.4 million Californians have insurance that is subject to federal regulations rather than state ones. Generally, these are people who work for large, multi-state or multinational companies. Nationally, insurers have been hesitant to make statements about vaccine coverage ahead of the CDC’s vaccine advisory committee, leaving coverage for people with federally regulated plans uncertain.
Still, Reiss said, she expects insurers to continue covering vaccines regardless of future changes made by the CDC’s advisory committee. It’s much cheaper for insurers to pay for vaccines than it is for them to pay for treatment of the diseases they prevent. 
The state’s partnership with Hawaii, Oregon and Washington also creates market pressure on insurers to continue vaccine coverage, Reiss said. 
“They might just say, ‘This is a big chunk of the population. We might as well have the same policy for all the country,’” she added.
Vaccines continue to be key protection
The rollout of this year’s vaccine is coinciding with a moderate surge in COVID-19 infections. Data from the California Department of Public Health show that cases have been ticking up since July. As of Sept. 6, 11.72% of samples sent in for testing were positive, slightly higher than this time last year.
Public health officials say the best way to stay healthy this fall and winter is to get vaccinated.
In addition to the COVID-19 vaccine, California’s immunization guidance also recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot. The vaccine to protect against Respiratory Syncytial Virus, or RSV, is recommended for all babies younger than 8 months and for babies between 8 months and 19 months if they carry risk factors. The RSV vaccine is also recommended for pregnant women at 32 weeks to 36 weeks of gestation and for all seniors 75 and older, as well as for those ages 50 to 74 with comorbidities. 
“If we want to make America healthy, rather than treating disease, we want to prevent disease, and well, vaccination is one of the best creations to prevent disease,” said. Dr. Jeffrey Silvers, an infectious disease specialist at Sutter Health. “It’s right up there with clean water in terms of preventing disease.”

(Photo by Jacob Orledge/North Dakota Monitor)WATFORD CITY, N.D. – North Dakota oil and gas companies have new economic allies in the form of a tech industry “desperate” to find energy sources to fuel the growth of artificial intelligence, Gov. Kelly Armstrong said Wednesday.
The governor, asked during the North Dakota Petroleum Council’s annual meeting about the value of artificial intelligence to the state, said “it is changing the dynamic” in a way that isn’t often discussed. 
The demand for artificial intelligence, generated in energy-intensive data centers, is surging from technology giants and countries around the globe. That is turning employees of tech companies, whom Armstrong called the “traditional adversaries” of places like North Dakota, into customers for natural gas.

“People who hated natural gas not that long ago, like 36 months ago, have all of a sudden recognized that natural gas is the key to the survival of their company,” Armstrong said.
That demand for power generation aligns with North Dakota’s need to find markets for its natural gas, a byproduct of crude oil production. 
“We’re going to see new synergies,” Armstrong said, “between Silicon Valley tech companies and western North Dakota oil companies.”
WBI to receive $500M state financial guarantee to build natural gas pipeline in North Dakota

Artificial intelligence companies may be the exact consumers North Dakota has been looking for to take care of the state’s excess supply of natural gas. WBI Energy is developing a natural gas pipeline from northwest North Dakota to the eastern part of the state with the help of an up to $500 million financial backstop awarded by the state. WBI said in application materials for the funding that some potential customers for the natural gas are developing power generation to support data centers.
North Dakota is an attractive place for data centers because the climate allows companies to lower their cooling costs.
“Being cold and windy is not usually a selling point,” Armstrong said. 
Enhanced oil recovery
North Dakota’s oil production, meanwhile, is expected to decline in the upcoming decades. But that’s not because the oil is running out. Oil companies can only extract a fraction of the crude oil underground before the reservoir, the pool of oil, loses pressure and wells become unproductive. 
The industry has been testing enhanced oil recovery methods to repressurize the underground reservoirs and continue pumping oil. The next few years will be crucial to advancing the technology, said John Harju of the Energy and Environmental Research Center at the University of North Dakota.
One enhanced oil recovery method involves injecting carbon dioxide underground. But North Dakota doesn’t produce enough carbon dioxide to fill the needs of the oil field. The proposed Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline to bring CO2 from surrounding states has met significant opposition, raising concerns about the industry’s ability to obtain and transport enough CO2 for the Bakken. 
Natural gas could serve as a replacement, Harju said. 
“We feel very confident that performance with rich gas is going to be an outstanding proxy for CO2,” he said.

North Dakota has seen some opposition to energy-related projects in recent years. Rep. Craig Headland, R-Montpelier, said it is increasingly difficult to obtain easements for pipelines and other infrastructure necessary to continue energy development. 
“The public good doesn’t seem to matter like it used to,” Headland said during a lawmaker panel.
Sen. Mark Enget, R-Powers Lake, said he’s had many discussions with North Dakotans concerned about their property rights. Some of the problem, he said, is how companies approach landowners during a project’s development. 
“The people I’ve talked to all understand that progress is necessary. They’re not against it,” Enget said. “North Dakota people are very reasonable. If you talk to them respectfully and you work towards a solution and discuss it in a way that resonates and makes sense to them, there’s a way through it.”
Burke County, where Enget is from, has welcomed a recent growth in oil and gas activity, but it has come with challenges, he said. School overcrowding is an issue. Roads and other infrastructure are experiencing wear and tear. And, more recently, he’s grown concerned about the use of water resources for hydraulic fracturing.
“It creates a problem where many of our water resources in the county are really being drawn down,” Enget said. “So I worry about the longer term and if we see more and more activity, where all of that water is going to come from.”
Infrastructure projects, property rights and a way to reconcile the conflicts between them will continue to be an issue in the state, said Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston. 
“I think it’s going to loom large in the next session,” Bekkedahl said.

(Photo by Micah Drew)MISSOULA — “What do you want me to do?” U.S. District Court Judge Dana Christensen asked the legal team behind 22 youth suing the Trump administration over a series of actions aimed at “unleashing” the fossil fuel industry. 
The lawsuit, Lighthiser v. Trump, was filed in Montana’s federal district court in May and seeks to overturn a series of executive orders the youth argue will make climate change — and related crises such as extreme wildfires — worse.
The federal government, joined by a coalition of 19 states and territories led by Montana, seek the case’s dismissal. 
But Christensen, during a hearing Wednesday in Missoula’s federal courthouse, seemed skeptical of the remedy as he quizzed a lawyer for the youth about rolling back the three executive orders. 
The lawsuit seeks to overturn Trump Executive Orders 14154, “Unleashing American Energy,” 14156, “Declaring a National Energy Emergency,” and 14261, “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry,” but the ask appears to be anything but simple. 
Over the last seven months, federal agencies have rescinded funding from climate science initiatives, pushed to open more land to oil and gas leasing, and halted renewable energy projects. Some of the actions have directly cited their compliance with the executive orders, while others align with the new administration’s policy agenda more broadly. 
“If I enjoin these orders, and these defendants enact policies favoring fossil fuels regardless of my enjoining the executive orders, what do I do then?” Christensen asked Julia Olsen, lead counsel for the plaintiffs on the second day of hearings. “Many things done by these agencies … appear to be derived from or based on these orders. … Do you want me to enjoin these agency actions as well?”
Olsen said the goal was to revert the country to a “status quo” that existed on January 19, the day before Trump signed the three orders. 
“The entire body of conduct should be enjoined,” she said. “Because it’s unconstitutional a … and is causing irreparable harm to these plaintiffs.”
Christensen appeared skeptical of that plan, which he said could amount to him having to review every energy-related policy and action taken by numerous government agencies “until the expiration of our collective lifetimes.” 
Attorneys for the federal and state governments agreed, saying the court was essentially being asked to set national energy policy — a clear overreach. 
“It’s unprecedented,” federal attorney Michael Sawyer said. “There is no basis in law for stepping in and going back to January 19th.”
In addition, he said an injunction would “irreparably harm” the United States and essentially force the district court into overseeing the actions of at least 13 federal agencies, with the plaintiffs’ lawyers returning to court every time they dispute an energy permit or federal rule. 
“They basically get to become the masters of the court’s injunction,” Sawyer said. 
Sawyer argued the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring the lawsuit, in part because there is no meaningful action the court can take to immediately offer relief to the alleged harms related to climate change, including wildfire smoke and extreme weather events like heat waves.
He also said challenging such a broad, sweeping policy order was the incorrect way to seek a change. Instead, he said the plaintiffs should challenge actual agency actions, such as a permitting decision over coal lease or a change to a specific rule. 
“This is thousands of lawsuits packed into one,” Sawyer said. “There’s been hundreds of different permitting decisions by the Department of the Interior — they want the court to jump in and issue one ruling to stop them all.”
Sawyer sought to tie the Lighthiser arguments to another youth-led climate lawsuit, Juliana v. United States. That case was ultimately dismissed by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals after years of litigation due to a lack of standing issue. 
But Olsen argued they were fundamentally different, because the current case is not asking the government to address decades of actions with a plan of action, but merely stop three executive orders. 
 ‘A constant reminder of the climate crisis’

Over the two-day hearing, the court heard from five youth plaintiffs and a series of expert witnesses who spoke about climate science, energy policy and the health effects of climate change. The government didn’t call any witnesses.
Isaiah Hudson, a high school senior from Missoula, was the only plaintiff to take the stand on Wednesday, where he shared his love of the outdoors and of running. 
As a varsity cross country runner for his high school, Hudson said summer months are a key time to build fitness for the fall season. 
But when wildfires burning across the west fill the Missoula valley with smoke, he’s had to miss days, and even weeks, of training. 
“I can’t exercise. I can’t go outside as often, and that impacts my mental health a lot,” Hudson said. “And it’s a constant reminder of the climate crisis we’re facing.”
Lori Byron, a retired pediatrician, testified about the increased harm children face from environmental factors exacerbated by climate change including from extreme heat and breathing particulate matter with still-developing lungs.
“Adding just one part per billion of pollution into the air mixture increases the risk of mortality,” she said. “…There are grave risks to these plaintiffs and other children by the concept of unleashing more fossil fuels.”
The court also heard from Nicole Hughes, the executive director of a renewable energy nonprofit who talked about the number of wind energy programs that had been halted after Trump took office, including the Lava Ridge Wind project in Idaho, stopped in one of the executive orders. 
The government lawyers pushed back against some of Hughes’ testimony by pointing out that wind — and solar — energy are not mentioned in any of the three challenged orders, and Trump had issued an entirely separate memorandum on wind energy, which the plaintiffs aren’t trying to overturn. 
That memo has been challenged in a Massachusetts court, and Sawyer said the Lighthiser plaintiffs “had every opportunity to go to that court and be part of that litigation.”
Instead, he said, they’re trying to assert their own policy preferences over every energy-related proposal by the administration. 
A last witness called by the plaintiffs laid the groundwork that Trump’s orders to bolster the fossil fuel industry had no economic justification, as renewable sources such as solar and wind are cheaper than fossil fuels such as coal. 
Geoffrey Heal, a professor emeritus at Columbia University in business and international and public affairs, said it was “baffling” to say the executive orders would strengthen trade and national security, as Trump and his lawyers argued, and that America was not in the midst of an energy emergency. 
He compared the current state of affairs, where the county is relatively energy sufficient, with the 1970s, when wars in the middle east led to an oil shortage. 
“There were gas stations with no gasoline, airports with no jet fuel, fights were breaking out,” Heal said. “That, unambiguously, amounted to an energy emergency.”

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Members of the Iowa Board of Regents on Wednesday recommended approval for the group that will advise the University of Iowa’s new center for intellectual freedom, despite concerns over the political and geographical spread of the proposed group.
At Wednesday’s board meeting, regent Christine Hensley, who will chair the advisory board, updated the board on the center’s progress. Legislation passed in the spring mandated the formation of the center, placing it under the purview of the Iowa Board of Regents.
Board President Sherry Bates said during discussion of the center that with advisory board members and an interim director identified, the center can begin its work.
“Civic education is a priority for this board,” Bates said. “We believe in civil and free inquiry, and are hopeful that with the establishment of this center at University of Iowa, as well as similar initiatives at ISU and UNII, the flow of individual ideas and opinions will continue to flourish.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While the law states the advisory council must include at least nine members, the list recommended for approval includes 26 names set to serve either two- or four-year terms. It is currently unknown whether all of the members will have voting abilities or not, but Hensley said during the meeting the “intent” is to have the entire board vote.
Regents Robert Cramer and Kurt Tjaden will join Hensley in serving four-year terms on the advisory council, according to board documents, and Jim Lindenmayer and Mike Richards, both former regents, will serve for two years. Peter Matthes, UI vice president for external relations and senior advisor to the president, will be the sole representation for the university on the advisory council and serve a four-year term.
Former Iowa state senator Liz Mathis would serve a four-year term on the advisory council, joined by University of Austin President Carlos Carvalho, Fareway CEO Reynolds Cramer, Iowans for Tax Relief Foundation Policy Director John Hendrickson and other economists and academics.
Ambassador and former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad and former U.S. House member Greg Ganske would serve two-year terms alongside faculty and corporate executives from across the U.S.
Hensley emphasized during the meeting that the proposed advisory council membership is politically balanced, with 12 members identifying as independent, 11 Republicans and three Democrats. Gov. Kim Reynolds and her office worked with Hensley to recruit people for the council, she said, and tapped Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to identify leaders in the development of similar centers in the state.
According to data compiled by the Independent Voter Project, Iowa’s voting base is split in near-thirds, with approximately 37% Republicans, 34% unaffiliated and 28% Democrats as of Aug. 27. On the advisory board, Democrats would make up just over 11% of the group, Republicans would make up around 42% and independents would fill the rest.
Regent Nancy Dunkel was the only board member to ask questions about those nominated to the advisory board and cast the sole “no” vote on the list of names recommended for board approval.
In addition to her issues with the minority of women on the council and the political breakdown of its potential members, one of Dunkel’s biggest concerns was that half of the individuals are not residents of Iowa. That will dilute Iowans’ votes and voice in the center, she said, adding that many of the individuals are unknown to the majority of the regents beyond their reputation.
“I can see that you want to go get advice from groups of people, but to actually name them to an advisory committee is baffling to me,” Dunkel said.
Olivia Jones, a University of Iowa graduate worker and member of the Campaign to Organize Graduate Students, also expressed her concern with the makeup of the advisory council members during public comment Wednesday.
Citing research she conducted and sent to the board, Jones said 22 of the 26 proposed advisory board members are either Republicans, donors to Republican campaigns or involved with conservative think tanks, agreeing with Dunkel’s comments about the group’s political balance.
The center’s interim director, UI professor Luciano de Castro, has stated that most UI instructors are left-leaning without providing any information to back the claim up, Jones said, and has an outsized amount of power in hiring and other planning efforts. Hensley said during the meeting a national search will take place to identify the official director.
While Regent David Barker pointed out that a Google search shows the candidates’ work and credentials that qualify them for the council, Dunkel said the group should slow down and think more about who they are and what they could bring to the center.
With the legislation mandating that only one member of the advisory board can come from the UI, Hensley said she and others involved in filling the board saw an opportunity to look outside Iowa’s borders to find the best people.
“I don’t think it’s important at this point that we have to know them personally, but their records speak volumes for them, and if we really want to make this an example of a center that’s going to be successful, we have to look at those individuals outside the area,” Hensley said.
Board of Regents Counsel Aimee Claeys said during the meeting “detailed conversations” about council policies and procedures have not been conducted yet, and Hensley said she was unsure of whether out-of-state members would be reimbursed or provided funds for travel and other expenses when coming to Iowa. Dunkel said board of regents members are not paid in any way for their travel or anything else, and her expectation is that the council will be treated the same.
Dunkel introduced a motion to table the decision until some of this information can be parsed out, but it failed to receive a second. Board President Sherry Bates said during the meeting that many of Dunkel’s questions “need to be answered,” which she expects will happen through the process of creating bylaws and other work.
Barker thanked Hensley for her efforts in preparing for the launch of the center — an idea he said he’s been “pushing for” since he was appointed to the board six years ago.
“I’m really excited to see it happen, and I think it’s going to be a center that will receive national recognition, a national reputation, and help boost the University of Iowa,” Barker said.

Elk Mountain Ranch owner’s petition for review of his failed trespassing suit is “procedurally deficient and doctrinally unfounded,” attorneys in public-access case contend.
The post Supreme Court shouldn’t take up Wyoming corner-crossing appeal, hunters say appeared first on WyoFile .","The U.S. Supreme Court should not review the Elk Mountain Ranch owner’s failed trespass lawsuit against four men who corner crossed to hunt on public land in Carbon County, the hunters’ lawyers say in a 39-page document filed Wednesday.
Ranch owner Fred Eshelman’s petition to the high court to take up the case is “procedurally deficient and doctrinally unfounded,” the new filing states. Eshelman’s claim that corner crossing is an unconstitutional taking of private property was not fully and fairly presented to lower courts and is therefore moot, the hunters contend.
Eshelman asserts, among other things, that corner crossing is an unconstitutional taking of private property without compensation. But he and his landowning company Iron Bar Holdings raised that argument late in the legal process, and almost in passing, the hunters say.
For the Supreme Court to consider Eshelman’s takings argument, the ranch owner had to first fully argue the issue in the lower courts, thereby exhausting all his other remedies, according to the hunters’ brief.
“This Court should not take this case to explore Iron Bar’s procedurally deficient and doctrinally unfounded takings theory,” attorneys Ryan Semerad and Lee Mickus wrote.
“Been here before”
Eshelman’s Elk Mountain Ranch covers some 20,000 acres of a wildlife-rich peak that soars to 11,156 feet. The North Carolina owner and pharmaceutical magnate is a hunter whose property surrounds 6,000 acres or more of public land owned by all Americans and controlled by the Bureau of Land Management.
Across southern Wyoming, property ownership is laid out in a checkerboard pattern of public and private square-mile sections, a vestige of the railroad building and land-grant era of the mid 1800s.
“Iron Bar complains that this narrow decision effectively legalized trespassing across the country, destroying billions of dollars in property value. The hyperbole is misplaced.” Ryan Semerad and Lee Mickus
“Many public-land squares on these checkerboards are accessible only by ‘corner crossing,’” the hunters’ attorneys explain. That is by “stepping from one public-land square to the next one across the public-private corner without touching the private-land squares.”
To corner cross, one must inevitably pass through the airspace above private property. Based on the common-law “ad coelum” dictum that presumes a landowner also owns the airspace above his or her property, Eshelman contends corner crossing is a trespass.
The onX digital mapping company estimated that 8.3 million acres of public land in the West would be inaccessible to the public if corner crossing is found to be an illegal trespass.
That’s what Missouri hunters Bradly Cape, John Slowensky and Phillip Yeomans did in 2020, and with Zachary Smith again in 2021. The Carbon County attorney cited them for trespass and a jury found them not guilty of the misdemeanor in 2022.
Eshelman sued the four in civil court that year, seeking to bar them and others from corner crossing to reach public land on Elk Mountain. A federal judge in Wyoming decided that Eshelman could not block the hunters from landlocked public land in the checkerboard part of Wyoming and the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed when Eshelman took his case to that venue.
The Wyoming chapter of Backcountry Hunters and Anglers has backed the hunters, saying they needed to have their case heard and required financial support to balance Eshelman’s wealth and resources.
Eshelman’s petition to the Supreme Court said the 10th Circuit decision against him “steamrolls state law, takes easements, and revolutionizes property law affecting up to 150 million acres of private land.”
Disarming Eshelman’s takings arguments was one of several points the hunters made in their response, including that “this [Supreme] court has been here before” and decided in favor of public access to public land. The 10th Circuit Court of Appeals correctly applied the text of the 1885 Unlawful Inclosures Act and the precedent set by other cases that revolved around that law, the hunters say.

Congress passed the 1885 act during checkerboard scuffles to prohibit blocking public access to public land, including by using fences, other physical barriers and even threats and intimidation.
The appeals court’s decision is narrow, doesn’t break new ground and is not in conflict with decisions in other appeals court circuits, the hunters’ response states. Those are all reasons to let the lower court ruling stand, they say.
Eshelman also failed to fully argue in lower courts that the 1885 Unlawful Inclosures Act does not automatically supersede Wyoming’s trespass laws. “Ordinarily, this [Supreme] Court does not decide questions not raised or resolved in the lower court,” the hunters state.
Bye bye Leo Sheep
Eshelman and his landowning company Iron Bar Holdings have argued that courts decided another Carbon County checkerboard case — known as Leo Sheep — in favor of blocking public access to public land across checkboard corners. In that instance, the BLM sought to build a road across a common corner to provide public access to a reservoir.

Fredric N. Eshelman is the owner of Iron Bar Holdings LLC, a New Hanover County, North Carolina, company, according to a 2005 filing with the Wyoming Secretary of State’s office. A web page for Eshelman Ventures displays the above photo of Eshelman and states that he served as CEO and executive chairman of Pharmaceutical Product Development before the company was sold to private equity interests.

Courts ruled against the BLM. Eshelman’s attorneys use that decision to argue that the federal government never reserved an easement allowing the public to corner cross.
The hunters disagree.
“As the Tenth Circuit explained, Leo Sheep doesn’t apply to Iron Bar’s claims,” the hunters say. The Supreme Court has already said that the 1885 act, on which the hunters hang their hats, “played no role” in Leo Sheep, Wednesday’s filing states.
“But Iron Bar raises a categorically different question,” the hunters continue, “whether checkerboard landowners can affirmatively extinguish all access to neighboring checkerboarded public land.” The Supreme Court rejected a petition to review a case that “invoked Leo Sheep in the same flawed way,” the hunters say.
The hunters’ response elaborates on a couple of other points, emphasizing the effects of finding that corner crossing is an illegal trespass.
“The UIA supplants conflicting state law since a different rule would place the public domain of the United States completely at the mercy of state legislation,” the filing states. In other words, by blocking the public from public property, Eshelman can enjoy that public land and its bounty for himself, the hunters say.
Semerad and Mickus note that the 1885 UIA was in effect ages before Eshelman ever laid eyes on Elk Mountain.
“Iron Bar bought checkerboarded property in 2005,” the attorneys wrote. “[Eshelman’s] rights have always been subject to the limits imposed by the UIA.”
Although the 10th Circuit decision is focused, the hunters say Eshelman exaggerates its effects.
“Iron Bar complains that this narrow decision effectively legalized trespassing across the country, destroying billions of dollars in property value,” the filing reads. “The hyperbole is misplaced.”
“The [appeals] court did not immunize a trespasser who marches straight down the middle of private property,” as Eshelman contends, the hunters say. “Rather, the court held only that if access to public lands is otherwise restricted, a checkerboard landowner cannot sue a corner crosser for trespassing so long as they did not physically touch [private] land.”

A lawsuit Disability Rights NC brought against the state Department of Health and Human Services carries her name. (Photo courtesy Disability Rights NC)The state Department of Health and Human Services has shown some progress in meeting court-ordered deadlines to make sure community services are available to people with intellectual or developmental disabilities, but an advocacy group questions what the state data can prove. 
The court order is the result of a lawsuit called Samantha R., brought by Disability Rights NC against DHHS on behalf of people who were institutionalized or faced institutionalization. The lawsuit claimed the state was not doing enough to support people with disabilities who want to live in their communities; it was named for Samantha Rhoney who spent seven years in a state facility because her parents no longer had the support to keep her at home. 
Disability Rights won in trial court, with the judge issuing an order that would have given the state 10 years to eliminate the waiting list of people seeking services under a Medicaid program called the Innovations Waiver.  
DHHS appealed but later dropped the appeal and the two sides agreed to a consent order that set out goals aimed at keeping people out of institutions and increasing use of community-support services.  The consent order dropped the required elimination of the waiting list. 
More than 16,000 people were on the waiting list in late 2022. It’s grown to 18,950 people as of March 31 of this year. 
“We’re all watching in horror as the numbers continue to go up,” said Lisa Grafstein, a lawyer with Disability Rights who is also a state senator from Raleigh. 
Disability Rights hosted an update on the Samantha R. case on Wednesday and will host another Thursday evening. 
According to the state’s latest report, DHHS has exceeded the first-year court-ordered goal of moving people out of institutions by increasing access to community services. Under the court order, at least 78 people should have moved from institutions by June 30 of this year. DHHS reported that 97 people had moved by March 31. 
Based on the knowledge that some people are approved for community services that they don’t receive, the court ordered that by June of this year 85% of authorized services should be used. DHHS reported that 85.2% were being used. 
“The data is not an end in itself,” Grafstein said. “It’s part of this longer term process of getting the state into compliance with rights of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities, and that means providing access to services in the community for those who want it, most prominently eliminating the waiting list.”
DHHS reported that more than 11,000 people with intellectual or developmental disabilities received services through a different Medicaid program. But that program has limited services and limited hours, said Emma Kinyanjui, Disability Rights’ legal director. It’s unclear what kinds of help people are receiving and how far it’s going to meet their needs, she said. 
There aren’t enough people who do the low-paid, community-based work, which is one of the reasons people wait for services. 
As a form of professional development, the state established an advanced training certificate program for the workers, called direct support professionals, that’s offered at three community colleges. Additionally, DHHS offered $3 million to provider agencies to pay hiring and retention bonuses. 
Next summer, DHHS and Disability Rights are going to review the data the state has collected and talk about next steps, said Corye Dunn, Disability Rights’ public policy director. The two sides may agree on what to do next, she said. But if the state moves to dismiss the case, Disability Rights would oppose it, she said. 
“Our hope is that we can all agree that more needs to be done, especially around the waiting lists and DPS (Direct Support Professionals) pay,” Dunn said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Samantha-on-sofa-in-her-home-scaled-1.webp,,,2025-09-17 19:57:22.783885

Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in the state Capitol. Raffensperger announced Wednesday that he will run for Georgia governor in 2026. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger officially launched his long-expected campaign for governor Wednesday with a video announcement touting his conservative bona fides.
“I’m a conservative Republican, and I’m prepared to make the tough decisions,” he said. “I follow the law and the Constitution, and I’ll always do the right thing for Georgia, no matter what.”
Raffensperger became a household name after the 2020 election when President Donald Trump called on him to “find 11,780 votes” and help overturn his loss in the state.
Raffensperger refused, and elements of the GOP have been hostile to him ever since – delegates at this year’s state GOP convention passed a resolution barring him from running as a Republican, though they acknowledge they do not actually have the power to do so.
The only mention of the president in Raffensperger’s announcement was a pledge to work with Trump and Congress “to bring jobs back to Georgia, deport criminal aliens, and restore law and order in communities across the state.”
If Raffensperger’s popularity took a hit among Republicans after 2020, it wasn’t enough to stop him from winning re-election in 2022 by comfortable margins against a Trump-backed opponent in the primary and a potent Democratic challenger in the general.
He will face stiff competition again next year as a slew of candidates from both parties seek to replace Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who is not running again because of term limits.
GOP voters in May’s primary election will select between Raffensperger and other big names including Lt. Gov. Burt Jones and Attorney General Chris Carr.
In a statement on social media, Jones touted his Trump endorsement.
“Chris Carr and Brad Raffensperger have one thing in common: They are both Never Trumpers,” he said. “There is only one candidate in this race that’s always supported and has the full and complete endorsement of @realDonaldTrump.”
Carr spokesperson Julia Mazzone called Carr the most electable candidate.
“We welcome anyone to this race, but the reality is Chris Carr is the only candidate who can win both the primary and the general election,” she said. “Chris Carr is also the only candidate who understands the challenges real Georgians face in making ends meet and building a better future.”
The winner of the Republican primary will go on to face the Democratic candidate next November. The names on the Democratic primary ballot are set to include Atlanta state Sen. Jason Esteves, former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, former DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond and former Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan.
Democrats are hoping the GOP candidates’ connections to Trump will damage their nominee’s prospects in a general election.
“As he wades into the governor’s race, Brad Raffensperger will have to pay the price of admission to any 2026 GOP primary: fully embracing Donald Trump and his toxic agenda of sky-high costs, shuttered hospitals, health care cuts, and economic chaos,” said Democratic Party of Georgia Chair Charlie Bailey in a statement. “We’ll see if Raffensperger can successfully out-MAGA Burt Jones and Chris Carr to win this messy, bruising primary – good luck!”

“Whatever label is used — a war crime, or crimes against humanity, or ethnic cleansing, or genocide — one thing is clear. This must end,” U.S. Sen. Peter Welch said on the Senate floor Wednesday.

The three members of Vermont’s congressional delegation on Wednesday, for the first time publicly, called Israel’s military campaign in Gaza a genocide, according to their offices.
U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, D-Vt., used the term in an op-ed she published Wednesday about the Middle East conflict on the news website Courier. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., published a statement on his website Wednesday bluntly titled, “It Is Genocide.” U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., used the word in a Senate floor speech Wednesday.
The delegation’s statements come a day after an independent United Nations commission released a report finding that Israel has committed four “genocidal acts” since Hamas’ brutal attack on the country on Oct. 7, 2023. This week, Israel also launched a long-threatened ground assault on the major population center Gaza City. 
According to Balint’s office, the second-term representative is the first Jewish member of the U.S. House to describe Israel’s offensive — which is estimated to have killed more than 65,000 people since the 2023 attack — as a genocide.
Balint wrote that “it is not easy” for her to call Israel’s actions a genocide, because her grandfather was murdred in the Holocaust and she has “an emotional connection to Israel beacuse it was a refuge after the genocide against the Jews.”
However, she continued, “the trauma of the Holocaust serves as a reminder of the power of speaking out. I feel compelled to speak out because I know there are so many others like me who are horrified by what they see.”
Sanders, in a separate statement Wednesday, also referred to the UN report. The commission’s findings have been strongly condemned by Israel’s government.
“I recognize that many people may disagree with this conclusion,” Sanders said of his decision to use the word “genocide.” “The truth is, whether you call it genocide or ethnic cleansing or mass atrocities or war crimes, the path forward is clear. We, as Americans, must end our complicity in the slaughter of the Palestinian people.”
Welch spoke on the Senate floor about the conflict ahead of a vote on a resolution he was leading that called for food and humanitarian aid delivery to starving children in Gaza. The measure, which was sponsored by more than 40 other Democratic senators, was not approved.
“There are many labels that could apply to what is happening in Gaza today. And whatever label is used — a war crime, or crimes against humanity, or ethnic cleansing, or genocide — one thing is clear. This must end,” Welch said. “It’s not just about giving a name or a label. It is about saving lives.”

The Crawford parade begins at 10 a.m. Saturday, Sept. 27, at 19th and Farnam Streets and finishes at 10th and Harney Streets, with a celebratory program to follow on the Heartland of America Park stage.
It is the city’s recognition of Crawford’s Sept. 13 defeat of Canelo Alvarez in Las Vegas, one of the biggest fights in the modern era. The unanimous decision made Crawford super middleweight champion and first male boxer to be the undisputed champion in three weight classes. 
Ewing during the press conference also announced a series of mayoral town halls to talk about Omaha’s future: Oct. 16, Salvation Army Kroc Center, 2825 Y St., Oct. 20, Learning Community Center of North Omaha, 1612 N. 24th St., Oct. 22, Montclair Community Center, 2304 S. 135th Ave., Oct. 27, Saddlebrook Community Center, 14850 Laurel Ave.
The town halls run from 6 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.
Among accomplishments Ewing noted in his first 100 days of becoming Omaha’s 52nd mayor were a $40 million commitment to affordable housing development via streetcar bond revenue and his presentation of a 2026 city budget with no increase to the city’s portion of the tax levy.
“Coming in the door with 43 years of public service prepared me well for the duties of leading this dynamic, wonderful city,” said Ewing, a former Omaha Police Department deputy chief who was elected in 2006 to his first term as Douglas County Treasurer. He is Omaha’s first elected Black mayor.

While Vermonters look for ways to lower their energy costs, access to plug-in and portable solar panels could lower bills and carbon emissions, according to a new campaign launched in Montpelier on Wednesday. 
Balcony solar, or miniature panels that can be set up on a patio or lawn, have gained popularity across Europe, and now Vermont is angling to become the second state to duplicate such a program. Sen. Anne Watson, D/P-Washington, chair of the Senate Natural Resources and Energy Committee, plans to introduce a bill during the 2026 legislative session to make plug-in solar panels available to Vermonters who can’t install a traditional net metering system, she said at a press conference. 
“My goal is to make it as easy as possible for people to purchase and plug in one of these devices and start saving money, while also getting the electric utilities the information that they need to meet their own requirements,” Watson said. 
The bill would propose removing current requirements like interconnection agreements with utilities and registration, as is currently required with solar installations 10 times as large, Watson said. Residents would only need to notify their electric companies that they had such a system under her bill, Watson said. 
“Seeing Utah pass a bill like this unanimously, and in a bipartisan way, that support underscored how doable I think this bill is going to be,” Watson said. “It’s time for us to get out of the way, cut that red tape, and make it easy for Vermonters to access affordable solar.”
Such a project could make renewable energy more available to all Vermonters, according to Ben Edgerly Walsh, a lobbyist for the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, a state-based environmental advocacy group. While 20,000 Vermont families have benefitted from household solar through the state’s net metering program, Walsh said, hundreds of thousands have been left out, including those who rent or live in condos or mobile homes.

“One part of the solar market hardest to open up is renters, and people who can’t afford to have solar on their property,” Walsh said Monday. 
But these smaller units, capped at 1.2 kilowatts under the proposed legislation, can be plugged into a normal wall outlet where electrons can start flowing into the house, helping to power appliances and energize light switches. They can also be connected to a battery that can save the energy for when it’s needed. Walsh estimated it could power about a fifth of a typical household, or save about $20 on a $100 electric bill. 
The small systems are also more affordable because they don’t require the same installation costs and the logistics of connecting to the grid. One unit could cost Vermonters $1,500 to $2,000, Walsh estimated, which could be paid back in about three years before adding free power to a household for the life of the system. 
In Germany, these systems now help power at least 1 million households, but those estimates could be three times as high, according to reporting by The New York Times. Rupert Mayer, a co-founder of Bright Saver, a California-based nonprofit partner that helps states and individuals set up plug-in solar systems, indicated at Wednesday’s press conference that there are 4 million portable solar units.
The portable  solar panels also enabled freedom and independence in one’s backyard without government interference, Mayer said. He said Bright Saver was talking to lawmakers across blue and red states to advance portable solar and help consumers experience its benefits. 

“It should be fairly non-controversial,” Walsh said of the initiative. “It just requires cutting a little red tape in a few places to make it possible.”
While such a move isn’t as precedent-setting as Vermont’s Climate Superfund Act or its attempt at a Clean Heat Standard, the state could be among the first to support balcony solar. 
In Utah, a bipartisan bill passed unanimously this year to reduce restrictions and expand access to this small-scale, affordable solar option. Utah Republican Gov. Spencer J. Cox signed the bill into law in March. In August, Pennsylvania legislators also began considering such a bill to facilitate widespread deployment of balcony solar. 
But while Utah’s bill became a success story, Vermont could see pushback.

“The Trump administration, they’ve doubled down on fossil fuels and they’re really doing all they can to upend the clean energy job sector,” said Johanna Miller, the energy and climate program director at the Vermont Natural Resources Council. But Miller said the 2020 Global Warming Solutions Act says the state has an obligation and an opportunity to help Vermonters move away from the burning of fossil fuels, the largest contributor to climate change. 
“The sad truth is that climate and energy policy is one of the most polarized areas in a very polarized political environment,” Walsh said. But he added there are no subsidies for this program — the legislation only asked to make it easier to install these systems without requiring net metering or grid connection. 
“For all the climate policies you can imagine us working on, this one is certainly the best set up for bipartisan support,” Walsh said. 
Vermont recently lost a major solar investment when the federal government slashed $62.5 million the state was promised by the Solar For All program, following President Donald Trump signing his One Big Beautiful Bill in July. 
While such a small-scale program can’t replace the massive funding package, Walsh said it’s another good way for Vermonters who have had trouble accessing solar to get a piece of the clean energy transition for themselves.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)A federal appeals court will consider whether Idaho’s recent voting laws unconstitutionally target voters based on age. 
A three-judge panel heard oral arguments Wednesday in the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals courtroom in Seattle in a challenge led by the youth advocacy organization March For Our Lives Idaho. 
The organization, along with the Idaho Alliance for Retired Americans, sued Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane over House Bill 124 and House Bill 340 — legislation that passed in 2023 eliminating student identification as a valid form of ID for voter registration and at the polls. House Bill 340 created a new list of acceptable ways to prove identity and residency to register to vote and allowed the Idaho Department of Motor Vehicles to issue a no-cost voter photo ID. 
Attorney David Fox, arguing on behalf of March For Our Lives Idaho on Wednesday, said that laws were a “targeted strike on young voters.” 
He said the laws violate the 26th Amendment of the Constitution, which states that U.S. citizens who are 18 years or older cannot have their right to vote denied or abridged on the basis of age. 
Idaho Deputy Solicitor General Michael Zarian countered that the state is allowed to create reasonable restrictions on voting to ensure security, and that the laws in question “don’t place a special burden on anyone.” 
“Any student who would have used a student ID before is now simply in line with the rest of the electorate who has always had to go to the DMV and obtain a compliant identification,” Zarian said.

 March For Our Lives says bills were meant to discriminate against Idaho’s young voters 

Fox on Wednesday focused on the disparate impact on young voters, which he said was an intentional target by the Idaho Legislature. 
Judge William Fletcher questioned the attorney if motivation could be assumed from the effect. 
Fox pointed to the lawmakers’ comments when the bill was being proposed, and how they differed from another proposed bill that would have eliminated the signed affidavit as valid identification at the polls. 
“There were concerns raised about the impact on young people, and they were entirely disregarded by the Legislature,” Fox said. 
He argued that when the affidavit bill was discussed, lawmakers asked for an age breakdown of who used it and found elderly voters were the primary users of this option. 
“And so the fact that the Legislature was especially, specifically concerned about age, and then specifically declined to eliminate one form of identification after learning that it was used by elderly voters, and in doing so, said they were trying to protect elderly voters, while on the other hand, restricting student identification, that clearly is disparately used and disparately affects young voters is strong evidence of intent,” Fox said. 
 Idaho argues laws improves security, does not limit voting access 

Zarian, of the Idaho Attorney General’s Office, said the lawmakers were aware that some universities didn’t have certain documentation requirements to confirm identity before issuing student ID cards, and thus they were not adequate to prove ID when voting or registering. 
“Idaho has wanted to make its elections as secure as possible and wanted to foreclose any loophole that could possibly be used for fraud,” he said. 
Fletcher asked if there was evidence of a student ID being used for voter fraud. 
Zarian said the state hadn’t found any evidence of the IDs being used for fraud. 
He also said the law hasn’t affected many people. In an election in 2022, electronic voter rolls — which are used by most but not all counties in Idaho — recorded around 100 voters who used student IDs to vote. Zarian said that March For Our Lives has not adequately shown its members were significantly burdened by the new requirements.
“It’s a legal, even-handed requirement on all people,” Zarian said. 
He also said there’s no evidence there was an intention to limit voting access for young people. 
 Similar case previously dismissed by Idaho Supreme Court

Another youth-led advocacy group, BABE Vote, with the League of Women Voters of Idaho, brought a challenge in county district court; the case was dismissed in April 2024 by the Idaho Supreme Court, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
The court unanimously upheld the laws, writing that the Idaho Constitution allows the state Legislature to create “qualifications, limitations and conditions” on the right of suffrage. The court found that the laws do not discriminate against a specific group of people, and they are related to the government’s interest in preserving election integrity.
March For Our Lives brought a separate lawsuit to the federal court.
U.S. District Court Judge Amanda Brailsford in a September 2024 opinion upheld the law and dismissed the case. 
“The Secretary (of State) has shown House Bill 340 promotes the State’s important interests of
election security and prevention of voter fraud,” she wrote. “Balancing these interests
against House Bill 340’s requirement that registrants provide an approved form of identification
to register — which may include no-fee identification — the Court concludes House Bill 340 does not pose an unconstitutional burden on registrants …” 
Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador said in a statement at the time that the Idaho Legislature “took important steps to provide secure elections while expanding accessibility to voting and eliminating burdens to participation.”
“These goals are not mutually exclusive,” the statement read. “We must promote uniformity and security in the identifications allowed for voter registration and voting.”

“The text, which is circulating in Arkansas and several other states, requests accurate account information so the state can deposit money,” a press release from the department said. “This is an effort to fraudulently access bank accounts.”
The texts may appear to be from a government agency but are “in no way legitimate,” the release said. People who receive them should not engage with them, it added.
“DFA urges all taxpayers to remain cautious, verify the source of any communication before taking action, and rely only on official state and federal websites for tax information and services,” the press release said.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)The New Mexico Higher Education Department said Wednesday that the state’s colleges and universities have more than $1 billion in infrastructure needs.
In a news release, the department said officials traveled over 700 miles across the state for its annual summer hearings to assess infrastructure needs and requests  — called capital outlay — to bring to the Legislature in next year’s session.
Higher Education Secretary Stephanie Rodriguez and the agency’s Capital Projects Division hosted meetings with the Department of Finance and Administration; the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department; and the Legislative Finance Committee, according to the news release.
Using data from campus leaders, the department will recommend specific capital projects to the executive and legislative branches, who will then debate the funding during the budget-focused 30-day legislative session that begins in January.
Last year, HED recommended approximately $221 million in campus infrastructure projects to DFA and the LFC, the news release states. Lawmakers approved 25 projects totaling more than $44 million, and Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham vetoed two of those totaling $350,000, according to LFC documents.
Rodriguez’s final tour visits in August took place at the New Mexico School for the Deaf and the Institute of American Indian Arts. In an interview at the time, she told Source NM, she had previously visited New Mexico State University’s main campus in Las Cruces; the New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell; Eastern New Mexico University-Roswell; and the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.
“Visiting all 33 campuses and schools in person has provided me with valuable insights we can’t get from reports alone,” Rodriguez said in a statement on Wednesday. “As the first higher education cabinet secretary to personally step foot on every public college, university and special school in the state, these visits have directly shaped the agency’s funding recommendations to support the unique needs of each school, strengthen student success and ensure that education in New Mexico continues to grow and thrive in state-of-the-art facilities.”

Larry Rhoden speaks to reporters during a press conference on March 31, 2025, at the state Capitol in Pierre. (Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)Several South Dakota lawmakers expressed doubts Wednesday that Gov. Larry Rhoden would change any minds with his pledge to create a Correctional Rehabilitation Task Force “following the passage” of his prison construction plan next week.
“No. Not at all,” said House Assistant Majority Leader Marty Overweg, R-New Holland. “I think most people are pretty dug in right now.” 
A special session Tuesday at the Capitol in Pierre will be the culmination of a years-long effort to replace the oldest parts of the Sioux Falls penitentiary, which predates statehood. 
After a proposal from Rhoden’s predecessor, Kristi Noem, to build in rural Lincoln County bogged down in local opposition, litigation and legislative concerns about the $825 million price tag, Rhoden appointed a Project Prison Reset task force to start over. 
Prison leader quits as prison vote looms

The group has since endorsed a new site on vacant land in northeast Sioux Falls and a lower price of $650 million for a 1,500-bed facility. The governor has said there’s enough money from the budget adopted last winter and a prison construction fund — which legislators have been filling for several years — to build the prison without debt.
Some opponents have expressed concerns that the state isn’t doing enough to keep people out of prison or prevent released inmates from reoffending.
In a news release Wednesday, Rhoden said if legislators approve the prison plan, “the next task is to expand our rehabilitative programming — that’s where this task force comes in.” 
The news release said the task force would assess programming needs for inmates, options for faith-based and Native American-focused programs, and best practices for re-entry models. It would also make recommendations on how to best use the expanded space of the new prison. 
Lt. Gov. Tony Venhuizen would lead the group, but no names were provided for other members. The news release said the roster would include legislators from both parties and chambers, plus a cross-section of experts in behavioral health, addiction counseling, correctional rehabilitative services and a tribal representative.
Overweg said he has not decided how he will vote. He is unconvinced that prison construction contractors won’t return for more money later after the $650 million cap has been reached. 
Senate Majority Whip Kevin Jensen, R-Canton, is co-chairing a legislative task force on incarceration rates and recidivism this summer and has declared himself a “hard no” on the prison bill. He called Rhoden’s announcement overdue and poorly timed, making it appear like a play to garner more votes.
“I’m wondering if it might backfire,” Jensen said.

Jensen also called attention to the language in Rhoden’s press release, which said the task force would be created “following the passage and signing of the draft legislation for the new prison.” 
South Dakota Searchlight sought clarity from the governor’s office about whether the creation of the task force is contingent on the passage of the prison plan. Spokeswoman Josie Harms responded in writing: “The Correctional Rehabilitation Task Force will be established following the passage and signing of the draft legislation for the new prison. The new prison will significantly increase space for rehabilitative programming, warranting the need for this task force.” She did not immediately respond to follow-ups.
House Minority Whip Kadyn Wittman, D-Sioux Falls, also serves on the summer task force. She said another task force making recommendations is not what the state needs.
“We have the data, we know what the problems are,” she said.
Wittman declined to say how she will vote on the prison proposal but stressed the poor condition of the penitentiary. 
“Our current facility is not fit for human habitation,” Wittman said. “Nobody wants to fund a new prison less than me, but we have a constitutional and moral obligation to not have people live in squalor.”
The prison plan will need two-thirds majority support in the House and Senate, due to a state constitutional provision requiring the higher threshold for bills appropriating money.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/EM8A1873-1024x745.jpg,,,2025-09-17 18:57:10.668528

Chief Michael Peeler said he could not answer several questions about the investigation into the death of 21-year-old Demartravion “Trey” Reed of Grenada, Mississippi. The tragedy swiftly captured the scrutiny of the state and the nation, with some speculating that this was another example of Mississippi’s racist history of lynching of Black people.
However, the chief stood by his earlier statements that there appeared to be no foul play. Peeler said he was the second officer from the Delta State Police Department on the scene after Reed was found, and he saw the body.

Bolivar County Coroner Randolph “Rudy” Seals Jr. said Monday that Reed had no broken bones and did not appear to have been assaulted.
Mississippi’s Chief Medical Examiner Staci Turner was conducting an autopsy of Reed’s body, and preliminary results should be released within two days, Peeler said Wednesday.
Delta State President Dan Ennis recognized that this case touched a nerve, and he defended the school from accusations of racism.
“Richard Wright said that history comes on us, it surges up and it’s fused and tangled. And so, I acknowledge that this imagery is fused and tangled in people’s identities,” said an emotional Ennis. “Sometimes we can’t unknot it. We can’t untangle it, but here is one of the best places to start to pick at that knot, and to acknowledge that situation and build off of it.”
Law enforcement presence on campus increased after several people made threatening calls to the university. However, Peeler emphasized that campus was safe.

“At this point we don’t have any credible threats that I’m aware of and law enforcement will let me know,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt when someone calls the office and says that this is a terrible place, and that people should be hurt.”
Ennis also addressed a statement from the attorney for Reed’s family that the university did not reach out to them. He said the university had been in contact with the next-of-kin Reed listed on a contact form. Ennis did not reveal who those people were, but said the university would cooperate with any investigation into Reed’s death. 
“I also acknowledge that there is a distinction between next-of-kin and family, and I acknowledge that both next-of-kin and family are grieving,” he said.

Stacy Starling, Reed’s aunt, addressed reporters after the press conference but did not answer any questions.
“We just ask that you continue to just to lift us up in your prayers. We thank you, and God bless each and every one of you,” she said before joining other relatives and friends in a prayer circle.
Reed’s body was found hanging from a tree early Monday near the pickleball courts on campus. Reed’s race and the manner of his death triggered an outcry online about Mississippi’s history of racist violence and rattled the university’s community.
Democratic U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson called for the FBI to investigate Reed’s death. Reed’s family has retained lawyers Ben Crump and Vanessa Jones, and they are launching their own independent investigation.
Reed’s death is being investigated by police from Delta State and Cleveland, the Bolivar County Sheriff’s Department and the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation.

As more insurers, hospitals and clinicians use artificial intelligence in health care, state legislators on both sides of the aisle are looking to regulate its use. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A bipartisan group of Pennsylvania state legislators recently hatched a plan to regulate the use of artificial intelligence in health care.
Four Pennsylvania House Democrats and one House Republican plan to introduce legislation that would require insurers, hospitals and other providers to follow certain rules when using AI for patient care, billing and coding, claims processing and other health-related services.
“As the only physician in the [Pennsylvania] General Assembly, I have seen the rapid growth of AI usage in health care in real time,” said Democratic Pennsylvania state Rep. Arvind Venkat in a statement announcing the legislation. Venkat is an emergency medicine physician in Pittsburgh.
Venkat said that while AI has increased efficiency in administrative tasks for physicians like himself, he’s concerned about its growing use in decision-making about patient care and whether health services are covered by insurance.
This year alone, more than a dozen states have passed laws regulating AI in health care, according to Manatt Health, a national health services firm.
Arizona, Maryland, Nebraska and Texas now ban insurance companies from using AI as the sole decision-maker in prior authorization or medical necessity denials. Nevada and Oregon prohibit AI from representing itself as a health care provider, while several other states — including Utah and New York —  have regulated the use of AI-enabled chat bots in mental health.
State AI legislation has been sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans and has been approved with bipartisan support, a reflection of broad concerns over its expanding use in health care.
California, New York could become first states to enact laws aiming to prevent catastrophic AI harm

The Pennsylvania lawmakers say their proposed legislation would force insurers and health care providers to be transparent about how they use AI; require a human to make the final decision any time AI is used: and mandate that insurers and providers to show evidence of minimizing bias in their use of AI.
“As AI use has grown in the health care industry, we have already seen evidence that AI usage can reinforce bias and discrimination,” Venkat said in a statement. “This will allow us to ensure that insurers, clinicians and hospitals use AI effectively and do not use it to perpetuate potentially harmful biases in the medical field.”
More than half of American patients say AI in health needs more oversight, according to an August poll from the United States of Care, a nonprofit focused on affordable and accessible health care. Meanwhile, more than two-thirds of physicians have reported an increase in AI use for administrative tasks like recording and managing patient information, and nearly half reported using AI more frequently in patient care and clinical decision-making.
National groups including the American Medical Association have also called for more oversight of AI. Last year, physician use of AI more than doubled, according to the latest data from the association.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/ Rhode Island Current)House Minority Leader Mike Chippendale is calling for an audit of the quasi-governmental agency that finances affordable home construction, claiming administrative bloat has hindered its mission of tackling Rhode Island’s housing crisis.
The Foster Republican on Wednesday suggested RIHousing is another example of why the state needs to create an office of inspector general to root out waste and fraud, despite the fact that the agency has posted audited financial statements on its website for the past 16 years. 
House Republicans released the fruits of their own investigation, in a six-page report Chippendale handed out to reporters gathered for a press conference in his State House office. The report compared RIHousing’s budget to its peers across New England.
“What we found was nothing short of shocking,” Chippendale said. He accused the agency of being an “upper middle class job creation program” while production stagnates.
The analysis conducted by House Minority Office staff found that RIHousing had among the second highest approximate combined administrative and personnel costs in the region at $46.4 million. 
When scaled to 10,000 residents, it was about $417,400 — nearly $60,000 higher than Vermont. When compared to MassHousing, the report found a disparity of over $300,000 per 10,000 residents.
Looking at total operating expenses over total program spending, House Republicans found that of the total $52.3 million RIHousing operating budget for fiscal year 2026, only $7.2 million would go toward program spending.
“A 7:1 ratio of overhead to output,” Chippendale said. “At a minimum, this reflects gross inefficiency.”
RIHousing has approximately 237 employees. The House GOP’s report said it is the second highest in the region after MassHousing with 363 people on staff.
RIHousing Executive Director Carole Ventura expressed her disappointment over the House Minority Office brief, which she said lacked an understanding of the agency’s significant workload.
“It’s disappointing to see political talking points mischaracterize and malign the work of an industry and agency that continues to deliver thousands of affordable homes to our state amid a historic housing crisis,” Ventura said in a statement released to Rhode Island Current late Wednesday.
“RIHousing is an award-winning housing finance agency which performs more functions than many peer agencies in larger states, and which has been recognized many times by its fellow HFAs for its innovative programs and the scope of its impact. Over the last five years, Ventura said RIHousing has invested roughly $1.6 billion into housing development and financed over 5,600 homes for Rhode Islanders.
RIHousing undergoes an annual audit of compliance with federal regulations for all major federal programs in accordance with Federal requirements conducted by an independent audit firm approved by the state’s auditor general, Ventura added. A page on the agency’s website has audited financial statements going back to 2009.










It’s disappointing to see political talking points mischaracterize and malign the work of an industry and agency that continues to deliver thousands of affordable homes to our state amid a historic housing crisis.


– Carole Ventura, executive director, RIHousing


“Every program we run is subject to rules and regulations, public input, and oversight by numerous bodies and independent audits,” Ventura said. “Every project we finance is subject to a transparent process and scoring, rigorous underwriting, third-party cost analyses, state and municipal approvals and, approval by the agency’s Board of Commissioners. Every activity we undertake, every hire we make and every dollar we spend is accounted for publicly and reported on routinely.”
Chippendale claimed the state will not get the return on investment needed to make a dent in the estimated 26,000-unit affordable housing shortage across the state.
He cited an October 2024 Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council (RIPEC) report as the prime example for the state’s shortcomings. The report found even though the state had committed $273 million toward new home construction, it would only yield about 1,600 new units.
“The only conclusion that can be drawn is that there are tremendous inefficiencies and flaws in our approach to development and funding of housing,” Chippendale said. 
“Development of affordable housing is complex and subject to review at every stage,” Ventura said. “Development budgets reflect real factors in the market, like land, cost of materials, cost of labor, building code requirements and other regulatory compliance, environmental work, accessibility requirements and more – not agency profit. To suggest otherwise is baseless, does a disservice to the real work being done by this agency during an unprecedented housing crisis and dismissive of the dedication and oversight of our Board of Commissioners.”
Chippendale said he has asked House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi to have the General Assembly’s Auditor General look into a full performance review of RIHousing. House spokesperson Larry Berman confirmed Wednesday afternoon Shekarchi received an informal request from Chippendale. 
If Chippendale were to put something down in writing, Berman said Shekarchi will look to schedule a meeting of the Joint Committee on Legislative Services, which Chippendale sits on, within the next couple of months.
The 20-member Special Legislative Commission on Housing Affordability — which includes Chippendale —  is scheduled Thursday afternoon to hear from RIHousing leaders about recent development activity and investments to boost the state’s housing stock.
That presentation will come just after Housing Secretary Deborah Goddard, who sits on both the commission and chairs RIHousing’s board of directors, delivers a status report on the state’s 2030 plan and housing production.
But Chippendale said he will be skipping the meeting in order to babysit his 2-month-old grandson.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)Pennsylvania has joined a coalition of northeastern states in an effort to develop public health and immunization guidelines amid concerns about the direction of federal health agencies.
The group will meet regularly to coordinate on public health efforts such as emergency preparedness and the creation of immunization guidelines.
“Pennsylvania is participating in the bipartisan Northeast Public Health Collaborative (NEPHC) because the Shapiro Administration is committed to keeping Pennsylvanians healthy, preventing injury and disease, and ensuring the safe delivery of quality health care throughout the Commonwealth,” Barry Ciccocioppo, communications director for the state Department of Health, said in a statement. “To meet our mission and ensure Pennsylvanians have access to essential public health resources, members of the Department of Health work with colleagues in other states and jurisdictions to share innovations, best practices, and improve efficiency.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Other states involved include Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. All have Democratic governors, except Vermont which is run by Republican Phil Scott.
The move follows a similar action taken by West Coast states, California, Oregon and Washington, who formed their own public health coalition.
Historically, almost all U.S. states, including Pennsylvania, have accepted immunization guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC). However, changes at the agency under President Donald Trump and U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., including the firing of its director, have shaken the trust of public health experts.
“States have had to step forward basically into the breach and fill the void left by a gutted CDC and the dismantling of public health infrastructure at the federal government level,” Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey told NPR recently.
Nine former directors of the CDC also raised alarms about the direction of the agency under Kennedy, its defunding of medical research, and the trustworthiness of its public health recommendations in a New York Times op-ed.
Earlier this month, the Pennsylvania State Board of Pharmacy, which is responsible for determining when and to whom Pennsylvania pharmacists can administer vaccines, also voted to accept immunization recommendations from non-government health organizations like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, as well as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
Pa.  Board of Pharmacy votes to use vaccine guidelines from non-government groups

The move effectively allowed them to bypass guidance from the Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, amid concerns that the group has been politicized.
Kennedy, a longtime proponent of antivaccine views and the former chair of an antivaccine advocacy group, removed and replaced all 17 members of the CDC’s immunization advisory panel, appointing a number who have voiced concerns about the safety and efficacy of vaccines in a break from widespread scientific consensus. The panel is scheduled to meet this week and vote on recommendations for this year’s COVID-19 shot and other vaccines.
The Pennsylvania Department of Health, Department of Human Services and Insurance Commission submitted a joint public comment to the panel ahead of their meeting that said, “Immunization remains one of the most powerful and cost-effective tools for preventing serious illnesses, reducing hospitalizations, and protecting those most vulnerable to severe outcomes.”
“Consistent and science-driven recommendations from ACIP are therefore essential to preserving both individual autonomy and collective well-being,” the letter added.

Andrew Nixon, the communications director of the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, responded to concerns about changes to the department in a statement to the Capital-Star.
“The American people voted for transparency and accountability, and that’s exactly what Secretary Kennedy is delivering,” he wrote. “For decades, CDC failed to level with the public. We are reforming broken institutions, restoring gold standard science as the foundation of public health, and empowering Americans with honest information and real choice. That is how we rebuild trust and Make America Healthy Again.”
Nixon also criticized states like Pennsylvania that are seeking to bypass the CDC’s vaccine recommendations.
“Democrat-run states that pushed unscientific school lockdowns, toddler mask mandates, and draconian vaccine passports during the COVID era completely eroded the American people’s trust in public health agencies,” he said. “ACIP remains the scientific body guiding immunization recommendations in this country, and HHS will ensure policy is based on rigorous evidence and Gold Standard Science, not the failed politics of the pandemic.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/COVID-vaccines-states.jpg,,,2025-09-17 18:57:10.668528

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The city of Fayetteville is violating a law prohibiting “sanctuary policy” and is therefore ineligible to receive discretionary funding administered by the state, according to an opinion released by the Arkansas attorney general Wednesday. 
The opinion was requested by Rep. Kendon Underwood, a Cave Springs Republican who claimed in June that the city violated the state law after the mayor issued a news release clarifying the Fayetteville Police Department’s role in an Arkansas State Police traffic stop that involved federal immigration enforcement, the Fayetteville Flyer reported. 
Underwood expressed his appreciation for the attorney general’s work and sent letters Wednesday to the governor and the Department of Finance and Administration’s secretary requesting they withhold all discretionary funds to the city of Fayetteville until it comes into compliance with state law, according to a news release. He also sent letters to the co-chairs of the Arkansas Legislative Council requesting the committee’s support. 
“It is unfortunate that the city is jeopardizing its funding because of the radical left politics and posturing of the mayor, but the Legislature has spoken and we will not tolerate dangerous sanctuary city policies that make Arkansans less safe,” Underwood said. “I am hopeful that the mayor will reverse course, but until then I will do everything in my power to ensure the law is enforced and funding is withheld from Fayetteville.”
Arkansas governor orders National Guard to assist ICE with immigration enforcement

Mayor Molly Rawn sent a letter Wednesday to city council members and Fayetteville’s police chief clarifying that it’s the city’s policy “to fully comply” with all state laws, including the statute in question. 
“The City of Fayetteville has never had a written policy that affirms, suggests, or implies the existence of a sanctuary policy,” Rawn said. “However, to avoid any misunderstanding, I want to make it unequivocally clear that my comments should not be interpreted as supporting or establishing a sanctuary policy in violation of A.C.A. § 14-1-103, either now or at any point in the future.”
Tension over immigration policy has heightened under the Trump administration whose crackdown on immigration has included an executive order to revoke federal funding to “sanctuary cities” and an effort to hire more U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. 
In Arkansas, state lawmakers passed the Defense Against Criminal Illegals Act this spring which, among other things, expanded the state’s current ban on “sanctuary cities,” a term for municipalities that don’t coordinate with federal immigration authorities. The law, whose primary sponsor was Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, applies to counties, cities, unincorporated towns or “any other political subdivision of the state.”
Under the law, local governments can’t adopt policies that prohibit cooperation with federal agencies to verify a person’s immigration status, “grants to illegal immigrants the right to lawful presence or status” in violation of federal law, prevents law enforcement from asking about citizenship or immigration status, restricts cooperation with detainers or other requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or requires ICE to obtain a warrant or demonstrate more than probable cause before complying with detainers or other legal requests to maintain custody of immigrants or transfer their custody to ICE.  
After receiving a complaint from an Arkansas resident or request from a state lawmaker, the attorney general must issue an opinion stating whether a local government violated the law. If a violation is determined, the local government is ineligible to receive discretionary funding provided by the state until the attorney general certifies the sanctuary policy is repealed or no longer in effect. Discretionary funding is not mandatory and refers to money that is provided through funds or grants administered by the state.
The law allows the local government to appeal the decision in Pulaski County Circuit Court.

In Wednesday’s opinion, Attorney General Tim Griffin said his office sent a letter to Fayetteville’s city attorney on June 27 requesting copies of city ordinances or policies related to the statute in question. While Griffin was provided with “numerous documents,” the most relevant was a statement from Rawn that indicated “FPD does not participate in civil immigration enforcement violations,” he said.
The Fayetteville Police Department received a request from Arkansas State Police related to a traffic stop near I-49 and Exit 64 on the morning of June 17, according to a news release from the city. A Fayetteville police sergeant responded and observed both ASP and ICE personnel, but had no further involvement and left the scene. Fayetteville PD had not been contacted by ICE or other agencies regarding immigration enforcement operations in the city, according to the release. 
“I want to reaffirm clearly: The City of Fayetteville does not assist ICE in carrying out its agenda,” Rawn said in the release. “Our police department’s role is to keep our community safe, not to act as agents of immigration enforcement.”
Griffin wrote in his opinion that the mayor’s statement, which said it “reiterated the city’s position,” reflects a preexisting policy and that violates the state’s sanctuary policy law. 
The attorney general’s office has exchanged four letters with the city (two sent and two received) seeking information about the city’s existing policies that are relevant to the law, Griffin said. The city believes its policies don’t violate state law or are relevant to the statute, but “that belief is mistaken,” he said.

“The City may submit evidence demonstrating that the sanctuary policy is no longer current or that exceptions have been made that would allow City employees to comply with the statute,” Griffin wrote. “If that evidence is submitted, the City will be eligible to receive the discretionary funds again.”
Fayetteville City Attorney Kit Williams argued in a June 18 letter to the mayor and city council addressing Underwood’s complaint that he did not believe Rawn’s statement violated the law. Williams wrote that Fayetteville “has long scrupulously followed and obeyed the sanctuary policies prohibited law,” but the law doesn’t require Fayetteville police officers to act as immigration enforcement agents. 
Furthermore, Williams argued, state law does not require the city to “assist ICE in carrying out its agenda,” which includes many things including “searching for, arresting and detaining illegal immigrants.”
“Since the City of Fayetteville does not have knowledge of the illegal immigrant status of residents, nor do we have any city detention facilities where a suspected illegal immigrant might be housed and then transferred to ICE custody, the city cannot assist ICE in its agenda,” Williams wrote.

(Screenshot from livestream)Arkansas PBS’ governing board on Wednesday nominated state Rep. Carlton Wing to take over the agency as CEO and executive director, pending approval from Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
Wing, a North Little Rock Republican and House Speaker Pro Tempore, would replace Courtney Pledger, who resigned in April after eight years at the helm of the public television network.
If confirmed, Wing would be required to resign from the Arkansas Legislature, triggering a special election to finish his term through 2027. Wing announced in June that he would not run for reelection to a sixth term in 2026.

In an email, Wing said interim executive director Sajni Kumpuris asked him if he would be interested in running the agency. Wing and his wife, Leigh, co-founded the video production company Wing Media Group. He also is a former sports broadcaster for KARK.
The Arkansas PBS Commission approved Wing’s nomination with no dissent after more than an hour of discussion in executive session. As of Wednesday afternoon, Arkansas PBS spokespeople had not responded to an email asking how many applicants the commission considered.
If confirmed, Wing would be Arkansas PBS’ third tie to Republican state lawmakers in less than two years. In June 2024, Sanders appointed Maria Sullivan, wife of a state senator, to the commission.
Wednesday’s quarterly commission meeting was the first for its newest member, former state Rep. Charlene Fite, a Van Buren Republican who left office in January after declining to run for a seventh term last year. Her term on the commission will expire in 2032, a year after Sullivan’s.
Fite’s appointment has yet to be formally announced by Sanders’ office. She replaces former commission chairman West Doss, whose term expired in 2024 but who continued to serve in the absence of a replacement. Vice Chairman Woody Freeman conducted Wednesday’s meeting, and the commission did not yet choose a new chair.

Arkansas House passes PBS appropriation after three votes for second consecutive fiscal session


Sullivan’s husband is Jonesboro Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan, the Legislature’s most vocal critic of Arkansas PBS. He unsuccessfully tried to reduce Arkansas PBS’ spending authority in the 2022 and 2024 fiscal sessions.
Arkansas PBS’ spending authority has repeatedly faced resistance in the Arkansas House. Wing was among the lawmakers who urged their colleagues to pass the network’s appropriation bill in 2024, when the bill passed after three attempts. The appropriation took five attempts to pass the House this year.
 Funding discussion

Sullivan introduced a bill in February that would have dissolved the PBS Commission, but he and Doss said in March that they reached an agreement for Sullivan to leave the commission alone.
Transferring the commission’s duties to the state Department of Education would have jeopardized Arkansas PBS’ funding via grants and donations, Pledger told lawmakers in February, urging them not to pass Sullivan’s bill.
Arkansas PBS lost $2.5 million in programming and operational funds after the Corporation for Public Broadcasting lost federal funding this summer. CPB announced in August that the majority of staff positions would conclude on Sept. 30, with a small transition team staying on until January 2026. The community service grant from CPB accounted for 51% of the Arkansas PBS’ operating expense funding, Kumpuris told the commission at a special meeting in June.

Corporation for Public Broadcasting to close its doors after loss of funding

 

The commission decided at that meeting to renew its federal PBS affiliation. Renewal allowed the agency to continue purchasing PBS programs to air, some of which is chosen by PBS’ national headquarters. Losing this programming would have led to a drop in donations even though forgoing the renewal would have saved the state agency $2.3 million in national dues, which it usually pays with federal funds, said Marge Betley, CEO of the Arkansas PBS Foundation.
Since June, the Foundation has provided the network with a “one-time emergency fund” of $1.5 million, supporting both operating expenses and about half of the national dues, Kumpuris said Wednesday.
“We’re grateful for the Foundation giving us this time to adjust,” she said. “There are some PBS networks that didn’t get that time.”
The financial aid meant the network only had to use about $500,000 more of its reserve funding than it did for fiscal year 2025, Kumpuris said, and she and other agency officials found ways to reduce expenses by $1 million without impairing network operations.
Kumpuris also said she and Betley are discussing the option of the Foundation covering the entirety of the network’s dues in fiscal year 2027.
“That’s really what our donors give for, primarily with membership, is to support those PBS dues,” Betley said. “That’s one of the primary messages that we send to them when we’re asking for their support [and] that’s the intention of the individual fundraising that we do.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)With the administration of Gov. Ron DeSantis moving to eliminate vaccine mandates from Florida statutes, rules, and regulations, some health care advocates worry that costs of vaccines won’t be covered for patients.
Meanwhile, the Florida Department of Health continues to keep quiet about whether it will hold a public hearing on a proposal to remove vaccination requirements for public and private school grades kindergarten through 12, day care centers, and adult education courses.
The issue of vaccines and insurance coverage was broached during a Florida Voices for Health statewide advocacy virtual meeting Wednesday. A coalition of community organizations, businesses, and individuals, Florida Voices for Health works to expand availability of health care services.
“What I am noticing as a consumer in both transgender prescriptions and in advocacy for people with disabilities, like, major life-preserving medications are being withheld just on the suggestion of executive orders,” one participant said. “And the issue is insurance carriers. It doesn’t even need to be in law for them to save money and not pay for things.”
AHIP — the national health insurance industry trade association — though, says insurers won’t halt payments for vaccinations any time soon.
“Health plans are committed to maintaining and ensuring affordable access to vaccines. Health plan coverage decisions for immunizations are grounded in each plan’s ongoing, rigorous review of scientific and clinical evidence, and continual evaluation of multiple sources of data,” the organization said in a written statement.
“Health plans will continue to cover all (Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices) ACIP-recommended immunizations that were recommended as of September 1, 2025, including updated formulations of the COVID-19 and influenza vaccines, with no cost-sharing for patients through the end of 2026.
“While health plans continue to operate in an environment shaped by federal and state laws, as well as program and customer requirements, the evidence-based approach to coverage of immunizations will remain consistent.”

Disappearing mandate?
The DeSantis administration made national headlines earlier this month when state Surgeon General and Department of Health Secretary Joseph Ladapo said he’d like to eliminate all vaccine mandates from Florida statutes and rules, a move that could affect schoolchildren but also college students and even nursing home residents. Ladapo said at the time that mandates drip “with disdain and slavery.” 
DeSantis administration pushes to eliminate all vaccine mandates in Florida

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website says that “vaccines can prevent infectious diseases that once killed or harmed many infants, children, and adults.” It also says, “The disease-prevention benefits of getting vaccines are much greater than the possible side effects for almost all children. The only exceptions to this are cases in which a child has a serious chronic medical condition like cancer or a disease that weakens the immune system, or has had a severe allergic reaction to a previous vaccine dose.”
The  Florida Phoenix asked the DOH Tuesday whether it will hold a public meeting on its proposed rule change regarding vaccines. The DOH announced last week that it was updating its immunization requirements and forms for childcare and school admission, plus opt-out provisions, in the Florida Administrative Register.
The Florida Chapter of the American College of Physicians and the Florida Academy of Family Physicians have asked the DOH to hold a meeting on its proposed new rules but the department hasn’t formally announced whether it intends to do so. Ladapo isn’t required to hold a public meeting if he deems it unnecessary.
Regardless, the Florida Board of Pharmacy appears poised to tackle the issue. The nine-member board meets virtually next week to discuss its rules regarding COVID-19 and other vaccinations. The Board of Pharmacy is housed in the DOH, which Ladapo runs, and its members are appointed by the governor.

“Two young, handsome Friesians have joined my herd,” the media personality wrote on social media last week.

Lifestyle and homemaking media mogul Martha Stewart has provided a “forever home” to two Friesian gelding horses seized from a Vermont farm as part of an ongoing animal cruelty case, according to an animal rescue director.
The state has confiscated 74 horses from the Friesians of Majesty horse farm in Townshend over the course of two years, and horse owner Robert Labrie is facing charges related to animal cruelty and violation of his conditions of release. 
First reported by the Brattleboro Reformer, Martha Stewart took in the two horses — named Ulysses and Stewart — last Friday at her estate Cantitoe Corners in New York.
“Two young, handsome Friesians have joined my herd,” Stewart wrote in an Instagram post Sunday. “Three-year old Ulysses and 10-year-old Stewart, were removed from a neglectful facility and brought to Dorset Equine Rescue in Vermont where they could get the care and attention they needed until they could be properly re-homed.”
Stewart’s barn manager contacted Dorset Equine Rescue after the first seizure of horses in 2023 expressing the celebrity’s interest in adoption, but the organization could not make the arrangement at the time due to pending litigation, said Jen Straub, executive director of the rescue. 
Ulysses was adopted outright by Stewart after the Friesian gelding was taken in the first seizure and had been forfeited. The second Friesian horse, called Stewart, is being fostered by his namesake, Straub said.

After the forfeiture is sealed, Stewart intends to adopt the 10-year-old gelding, Straub said. An “animal lover,” Stewart already had four Friesians, five miniature donkeys, dogs and cats on a farm in Katonah, a hamlet of Bedford, New York, Straub said.
Ulysses was a yearling when the rescue first received him, but he was small for his age, emaciated, feverish, dehydrated and displayed signs of colic, said Tiffany Vittum, the barn manager for Dorset Equine Rescue. 
After Ulysses was sent to the hospital, the horse was diagnosed with a condition called pyloric stenosis, an intestinal issue that prevents feed from properly passing through from the stomach to the intestine. 
“He would have died from this,” Vittum said. “The vets did not think that this was ever going to change. It was just going to be a lifetime diagnosis, but with a couple of years of proper treatment and proper feeding and just lots of growing and proper nourishment, he actually was able to overcome it.”
When seized earlier this year, the horse Stewart was emaciated and hospitalized due to several dental issues where he received treatment for several weeks, Vittum said. 
“He was born with poor jaw conformation, but the neglect only enhanced it,” Vittum said. “He’s going to need routine, more regular dental work than the average horse. But once we got that taken care of, he was able to go on a pretty normal horse diet of grain and hay, and his weight improved immediately.”
Dorset Equine Rescue has helped with recovery, care and placement of the 74 horses seized from Friesians of Majesty horse farm in the past two years, and facilitated the adoption of over a of the dozen horses since forfeited, Straub said. 
Steven Brown, Windham County state’s attorney, said the forfeiture of horses seized in 2023 has long since been completed. Brown said Windham County Superior Court Judge John Treadwell ordered the forfeiture of 19 of the 20 horses seized in 2024, reported by the Brattleboro Reformer in August. That means the adoption process may commence for those 19 horses as well, Brown said. 
The next step in the case is the forfeiture hearing for the 39 horses seized in June this year, and then Labrie will stand trial for the animal cruelty charges against him, Brown said.
Brown expressed gratitude to Dorset Equine Rescue for assisting the state and law enforcement during the seizures and caring for horses while the forfeitures are litigated. 
“They’ve been an outstanding partner to us, and have gone way above and beyond what we ever could have asked for in terms of care they’re providing and their work in this case,” Brown said. “The public should be aware that they are not receiving any public funds for this work. It’s all based off of donations, and we really appreciate what they do.”

A majority of the five-member commission fired Howard Knapp out of a desire for new leadership, according to a statement by Chairman Dennis Shedd.
Shedd also said the decision was “unrelated to the conduct of any election in South Carolina.”
“The Commission’s leadership and staff remain dedicated to ensuring South Carolina’s elections are accurate, secure, and accessible,” Shedd said.
The commission declined to make any further comment.
Knapp’s firing, effective immediately, comes amid a lawsuit trying to stop the Election Commission from providing the information of about 3.3 million registered voters to the U.S. Department of Justice over privacy concerns.
In an opinion earlier this month, the state Supreme Court overruled a circuit court’s pause on providing that information, clearing the way for the commission to begin handing over names, birthdays, addresses, driver’s license numbers and final digits of Social Security numbers.
Knapp was named the state’s chief election official in 2022 and confirmed by the state Senate in 2023. He earned an annual salary of $150,000.
Knapp also remains the subject of an ongoing investigation by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, according to agency spokeswoman Renee Wunderlich.
In March 2024, SLED launched the investigation into unspecified allegations of misconduct at the request of the state attorney general’s office.
The commission appointed Chief of Staff Jenny Wooten as interim executive director.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Matthew Mueller) Kentucky Auditor Allison Ball alleges in a report released Wednesday that the state mismanaged about $800 million in taxpayer funds, resulting in payments to Medicaid managed care organizations at the same time other states were paying for the same patients.
Dr. Steven Stack, secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services, called the Wednesday report a “rehash” of what federal investigators found in 2022 — that 47 states made capitation payments for Medicaid recipients who were enrolled in two states. Medicaid is a federal-state program that pays for 1 in 3 Kentuckians’ health care. 
“The issue of concurrent enrollment in Medicaid Managed Care was identified by a federal inspector general in 2022 and is happening in nearly all 50 states, making the (auditor’s) ‘special examination’ a rehash,” Stack wrote in a Sept. 10 letter to Ball, which is included in the report.

Kentucky Medicaid contracts with six insurance companies to serve as managed care organizations (MCO) that offer competing health plans and process claims. Medicaid pays the MCOs  a set amount called a capitation payment for each patient.
As “one of Kentucky’s costliest programs,” Ball said in a statement, “it’s essential that we make sure every Medicaid dollar spent is going directly to benefit Kentuckians in need of services, not being wasted due to bureaucratic negligence.” 
The audit says Kentucky was one of four states — along with Ohio, Oregon and Washington — that were asked by federal officials during the Biden administration to dig into state-specific issues related to concurrent payments to MCOS from Jan. 1, 2019 to Dec. 31, 2022. An auditor spokesperson said the office examined these dates because the Office of Inspector General “specifically asked us to look at this time period.” 
Among other things, the report suggests, as a solution, that managed care organizations carry more responsibility in their contracts to help track members and eliminate waste.
“The issues causing this waste are straightforward problems that can be fixed with relative ease,” the report said. 
Tyler Glick, spokesman for the Kentucky Association of Health Plans, which represents the state’s managed care organizations, said in a statement that the MCOs are not to blame for this problem. 
MCOs “are obligated to cover medical services for enrolled Kentuckians,” Glick said in a statement. But: “health Plans don’t decide who is eligible.” 
“Existing federal rules cap profits and require actuarial rate-setting, limiting concurrent spending. Kentucky’s health plans improve Medicaid by coordinating high-quality, whole-person care, emphasizing preventive services and promoting competition and consumer choice,” Glick said. “As always, health plans remain committed to working with state and federal officials to ensure program efficiency and continuity of care.”
Kentucky Auditor Allison Ball alleges in a report released Wednesday that the state mismanaged about $800 million in taxpayer funds, resulting in payments to managed care organizations that were also receiving money for the same patients from other states. (Screenshot)
The auditor’s report, Stack said in his Sept. 10 letter, “contains significant inaccuracies, relies heavily on unsubstantiated assumptions and fails to provide verifiable evidence of any substantial loss of taxpayer funds.”  
Stack also wrote that the report lacked a determination of the “actual state of residence for each overlapping month” and “a significant portion of the counted overlap happened during time periods when Kentucky Medicaid was the correct state of residence instead of the other state, and vice versa.” 
In a response letter, Ball said that “whether Kentucky or another state is the true state of residency for those concurrently enrolled individuals matters only for determining whether more of that waste falls on the shoulders of Kentucky taxpayers or another state’s taxpayers” but asserted that “Kentucky taxpayers have shouldered the burden of this waste in at least some capacity as federal taxpayers.” 
Stack said states also lack “access to the data necessary to identify when beneficiaries are concurrently enrolled in a Medicaid Managed Care program in another state.” Ball responded in a letter dated Sept. 17: “That is false. At a base level, CHFS already does have all the data it needs to identify concurrent enrollment.” 
In July, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced several plans to “partner with states to reduce duplicate enrollment.” Stack referenced that promise in his letter to the auditor and said “our agency has yet to receive any additional guidance” yet. 
Looking at a sample of 19 Medicaid patients who died, Ball’s report says Kentucky made payments for at least four months after the date of death. The Cabinet for Health and Family Services took an average of 320 days to “reflect the deaths” of those Kentuckians, the report says. (Screenshot)
Ball’s report also alleges that there were delays in recording deaths and ceasing payments to MCOs. Looking at a sample of 19 Medicaid patients who died, the report says Kentucky made payments for at least four months after the date of death. The Cabinet for Health and Family Services took an average of 320 days to “reflect the deaths” of those Kentuckians, the report says. 
In Stack’s response letter, he says that the cabinet relies on official records of deaths and  “there are reasons why that could be delayed.” 
Ball’s Sept. 17 letter says the auditor’s office “cannot confirm nor deny whether (the cabinet) truly removed 56,440 individuals from Medicaid during the examined period. Regardless, its failure to address the issues outlined in the (auditor’s) report contributed to over $800 million of Medicaid waste borne by United States taxpayers.”  
Kendra Steele, a spokeswoman for the cabinet, said the report fails to “acknowledge states depend on federal partners to see through their commitment to provide the necessary guidance and technical assistance.” 
“We know what the issue is because (the Office of Inspector General) and (Centers for Medicaid Services) have told us: States need full access to the tools necessary to identify concurrent enrollment,” she said. “(The cabinet) stands ready to take action as soon as that information is provided by the federal government.” 
In her Sept. 17 letter to Stack, Ball wrote that the cabinet has a “reactive, and not proactive, vision for addressing the issue,” which she called “concerning.”
“As the (Auditor of Public Accounts has outlined in its report, (the cabinet) can take numerous steps right now to address this issue without federal government guidance,” Ball wrote. “It should take those steps while the Trump administration prepares to give states tools for combating this issue that previous administrations have not.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Tensions between Democrats and Republicans were on full display during the second and final meeting of a state Senate working group on gun violence prevention, just two days after the lawmakers expressed a willingness to work together following a Minneapolis school shooting that killed two children and injured 21 others.
Democratic-Farmer-Labor members of the working group put forward a number of gun policy proposals, many of which have gotten hearings in recent legislative sessions: safe storage requirements; funding for gun violence prevention research; and bans on assault weapons, high-capacity magazines and binary triggers, which increase the rate of fire of a gun.
The Republican members held the line on their party’s opposition to any measure that would place new restrictions on firearms. They did not submit any specific proposals for consideration, citing a lack of time to prepare.











Sen. Ron Latz, DFL-St. Louis Park, is an attorney who chaired the working group. He spent much of the first hour of the meeting pressing Republicans to state their position on a bill that would require gun owners to store their firearms unloaded and equipped with a locking device; or loaded or unloaded in a locked firearm storage unit or gun room.











“Is there any objection to moving forward with a discussion, with an eye toward finding agreement on language for a safe storage-type bill?” Latz asked the Republican working group members. 
Sen. Jeff Howe, R-Rockville, responded: “I don’t think it’s right for us to tell an author of a bill that they can’t continue to work on a bill. I think if you’ve got an idea for the bill, continue to work on the bill.” 
Latz replied: “Are you volunteering then…to try to come up with language that might advance the concept of a safe storage bill? Or is anyone on the GOP side of this committee willing to say that they are comfortable with the idea and are willing to work on language that might be acceptable?” 
Howe: “We’re five folks. There are 33 of us on this side of the aisle. Just because we don’t — and we may or may not, I can’t speak for the other members of the committee,” he said before describing his gun safes. Another member of his party might be interested in working on the bill, he said. 
Latz grew visibly frustrated at what he deemed evasive answers.
After the meeting, Republican members criticized the DFL — which controls the Senate 34-33 — for giving members short notice to submit proposals. 
“Democrats have repeatedly been shooting or voting our ideas down,” Sen. Eric Lucero, R-Saint Michael, told reporters after the meeting.
Sen. Keri Heintzeman, R-Nisswa, said the testimony from the parents of children shot in the Annunciation attack had not changed her opposition to an assault weapons ban.
Chad Kuyper, co-lead of the Minnesota Chapter of Moms Demand Action, released a statement after the meeting, excoriating Republicans for inaction: “Minnesotans are literally begging lawmakers to come to the table and help craft real solutions to our gun violence crisis – and Republicans won’t even bother to try.”

Those charges have since been dismissed by the Lansing 54-A District Court, a move that Nessel said was the wrong decision and now has her contemplating an appeal.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXTwo of the defense attorneys on the case appeared before the House Oversight Subcommittee on the Weaponization of State Government on Wednesday, arguing that Nessel, a Democrat, had sought to secure convictions against the group on political grounds. One of the attorneys announced his intention to file Freedom of Information Act requests with Nessel’s office to determine the costs of pursuing the case.
The subcommittee’s chair, state Rep. Angela Rigas (R-Caledonia), said she might do the same.
Nessel has faced heavy criticism from Michigan Republicans for pursuing charges in several cases linked to President Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election and false assertions that the election – which Trump lost by more than 7 million votes – was rigged against him.
While Nessel first announced charges in the false electors case in 2023, the charges were dismissed last week, with Lansing 54-A District Court Judge Kristen Simmons. She determined there was insufficient evidence to prove the 15 individuals, who were alleged to have committed forgery and conspiracy crimes, had acted with criminal intent when they signed documents certifying Michigan’s electoral votes for Trump.
Judge: Alleged Michigan Republican false electors will not face trial

Simmons’ decision sparked celebration from Republicans across the state, who viewed the decision as a vindication of the 15 defendants. However, Nessel and her office retain the right to appeal the decision.
“While my office reviews a potential appeal of the District Court’s opinion in this matter, I find it important following today’s demonstration to note that, at no point has any judge or jury found these defendants not guilty,” Nessel said in an emailed statement. “Plainly, none of these defendants have ever even denied the conduct supporting these criminal charges – that they signed the fraudulent certificate of electors. The Court claimed, instead, that these defendants were insufficiently ‘savvy or sophisticated enough’ to understand the electoral process, to understand their role in this plot to overturn the 2020 election. Ignorance of the law is no excuse, and neither is just plain ignorance.” 
During Wednesday’s hearing, attorney Kevin Kijewski maintained that his client, Clifford Frost, and other so-called “alternate electors” acted on the collective belief that their actions were lawful, and protected by the First Amendment. 
“This was not some type of hidden or clandestine plot hatched in the shadows.” Kijewski argued. “It was a transparent, precautionary measure rooted in historical precedent.” 
Kijewski pointed to the 1960 election between former presidents John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon, where Democratic electors in Hawaii met, signed and submitted certificates casting the state’s electoral votes for Kennedy while the state was in the midst of a recount, despite initial results showing Nixon had won.

However, a report from Politico notes that the recount ultimately turned out in Kennedy’s favor, with the governor of Hawaii certifying and transmitting a new set of electoral certificates, signed by the same Democrats who submitted the previous document. Additionally, Nixon, who was then serving as vice president, obtained unanimous consent to adopt the new slate, despite it arriving past the deadline, meaning Congress never weighed in on the validity of the unofficial Democratic slate.
Several of the defense attorneys on the case used the Kennedy example as a way to absolve their clients of wrong doing during several lengthy preliminary examinations before Simmons, which were used to determine probable cause – or lack thereof.










This was not some type of hidden or clandestine plot hatched in the shadows. It was a transparent, precautionary measure rooted in historical precedent.


Nicholas Somberg, the attorney for former Michigan Republican Party Co-Chair Meshawn Maddock, told the committee he planned to FOIA Nessel’s office to uncover the full cost of the investigation and prosecution of the case. 
“The people of Michigan deserve to know how much money was wasted on what amounted to a political vendetta,” Somberg said. 
Rigas told Somberg to save his money.
“I will be making that request,” Rigas said. “I know that they’re very expensive and I’m sure that the amount of documents regarding this case, going back two years, has got to be very, very, very thick.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Treg Taylor, the former Alaska attorney general, is running for governor, he announced Wednesday morning.
“I have a four-and-a-half-year proven record as the attorney general of fighting crime, fighting Biden, and fighting for Alaska,” he said by phone.
In a campaign video and written statement, Taylor promoted himself as a “fearless conservative” who is the best successor to incumbent Gov. Mike Dunleavy, who is term-limited and unable to run for another four years in office.
Taylor is the 10th Republican and 11th candidate overall to enter the 2026 Alaska governor’s race. 
The lone non-Republican in the race is former state Sen. Tom Begich, an Anchorage Democrat. 
The other Republicans are Anchorage business owner Bernadette Wilson; former state Sen. Click Bishop of Fairbanks; former Alaska Revenue Commissioner Adam Crum; current state Sen. Shelley Hughes of Palmer, Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom of Eagle River; Matanuska-Susitna Borough Mayor Edna DeVries; podiatrist Matt Heilala of Anchorage; former teacher James William Parkin IV of Angoon; and Bruce Walden of Palmer.
“That is a ridiculous number of people in the race,” Taylor said when asked how he distinguishes himself from the other Republicans. “My answer is that I am the only candidate that has a proven record of fighting on behalf of Alaska. When I was the attorney general for four and a half years, I fought crime, I fought Biden, I fought for Alaska’s economic future. I’ve been heavily involved with the Trump administration. I helped draft Trump’s first day Executive Order unleashing Alaska’s extraordinary resource potential. And I’ve worked hard with the Trump administration, with (Department of the Interior), (Department of Justice), to see fulfillment of that executive order, which is going to push Alaska’s economic future.”
Asked about his campaign plans, Taylor said, “over the next few months, I’ll be hard at work, visiting with groups, visiting with individuals, working up support, fundraising. Obviously, I think the biggest tell in this race is going to be when everybody divulges their fundraising and our goal is to be at the top of that list, and I think we’ve got a good plan for getting there.”
Taylor, a longtime attorney with a degree from the Brigham Young University law school, worked in private practice and for Arctic Slope Regional Corp. before joining the Alaska Department of Law in 2018. He was head of the department’s civil division in 2021 when Dunleavy picked him as attorney general following the resignations of two other men amid sexual misconduct scandals.
Taylor, who has never held publicly elected office before, ran unsuccessfully for the Anchorage School Board in 2011 and for that city’s Assembly in 2016.
Taylor’s entry into the governor’s race marks an unusually early start for an Alaska campaign. Eight years ago, when now-Gov. Dunleavy launched his campaign in July 2017, he was the first high-profile candidate to challenge then-Gov. Bill Walker. This time around, three candidates had entered the race before June. 
While the race is unusually crowded, additional candidates are still possible. Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski has not ruled out a campaign, and a run by former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, a Democrat, is also possible.

A U.S. District Court last month rejected the lawsuit for the second time against Kappa Kappa Gamma for welcoming a transgender woman. 
The post UW sorority sisters will appeal their lawsuit’s dismissal, again appeared first on WyoFile .","A federal lawsuit against a University of Wyoming sorority for admitting a transgender woman appears headed to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals for the second time. 
On Wednesday, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal, signaling their intention to reverse U.S. District Court Judge Alan B. Johnson’s dismissal of their lawsuit last month. 
In 2023, six Kappa Kappa Gamma members, including Jayln Westenbroek, Hannah Holtmeier, Allison Coghan, Grace Choate, Madeline Ramar and Megan Kosar, sued the sorority for allegedly breaking its bylaws, breaching housing contracts and misleading sisters when it admitted student Artemis Langford. 
Johnson dismissed their suit for the first time in August 2023, ruling the court couldn’t interfere in how a private organization admits members. Later that year, the plaintiffs tried to appeal, but the higher court rejected the case on the grounds that the district court’s ruling did not amount to a final decision. 
However, since Johnson ruled “with prejudice” last month, the appeals court will be dealing with a final ruling this time, making it more likely for a decision to rest on the merits of a case and less on procedure. 
After the appeals court tossed the case, the legal complaint went unresolved for several months before Johnson set a deadline earlier this year for the plaintiffs to refile or his ruling would convert to a final judgment. 
In June, a new set of plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, dropping Langford as a defendant and omitting earlier allegations that Johnson described as “unbefitting in federal court.” 
That same month, the Trump administration announced it would investigate UW for alleged Title IX violations stemming from the case. The U.S. Department of Education, which handles such investigations, has not given an update since then, and when a WyoFile reporter called the agency’s press office Wednesday, an automated message said its “information resource center is temporarily closed.” 
Johnson dismissed the case in August, almost two years to the day after he first rejected the case. His reasoning was much the same as in 2023, when he ruled that the sorority has the freedom as a private organization to decide who it wants to admit as members, including transgender women. 
“In short, we are required to leave Kappa alone,” Johnson ruled in 2025. 
The plaintiffs now have a limited time to file their appeal. The appellate case had not yet been opened by publishing time, according to the public docket.

As the state attempts to provide clarity for those who will lose benefits, advocates say the Vermont food assistance network is under increasing pressure.

State officials on Monday released a plan for rolling out new federal rules that will reshape Vermont’s 3SquaresVT food assistance program, including provisions that will protect some affected households from losing benefits until February. 
The changes, mandated after the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July, take effect Oct. 1, and will bring new limitations for work requirements, noncitizen eligibility, utility allowances and outreach programs.
The majority of Vermonters enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, will not see changes to their benefits, save for standard annual adjustments for household costs, officials said. But as the state attempts to provide clarity for those who will lose benefits, advocates say the food assistance network is under increasing pressure.
For Ivy Enoch, director of policy and advocacy at Hunger Free Vermont, the details of Monday’s outline came largely as expected. 
“What’s surprising to us about these changes is that they were passed at all in the (federal) budget reconciliation bill back in July,” Enoch said.

The upper age limit for SNAP proof-of-work requirements will increase to 64 for many people without dependents who are able to work, and an exemption for parents and guardians will only apply to those with children under 14, rather than 18. Individuals experiencing homelessness will also no longer be exempt from that work requirement; Monday’s report estimated roughly 1,603 people will be affected by that change. Veterans and young adults who have aged out of foster care will also no longer be exempt, though fewer than a dozen in each group will be affected according to the report.
The Department for Children and Families and the Agency of Human Services said in Monday’s report that because of state exemptions and a federal policy that provides a grace period, work requirement changes shouldn’t cause people to lose benefits before February.
“It’s important time,” said Enoch, calling the state’s temporary respite from the “harmful and punitive” work requirements “the right thing to do.”
“DCF is utilizing its discretion to ensure that 3SquaresVT recipients are not negatively impacted by the work requirement until … November 1,” read Monday’s report. 
On that day, a federal policy that allows each financially eligible adult three months of benefits — regardless of other barriers like the work requirement — every three years resets its calendar. That three-month buffer will be usable immediately, carrying affected households through to February if they choose.
“What we were able to do is to give us more time, and give Vermonters time to engage with us,” said Miranda Gray, the deputy commissioner of the Department for Children and Families’ Economic Services Division.
The timeline has been difficult to manage, Gray said, as has the unusual absence of immediate guidance. 
“They don’t have answers to everything yet,” she said of federal SNAP officials.
Gray said her department had been reviewing the SNAP eligibility of noncitizens in a process that concluded Wednesday. In some 1,523 relevant cases, noncitizen households may be denied benefits beginning Oct. 1 if they are not members of certain protected groups. Refugees and asylees outside these groups are no longer eligible for food stamps.
The Standard Utility Allowance, or “Heat and Eat” policy, will likewise change Oct. 1, with households only allowed to claim utility costs to obtain more SNAP benefits if they include older adults or disabled members.
Federal funding for SNAP State Outreach through the Vermont food assistance network will be reduced in fall 2026, when federal matching grants to at least 10 organizations across the state to provide application assistance and other services will be halved.
“I think it’s leaving a hole,” Gray said. “I think it will be something that we certainly are talking about this legislative session.”
Hunger Free Vermont is a recipient of the affected outreach program. Apart from putting pressure on the organization’s programming, Enoch said, it’s a big ask financially for nonprofits to front significant costs in a grant landscape that’s becoming less stable.
“Partners are incurring more risk in continuing to participate in this grant,” she said. “Private charity can’t make up for this loss of government spending.”
Roughly half of the affected organizations administering SNAP State Outreach programs are Area Agencies on Aging — nonprofits that connect older Vermonters with resources like food stamps, transportation and health care. Mary Hayden, executive director of the Vermont Association of Area Agencies on Aging, said the SNAP State Outreach had been critical in helping older people navigate complex applications and requirements.
“I’m really concerned,” Hayden said. “Will eligible people, including older Vermonters, disabled Vermonters … not be able to benefit from the program because they couldn’t get the assistance they needed to sign up properly?”
The federal reduction is part of a larger body of cost-sharing changes that will see Vermont shoulder 75% of the significant administrative costs of SNAP — up from half. Beginning next fall, these changes could add $8.4 million to the state’s obligation, according to Monday’s report.
It’s “really important that we don’t waver on the fact that SNAP or 3SquaresVT really matters,” Enoch said. “It is our most effective food security program.”
Households affected by new federal rule changes should receive notifications by mail this month. 
“Please open it, review it, and call us if you need to,” Gray said.

Martin Heinrich (D-NM) on Wednesday took to the floor of the U.S. Senate to call on New Mexicans to submit comments on a Trump administration proposal to rescind a policy preventing road construction and logging in wild spaces.
About 1.6 million acres, or about 2,500 square miles, in national forests in New Mexico are currently protected under the so-called federal Roadless Rule.
By the #s: Nearly a quarter of the Gila is protected as ‘roadless.’ Those protections could be nixed

U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins first announced the Trump administration’s plans to repeal the rule  in June at the Western Governors’ Association meeting in New Mexico’s capital city in June, and said the move would help restart logging in federal forests and reduce wildfires.
“The heavy hand of Washington will no longer inhibit the management of our nation’s forests,” she said.
Environmental groups opposing the repeal, and Heinrich on Wednesday, pushed back on that claim, saying that roads increase wildfires, rather than reducing them, noting that 88% of all fires are human started and more than 90% occur within a half mile of roadways, according to USDA research.
“The bottom line is that when we build new roads in protected areas, we risk more fires, not fewer,” Heinrich said.
The USDA opened public comment at the end of August and will close it on Friday, Sept. 19.
Heinrich urged the U.S. Forest Service officials to extend the public comment period, and for New Mexicans to “have their voices heard on the issue.”
Heinrich said the rule’s repeal is being rushed through, and is ignoring the work of scientists and other staff in the U.S. Forest Service.
He said the wild spaces afforded by the rule creates prime habitat for fish and wildlife, citing his own experiences hunting elk or angling trout.
“This is being imposed…by people in the White House, who frankly have never harvested a bull elk or [caught and] released a native trout, or otherwise experienced the wonder of God’s creation in the very lands that represent the anvil on which our nation’s character was forged,” Heinrich said. “The truth is that the roadless rule protects us from wildfires, it ensures clean drinking water for communities, and it sustains wildlife habitat for wildlife and for sportsmen.”

Ryan Chamberlin from the House Floor, courtesy of the Florida House of RepresentativesAfter months of demands from the Florida governor’s office to slice property taxes, a Belleview Republican announced Tuesday his three-part plan to phase them out.
Rep. Ryan Chamberlin, from Marion County, serving his second term, revealed his “Freedom 1,2,3” proposal to reporters during a Zoom press conference. The move came months after Gov. Ron DeSantis first pressured state lawmakers to eliminate the tax.
The demand set the stage for a tax-cut feud between DeSantis and House Speaker Daniel Perez during the 2025 legislative session; Perez wanted to focus instead on slashing the state sales tax.
“If we do this, no one’s gonna be able to touch us. And we will be the first state in the country to take a dramatic step toward eliminating the most hated tax in America,” Chamberlin, 51, said Tuesday, noting that property taxes statewide have risen by more than 45% since 2019.
Chamberlin’s first point involves legislation to roll property tax rates back to where they were in 2022. He acknowledged that much of his proposal could be subject to change pending further debate but, for now, he wants to eliminate roughly $34 billion of the $43 billion levied through county school and non-school property taxes.
This would mirror 2007’s property tax rollback under then-Speaker Marco Rubio, which forced rates down to reflect the 2006-2007 fiscal year’s levels before the voters approved a constitutional amendment expanding homestead exemptions and capping assessment increases on non-homesteaded properties. It came in direct response to the then-looming 2008 housing crisis, which saw a major market downturn ahead of a crashing stock market.
‘Political risk’
Once the new rollback removes a slew of property tax revenue, Chamberlin acknowledged, something will have to be done to replace the lost money — traditionally used to fund firefighters, public schools, and other crucial services statewide. This is where “2 and 3” of “Freedom 1,2,3” come in, said Chamberlin, a former consultant and entrepreneur.
He’s proposing a 5% transaction fee on real estate sales, which he says could generate roughly $12 billion a year; a 5% transaction fee on rideshares, hotels, and amusement parks as a “travelers’ fee” to create $3.8 billion in lost revenue; and a 3-cent sales fee going specifically to schools to spawn at least $20 billion to replace the “required local effort” of school property taxes. That money would be collected against purchases in a county and redistributed depending on how many students are in each school.
Chamberlin said he knows this won’t be received well by everyone. Republicans have traditionally opposed raising taxes and, although DeSantis has been chief among Floridian politicos calling for a solution to property tax rates, he also vowed not to sign any tax increases — even if it’s to supplement lost income. DeSantis instead offered a more vague interim proposal involving a $1,000 rebate to homeowners.
“There is a political risk for me or anyone else who rolls out an actual plan, because immediately, there’s going to be those who organize opposition,” Chamberlin said, noting that although many people may try to “poke holes” in his plan, he welcomes the discussion. “It’s easy to talk about doing something about property taxes without ever getting specific about doing anything about it. But I’m convinced that we must have a starting point.”
The loud debate yet lack of action surrounding property taxes dominated the 2025 session. DeSantis and Perez, a Miami Republican, battled over which tax should be cut. Ultimately, the Legislature approved a $1.3 million tax cut package and Perez created a committee to research the best way to lower costs for homeowners while ensuring state-funded facilities could still operate.
Chamberlin, who’s a member of the House’s 37-member property tax committee, insisted that his plan is not affiliated with DeSantis, the property tax committee, or anyone besides himself.
Still, he mentioned that he’d had recent conversations with the governor, former House Speaker — and GOP gubernatorial candidate — Paul Renner, Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia, Lt. Gov. Jay Collins, and state Sen. Stan McClain — the former House Ways and Means chairman — on cutting property taxes.
The governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment.

Roberts wrote in a letter posted to Facebook on Wednesday that the posts were “completely at odds” with the university’s code of conduct.
“Actions that endorse, glorify or trivialize violence undermines that responsibility, have no place at Auburn and fall short of the community of respect and integrity that we work hard each day to uphold,” he wrote.

While it is not known if the employees fired were faculty, the Auburn University Faculty Handbook states when professors write or speak about “matters of public interest as well as matters related to professional duties and the functioning of the University, they should be free from institutional censorship or discipline.” The handbook also says it should be made clear that faculty members are not speaking for the university.
The announcement came after U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Alabama, made a series of Facebook posts demanding the firing of educators who “mocked” the death of right-wing activist and talk radio host Charlie Kirk. Tuberville thanked Auburn University for terminating their employees.
“Thank you, Auburn University, for taking action and FIRING these sick people who mocked the assassination of Charlie Kirk. They have NO PLACE in our state’s public education system,” Tuberville wrote on Facebook.
Kirk was a right-wing political commentator, host of a radio talk show and founder of Turning Point USA, a nonprofit organization that encourages conservative politics on high school, college and university campuses. 
Among other activities, Turning Point maintains a database known as the Professor Watchlist, which Kirk in 2016 said was intended to “expose” professors the organization accused of promoting “anti-American values” and advancing “leftist propaganda in the classroom.” The organization has been accused of leaving college professors open to harassment. 
Auburn University officials did not have a comment on if any professors from the university were targeted by the watchlist. 
Roberts said in the letter that employees who condone or promote violence can be suspended or have other personnel actions taken against them and campus should be a place where everyone is accepted.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Federal prosecutor cites cooperation of 3 men in Vermont murder-for-hire case while seeking sentencing breaks.","A federal prosecutor is recommending less than the maximum prison sentences for three men who testified against the California biomedical researcher convicted of masterminding a murder-for-hire plot that led to the death of a business rival in Vermont. 
Court documents, which were filed this week ahead of hearings set for next week in federal court in Burlington, lay out the arguments a prosecutor plans to make in support of the amount of time behind bars he will be seeking for the men, who already reached plea deals in the case.
The plea deals included separate proposed maximum sentences each of the men could face for their role in the deadly scheme that resulted in the fatal shooting in January 2018 of 49-year-old Gregory Davis of Danville. 
The prosecutor cited the cooperation the three men provided to investigators to explain why he would not be seeking the maximum time behind bars from Judge Christina Reiss. 
Each of the three men spent days on the witness stand during Serhat Gumrukcu’s five-week trial that ended in April, when the jury returned guilty verdicts against him on several charges, including murder for hire. 
Gumrukcu, a Turkish national, was working in Los Angeles as an entrepreneur and biomedical researcher at the time of his arrest in May 2022. Prosecutors argued during the trial 
that Gumrukcu ordered and paid for Davis to be killed over a failed oil trading deal between the two men. 
Gumrukcu, according to prosecutors, feared that Davis would go to authorities and accuse him of fraud, jeopardizing a much larger biomedical deal Gumrukcu had in the works in which he stood to gain millions.  
His attorneys contended during the trial that Gumrukcu’s co-defendants were testifying against him, and telling prosecutors what they wanted to hear, in large part to reduce their own time in prison when it came to sentencing. 
Gumrukcu, 42, faces a mandatory minimum sentence of life in prison when he is sentenced next week. Reiss said at a hearing this week that the actual imposition of that sentence may be delayed, though Gumrukcu is certain to be sentenced to life in prison.
The sentencing for the other defendants are expected to take place Thursday Sept. 25, and Friday, Sept. 26.
“The murder-for-hire conspiracy that took the life of Gregory Davis is unconscionable,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Zachary Stendig, the prosecutor, wrote in a sentencing filing.
“The killing of Davis was planned and premeditated,” Stendig added. “Gregory Davis’s death was a brutal, execution style, killing of a father of six (Davis’s wife was pregnant with their seventh child at the time of his death).”
Based on the plea deals, each of the men are facing varying amounts of prison time.

‘Motivated by greed’
Berk Eratay, also a Turkish national who had been living in Las Vegas, was a longtime friend of Gumrukcu. Prosecutors have described Eratay as a go-between, connecting Gumrukcu with people who could kill Davis after their business deal soured.
“It was Eratay who helped set the chain of events in motion, in short, because of his personal and business relationship with Serhat Gumrukcu and the problems they faced due to their business dispute with Davis,” Stendig wrote in his filing. 
“Eratay and Gumrukcu were motivated by greed,” the prosecutor added. “So, they committed an unforgivable crime.” 
Eratay, 38, has pleaded guilty to charges of murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and conspiracy to launder money. As part of the plea agreement, prosecutors agreed to not request a prison sentence of more than 25 years for Eratay. 
According to court filings this week, a prosecutor wrote he will be seeking a 10-year prison term for Eratay. His attorney, in a separate filing, has asked for a lighter prison sentence of not more than five years.
The prosecutor and his defense attorneys in their filings both cited Eratay’s cooperation and testimony as playing a critical role in the jury returning guilty verdicts against Gumrukcu following a five-week trial. 
Stendig wrote that there were also mitigating factors in Eratay’s favor when it came to sentencing, including his lack of a previous criminal record and his showing of “significant remorse” throughout the case. 
“To that end,” the prosecutor wrote of Eratay, “he wrote a letter expressing his contrition to Mr. Davis’s widow and he testified extensively about why he decided to cooperate with the federal government which was, in part, to try to right his previous wrong.” 
His attorneys wrote in their filing that their client has used his time behind bars since his arrest in 2022 to better himself by participating and completing programs and educational offerings while incarcerated. 
Eratay’s lawyers also highlighted his role in aiding Gumrukcu’s prosecution, including providing “extensive testimony” during Gumrukcu’s trial.
“Mr. Eratay spent a vast number of hours in meetings with the government,” the defense filing stated. “He reviewed voluminous evidentiary material, often in Turkish, and he assisted the prosecutors in understanding the meaning and context of Gumrukcu’s communications and actions.”
The defense also submitted scores of letters from people who knew Eratay expressing their support for him, describing his character and relationships they have had with him. 
One friend wrote about Eratay’s background as a magician in Turkey, where he won a national television competition show in that country for his skills in the craft. It was also through magic that Eratay bonded with Gumrukcu, who had also performed as a magician in Turkey.
“He has always gone out of his way to uplift friends, to make them feel seen and valued,” the friend wrote of Eratay in the letter. “Berk has been an active member of the global magic community — a group of quirky, passionate performers who still believe in wonder and connection.”

The first cooperator 
Aron Lee Ethridge, formerly of Henderson, Nevada, and a friend of Eratay, recruited the eventual hitman to carry out Davis’ fatal shooting in Vermont, according to charging documents.
He pleaded guilty to charges of murder for hire and conspiracy to kidnap with death resulting. Under the plea agreement, Ethridge could have been sentenced to up to 27 years behind bars, and his attorneys could seek a lesser prison term.
The prosecutor and his defense attorney, in court filings, both asked the judge to impose a sentence of 12½ years.
Ethridge, 45, was the first of the defendants in the case to plead guilty and cooperate with the prosecution.
“Aron has accepted total responsibility for his actions since his arrest,” attorney Mark Kaplan, representing Ethridge, wrote in his filing. “Aron has never made any excuses for his involvement in this serious crime and has done everything possible to show his remorse.” 
Stendig, the prosecutor, wrote in his filing that when investigators first approached Ethridge in April 2022, he denied involvement in the murder-for-hire plot. 
“Two days later, Ethridge called police back and tearfully confessed. He then arranged a self-surrender to FBI in Burlington and followed through with that plan,” Stendig wrote. “He was the first cooperator in this case and was uniquely situated as he personally interacted with all three of his co-conspirators.”
While asking for more than a dozen years in prison for Ethridge, Stendig wrote that Ethridge’s crimes were not the result of an accident.
“Rather, the defendant’s actions appear to have been motivated by his own greed,” the prosecutor wrote. “Ethridge was motivated entirely by money which he blew on drugs.”

Murdered for the ‘Turkish prince’
Jerry Banks, formerly of Fort Garland, Colorado, traveled to Danville on Jan. 6, 2018, knocked on the door of Davis’ home in Danville, and while pretending to be a U.S. marshal, told Davis he was under arrest for racketeering, according to prosecutors. Banks then drove Davis away and shot and killed him in a pull off along the road only a few miles from his home, court records stated.
Banks, 37, pleaded guilty to three counts for his role in the killing: murder for hire, conspiracy to kidnap and money laundering. He could have been sentenced to life in prison. 
Stendig, the prosecutor, recommended a 20-year prison term for Banks, who previously worked as a detention officer for a sheriff’s department in Colorado.
“Significantly, Banks shot Davis in the back more than ten times,” Stendig wrote in his filing. “The nature and circumstances of this offense are truly heinous.” 
Stendig also wrote that there were mitigating circumstances in Bank’s background, including a “limited criminal history” as well as no disciplinary infractions since he was arrested and jailed in 2022.
“Banks has also struggled with substance abuse and myriad mental and emotional health challenges,” the prosecutor wrote. 
Stendig also wrote about Banks’ important role in Gumrukcu’s prosecution.
“The most important part of his testimony against Gumrukcu was corroborating testimony of Aron Ethridge, and Banks’s unequivocal statement that he committed the murder for hire on behalf of ‘the Turkish Prince,’” Stendig wrote. 
“Gumrukcu held himself out to be a prince,” the prosecutor added, “and this was a powerful piece of evidence against Gumrukcu.”

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Death row inmate Roy Lee Ward declined to meet one-on-one with the Indiana Parole Board, saying he wanted to spare the family of his victim from traveling to the state prison in Michigan City for the interview.
Ward’s attorney, Joanna Green, also added that Ward’s autism spectrum disorder diagnosis — which is detailed in the inmate’s clemency filings — “makes it difficult for him to effectively communicate, especially to convey his feelings of remorse.”
Indiana Department of Correction spokesperson Annie Goeller said in a statement Wednesday that Ward “does not wish to be interviewed by the Parole Board as part of his clemency request.” The inmate is scheduled to be executed Oct. 10 at the Indiana State Prison.

State officials canceled the hearing — previously set for Friday — and will convene Monday at the Indiana Government Center in Indianapolis, where Ward’s attorneys and representatives from the Indiana Attorney General’s office will present arguments.
That hearing was already scheduled and is also when the public can weigh in.
Green, told the Indiana Capital Chronicle the decision was motivated by Ward’s desire to ease the burden on the family of 15-year-old Stacy Payne, who Ward murdered in 2001.
“Roy did not want Stacy Payne’s family to feel compelled to travel to Michigan City for the clemency interview,” Green said. “He wanted to spare them that.”
Green said the defense team still plans to argue Ward’s case before the board on Monday.
“We plan to make a presentation to the Board Monday morning but are still solidifying our plan in the midst of our other legal filings,” she said.
Ward’s clemency petition is one of the final steps available to avoid his death sentence.
The Parole Board hears arguments from attorneys, victims’ families and execution supporters before issuing a recommendation to the governor.
The governor alone has the power to commute a death sentence to life in prison, grant a reprieve or deny clemency altogether.
Earlier this year, the board followed the same process for another death row inmate, Benjamin Ritchie, ahead of his scheduled execution. Following several hours of hearings, the parole board ultimately — unanimously — recommended against clemency for Benjamin Ritchie, and Gov. Mike Braun allowed his execution to proceed.
Ward has been on Indiana’s death row for more than two decades. He pleaded guilty to Payne’s murder but has long sought to avoid execution, citing both legal challenges and concerns tied to his mental health.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/17/uconn-avery-point/,"Investments in housing and academics at UConn's Avery Point campus are needed to supply workers for the region's industries, lawmakers said.","Investments in housing and new academic programs at the University of Connecticut’s Avery Point campus in Groton are necessary to supply the growing manufacturing and energy industries in the region with a much-needed workforce, lawmakers from Southeastern Connecticut told the university’s board of trustees on Wednesday.
Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, told the board that the campus was being “neglected.” 
She said Avery Point needs to expand its majors to include engineering and studies related to energy, and that the school needs to invest in housing. 
“These are things that I would say need to happen, and not in a strategic plan that is going to happen in 10 years, because it’ll be too late. Then you’ll have successfully starved our satellite campus,” said Osten.

Discussions around building housing at Avery Point have been occurring for over a year. In July 2024, UConn announced that it had issued a “Request for Expressions of Interest” for companies who could build housing for 150 to 250 students at Avery Point. The location identified is across from the athletic facility and would include dining and health services. 
“Avery Point students and their families consistently tell UConn how much they love the campus, but the lack of housing has been a barrier to increasing its enrollment — especially since rentals have become more expensive and scarce in the region amid hiring booms at major employers,” the announcement read. 
The new dorm is expected to cost $50 million. 
UConn Spokesperson Stephanie Reitz told CT Mirror that the University was in discussions with a “preferred developer” about the project but that nothing had been finalized yet.

Sen. Heather Somers, R-Groton, said at the Wednesday meeting that she’d met a man years ago on a plane who said he chose to send his son to the University of Rhode Island rather than Avery Point because of the lack of housing. According to data from UConn, roughly 200 to 250 student applicants who meet target demographics choose a regional competitor annually over UConn-Avery Point.
Rep. Aundré Bumgardner, D-Groton, added that the lack of housing for students put pressure on the local housing stock, where there was already a shortage. He mentioned the investments that UConn had put into building housing on its other regional campuses, particularly Stamford. 
UConn has been purchasing apartment buildings to house students at the fast-expanding Stamford campus, at times displacing local residents as a result. And this year, UConn began for the first time to lease apartments in Hartford for students at its campus in the state capital. In a July letter to the board of trustees, lawmakers mentioned recent investments in the other three regional campuses, including $10 million to expand the campus in Waterbury and a $3.5 million grant for housing in Hartford. 
In June, the board of trustees met to discuss appropriating $3 million toward the project but ended up postponing the vote, they said, until the university is able to draw up a full strategic plan for the campus. 
The decision greatly upset lawmakers from the region, who in their July letter to the board of trustees said they were “disheartened and concerned” by the delay. 
But the Groton campus’ finances are on shaky ground, and it’s not clear whether the state is willing to foot the bill for an expansion. 
UConn’s only regional campus without significant housing options, Avery Point’s enrollment has plunged by 40% over the past decade, dropping to 409 students this fall. And it’s projected to fall further, to 393 by 2027.
Correspondingly, the branch campus’ operating budget has lost an average of $13 million annually since 2022.
According to a presentation for state lawmakers in August, the addition of new pathways in engineering and business, as well as academic support for students at the campus, will cost UConn about $9.5 million annually. 
The Lamont administration was noncommittal when asked about new state investments — beyond what’s already provided — to make the Avery Point campus competitive. 
“The administration has not had discussions regarding the addition of housing at Avery Point,” said Chris Collibee, the governor’s budget spokesman.
Collibee added that UConn has the option to issue its own bonds and borrow funds for a new dormitory, which it then could repay through housing, dining and other student service fees.
But to encourage more students to attend Avery Point, UConn must be careful setting fee levels. University officials warned fees may not be enough even to cover the full cost of running the dormitory, dining and other services, adding there could be an annual loss ranging from $274,000 to $1.35 million.
Rep. Gregory Haddad, D-Mansfield, co-chairman of the legislature’s Higher Education and Employment Advancement Committee, said that Connecticut could scale back its savings efforts very modestly and make significant investments in public colleges and universities. The state currently has surpluses that have averaged more than $1.8 billion, or 8% to 9% of the General Fund, over the past eight years. 
“I think Avery Point is a gem of a campus,” Haddad said, adding that “I think we need a greater commitment from the [Lamont] administration to higher education writ large.”
Rep. Vincent Candelora, R-Branford, told CT Mirror it made sense to look at funding for housing at Avery Point but said he didn’t want to change the state spending caps, which regulate what percentage of the budget the state is required to set aside. He said the board of trustees could make decisions about how it used its state block grant and what it wanted to invest in and that it already had a structure for investing in capital projects through the UConn 2000 bond program.  
Somers said she believed it wouldn’t be necessary to even discuss modifying the state’s fiscal guardrails. She said smart investments in Avery Point, including investments in the dormitories, would pay for themselves. She noted that every other satellite campus had received state investment, and those investments had resulted in higher enrollments. 
Lawmakers also commented on the vast workforce demands on the eastern side of the state and how Avery Point could fill those needs. 
Osten pointed out that Eastern Connecticut was home to General Dynamics Electric Boat, among the largest private-sector employers in Connecticut, which employs roughly 24,000 workers between its main site in Groton and its fabrication facility in Quonset Point, R.I. 
She underscored that the employers in the area provide blue-collar jobs that pay a living wage. Electric Boat, for example, offers jobs with a starting annual salary of $60,000 plus benefits. 
“It’s very important for us to recognize that more than 400 subcontractors are in Connecticut, with more than 100 being in the eastern part of the state. And those people need workers that you all will be graduating,” she said. 
U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, told CT Mirror that the need for housing on the Groton branch campus is “blindingly obvious,” particularly in light of recent defense contract awards for fast-attack submarines that are projected to drive Electric Boat’s employment to nearly 33,000 workers by the early 2030s. 
“There’s a slew of new engineering projects that are already part of the Navy’s shipbuilding plans,” said Courtney, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee.
In a letter to UConn President Randeka Maric last January, Courtney underscored a tri-country partnership among the U.S., Australia and the U.K. focused on security and advanced technologies. 
“Expanding the engineering, business, and other four-year degrees offered at Avery Point will enable more young people in our region to fill these critically important job positions,” Courtney wrote. 
Somers said that she’d like to see Avery Point expand its offerings not only to engineering but to business and hospitality, since Eastern Connecticut is home to Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods casinos.
“We can’t hire people in that industry, whether it’s hotel management, business application, restaurant entrepreneurship — there’s nothing available for that,” she said. 
She said the university needed to recognize Avery Point’s unique assets, including its location on the Long Island Sound, and to align its offerings with the needs of local industries and the community. 
“ I encourage you, I actually implore you, to view Avery Point not as a cost center but as a high potential asset that has been undervalued and underinvested,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Osten-II-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-17 18:01:01.063458

Board records show that in 2017, nurse Renee Nesbitt of Urbandale, first licensed in 2009, entered the Iowa Nurse Assistance program, which assists professionals with alcohol and drug issues. According to the board, she then moved to Minnesota where, in 2020, her license was suspended due to noncompliance with that state’s “alternative to discipline” program.
Nesbitt then moved back to Iowa and reentered the Iowa Nurse Assistance Program. According to the board, she subsequently failed to comply with conditions of participation in that program. Although the board has not disclosed how or when that occurred, the board has noted that the program required Nesbitt’s abstinence from alcohol and the use of a worksite monitor.
As a result of that issue, the board in 2022 allowed Nesbitt to continue practicing but placed her license on probation for two years.
In January 2024, the board charged Nesbitt with violating the terms of her probation by testing positive for alcohol use on Aug. 9, 2023. In March 2024, Nesbitt agreed to surrender her Iowa license.
On April 10, 2025, Nesbitt applied for reinstatement of her license. Ten weeks later, the board issued a preliminary notice indicating it intended to deny the application. Nesbitt has appealed that decision and a hearing on the matter is now scheduled for Oct. 9, 2025.
Board to deny reinstatement of second nurse’s license
In a separate case, the board has informed Tara Sheets of Pleasantville that it intends to deny her application for reinstatement of her nursing license.
In January 2023, the board charged Sheets with excessive use of alcohol that could impair her ability to practice, alleging that in May 2022, Sheets had entered a residential treatment program for alcohol use. In September 2023, Sheets voluntarily surrendered her license.
In March 2025, Sheets applied for reinstatement of her license. Twelve weeks later, the board issued a preliminary notice indicating it intended to deny the application. Sheets then appealed that decision. A hearing on the matter is now scheduled for Oct. 9, 2025.



Dentist seeks license reinstatement
The Iowa Dental Board has informed a former West Des Moines dentist previously accused of incompetence of its intent to reject her application for reinstatement of her license.
In May 2016, the board charged Steffany Mohan with failure to maintain a reasonably satisfactory standard of competency in the practice of dentistry, specifically with regard to dental implants. The matter was settled in March 2017 when Mohan agreed to halt any dental-implant work and have her license placed on indefinite probation.
The restriction on dental-implant work was lifted October 2018. According to the board, Mohan opted to voluntarily discontinue all clinical work in 2020 and to have her license placed on “inactive” status.
Since then, Mohan has apparently applied for reinstatement of her license. Although the available board documents don’t indicate when that application was made, the board states that on July 21, 2025, it issued Mohan a notice of its intent to deny her application.
A hearing on the matter was scheduled for Aug. 22, 2025, although the board has yet to publish its final decision in the case.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/BON-1024x459.jpg,,,2025-09-17 18:01:01.063458

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The day after he announced he’s running for a third term as Minnesota governor, Tim Walz got a taste of what a Republican campaign could look like against him, as his administration faced withering questions about a now defunct state housing program that was so riddled with fraud that Walz moved to shut it down.
Last month, Department of Human Services Temporary Commissioner Shireen Gandhi asked the federal government for assistance in terminating the Housing Stabilization Services program, citing “credible allegations of fraud” and “exponential growth in spending.”
The program — which resides under the umbrella of the federal-state Medicaid program — was supposed to help older adults and people with disabilities find and maintain housing. Instead, costs ballooned suspiciously; in 2017, analysts expected the cost to be $2.6 million a year, but by 2024, it was $107 million.
The Republican-led House Fraud Prevention and State Agency Oversight Policy Committee was scheduled to meet Wednesday morning to question DHS officials about why they didn’t stop the fraud sooner.
Walz announced about 45 minutes prior to the committee hearing that he signed an executive order establishing a statewide Inspector General Coordinating Council led by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, though it’s unclear exactly what this council will do.
The second-term Democratic governor also touted various measures his administration has taken to prevent fraud, including more data-sharing across state agencies and installing an inspector general in DHS.
“We have no tolerance for fraud in the state of Minnesota,” Walz said in a statement. “Abuse of taxpayer dollars takes resources away from the people who need them most. If you commit fraud in Minnesota, you will be prosecuted and held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.”
The record says otherwise, however. Fraudsters have gamed state government — and federal programs administered by Minnesota — out of hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years, including the notorious Feeding Our Future scandal, the state’s autism program, a bevy of Medicaid schemes and now housing assistance.
Rep. Kristin Robbins, R-Maple Grove and chair of the fraud prevention committee, was skeptical of Walz’s executive order establishing the inspector general council because it’s not independent enough from the executive branch.
“Releasing this executive order just before today’s House Fraud Prevention and State Agency Oversight hearing appears more like a distraction than a solution,” Robbins said in a statement. “Our committee will continue pressing for accountability and real reforms to protect taxpayers and ensure state programs serve those truly in need.”
Robbins is running for governor as a GOP candidate and will likely use her perch for the next year to hammer Walz’s record on stopping fraud.
Also prior to the Wednesday hearing, Robbins said she received a call from Gandhi informing her that the assistant commissioner who oversaw Housing Stabilization Services is no longer employed with DHS. Robbins said the assistant commissioner was fired, but Gandhi quibbled with that assertion, saying instead “the appointment of our assistant commissioner has ended.”

DHS Inspector General James Clark testified during the hearing Wednesday that the agency has suspended payments to 115 providers in the housing program. Over six years, those providers billed the state about $100 million, Clark said.
Robbins grilled Gandhi and Clark about why DHS didn’t stop payments or detect fraudulent activity until KARE 11 reported about fraud in the program. In July, the FBI raided five Minnesota businesses that have received millions in Medicaid money for services they didn’t provide.
Clark said DHS has become more “aggressive” in combating fraud, stopping payments when signs of fraud occur and notifying law enforcement. Previous DHS protocol, he said, would have been to continue to provide payments to avoid tipping off the fraudsters.
Gandhi said the Housing Stabilization Services program, pending federal approval, is scheduled to terminate on Oct. 20.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/MG_9158-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-17 18:01:01.063458

Sept. 17, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceVice President JD Vance visited a rural Michigan stamping plant on Wednesday to tout the Trump administration’s efforts to restore manufacturing jobs in the nation.
But the vice president veered off in his 20-minute speech, most notably to suggest deploying federal troops to clamp down on crime in Detroit, even though the city has been safer than it has been in decades. 
Still, Vance made a call to Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to let the National Guard patrol Detroit’s streets much like it had in Washington D.C. and as President Donald Trump ordered Monday for Memphis, Tennessee.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX“My one message to Gretchen Whitmer is look at the city of Detroit, which we know has got some serious crime problems,” Vance said. “We know that it’s the people in Detroit who suffer the most when crime is allowed to run rampant all over city streets. So Gretchen, we are happy to send the National Guard to Detroit.”
The most recent weekly crime report for the city shows that crime was decreasing across the board compared to the same time period last year. That includes one homicide in the last week, and six non-fatal shootings. Violent crime and property crimes were also down from last year, according to data released by the Detroit Police Department.
Even Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a former Democrat who is now running for governor as an independent candidate, recently in an interview was asked what he would do if the president called him and said he was planning to bring in federal troops. 
Duggan said that there was no need to deploy federal troops in the city because of its momentous turnaround and that sending in troops would be a bad strategy. He also noted that Detroit wasn’t a sanctuary city, so there was no need for enhanced immigration enforcement like in Los Angeles, and that the city already has a tight partnership with the U.S. Attorney’s office.
Vance doubled down anyway, saying that streets are safer when law enforcement is allowed to “put bad guys away.”
“Just as we want to protect your jobs … we also want to make sure, when you go home, you can enjoy your neighborhood and enjoy your community in sync,” Vance said.
Mentions of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, its tax cuts and any efforts from the administration to make manufacturing might again were mere footnotes to his riffs on crime and Kirk.
On the federal budget and economic policy, Vance loosely mentioned the president’s tax cuts but did not detail how they would make life better for average Americans. Vance did say that it was his belief that ending the so-called Biden era electric vehicle mandate was good for the American auto worker, and that autoworkers were already doing better in the short nine months of Trump’s second term.
“President Trump and I are proud to fight for you each and every single day,” Vance said.
Michigan GOP leaders praise for Trump administration for tax cuts
Several Michigan Republicans joined Vance in Howell, including Michigan Republican Party Chair and state Sen. Jim Runestad of White Lake, U.S. Senate candidate Mike Rogers and U.S. Rep. Tom Barrett.
Runestad said Trump’s policies have been spurring investment and business, creating secure new jobs, and have emphasized stronger families and more resilient communities. For Runestad, those conservative-led efforts were, in turn, building a stronger America.
“We are eager to use your vision to build a stronger Michigan economy,” Runestad said.
Rogers said Republicans put Trump and Vance in the White House to finally step up to China’s manufacturing stronghold and bring jobs home. It was his belief that the pair were delivering.
Barrett, who has gotten flack from Democrats and other constituents at home for his vote to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, said he was proud of the bill’s contents and that it would stave off economic damage and high prices consumers felt during the administration of former Democratic President Joe Biden.
“We were able to do that,” Barrett said. “We staved off the largest tax increase in American history by extending the 2017 tax cuts and jobs so you can actually keep more of your own money.”
Democrats tell Vance to go home
Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee said Vance was simply doubling down on Trump’s “disastrous economic agenda” in Michigan. The party noted that the last time Vance visited the state, he promised a manufacturing renaissance, but the manufacturing sector has since shrunk by 42,000 jobs, according to the independent, bipartisan Center of American Progress research group.
Vance visited Michigan in March, and bragged about inflation numbers being on the right track. The DNC noted that since then, the Trump and Vance administration has seen inflation rates rise and may worse with foreign import taxes and other rising costs.

“After promising a manufacturing renaissance, JD Vance has a lot of nerve going back to Michigan to sell his billionaire-first budget. Instead of a ‘great American comeback,’ Trump and Vance have delivered an economic disaster: Prices are soaring, wages are decreasing, jobs are disappearing, and the manufacturing sector is being gutted,” Kendall Witmer, DNC rapid response director, said in a statement. “There’s no hiding the truth that Trump’s reckless economic policies are failing working and middle-class families in Michigan. That’s why Democrats are fighting to make the economy work for regular people – not just billionaires and elites.”
The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also bashed Barrett for his appearance at the speech and rally on Wednesday.
“Thanks to Barrett and Vance, Michiganders are losing their health care, facing layoffs at their manufacturing jobs, and paying higher prices everywhere from the grocery store to their electricity bills,” DCCC spokesperson Katie Smith said in a statement. “Michiganders won’t be fooled: Barrett puts Washington first and his constituents last, and it’s why he’ll be rejected at the ballot box next year.”
Vance eulogizes Kirk
The vice president also lionized Charlie Kirk, the close Trump ally and podcaster who was fatally shot Sept. 10 in Utah. Several members of local chapters of Turning Point USA, which Kirk founded and advocated for conservative causes on college campuses, stood on a riser behind Vance as he spoke.
Vance said Kirk’s work gave conservative and Christian students a home on college campuses where they might otherwise be ostracized, and said that he would continue to fight for everyone’s ability to speak their minds freely and openly – despite their political affiliations.
That call for unity was in stark contrast to his message while guest hosting Kirk’s podcast this week, where he claimed there was no unity with groups that escalate against speech they disagree with through violent acts.
Trump this week has called for a crackdown on liberal groups with no apparent ties to the suspect in Vance’s killing, who faces murder and other charges.
Vance, in Michigan, also turned his call for unity into another rallying cry for young conservatives, saying they will reject political violence but also will reject “the crazy left wing radicals that gunned down our friend Charlie.”

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)NINETY SIX — Just a mile down the road from Edgewood Middle School is the site of the South’s first land battle in the Revolutionary War nearly 250 years ago.
Using virtual tours, information sheets and interactive maps, K-12 students across the state will be able to learn more about the November 1775 Battle of Ninety Six and the other significant people and events in South Carolina’s military history, the Department of Education announced Wednesday.

Teachers newly have access to free, optional lessons that emphasize the state’s role in winning America’s independence, to help bring South Carolina’s outsized role to life, said state Superintendent Ellen Weaver.
“There are so many special things about the state of South Carolina that I want every student in our state to know and to love,” Weaver said.
This is the first time the American Battlefield Trust, a nonprofit focused on preserving battlegrounds and educating people about their history, is offering resources on the war tailored specifically to a single state, said Van Hipp, a trust board member.
Preserving battlefields is one thing, but making sure people understand what happened there and its importance is a key part of ensuring history isn’t forgotten. Forgetting history, in turn, means forgetting the foundations of freedom on which the country was built, said Hipp, who lives parttime in Georgetown.
“Without telling the stories and passing them down, in a generation or two, our work will have lost its meaning,” Hipp said.
The curriculum also comes at no cost to the state, since the nonprofit funded it using private donations. All offered resources align with state standards for each grade, Weaver said. That means teachers can use them toward preparing students for what they’re supposed to learn.

Although the resources are part of the state’s Palmetto Civics Project, a catalogue of historical resources for teachers, they aren’t restricted to lessons on history and social studies, Weaver said. Any teacher who can find a way to fit the resources into their classroom should feel free to do so, she said.
For instance, teachers could use one-page sheets on significant people from the Revolutionary War to teach students about exemplary traits and life skills, Weaver said.
“Young ladies and young men, I want you to remember that you are the legacy of these amazing American patriots, who bled and fought for our freedom right here on the soil of South Carolina, winning the American Revolution and setting us on a trajectory of freedom and continuous improvement,” Weaver told about 100 students at Edgewood Middle School.
She pointed to the resilience of William Jasper as one example of a life lesson students can take from history.
During the Battle of Sullivan’s Island in June 1776 — the Patriots’ first decisive win — Jasper braved enemy fire to restore the flag shot down from the island’s fort. South Carolina’s flag is a combination of the crescent on that 1776 indigo flag and the Palmetto tree, Weaver told the students.
(The British Royal Navy lost that battle, thanks partly to the fort’s construction, as cannons bounced off the palmetto tree trunks that made up the fort.)
“It’s really just about the teacher and their creativity in terms of how they want to deploy these resources to support their students’ learning,” Weaver said.
Students already learn about the Revolutionary War and state history during social studies classrooms, but seeing the places where battles played out can make a big difference in conveying the war’s significance, Weaver said.

A video will walk students through historical sites in Charleston, not just from the Revolutionary War but from all parts of history.
Students can see the inside of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor — where the Civil War began — learn the history of the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley and hear about Gullah Geechee culture from Boone Hall Plantation, according to the lesson plan.
Weaver’s own experience of history was shaped by walking through historical sites and standing in the same places as the people she learned about, she said.
“That’s the experience I want our students to have,” Weaver said. “To see that these battlefields, these historic sites, of which we have so many here in South Carolina, are actual places where real people fought and died so they could be free today.”
As the country’s birthday approaches next year, Weaver is asking other states to pick up the curriculum and teach students more about South Carolina’s role in the Revolutionary War, she said.
The announcement coincided with the 238th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Constitution, which is a perfect example of how history continues to play out nearly 250 years after the country’s founding, said Beth Taylor, superintendent of Greenwood School District 52.
During Wednesday’s assembly, a middle school student read the Constitution’s preamble.
The stories from history included in the curriculum “are not just South Carolina’s stories. They are America’s stories,” Taylor said.
“And now, they are our stories to continue,” Taylor said. “Let’s continue to honor the sacrifices of the past, celebrate the freedoms of the present, and work together to continue building a stronger future for the children of our country.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4433-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-17 18:01:01.063458

(Photo via Google Earth)A western Iowa nursing home has been cited by the state for failing to provide adequate nursing services for a woman whose leg was later amputated.
The Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing has cited the Good Samaritan nursing home in Red Oak with failing intervene when a female resident’s condition worsened, and with failing to properly assess the woman’s impaired circulation in her leg despite a diagnosis related to gangrene.
According to inspectors, the resident was crying and complaining of serious pain in her right leg early in the afternoon of Aug. 3, 2025. The staff provided paid medication through the night and the next morning. By the afternoon of Aug. 4, the staff was documenting that the woman’s leg had turned purple and was cold to the touch, with the woman continuing to experience “extreme pain” in her leg.

Upon admission to a local hospital, the woman was diagnosed with a life-threatening condition and she was transported by air to another hospital where she could be seen immediately by a vascular surgeon.
The surgeon’s physician assistant later told inspectors the woman underwent a “through-the-knee amputation” of her leg on Aug. 7, 2025. When asked whether it would have made any difference had the Good Samaritan staff sent the woman to the hospital earlier, the physician assistant allegedly told inspectors the woman “would not have had to suffer as many days in significant pain.”
The inspections department has proposed, but held in suspension, an $8,500 state fine against the Good Samaritan home for failing to provide residents with the required nursing services. The state fine is being held in suspension while the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services determines whether a federal fine will be imposed.
Currently, the 64-bed Good Samaritan home has a two-star, “below average” overall rating from CMS. In April 2025, during the home’s most recent annual inspection, Good Samaritan was cited for regulatory violations related to environmental hazards, failure to implement resident care plans, services that failed to meet professional standards, treatment of bedsores, tube feedings, food services and infection control.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach the home’s administrator, Mike Early, for comment Tuesday.

Claire Burns, who had been leading the Caledonia County State’s Attorney’s Office in an interim capacity, is now the county’s top prosecutor. 
Gov. Phil Scott appointed Burns earlier this month. She replaces Jessica Zaleski, who stepped down this summer. 
In an interview Wednesday, Burns described her appointment to the job as “bittersweet”: bitter because she was no longer working with Zaleski, who she described as a mentor. 
Burns first joined the Caledonia County State’s Attorney’s Office as a deputy prosecutor in 2021. Prior to that, she worked as a recovery services clinician at the Vermont Psychiatric Care Hospital, and in public defense in Colorado and California. 
While working at a Sacramento public defender’s office in law school, Burns said she developed an interest in the root causes leading people into the criminal legal system. 
“I just became bombarded with the reality of mental illness and substance use really precipitating criminal behavior and involvement in the criminal justice system,” she said. That experience led her to study clinical psychology, an education “equally important as my law degree,” Burns said. 
That path eventually brought her back to Vermont, first to work in mental health care, then as a prosecutor. 
“I grew up in Craftsbury, so the Northeast Kingdom is very much my community,” Burns said, explaining her interest in leading the Caledonia County State’s Attorney’s Office. 
Becoming the county’s top prosecutor has already brought challenges, according to Burns. Unable to secure a witness, she didn’t have the evidence to fully explain one defendant’s involvement in a fatal ATV crash, enraging the victim’s family. And a plea deal in a case involving multiple sexual assault charges has attracted public criticism, according to Burns. 
“Any difficulty or adversity is a learning opportunity, and all we can do is keep moving forward,” she said. “We are hard workers and we are caring, and I think we do all right by Caledonia. That’s not to say we can’t do better, and we will continue striving to do better.”
Burns will finish her predecessor’s term and be up for election next year.

(Photo courtesy of Revolution Wind)Rhode Island and Connecticut attorneys general are doubling down on their legal push to reverse the Trump administration’s stop work order on Revolution Wind — before it’s too late.
In a 47-page motion filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island, Attorneys General Peter Neronha of Rhode Island and William Tong of Connecticut asked a federal judge for a faster, temporary block on the Trump administration while their lawsuit plays out.
“Revolution Wind was chosen for a reason—it was the best way to reduce costs for ratepayers, comply with state mandates, and ensure a long-term stable energy source,” the AGs wrote. “The multi-year process that the States engaged in before selecting Revolution Wind cannot be recreated in a timely fashion.”
The pair of Democratic state attorneys general sued the administration on Sept. 4, two weeks after federal regulators ordered co-developer Ørsted to stop construction of the 65-turbine wind project. The project 15 nautical miles south of Rhode Island was already 80% complete, having secured its final federal approval in November 2023, and inked agreements to sell power to Rhode Island and Connecticut utility companies by 2027.
Now nearing one month, the delay has already thrown critical project benchmarks off-track, risking loss of specialty vessels needed to transport equipment and parts; union laborers, some of whom have now taken other jobs, and both states’ environmental and economic futures. 
“While in some types of construction, delays of weeks could be mitigated or might be compensable, Ørsted has explained that a delay beyond September 22, 2025 imperils the entire project and threatens unsustainable losses for the company,” the AGs wrote, referencing the timeline suggested by Ørsted executives in prior affidavits.
The Danish renewable energy giant and its co-developer, a consortium led by Skyborn Renewables, filed suit against the Trump administration on the same day as the state attorneys general, although the companies took their legal challenge to federal court in Washington D.C. Ørsted and Skyborn, together known as Revolution Wind LLC, asked a federal judge for a preliminary injunction on Sept. 5, seeking a short-term intervention that would let them pick the $5 billion project back up. 
A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for Sept. 22, according to the public court docket. 
The same request is now being made by the attorneys general.
“We have no time to waste in getting Revolution Wind back online, which is why we’re asking the Court to put a stop to this in short order,” Neronha said in a statement. “In the few weeks since the stop work order was issued, without warning or reason, Rhode Islanders have been harmed, facing daily uncertainty. We have heard difficult stories from union workers who are out of a job, and from businesses who are now reluctant to pursue economic ventures due to the uncertainty created by this Administration’s decision. Further, Rhode Islanders continue to bear the brunt of the rising and increasingly unstable energy costs and environmental harms associated with fossil fuels. In this case, we need relief now for the benefit of Rhode Island, its workers, and its residents. And time is of the essence.”
Neronha’s office acknowledged, but did not immediately provide an answer Wednesday on why the state did not ask for a preliminary injunction sooner.
Speaking to the Connecticut Building Trades Council at its convention at Mohegan Sun casino Wednesday, Tong said the AGs delayed seeking an injunction at the request of Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont. The Connecticut Mirror reported that Lamont first wanted to try to negotiate with federal administrators, including Interior Secretary Burgum.
Gov. Dan McKee has also appealed to Burgum directly, exchanging text messages in the hopes that more information about the project’s progress might persuade the administration to rescind the stop work order. But McKee’s request for a face-to-face with Donald Trump has not yet been answered.











We have no time to waste in getting Revolution Wind back online, which is why we’re asking the Court to put a stop to this in short order.


– Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha



The new AGs motion features a stark warning from Christopher Kearns, Rhode Island’s acting energy commissioner, who wrote that delays in the project jeopardize the state decarbonization mandates, including offsetting 100% of the state’s electricity needs by 2033 — either through renewable sources or credits purchased by the state utility company. The 704-megawatt Revolution Wind project is projected to produce enough electricity to power 350,000 homes across Rhode Island and Connecticut, equal to 2.5% of the regional electric needs.
“There are no readily available alternatives to allow Rhode Island to meet its statutorily required levels of renewable energy with affordable long-term contracting for clean energy or Renewable Energy Credits without Revolution Wind, Kearns wrote in his 11-page affidavit.
And, the 9.8 cents per kilowatt hour Rhode Island Energy was already under contract to pay for the wind project’s electricity is 33% lower than the proposed winter electric rates in Rhode Island this year. Connecticut energy officials project regional utility costs to rise $500,000 a year starting in 2028 if the Revolution Wind project is not completed.
“Every day that Revolution Wind sits mothballed in the ocean is another day of unemployment, another day of unaffordable energy costs, and another day burning fossil fuels when clean, affordable, American-made energy is within our sights,”  Tong said in a statement. “We’re asking the court to step in right now, to recognize the irreparable and immediate harm we are suffering, and to stop the Trump Administration’s impulsive and lawless overreach.”
An estimated 1,200 union laborers stand to lose work if the project does not resume, while new state apprenticeship programs meant to train future operations and maintenance technicians could fall flat.
“The Stop Work Order is also likely to undermine investor confidence and set a chilling precedent for future projects,” the AGs motion states. “This type of shock to the industry hurts the States’ investments to support this industry.”
Elizabeth Peace, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Interior, declined to comment in an email Wednesday, citing the pending litigation. 
The federal administration has until Oct. 1 to submit its written response to the court in the AGs’ lawsuit.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-17 20:40:32+00:00,CT Mirror,CT fire officials voice opposition to single-stairway exit change,Ginny Monk,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/17/ct-fire-single-stairway-exit-change/,CT fire officials said they were 'vehemently opposed' to the change in the building code and one stairway exit could lead to safety concerns.,"Connecticut officials are considering a change to state building codes that would allow some residential buildings to have only one way to exit, rather than two.
The proposal would allow new buildings with up to five stories of residences and up to four units of housing per floor to have just one stairway as an exit, if the building has certain fire-resistant technology. Up to six stories would be allowed in cases where there is a commercial space on the first floor.
Current state building code allows single-stairway exits for residences up to three stories tall.
The state’s Codes and Standards Committee, which reviews changes to building and fire codes, on Wednesday heard from firefighters about what they said were the dangers of the change during a public hearing. The committee has already voted once in favor of the proposal. Advocates say the change would make it easier to build housing, while opponents fear the change would be unsafe.
“Fire codes were created not by great ideas but from major losses of life and unfortunate lessons,” said Greg Priest, the fire chief of West Hartford and a representative of the Joint Council of Connecticut Fire Service Organizations.
After the public comment period ends Oct. 11, the committee will have a month to respond to comments. It’ll vote on the measure for a second time before sending it to the legislative Regulation Review Committee, which will also vote on the new code. The code is largely based on standards from the International Code Council. Connecticut updates its code according to the standards every few years.
The proposal on means of egress stems from a measure included in the 2024 bonding bill in which lawmakers mandated that the committee review a change. The goal was to make it easier to build more housing and address a shortage that experts say has caused housing costs to rise.
“I think it’s a good direction for us to move in, in terms of housing policy,” said House Majority Leader Rep. Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, when the measure passed.
Roger Nelson, the Bloomfield Center fire marshal and the president of the Connecticut Fire Marshals Association, said he was “vehemently opposed” to the proposal because the one exit could become blocked and would need to be wide enough for firefighters to enter a building while residents exit.
“Unfortunately the single-exit provision has become a political issue, not a life safety issue,” Nelson said.
Residential building fires killed about 2,700 people annually from 2018 to 2020. About 80% of those fire deaths in the United States occurred in one- or two-family homes, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Connecticut’s proposal would apply to new construction and says that in order to have only one set of stairs to exit, the buildings must have an automatic sprinkler system and one-hour fire resistive material. There also must not be more than 20 feet between any housing unit and the exit stairway.
The change wouldn’t apply to boarding houses, the proposal documents say.
Single-stairway legislation is growing in popularity among some housing advocates who say with new technology and building materials, the fire risk is minimized in apartment buildings of four to six floors. Colorado and Tennessee are among states that have legalized single stairs in some form. Some cities including Memphis and Austin have also gotten on board.
“The limitation of the building code has meant that smaller, missing middle-type homes, multifamily home developments just have a significant amount of barriers preventing them from being constructed,” said Pete Harrison, Connecticut director for the Regional Plan Association, in an interview.
He said modern fire suppression technologies and other safety planning can make buildings safe and make it easier to build townhomes and smaller apartment complexes, particularly as infill between existing buildings. He added that more fire deaths occur in single-family homes than apartment buildings of this size.
“It has everything to do with affordable housing, and it unlocks a really critical type of home construction that is illegal in Connecticut, but was legal for a very long time,” Harrison said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023_1213_SR_Construction_020_1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-17 16:57:47.465062

Established in 1964, ACIP is charged with setting national guidelines around which people should be vaccinated against a plethora of preventable diseases and when those vaccines should be administered. The recommendations also play a key role in determining which vaccines insurance companies are willing to cover and how accessible immunizations are for the public to access.
The committee, which meets three times a year, has not historically garnered much public interest. But earlier this year, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. abruptly dismissed all 17 existing members of the committee and replaced them with seven hand-picked appointees, many of whom are seen as vaccine skeptics, launching the little-known committee into the national spotlight. Ahead of Thursday’s meeting, Kennedy has appointed an additional five members to the panel, several of whom have publicly advocated against vaccines and immunization mandates.
Controversy over the panel’s recommendations has also contributed to ongoing turmoil at the CDC. Former Director Susan Monarez, who was fired by Kennedy in August after serving as head of the agency for less than a month, claimed she was dismissed for refusing to preapprove ACIP recommendations that did not align with scientific evidence in an op-ed published this month by the Wall Street Journal. Three senior leaders at the CDC also resigned in protest after Monarez was ousted.

Monarez, who testified Wednesday before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said she worries that the panel will move to restrict access to vaccines, worsening ongoing outbreaks of diseases like measles.
“Based on what I observed during my tenure, there is a real risk that recommendations could be made restricting access to vaccines for children and others in need without rigorous scientific review,” Monarez said. “With no permanent CDC director in place, those recommendations could be adopted.”
ACIP expected to revise vaccine schedules for children, adults
Members of ACIP are expected to vote on three different vaccine protocols during their two-day meeting, according to a draft agenda released last week. The first item on the agenda is the MMRV vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella, more commonly known as chickenpox.
Current ACIP recommendations advise health care providers to administer vaccines for MMR and varicella together. However, due to a slightly increased risk of febrile seizures — or convulsions that are caused by a fever — in young children who receive the MMRV vaccine, doctors may choose to administer the two vaccines separately. 
The panel may recommend that the vaccines be administered separately for all children, a move that would not restrict vaccine access but may reduce uptake of one or both of the vaccines, particularly for children who have missed vaccine appointments in the past.

ACIP is also slated to review hepatitis B vaccines, which the CDC currently recommends that all infants and most adults receive. But at the most recent ACIP meeting in June, Chairman Martin Kulldorff — a doctor and former Harvard Medical School professor who is known for his opposition to vaccine mandates — signaled that he would be open to postponing hepatitis B requirements for newborn children.
“Unless the mother is hepatitis B positive, an argument could be made to delay the vaccine for this infection, which is primarily spread by sexual activity and intravenous drug use,” he said.
ACIP is expected to change its recommendations at the upcoming meeting, potentially delaying hepatitis B vaccines until age 4, KFF Health News reported.
U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a doctor and Louisiana Republican who cast the deciding vote to confirm Kennedy as health secretary, explained during Wednesday’s hearing that before the hepatitis B vaccine was approved for infants in 1991, more than 20,000 babies a year were infected with the virus in the United States. More than 90% of the children infected with hepatitis B at birth, he said, developed “chronic lifelong infection.”

Speaking to reporters after the hearing ended Wednesday, Cassidy said Americans should not trust any changes ACIP makes to the childhood vaccine schedule. He added that changing the childhood schedule could mean health insurance companies won’t have to cover the cost of any vaccines no longer included in the recommendations.
“You always have to balance the patient’s pocketbook with their health,” Cassidy said. “Now, if the child gets vaccinated at age four, most likely today, because of our success in preventing hepatitis B the child will be okay. But I can promise you there will be some hepatitis B transmission.”
The panel will also examine COVID-19 vaccine guidelines on the second day of the meeting, a subject that has drawn intense scrutiny amid shifting federal guidance on public health policies. 
In August, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is tasked with overseeing vaccine development, approved a new round of COVID-19 vaccines aimed at providing immunity against the JN.1 variant. While previous booster shots had been recommended for everyone six months of age and older, the new recommendations limited eligibility for the updated shots to only those who are 65 or older, as well as younger people with certain health problems. ACIP may vote to follow suit.
Kennedy appoints new members
Days before the committee was set to hold its second meeting of the year, Kennedy announced the appointment of five new members to the panel. The panel, which now includes a total of 12 members, many of whom have publicly opposed existing vaccine policies and mandates.

In a press release, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the appointments “reflect the commitment of Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to transparency, evidence-based science, and diverse expertise in guiding the nation’s immunization policies.”
Jim O’Neill, the agency’s deputy secretary who is serving as the acting director of the CDC, added that the new appointments would help restore public trust in the agency, which Kennedy has outlined as a priority.
“The new ACIP members bring a wealth of real-world public health experience to the job of making immunization recommendations,” O’Neill said in a statement. “We are grateful for their service in helping restore the public confidence in vaccines that was lost during the Biden era.”
The five new members include Hillary Blackburn, a clinically trained pharmacist and podcast host who is the niece of U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee; Dr. Evelyn Griffin, a Louisiana-based OB/GYN who has publicly questioned vaccine requirements and testified about adverse vaccine reactions before members of the Louisiana House of Representatives; Dr. Kirk Milhoan, a Hawaii-based pediatric cardiologist who serves as a senior fellow at the Independent Medical Alliance, formerly known as the Frontline COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance, which advocated for the use of the drug ivermectin and other unproven methods to treat COVID-19; Dr. Raymond Pollak, an Illinois-based family medicine physician and transplant specialist; and Catherine M. Stein, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Case Western Reserve University who has been an outspoken critic of COVID-19 policies.
Noel Brewer, a professor of public health at the University of North Carolina and a former member of ACIP who served for a year before being fired by Kennedy in June, says the new committee lacks relevant medical and immunology experience compared to previous versions of the panel.
“There’s key expertise missing in vaccinology, patient care and so on,” he said. “They have much less scientific experience, but also a lot less clinical experience.”
The result, Brewer said, is a panel that lacks the trust of the scientific community, while also endangering access to vaccines for a broad range of Americans.
“The meetings will increasingly become a platform for anti-vaccine rhetoric and misinformation, and then finally, through their bully pulpit, they’re trying to take vaccines away from Americans,” he said. “They’ve already taken vaccines away, and they’ll just keep going. I don’t know how long before not many are left.”

Kevin Stitt on Wednesday announced the end of an effort to remove homeless encampments on state property in Tulsa.
In two weeks, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol cleared 64 locations and disposed of nearly 2 million pounds of “debris” as part of Operation Swift Action for Families Everywhere, Stitt said.
He said it would be up to Tulsa Mayor Monroe Nichols and city officials to “ensure
 state and local laws are enforced and camps are not reestablished. 
“OHP will continue to monitor state property and will return to enforce state law if necessary,” he said.
Nichols has been critical of the effort, saying it was a manufactured crisis. Nichols said Stitt did not coordinate with local officials.
There were no arrests, said Sarah Stewart, an Oklahoma Department of Public Safety  spokeswoman.
Troopers initially issued warnings to homeless individuals before beginning clearing encampments. People were offered rides to treatment or housing facilities or a trip to jail if they refused to vacate.
The Oklahoma Department of Transportation was part of the cleanup effort and posted vacate notices on state property.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Dr. Debra Houry said she first considered stepping down from her role as chief medical officer and deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March.
“And I had been updating my resignation letter every few weeks,” Houry, speaking to a group of health journalists in Wellesley, Massachusetts, last week, said. “Because I knew at some point I would have to take a stand.”
The doctor and public health expert said she considered quitting several times over the ensuing months amid turmoil under the leadership of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Kennedy, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, has prompted outrage among the public health community over several of his vaccine-related decisions. In May, Kennedy announced the CDC wouldn’t recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women. (Houry said she learned about that change via the social media platform X.) In June, he fired 17 members of the CDC’s vaccine advisory commission and replaced several of them with vaccine skeptics. In August, he cut roughly $500 million in funding for research on mRNA vaccines for illnesses like influenza and COVID-19.
However, it was in late August, when Kennedy and the Trump administration fired CDC Director Susan Monarez, that Houry decided it was time to turn in her resignation letter in protest.
“What’s interesting is my letter hadn’t changed much since March,” she said.
She was among four high-level CDC officials who resigned that day. Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the now-former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, was another. They said Kennedy and Trump’s leadership had made it impossible for them to do their jobs properly.
“I think probably the most important thing going on in the media, from my perspective, is not so much the resignation of the officials at CDC — myself, Dan Jernigan, and Deb Houry — but rather the light that I think should be shown is on the attack that is happening to public health,” Daskalakis said, speaking to the same group in Massachusetts via videoconference. “We are sort of seeing the leadership of public health in the United States really focused on ideology rather than science.”
The two discussed the state of the federal government’s health apparatus under Kennedy and Trump, and what they predict will be the repercussions of their actions.
Former CDC chief says she was fired for resisting RFK Jr. orders on vaccines

Houry — who worked under six CDC directors and three presidents over roughly a decade — said her team, the office of the director, had 11 political appointees when she left. She said that’s “different” than under previous administrations. She said only one of them — a urologist — had health experience. The others included a real estate agent, an aviation attorney, and someone who ran a local campaign, she said.
“So that was my team for several months,” she said.
Meanwhile, Kennedy is firing workers en masse. In March, he announced roughly 10,000 Health and Human Services employees, including 2,400 at the CDC, would be laid off; however, many of those firings have been halted by courts.
“I think well documented has been the strategy of trying to reduce the size of public health, trying to create, quote, ‘efficiency,’” Daskalakis said. “It would be interesting if that were done with a strategic plan, if the decision was, ‘Here’s a priority, and this is what we need to do to be able to match the workforce to the priority.’ That’s what we hope people who are good at organizations do. Instead, what happened is that there’s been a random patchwork of gaps created that is, in effect, throwing public health, from the governmental perspective, into chaos.”
Daskalakis said the CDC has lost “centuries of expertise.”
Houry also talked about the upheaval of a recent shooting at the CDC headquarters. In August, a gunman fired more than 500 rounds into six buildings on the CDC campus in Atlanta. Authorities said they found documents the gunman had written at his home suggesting he was motivated by conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 vaccine. The gunman killed a responding police officer before killing himself. After the shooting, hundreds of current and former Health and Human Services employees signed a letter arguing that the attack was “driven by politicized rhetoric that has turned public health professionals from trusted experts into targets of villainization” and that Kennedy is “complicit in dismantling America’s public health infrastructure and endangering the nation’s health by repeatedly spreading inaccurate health information.”
“I walked through that building,” Houry said. “There’s glass everywhere; 181 windows had bullets in them and many of my colleagues had bullets on their desk.”
Research in recent years has suggested public health officials at all levels of government have faced a growing number of threats since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
“I think the impact at CDC has been more profound than realized,” Houry said. “Most of my former scientists don’t want to speak about vaccines. They’ve taken their names off papers.”
In late March, Kennedy and the Trump administration canceled nearly 700 CDC grants collectively worth about $11 billion, though some cancellations have been reversed by courts ruling it doesn’t have the authority to do so. The administration has argued it’s simply ending pandemic-era programs.
Houry anticipates the impacts of these and other cuts instituted this year to trickle down to the state and local level, but it will take time. She noted 80% of CDC funding goes to state and local health departments. Houry explained that the CDC administers grants that fund programs through the entire year. However, when those grants expire at the end of the year, funding cuts at the CDC mean they likely won’t be replaced or will be reduced.
“You will start to see layoffs and programs that aren’t going to continue in communities once these budget cuts become a reality,” she said.
Daskalakis also cautioned about the ripple effects.
“It’s not just the federal government that’s in chaos,” he said. The chaos that you see at CDC is then transmitted to the local jurisdictions who have also had to reduce their force, limit the number of people that they have working in some areas that have lost funding in key areas because of, in effect, AI searches for words like equity, gender, etc.”
Many of the grants have been eliminated because they have been deemed DEI-related (diversity, equity, and inclusion) by the Trump administration, and some reporting suggests the government is identifying DEI by using keyword searches.
Houry also worries Kennedy will have autism added to the list of adverse effects of vaccines despite overwhelming scientific evidence vaccines don’t cause autism.
She said she was “shocked” when she heard Kennedy say that he didn’t think it was a conflict of interest to have people who served as expert witnesses in lawsuits against vaccine companies serve on the federal government’s vaccine advisory committee.
Daskalakis called Kennedy’s statements on vaccines and other topics “Orwellian double speak.”
Alongside Houry and Daskalakis, Dr. Daniel Jernigan, head of the National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases and Dr. Jennifer Layden, director of the Office of Public Health Data, Surveillance, and Technology, also resigned from the CDC in August. On Wednesday, Houry and Monarez testified in front of a Senate committee in Washington, with Monarez saying she was fired for refusing to agree with Kennedy’s decision to fire top vaccine officials and pre-approve vaccine recommendations.
“I could have kept the office and the title,” Monarez said during the hearing, “but I would have lost the one thing that cannot be replaced: my integrity.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said Wednesday the U.S. needs to explore new global markets amid ongoing trade wars, referencing the recent Iowa delegation trip to India as an area where Iowa farmers could see expanded business.
Naig spoke on the issue at a news conference held at Maxwell Custom Beef in Des Moines, where he announced the recipients of nine Choose Iowa Butchery Innovation Grants Wednesday. The Choose Iowa grants, totaling $355,000, provide funding for equipment upgrades and facility improvements for small-scale meat processing plants across the state.
As harvest season approaches, the agriculture secretary acknowledged that “certainly, prices are not where we would like them to be,” especially for soybeans. He said another factor causing farmers to struggle is high input prices — referring to growing costs for land, farm equipment, seeds and fuel.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“So what we need to be thinking about then is, how can we drive down the cost of inputs, but how can we also expand and unleash the market opportunities?” Naig said. “… So my message to our farm community — and certainly I’ve been hearing from them about their concerns and the challenges — is that we need to continue to work on both the input side, driving down those prices. But also — how do we how do we increase demand for the things that we produce in this state so well?”
Some have pointed to President Donald Trump’s trade policies as a concern for farmers. For soy farmers, U.S.-China trade relations are particularly in question. Currently, China is not buying U.S. soybeans, a retaliatory measure to tariffs imposed by Trump. While typically more than half of soybeans grown in the U.S. are sold to China, Chinese importers have booked a vast majority of soybean shipments to come from South America in October 2025, Reuters reports.
Though there are significant concerns about the impact of this trade shift, Naig said the U.S. needs to aggressively seek new foreign trade partners.
“Just remember: this is a global marketplace,” Naig said.
If China is importing more from Brazil and other South American countries, Naig said, that means “there are other markets that are available for us to be selling to and that’s where you’ve got to go be very aggressive in pursuing those additional markets.
“And it takes many to add up to what China formerly was, to be sure, but I think there’s opportunities across the board for for soybean and soybean meal — India, again, being an example of where we think soybean meal could be a real opportunity,” he said.
Naig, alongside Gov. Kim Reynolds and other Iowa state and business leaders, returned this week from an eight-day trade mission to India. The trip involved trade discussions that began when an Iowa delegation first went to India in 2024, and involved roundtable events with the U.S. Soybean Export Council and the U.S. Grains Council.
However, Naig said he still believed there would be successful negotiations between the U.S. and China that will result in soybean exports.
“(China) can’t entirely rely on South America, and so we need to get to reality here,” Naig said. “And obviously that’s a very complex relationship. Soybeans just one of those pieces, but I am hopeful that we will, in fact, see some movement in that.”

Montana case. (Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)The State of Montana is on the hook for nearly $3 million to cover attorney’s fees stemming from the litigation of Held v. Montana, the youth-led constitutional climate lawsuit that made national headlines when it went to trial in 2023.
Lewis and Clark District Court Judge Kathy Seeley, who ruled in favor of the young plaintiffs and affirmed their constitutional right to a “clean and healthful environment,” issued the order awarding attorneys fees on Tuesday.
In her order, Seeley highlighted the number of individuals affected by the laws at the heart of the lawsuit and the state’s actions in approving unconstitutional as justification for the award.
“Defendants have not overcome the rebuttable presumption that ‘when a Montana citizen has to resort to litigation in order to vindicate a constitutional right, the citizen is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that he should not bear the expense of that litigation,’” Seeley wrote.
She awarded $2.8 million in attorney’s fees, plus nearly $100,000 in additional costs.
Seeley’s original decision in Held found that Montana’s greenhouse gas emissions are “proven to be a substantial factor in causing climate impacts to Montana’s environment, and harm and injury to the youth plaintiffs.” The ruling was upheld by the Montana Supreme Court in 2024.
A joint statement from Our Children’s Trust and the Western Environmental Law Center, two of the law firms involved in the litigation, expressed gratitude to Seeley for “recognizing the extraordinary time and effort required to bring this historic case to trial, and for affirming the years of commitment and legal expertise contributed.”
“This award represents only a fraction of the thousands of hours invested over more than five years, but it helps ensure that organizations like ours can continue to stand with young people fighting for their constitutional rights. We remain humbled by the opportunity to walk beside these courageous youth and are as committed as ever to advancing their fight to uphold the values enshrined in Montana’s great constitution,” the statement said.
Attorney Roger Sullivan of McGarvey Law in Kalispell, who also represented the Held plaintiffs, argued the case for attorney’s fees earlier this year, and told the Daily Montanan on Wednesday he was pleased with the outcome.
“We were protecting, on behalf of our youth plaintiffs, their constitutional rights,” Sullivan said.
A spokesperson from the Montana Attorney General’s Office did not answer questions from the Daily Montana, but sent a link to statements made in other media that the department is “disappointed” and would likely appeal.
Ten of the 16 youth plaintiffs from the Held lawsuit are also involved in another climate case – Lighthiser v. Trump — challenging three of the president’s recent executive orders on “unleashing” the fossil fuel industry.

A construction crew worked at the site on Jan. 30, 2025. (Sara Wilson/Colorado Newsline)The housing shortfall in Colorado is north of 100,000 units, but that number is dropping from a peak in 2019, according to an analysis from state demographers that looked at data up until 2023.
Demographers say that 34,100 new homes will need to be built each year to prevent that shortfall from growing over the next decade.
“Since 2000, Colorado’s housing market has undergone significant transformation. Population growth has outpaced new housing development, resulting in supply constraints and escalating costs,” the report reads. “Multiple studies have highlighted how Colorado’s housing supply has not kept pace with housing demand and is particularly deficient relative to other states.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The report concluded that in 2023, Colorado had a housing shortfall of 106,000 units. Researchers analyzed census data including the total housing units in the state, number of households, age of heads of household, number of second homes and number of uninhabitable units. The report’s authors acknowledged that their work does not fully capture all populations in the state, such as those experiencing homelessness, since they relied on imperfect census data.
The shortfall began to accelerate around 2007 and peaked at 140,000 units in 2019. Since then, Colorado’s population growth has slowed and housing production has increased.
“Since 2020, 43,000 housing units have been built on average annually, a marked increase from the previous decade’s housing production. These factors combined have allowed for the housing deficit to be cut by nearly 25% in a short amount of time between the peak shortfall in 2019 and 2023,” the report reads.
This chart shows the scale of housing underproduction in Colorado since 2005. (Screenshot from Colorado State Demography Office’s “Colorado’s Housing Shortfall”)
The report does not consider the types or prices of housing needed to close the gap or make housing affordable in the state. Around 2015, housing prices started rising faster than personal incomes in the state, and by 2023 there was the largest gap in housing affordability in over 20 years. By that year, housing prices were up 223% since 2000, but income was only up 144%.
“Despite making substantial improvements in the state’s housing deficit over the past five years, the gap between household income and housing costs are greater now than ever before, a phenomenon that is disproportionately impacting low-income households in Colorado,” the report says.
State demographers plan to update the housing shortfall analysis every year. That should give insight into how emerging factors, such as rising construction costs, policy changes and tariff impacts, will affect the housing supply.
An analysis from the National Low Income Housing Coalition found that Colorado has a deficit of about 134,000 rental units for extremely low-income households. The right-leaning American Enterprise Institute estimates that the Colorado housing shortfall sits at about 180,000 units, the sixth highest in the country. Housing policy group Up For Growth found that Colorado needs about 105,000 units to meet needs as of 2022. Those three studies used different methodologies than the state demographer’s office, though Up For Growth’s methodology is most similar.
Since 2023, the Colorado Legislature has passed a handful of policies to spur housing construction, but it’s hard to gauge their impact so soon. That includes laws to streamline modular and manufactured housing, expand the parts of the state where accessory dwelling units are universally allowed, incentivize denser housing around transit hubs, and reduce litigation risks for construction defect claims.
“We are fighting to lower housing costs and ensure that every Coloradan can realize the dream of becoming a homeowner but more work needs to be done. By expanding housing options, we can lower costs and provide more options for Coloradans to live where we want to live,” Gov. Jared Polis, who has put housing and affordability near the top of his policy agenda, said in a statement.

Hundreds of people interested in solving New Mexico’s housing challenges have descended on an Albuquerque hotel this week for a summit, one that the state’s Mortgage Finance Authority organized for more than a year.
The authority kicked off the summit Wednesday morning with its monthly meeting, in which board members celebrated the authority’s 50th anniversary and milestone of serving 505,000 New Mexicans. While presenters detailed successes on a variety of housing programs, they also noted economic headwinds expected in the next year.
For example, the authority projects producing a little under 4,000 housing units in the upcoming fiscal year, through several programs that help fund a mixture of single and multi-family units and rehabbed homes. That’s a reduction of about 300 units for this fiscal year and a drop of about 1,000 since 2024, according to a presentation from Jeff Payne, the authority’s Chief Loan Officer.

Even with the projected decrease, the authority expects increased costs for a variety of its programs, prompting board member Rebecca Wurzburger to chime in at the end of Payne’s presentation:
“So the bottom line is we are spending more money and we’re getting fewer houses. Is that correct?” she asked during the board meeting at the Hotel Albuquerque.
“That is correct,” Payne said, citing rising sale prices in Albuquerque, for example, as evidence that the authority is producing fewer housing units, and smaller units, for the same amount of money as in years past. 
The summit continues through Friday with more than 100 presenters from 20 states on a wide variety of housing topics, including homelessness, Indigenous housing in urban areas, tips for developers and artificial intelligence’s applications for housing builders. 
The authority expects roughly 600 people to attend. The summit is at capacity, which director Isidoro “Izzy” Hernandez attributed to widespread interest in the topic in a state where average rents and homelessness are increasing above the national average.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_0977-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-17 16:57:47.465062

Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Delia Ramirez of Illinois joined advocates Wednesday outside the U.S. Capitol to blast proposed cuts to education spending.The lawmakers and demonstrators rebuked a congressional spending panel’s bill that calls for $12 billion in spending cuts at the Education Department for the coming fiscal year and fulfills many of President Donald Trump’s education spending priorities as he and his administration seek to dismantle the agency.Dozens of advocates from across the country marched from the Education Department’s headquarters to the U.S. Capitol to protest the proposed cuts, organized by the political arm of Popular Democracy, a network of community-based organizations across the country. The march culminated in a press conference, where Tlaib and Ramirez rallied with the advocates.  Trump outlines ‘winding down’ of agencyTrump and his administration have sought to take an ax to the Education Department in an effort to dramatically overhaul the federal role in education.Earlier this year, Trump requested $12 billion in spending cuts at the department for fiscal 2026. A summary of the department’s request said the cut “reflects an agency that is responsibly winding down.”“You all know, and I feel this from my heart — the fact that the current president wants to gut and completely eliminate the Department of Education is not only despicable, it is unconstitutional,” Tlaib said. “You know the Department of Education is incredibly important for not only those living with disabilities, but different religious backgrounds, diverse communities,” she said. The Michigan Democrat added that “without the Department of Education, we know many of our kids will be left behind, unable to receive ... the education and resources.” House and Senate bills differThough the House and Senate Appropriations committees share jurisdiction over funding the Education Department for the coming fiscal year, their bills stand in sharp contrast to each other. Senate appropriators largely rejected Trump’s proposed spending cuts in their bipartisan bill, which advanced out of the committee in July. Their measure tightens requirements for the department to have the necessary staffing levels to fulfill its statutory responsibilities and prevents the agency from transferring certain programs to other federal agencies. But the House Appropriations Committee’s bill, which also passed out of that panel, largely aligns with the president’s education agenda and spending cut priorities. Ramirez of Illinois blasted that bill, saying it “would gut support for English language learners, funding for teacher training and retention and dismantle entire community schools.”  She noted that “in an effort to turn the clock back to when discrimination was legal, Republicans are obsessed with dismantling the Department of Education and every program that protects equal opportunity education for our children — that’s why Republicans are pushing to take away over $12 billion from our children’s public education.”",,,,2025-09-17 16:57:47.465062

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)Tana Senn, the director of the state’s Department of Children, Youth and Families, began a note to the governor’s budget director lamenting her agency’s predicament. 
“I wish times were better in writing my first budget request letter,” she wrote Monday to K.D. Chapman-See, the director of the Office of Financial Management. 
The request is among those state agencies have submitted in recent days to Gov. Bob Ferguson’s office as he prepares a budget proposal ahead of the 2026 legislative session. 
Senn’s sprawling agency faces twin crises. 
There’s the issue of overcapacity in the state’s juvenile detention system. Lawmakers couldn’t figure out systemic fixes to address these concerns this year, and Green Hill School in Chehalis remains dozens of young people above its safe capacity.
Senn is now asking for nearly $8 million to open a new, 16-bed juvenile facility in Pierce County. This would be a medium-security detention center focused on serving young people with acute mental health needs. If granted funding, the agency would seek to buy the facility in fiscal year 2027, with detainees potentially moving there in April 2027.


A dash for cash 
Ahead of the 2026 legislative session, we’re highlighting budget requests from state agencies. Do you know of a notable ask? Or are you curious about a specific agency? Email us with tips or questions: info@washingtonstatestandard.com. You can check out all of the requests here.


Of the $8 million, $3 million would go toward buying the property, and the rest is for operations. The state would be buying the building, a shuttered treatment center near Parkland, from nonprofit hospital system Multicare.
The department is also seeking $12 million to improve staffing at Green Hill and the state’s other juvenile detention facility, the Echo Glen Children’s Center in Snoqualmie. Officials also want money for security improvements at the two facilities. 
Then there’s the spike in child fatalities and near fatalities in the child welfare system that the Department of Children, Youth and Families oversees. 
While lawmakers debate a recent state law’s role in that rise, Senn wants more money, $4 million to be exact, to address the issue. 
The money would go in part toward getting drug treatment for parents before their child welfare cases are closed. The highly potent opioid fentanyl has driven increases in fatalities and near-fatalities for the state’s children in recent years.
The funding would also look to help connect families to services after their cases close.
“Families need support in their communities to mitigate risk factors,” Senn wrote to Chapman-See. “Investing in increased community-based supports to better engage parents in substance use disorder treatment, to create safe home environments for young children, and to more successfully connect families to services after a case is closed can mitigate risk and prevent tragedy.”
Overall, the agency is asking for 37 new full-time equivalent employees to improve staffing in the child welfare system.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/green-hill-school-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-17 16:57:47.465062

Mikie Sherrill (D) an edge over Jack Ciattarelli (R) as the two vie to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy in November.,"Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill are competing in November to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy (Photos by Dana DiFilippo and Amanda Brown)Democrat Mikie Sherrill holds an 8-point lead over Republican Jack Ciattarelli, according to a new poll of New Jersey’s gubernatorial race.
The Quinnipiac University poll of likely voters released Wednesday found Sherrill, a four-term congresswoman, with 49% support, compared with 41% for Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman who was also the GOP candidate for governor in 2021. Third-party candidates picked up about 2% combined, while 4% of respondents were undecided.
Quinnipiac pollster Tim Malloy said Sherrill’s edge in the race “is by no means a sure-fire indication she’s headed to Trenton.” She and Ciattarelli are vying to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat who cannot seek a third term in November.
“Republican voters are more enthusiastic about voting for their candidate than Democrats are about theirs, though the difference is not dramatic,” Malloy said. 
This is the third poll in as many months that found Sherrill leading by single digits in the governor’s race. A July Fairleigh Dickinson University poll gave Sherrill an 8-point lead, and she led by nine points in a Rutgers University poll from August.
Republicans have dismissed polls, citing those of the 2021 gubernatorial race that gave Murphy a wide margin over Ciattarelli. Murphy ended up winning that race by three points.
Taxes remain the top issue on voters’ minds this year, with nearly a third of respondents reporting it was the most important of 11 issues presented to them. Forty-six percent of respondents said Ciattarelli would do a better job handling property taxes, while 40% said Sherrill.
“You can bet in the weeks leading up to the election, Ciattarelli will be portrayed by his team as a problem solver with a solid business background who is better equipped to corral property tax rates, the overwhelming concern for registered New Jersey voters,” Malloy said.
The poll says Republicans’ top three issues are taxes, immigration, and crime, while Democrats are worried about ethics in government, health care, and taxes.
President Donald Trump gets poor marks in the survey. Fifty-five percent of respondents said they disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job, and 50% said they would like to see the next governor stand up to the president. 
Sherrill holds a 20-point advantage with women voters, with 55% percent backing her over Ciattarelli. Malloy said that’s common nationally, as more women cast ballots than men, and Republicans take heat for their records on abortion.
“Virtually every GOP candidate faces that hurdle,” Malloy said.

Racine officials on Wednesday released the records related to the projected usage of water at Microsoft’s planned artificial intelligence data center seven months after they’d been initially requested by a Milwaukee-based water quality advocacy group and days after a lawsuit was filed to force their publication. 
The data center is currently under construction at the site initially planned to hold the Foxconn manufacturing plant in Mount Pleasant and expected to begin operation next year. 
Data centers require a huge amount of energy to keep running and use a significant amount of water to keep the servers inside cool. The water for the data center is being provided by the Racine Water Utility under an agreement with the village of Mount Pleasant. The Foxconn site has already been subject to water-based controversy after concerns were raised that water would be diverted from Lake Michigan to the area. 
The Great Lakes watershed around the southwest tip of Lake Michigan does not extend very far off the shoreline, meaning any water taken to Mount Pleasant is taking water away from the Great Lakes — threatening the agreements in the Great Lakes compact and risking the creation of a precedent across the eight U.S. states and two Canadian provinces along the Great Lakes shoreline. 
According to the Racine projections, the first phase of operations on the data center campus would use a peak of 234,000 gallons per day or 2.8 million gallons per year. In later phases, as more substations go online, the campus would use 702,000 gallons per day or 8.4 million gallons per year.
An Olympic-sized swimming pool holds about 660,000 gallons of water. Lake Michigan holds 1.3 quadrillion gallons of water. 
On Monday, Madison-based Midwest Environmental Advocates filed a lawsuit on behalf of Milwaukee Riverkeepers to release the requested water use projections, which the water organization had initially asked for in a February open records request. 
“Data centers will have major implications for Wisconsin’s environment. Our ability to understand the impacts and protect our water resources depends on open and transparent government,” Milwaukee Riverkeeper’s Cheryl Nenn said. 
Across the country and Wisconsin, data centers such as the site in Mount Pleasant have been proliferating as tech companies race to develop AI tools and chatbots. In some cases, the tech companies have required local governments to sign non-disclosure agreements that cover information beyond proprietary secrets and include potential community impacts. 
City officials said Wednesday the request took so long to complete because the city was making sure that providing the information did not violate a contractual agreement. 
“Open and transparent government is not optional; it is essential to public trust,” Racine Mayor Cory Mason said in a statement. “While we needed time to ensure that we handled this request responsibly and in compliance with legal agreements, we believe transparency is paramount. The information has been released, and we remain committed to making all relevant government records accessible so our community can see how decisions are made and resources are used.”

Democratic and Republican political leaders have universally condemned the killing of prominent conservative activist Charlie Kirk. But President Donald Trump lashed out at Democrats and other political opponents, charging without evidence that their “rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today.” Trump and other top officials are now promising a broad crackdown on the free speech of his opponents.
U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that she would “absolutely target” protesters engaging in what she called “hate speech.”
Critics, including many conservatives, have noted that the first amendment right to speech does not include an exception for “hate speech” and that it would be unconstitutional to target people for their overheated rhetoric.
“So-called ‘hate speech’ is free speech,” asserted Aaron Terr in an essay for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), where he is director of public advocacy. FIRE is a national group that advocates for and defends free speech.
“The ever looming threat is that when people are in power, they always are going to have this motivation to crack down on speech that threatens their hold on power, that opposes their policies and their views,” Terr told The Vermont Conversation.
“I’m worried that (Trump) is setting the stage for a broader government crackdown on speech on the administration’s political opponents and that will really only make the situation worse,” said Terr. “The remedy that our First Amendment envisions for speech that we find potentially harmful is not to suppress it. It’s not to silence the speaker, but to push back against it, to call it out, to counter it with better ideas.”
Notably missing from Trump’s broadsides are actual examples of leading Democrats or liberal organizations “celebrating” Kirk’s murder.
The baseless argument that Democrats and the Left are responsible for a violent conspiracy against the country obscures the reality that the overwhelming source of political violence in the U.S. comes from the far right. A study examining terrorism in the U.S. in recent years showed that violent far-right extremists have been responsible for 87% of the terrorism fatalities in the United States and 69% of the attacks.
In a political environment in which the president characterizes his opponents as “evil” and “scum,” violence has become normalized. FIRE recently published the results of a survey of college students that revealed that in 2020, about 1 in 5 students said it was “ever acceptable to use violence” to stop a speaker. That number has since risen to 1 in 3 students, a 50% increase in the level of support for political violence among college students over the last 5 years.
“Free speech isn’t a conservative or liberal value. It’s a constitutional value. It’s a check on power,” Terr said. “We need the First Amendment because power brings with it the temptation to silence dissent. That’s human nature. And the beauty of free speech is it ensures that no single person or administration can declare by fiat what’s true or false, what’s right or wrong and make it illegal to disagree. And wherever you fall politically, you have a stake in being free from that kind of authoritarian control. My biggest worry is that people are just losing faith in the importance of free speech.”

The plans dealt with several issues, from workforce development to providing behavioral health. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Several working groups briefed a state task force on Tuesday regarding plans to improve the re-entry process for those coming out of prison and for reducing the state’s recidivism rate.
“The working groups are really focused on being in the weeds of how we can get these recommendations through, how can we develop them into strategies, and into action plans, and into some next steps,” said Megan Pfeiffer, a project manager with the Council of State Governments Justice Center, told members of the Alabama Reentry Task Force.
The Commission formed in 2021 and was reauthorized in 2024 to address structural barriers faced by former inmates after release.  In October 2023, Alabama partnered with the Council of State Governments Justice Center with a goal of cutting the state’s recidivism rate in half, to less than 15%, by 2030. For the past couple years, the group has met monthly to discuss the barriers and other issues that hinder the progress of those seeking to reenter society after incarceration.

The discussions led to a report that identified the problems endured during reentry, and the Alabama Reentry Task Force convened its first meeting in June stemming from a joint resolution from the Legislature to build on the work of the commission.
Some of the findings in the report included goals spread across several key areas such as infrastructure, workforce development, behavioral health and housing, as well as gathering the appropriate data to ensure the intervention measures are making progress.
A representative from each of the working groups provided members of the task force on Tuesday with an update regarding their plans.
“Our objectives were cross-system collaboration and communication between the agencies in order to better the treatment and care of the justice-involved individuals coming from the Alabama Department of Corrections,” said Rebecca Bensema, assistant director for reentry with the Alabama Bureau of Pardons and Paroles.
Members are working on a plan to establish a continuum so that people may continue to receive treatment services as they proceed throughout the system and eliminate any gaps that could lead to adverse outcomes.
Another working group focused on workforce development and career opportunities. One problem that the group is working to address is how incarcerated people may prepare for a career while in prison, but find upon release that their criminal history prevents them from finding work in the field, according to Jonathan McNair, public relations and communications specialist with the Alabama Department of Workforce
“Part of the onus of this group is to make sure those things do not happen, and that people are not informed of what services are available to them upfront to make sure that those barriers do not exist once they get down the road and they get out there and get into the workforce,” he said.
The groups are still working through the logistics for each of their proposals and will develop detailed plans in the coming months.
Brian Longo, associate vice president with Unite Us was awarded a contract to create a software platform that allows different agencies to access information about people in the reentry process.
The system could assist agencies that provide services to people released from prison by facilitating coordination and tracking outcomes.
“The goal of the partnership is to create a connective tissue, a connective tool, a unified system focused on interagency collaboration and data sharing across agencies,” he said during the meeting. “Unite Us can act as a tool to improve coordination across agencies, to improve the way in which connections are made out to service providers and to provide data that can drive this committee and other decision-making bodies decisions.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250916_140838-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-17 16:57:47.465062

The Gamefowl Commission, which had advocated for lessening cockfighting penalties, will pay the full amount in monthly payments beginning Oct. 1 and ending by Sept. 1, 2027. The committee must dissolve within 30 days and cannot form a new affiliated political action committee for two years. 
As part of the settlement, first made public Wednesday, the political action committee admitted to violating several ethics rules. Among the violations were accepting anonymous contributions above the legal limit, failing to collect the required contact information of contributors, spending funds outside the committee’s purpose, accepting prohibited corporate contributions and failing to maintain accurate records. 
Lee Anne Bruce Boone, executive director of the Ethics Commission, said the political action committee is being held responsible with “real and lasting repercussions.”
“These violations were not mere oversights — they were blatant breaches of the law that undermine public trust in the fairness of Oklahoma’s elections,” she said in a statement. 
Bruce Boone said the settlement only addresses the matters from a specific Ethics Commission investigation. It does not prevent criminal or civil charges from being filed if other groups have a claim related to these allegations, she said in a statement.  
Anthony DeVore, president of the Oklahoma Gamefowl Commission, did not immediately return a message left seeking comment Thursday.

In an email announcing her bid, James said she intends to prioritize expanding access to affordable health care, supporting small businesses, ensuring quality education and tackling the rising cost of living. 
James was raised in Colorado and is a first-generation graduate of the University of Colorado Boulder. She is the first Black woman commissioned through the school’s Naval ROTC Battalion, according to her campaign website. James and her husband founded Simply Pure, said to be the first Black-owned cannabis dispensary in the country.
DeGette is Colorado’s longest serving member of Congress, having first been elected in 1996. 
James was elected to the Board of Regents in 2022. The board voted to censure James in July because they said comments she made objecting to a CU Anschutz campaign educating people about the risks of cannabis use represented a conflict of interest between her role as a regent and as an owner of a cannabis company. James said the campaign included racist tropes.

CMDA, formerly called the Municipal Redevelopment Authority, was established in 2019 as an unfunded entity; Last year, it officially received funding and launched operations. The authority is tasked with offering financial and technical assistance to towns looking to increase density near train and bus rapid transit stations and in downtowns.
Since it launched, 26 towns have agreed to partner with the agency. About five are likely to have their contracts with the agency approved later this month.
Naugatuck was the first municipality to join up with CMDA. Authority director David Kooris said he anticipates his board will approve that contract in the coming days. Other towns have a few more details to iron out, but Kooris said he hopes they’ll be ready.
For Naugatuck, this means developers working on projects will soon be eligible to apply for funding through CMDA. The agency has $90 million in bonding — $60 million that’s already available and another $30 million for the next fiscal year. Much of the funding will be doled out in loans, which the authority will then use to fund more projects once the loans are repaid.
“They’re all across the state. They’re all different sizes,” Kooris said of the towns he’s working with. “I think it is a testament to the fact that CMDA is a robust and diverse toolkit that can be tailored to meet the needs of our municipal partners, even if they have very different challenges and opportunities within their borders.”
Naugatuck is in the process of relocating its train station, which will be across the street from a new housing development and near some old commercial space that could be converted into apartments. Local officials say they hope this will encourage people to walk to the train station and to some of the borough’s nearby shops.

“We want vibrancy,” said Mayor Pete Hess, on a walking tour of the area where CMDA will work. “We want people walking, eating, drinking, shopping using the train.”
That effort is paired with another project aimed at improving walkability in the nearby downtown, where workers were putting in new brick sidewalks late last month. It’s an expensive project, and the town will need improved infrastructure, Hess said in the spring. 
But just as he was worrying over the small town being unable to afford the cost, “Out of nowhere, an angel came from above, and it was CMDA,” he said.
CMDA’s work is based on a land use concept known as transit-oriented development, which seeks to build walkable communities where people can easily access businesses, housing and public transit. It often requires higher density, which increases the housing stock.
Municipalities opt in to work with CMDA. After meetings, analysis and public comment, the town’s governing body can vote to join as a member municipality. The towns that join will likely need to agree to make certain zoning changes in the areas of town they want to work in. Then, a memorandum of understanding is developed between the agencies and approved by the CMDA board. That makes the town eligible for technical assistance and funding.
“We don’t have the authority to usurp zoning control,” Kooris said. “We don’t have the authority to override local decision making.” Still, he added, there’s been a “pronounced uptick in interest” from towns in the last six months.
Kooris said he’s gotten questions about whether the authority would decide on projects without the town’s input. He said CMDA works with projects that already have zoning approval from the town, and it won’t fund projects that come in through affordable housing developers suing towns under the 8-30g statute.
The legislature included a few measures in budget legislation earlier this year to make it easier for towns to opt in to working with CMDA. For towns that have a council and a representative town meeting, only the council will need to approve the opt-in as of Oct. 1, when the legislation goes into effect.
Public comment will also be allowed at meetings where the local legislative body votes on the measure; Previously, a separate public hearing was required.
Nearly every town in Connecticut is now eligible to participate. Under the original statute, towns in the Hartford area that were a part of the Capitol Region Development Authority weren’t eligible to join CMDA.
This year’s state budget legislation also allows for towns with a nearby transit station that’s not technically within their town boundaries to include property that’s near the neighboring town’s station in a designated CMDA project zone. For example, Bridgeport could include its land close to the Fairfield-Black Rock train station in a transit zone, even if Fairfield hadn’t opted to join CMDA.
Kooris said it’s likely more towns will join when these changes go into effect.
“We have a lot of flexibility in what we can support as long as there’s a direct nexus between either the infrastructure or the project funding and the creation of housing units within the context of vibrant, mixed use, walkable downtowns or transit oriented districts,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025_0423_SR_DavidKooris_021-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-17 15:57:15.606824

“I will make news right now. We are moving, as we speak, for a preliminary injunction to overturn the stop-work order right now,” Tong told the Connecticut Building Trades Council convention at the Mohegan Sun casino, prompting applause.
Lawyers for the two states, which have contracts to purchase power to be generated by wind turbines off the Rhode Island coast, are filing in U.S. District Court in Providence for an injunction that would lift a federal stop-work order while the issue is litigated, Tong said.
The Trump administration issued the unprecedented order to stop work on a fully permitted, multibillion-dollar project that was initiated during Donald Trump’s first presidency and was 80% complete, promising the delivery of enough power next year to light 350,000 homes in Connecticut and Rhode Island.
Tong already had filed suit, but he said he had delayed seeking an injunction at the urging of Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat and former businessman who wanted to first attempt negotiation through contacts, most notably a former fellow governor, Douglas Burgum, who is Trump’s secretary of the interior. 
The attorney general said he was acting with the consent of the governor, who told him he saw no sign of the Trump administration wanting to find a solution.
Lamont addressed the convention earlier Wednesday, complaining that the Trump administration was no closer to explaining in detail why it halted the project, other than vague claims of national security — or what it would take to lift the stop-work order, issued a week before Labor Day.
“I want to know: What does it take to get this thing open?” Lamont said. “Tell me what it is. Show me the ransom note.”
“Ransom note” was an unusually blunt reference, at least for Lamont, to the accusations that Trump is willing to use executive actions on one issue to force a concession on something else. 
His administration halted a different wind project off New York until Gov. Kathy Hochul dropped her opposition to a gas pipeline sought by Trump.
“I’m a pretty patient guy. I work hard on relationships,” Lamont said. “I work hard on relationships in the Biden administration and the Trump administration. I have pretty good relationships with [the departments of] Energy and Interior and even in the White House down there.”
But Lamont said no one would articulate a reason for the shutdown of a project that had undergone exhaustive review before it was permitted to proceed under a lease from the federal government. 
“You just can’t trust this administration. This administration is, in many ways, hostile to business. This is crony capitalism,” Lamont said. “We had a deal. I know that the president hates wind power. He’s been quite expressive on that subject. But we also know that a deal is a deal.”
Connecticut and Rhode Island filed suit in U.S. District Court on Sept. 4 in Rhode Island, opposing the stop-work order, stopping short of a demand for an injunction. Ørsted, the Danish company building Revolution Wind, filed a similar action in the District of Columbia.
The Trump administration defended the order this week in federal court in Washington, but Tong said it still has not identified specific reasons for a halting work after two years of a construction.
“The Order does not identify any violation of law, any imminent threat to safety, or any judicial decree requiring suspension,” Tong and Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Neronha wrote in their motion for an injunction.
House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, who also spoke at the convention, said in an interview after addressing delegates that he favored completion of Revolution Wind and that the Trump administration owed the public an explanation for halting it.
“I think when a government suspends a project they have an obligation to immediately state the grounds for that suspension, so that there could be corrective action and it could be moved forward,” Candelora said. “That project needs to be completed. It’s almost done.”
Candelora said he generally was wary about the cost of wind power, but he noted that Revolution Wind offered a relatively competitive price, unlike another wind project that Lamont had refused to support.
“I think stopping this project is unrealistic and will cause more harm in the long run,” he said.
Lamont said Ørsted is under pressure to continue the project or potentially lose access to specialty vessels leased for construction.
“I think we’ve got a little more time,” Lamont said. “But that’s measured in maybe weeks, not longer than that, days or weeks, actually.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A1C9ADB5-49AB-4477-945A-24AD2CA10FA6-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-17 15:57:15.606824
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-17 19:41:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Watertown residents accept plan to bail out town’s water debt to Waterbury,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/17/watertown-waterbury-water-referendum/,The vote to borrow money for unpaid water bills followed years of negotiation and litigation between the two appropriately named communities.,"Voters in Watertown on Tuesday agreed to borrow up to $30 million to pay off years of unpaid water bills that local officials had warned threatened to plunge the town into a fiscal crisis.
According to results posted on the town’s website, more than 70% of voters approved the referendum, allowing officials to breathe at least a temporary sigh of relief.
“We need to pass this and pay the bond off and determine a way to move forward,” Town Council Chairwoman Mary Ann Rosa said prior to the vote. “The devastation that a ‘no’ vote will cost the town will be overwhelming and will only lead to higher costs for ratepayers.”
The referendum followed years of negotiations and, ultimately, litigation over water between two appropriately named communities: Waterbury and Watertown. 
The squabble began in 2018 when Waterbury — facing mounting costs to operate and maintain its aging water and sewer infrastructure — decided to begin charging its smaller neighbor higher rates to use those systems. 
For decades, contracts between the two towns provided Watertown with water and sewer services at much lower rates than those paid by Waterbury residents. Waterbury’s decision stop offering a discount doubled the price Watertown paid for water, while sewer prices rose by over 300%.
The response from officials in Watertown was to continue paying the old rates for water and sewer while protesting the price increases. 
After several months, Waterbury sued its neighbor to begin collecting the debt. In 2023, a superior court judge ruled in the city’s favor, ordering Watertown to pay $18.8 million in unpaid water bills. 
Watertown appealed that decision while continuing to pay the lower rates. By the time the Connecticut Appellate Court upheld the lower court’s ruling earlier this year, Watertown’s debts had ballooned to more than $34 million — nearly the equivalent of town’s entire annual budget.
After losing their appeal, officials in Watertown began paying the higher water rates. But the town is still accumulating over $10,000 in interest each day on its debts.
Waterbury Mayor Paul Pernerewski expressed satisfaction with the results of the referendum on Wednesday, saying that a “little bit more” work is needed before city can begin collecting the debt.
“It’s been a long, ongoing dispute,” Pernerewski said. “I think we’re at the point now where the whole issue can be resolved.”
Even with a path now open for the town to begin paying off its debts, residents in Watertown have expressed outrage at their elected officials for allowing the issue to snowball and frustration at the town’s messaging around the plan to borrow money to pay back its debts.
“They never looked into what would happen if we lost,” the appeal, said Katherine Camera, a resident of the Oakville neighborhood who opposed the referendum. “So scrambling now and telling people, you know, ‘You have to do this, you have to do this,’ when we’re not really ready, we don’t really even understand, it’s just bizarre to me.”
The bonds themselves are to be paid back by the roughly 4,300 customers of the town’s Water and Sewer Authority.
Prior to the vote, Watertown released estimates stating that the bonds will add around $295 a year to the average customer’s water bill. But Camera, who said her usage is less than the publicized average, received a separate estimate at a public meeting in August showing her added costs could be up to $1,136 a year. (Camera is one of a slate of Independent Party candidates running against the Republican-led town council in the November municipal elections.)
In addition, the town also published information stating that the Watertown Fire District — a separate utility located within the town’s borders — will contribute $6 million toward paying off the debt to Waterbury. Officials with the Fire District, however, released their own statement saying they had not made any such arrangements and had no obligation to do so.
Representatives of the Fire District were not immediately available for comment on Wednesday. 
Watertown Town Manager Mark A. Raimo said the Fire District is bound by a 1970s-era agreement to pay for its share of the town’s debt and that two sides are engaged in ongoing conversations. “This is a problem they have to work with us to resolve,” he said.
Another option being discussed by town leaders could offset much if not all of the costs from the bonds: selling the water system to a private entity.
Rosa, the council chairwoman, said Wednesday that a task force, convened by the town to study the next steps, is likely to look into a potential sale, which would require the town to solicit bids and hold another referendum.
“Will there be interest? Companies have expressed that, yes, there will be,” she said, without naming any specific interest bidders. “But we have to go through the legal procedures to make it official.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Morris-and-Wigwam-Reservoirs-1024x567.jpg,,,2025-09-17 16:57:47.465062
,DC,2025-09-17 19:40:55+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Former CDC chief says she was fired for resisting RFK Jr. orders on vaccines,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/former-cdc-chief-says-she-was-fired-resisting-rfk-jr-orders-vaccines,,"WASHINGTON — Former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez testified before a U.S. Senate committee Wednesday that she was fired after just 29 days because she refused to pre-approve vaccine recommendations or fire career officials for no reason. Monarez, who was nominated by President Donald Trump earlier this year and confirmed by the Senate in July on a party-line vote, became a central figure in the country’s debate over public health last month after she refused to resign. Monarez testified that during a meeting in late August, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told her she needed to commit to approving upcoming recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices without reviewing any data or research. “He also directed me to dismiss career officials responsible for vaccine policy without cause. He said if I was unwilling to do both, I should resign,” Monarez said. “I responded that I could not pre-approve recommendations without reviewing the evidence and I had no basis to fire scientific experts.""Monarez testified before the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee during the nearly three-hour hearing that she told Kennedy if he didn’t trust her, then he could fire her.During that same late August meeting, Monarez said Kennedy told her the childhood vaccine schedule would be changing in September and that she needed to be on board with that.“We got into an exchange where I had suggested that I would be open to changing childhood vaccine schedules if the evidence or science was supportive,” Monarez testified. “And he responded that there was no science or evidence associated with the childhood vaccine schedule.""ACIP is scheduled to meet Thursday and Friday at the CDC’s headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. Kennedy testified before a separate Senate committee earlier this month that he did demand that Monarez fire career CDC scientists but said he didn’t tell her to accept the recommendations of the vaccine advisory panel without further review.""What I asked her about is she had made a statement that she was going to not sign on and I wanted clarification about that,"" Kennedy said at the time. “I told her I didn’t want her to have a role if she’s not going to sign onto it.”Vaccine safety at issueMonarez said that undermining vaccine safety will lead to an increase in preventable diseases, some of which have long-term or even lifelong consequences for children's health. “I believe that we will have our children harmed for things that we know they do not need to be harmed by — polio, measles, diphtheria, chickenpox,” she said. Former CDC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Debra Houry told the committee there are significant ramifications if the new members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, who were appointed by Kennedy after he fired all of the former members, don’t use rigorous science and data to make their recommendations. “It's going to be heartbreaking,” Houry said. “I think what concerns me is these aren't harmless diseases. We just saw the case in California of a young child that died of encephalitis years after measles. These diseases have long-term consequences and in the U.S. we have gone so far in reversing this. We don't want our children to die.”  Houry was one of several CDC officials who resigned after learning about Monarez’s firing, which happened just weeks after a gunman opened fire at the CDC’s headquarters, killing a police officer. Both Monarez and Houry testified, in response to a question from Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, that confusion about vaccines and CDC recommendations had real consequences. “I myself was subject to threats,” Monarez said. “And I am very concerned that the further promulgation of misleading information will undermine not just the safety and health of our children, but it will also exacerbate some of these tensions — the willingness to commit harm if someone is affronted by a belief that the people like us that are trying to help them are actually not trying to help them.” Houry told the committee the gunman fired about 500 rounds, with approximately 180 of those hitting the building. “Each bullet was meant for a person, and each of my staff were very traumatized afterwards,” Houry said. “I had staff that were covering their kids in the day care parking lot. There were people that were out at the ride-share as bullets were passing over their head. I have many that won't speak about vaccines now and removed their names off of the papers. They don't wish to present publicly anymore because they feel they were personally targeted because of misinformation.”‘Did we do something wrong?’HELP Committee Chairman Bill Cassidy, R-La., said at the beginning of the hearing he intended to invite Kennedy and possibly other HHS officials to testify before his committee later in the year if they wanted to respond to what was said in the Wednesday hearing. He also raised concerns that Monarez was fired after less than a month in the role, despite her being nominated by Trump, confirmed by the Senate and Kennedy saying while swearing her in that she had “unimpeachable scientific credentials.”""We as senators need to ask ourselves, did we look past something? Did we do something wrong?” Cassidy said. “It may be that we did nothing wrong, in which case, Dr. Monarez and Dr. Houry, the onus is upon you to prove that the criticisms leveled by the secretary are not true.”

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)

Cassidy later added that “it may be impossible to learn who's telling the truth.”Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, ranking member on the committee, said the Trump administration’s decision to fire Monarez after less than a month in the CDC director’s role was because “she refused to act as a rubber stamp to implement Secretary Kennedy's dangerous agenda to substantially limit the use of safe and effective vaccines that would endanger the lives of the American people and people throughout the world.”Sanders raised concerns that the loss of career officials at the CDC and other federal health agencies could hamper the country from addressing disease outbreaks in the months and years ahead. Confusion over whether Monarez was recordedThere were a few awkward moments in the hearing, in addition to the serious discussion about the Trump administration’s approach to public health. One came after Florida Republican Sen. Ashley Moody mentioned twice during her five minutes of questions that Monarez had spoken with Cassidy about her firing, implying that was somehow improper.  Cassidy gave a lengthy statement afterward, clarifying the record. “As chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over the CDC that favorably reported Dr. Monarez as the CDC director, it is entirely appropriate for someone with oversight concerns to contact my office, or me, or frankly any of us,” Cassidy said. “Upon receiving outreach from Dr. Monarez, I contacted both the secretary and the White House to inquire about what was happening and to express concerns about what was alleged. As soon as the director was fired, the HELP Committee began reviewing the situation, as it is our responsibility, and any and all communication with the witnesses was conducted by HELP staff in coordination with attorneys.”Another somewhat uncomfortable and slightly confusing moment came after Oklahoma Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin told Monarez that someone had recorded her meeting or meetings with Kennedy.Mullin then repeatedly questioned her recollection of her conversations with Kennedy, implying that he had a different view because he had listened to the recording. The exchange led Cassidy to give another statement to the committee. He appeared somewhat frustrated that someone gave just one senator on the panel the recording, that Mullin had not shared it with any other members of the committee and that HHS had chosen not to give it to the committee in response to a request for documents related to Monarez’s firing. “If a recording does not exist, I ask Sen. Mullin to retract his line of questions,” Cassidy said. “I'll also note that if he has it, I'm also curious why only one senator was given this and why we're just hearing about it now.""A few minutes later, Cassidy announced to the hearing room that Mullin told reporters elsewhere that he was mistaken about there being a recording of the meeting or meetings. Monarez lawyerSeveral GOP senators on the panel also questioned Monarez at length about when and why she chose to hire legal representation and why she ultimately went with Mark Zaid, who has made public statements against Trump and his policies. Monarez testified that she wasn’t aware of Zaid’s political beliefs when she hired him and hasn’t spoken with him about politics. “I was seeking some critical counsel to be able to help me make sure that I was understanding and aware of everything that had transpired and preparing for what might be next, including this committee hearing,” Monarez said. “Mark and I have never spoken about politics. I never asked him about his politics. He has never asked me about my politics.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-09-17 15:57:15.606824

A coalition of public school advocates announced Wednesday that it’s filing a lawsuit seeking to block House Bill 93, Idaho’s first private school choice program.
The coalition — which includes the Idaho Education Association, the Moscow School District and two advocacy groups — held a news conference Wednesday at the Statehouse in Boise. Leaders for the group said they planned to file a petition with the Idaho Supreme Court later that day.
The petition will ask justices to declare HB 93’s tax credit unconstitutional and block the Idaho State Tax Commission from implementing it. The program violates the Idaho Constitution’s requirement that the state “establish and maintain a general, uniform and thorough system of public free common schools,” the coalition argues.

“These 14 words are simple, yet they’re profound, and HB 93 has no basis in them,” said Daniel Mooney, a Boise attorney and president of the Committee to Protect and Preserve the Idaho Constitution, one of the advocacy groups involved in the coalition.
The GOP-dominated Legislature approved HB 93 in February, and Republican Gov. Brad Little signed it into law — despite strong public opposition to the proposal.  The bill created the state’s first private school program after years of debate, and Idaho joined dozens of other Republican-led states in unlocking taxpayer dollars for private and home schooling.
Recipients of the tax credit, which is scheduled to launch in January, are eligible for up to $5,000 — or $7,500 for students with special needs — covering private school tuition and other expenses for non-public education.
The lawsuit came as no surprise to HB 93 co-sponsor Rep. Wendy Horman, R-Idaho Falls.
“We’ve been anticipating this,” she told Idaho Education News on Wednesday. “We are as confident as we ever have been in the constitutionality of this bill, both with the Idaho Constitution and the United States Constitution.”
Other plaintiffs in the forthcoming lawsuit include Mormon Women for Ethical Government and several individuals, including former Republican state superintendent Jerry Evans and current Rep. Stephanie Mickelsen, R-Idaho Falls.

The NAS, a non-governmental nonprofit set up to advise the government on science, said human activity is releasing greenhouse gases that are warming the planet, increasing extreme temperatures and changing the oceans, all dangerous developments for the health and welfare of the United States public. Evidence to that effect has only grown stronger since 2009, the group said.
[RELATED: CT battling Trump EPA proposal to end greenhouse gas regulation]
In July, the Trump administration proposed revoking what’s known as the “endangerment” finding, the concept that climate change is a threat. The finding underpins many environmental regulations adopted in the U.S. and overturning it could pave the way for cutting a range of rules that limit pollution from cars, power plants and other sources.
“EPA’s 2009 finding that the human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases threaten human health and welfare was accurate, has stood the test of time, and is now reinforced by even stronger evidence,” the NAS said. Science that was uncertain or tentative in 2009 has now been resolved, it said, and new risks have been found, too.
The NAS was established in 1863 under President Abraham Lincoln and has played a significant public role in scientific policy for more than a century, including consulting on the Clean Air Act.
“The importance of getting the science right weighed heavily on the committee’s deliberations, given the potential significant implications of a changing climate and of the actions proposed to address it,” NAS committee chair and former Princeton University President Shirley Tilghman wrote in the preface to Wednesday’s report.
“Unlike earthquakes and volcanoes, over which we have no control, responding to the potential harm to human health and welfare from changes in the climate is actionable now,” Tilghman wrote.
The Trump administration looks to undo more than a decade of regulations
Under President Donald Trump, the Department of Energy has suggested that climate models used by scientists to predict warming have overreached, that long-term trends for disasters generally don’t show much change and that climate has little impact on the economy. The DOE also said there are advantages to a world with more carbon, like increased plant growth.
In a statement, EPA said the endangerment finding was used by the Obama and Biden administrations to justify “trillions of dollars of greenhouse gas regulations” and that many of the “extremely pessimistic predictions and assumptions EPA relied upon have not materialized as expected.”
The Trump administration’s work has already been met by strong pushback from the scientific community, including dozens of experts who responded to a survey from The Associated Press. The vast majority of respondents were highly critical of science the administration put forward as it argued to revoke the endangerment finding. Many described it as filled with errors, bias and distortion.
A battle with mainstream science
Other mainstream groups, including the American Meteorological Society, have also criticized the administration’s work. A group of 85 climate experts found it “full of errors, and not fit to inform policy making.” Environmental groups are already challenging the administration’s documents in court.
A White House spokesperson previously told The Associated Press that the Trump administration “is producing Gold Standard Science research driven by verifiable data” and that the endangerment finding had long been misused to justify expensive regulations “that have jeopardized our economic and national security.”
The Trump administration maintains that while climate change is real, its future effects are unclear and likely weaker than projected by many mainstream scientists. The administration also contends that U.S. cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, which largely come from burning fuels like oil and coal, would mean little globally.
The authors of the Department of Energy report said in August that any errors found in the work would be corrected and that the report is not meant to be a comprehensive review of climate science. They said the report was intended to focus on topics that have been “underreported or overlooked in media and political discussions.”
The National Academy of Sciences said in its report released Wednesday that harm to Americans from climate change is real. People are exposed to more extreme heat, air pollution and extreme weather events, just to name a sampling of the threats, NAS said.

Circuit Judge Michael Froble issued a subpoena requiring Dr. Mark McDaniel to appear in his courtroom during the lawsuit’s next scheduled hearing in October.
“…the Court finds that the testimony of Dr. Mark E. McDaniel, Acting State Health Officer, is relevant to the issues in this matter and that calling this witness will assist the Court without causing unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, undue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence under Rule 403 of West Virginia Rules of Evidence,” Froble wrote in the order, filed Tuesday. 
McDaniel, a doctor of osteopathic medicine and a retired state air surgeon for the West Virginia National Guard, started last month as acting state health officer. 
He told West Virginia Watch he agrees with Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s opinion that the state should allow school children religious exemptions to the state’s mandatory vaccination law. 
“I agree with Gov. Morrisey’s position that no West Virginian should ever be forced to choose between their religious convictions and access to education,” he said through a Department of Health spokesperson in response to questions from West Virginia Watch. “Our governor’s leadership makes clear that protecting fundamental freedoms can go hand-in-hand with safeguarding public health.”
McDaniel will testify as part of a hearing in a lawsuit against the state and Raleigh County boards of education. Families in Raleigh County are suing the boards to allow their children to attend school with religious exemptions to the state’s school vaccination requirements. Froble in July issued a preliminary injunction allowing the students in the case to attend school with a religious exemption. The state Department of Education has appealed to the state Supreme Court over the preliminary decision.
The Raleigh County lawsuit has also been consolidated with another lawsuit filed by the parents of immunocompromised parents against the state Department of Health. The parents, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of West Virginia and Mountain State Justice, are seeking to stop the health department from issuing religious exemptions. 
All states require students to be vaccinated against a series of infectious diseases including chickenpox, polio and measles. West Virginia has been one of only five states that do not allow families to opt out of the requirements because of religious or philosophical objections to the shots. State law currently allows families only medical exemptions to the requirements. 
Morrisey issued an executive order in January requiring the state to allow religious exemptions. 
His order is based on the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act, which says that “no state action may burden a person’s exercise of freedom of religion, unless doing so is essential and is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest.” The governor argues that the school vaccine law, when read along since EPRA, requires the state to allow religious exemptions.
Morrisey has not rescinded the order even though the Legislature earlier this year rejected a bill that would have established the religious exemptions in state law. 
During a two-day hearing in the case earlier this month, former state health officer Dr. Cathy Slemp testified that the state’s current vaccination law, without religious exemptions, is the best way to protect the state’s public health goals.
“At the end of the day, the… compulsory vaccine law actually is about creating healthy communities,” Slemp told the court. “It’s about protecting the health and safety of children, having a well vaccinated population so that we decrease disease spread and the occurrence of outbreaks.”
The hearing on permanent injunction is expected to continue at 9 a.m. Oct. 8 and 9 at the Raleigh County Judicial Center in Beckley.

MONTPELIER — Gov. Phil Scott signed an executive order Wednesday aimed at speeding up new housing production in Vermont by rolling back regulations that he said have been slowing down projects and making them more expensive for developers. 
The order is notable because it comes when the Vermont Legislature is out of session until January but focuses on one of the most contentious issues Scott and state legislators have grappled with in recent years. Alex Farrell, the state’s commissioner of housing and community development, said the measures put into effect by the order do not require legislative approval.
“This executive order is an attempt to pull the levers that we have control over,” Farrell said. He added that its provisions take effect immediately. 
Scott announced and signed the order at a press conference Wednesday, flanked by housing developers and administration officials. He told reporters that Vermont’s need for new housing was too great to wait for the legislative session to start, and then for legislators to debate and pass additional bills, which could take several months. 
Scott said the effort made by lawmakers in past sessions “hasn’t led to enough changes in the right direction.”

He and Farrell said the state needs to build at least 40,000 new homes by 2030 to meet future demand.
“We need relief right now — so think of this as just catching up on the backlog,” Scott said.
The order allows developers to comply with residential and commercial building energy standards put in place in 2020, which had been superseded by newer standards from 2024. The flexibility in allowing the use of either set of standards, the order states, “is intended to be used to make housing more affordable for the buyer.”
Scott’s directive also tasks regulators under his purview with fast-tracking all housing-related permitting processes. It directs state government agencies that handle housing-related permits to prioritize residential, mobile-home and shelter applications for review.

Regulators should process multiple permits at a time, rather than sequentially, under the order. And it names a goal to halve the timeline of review periods for residential and shelter projects. 
Scott’s order also asks the Vermont judiciary to “prioritize and expedite” court proceedings for appeals of housing permits, among other measures.

(Photo by Mary Ann Chastain / Special to the SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The state Supreme Court upheld South Carolina’s congressional voting lines Wednesday by ruling there’s nothing unconstitutional about partisan gerrymandering.
The decision marks the second time in less than two years that a high court has validated the map redrawn by the Legislature following the 2020 census.
“After years of litigation — only for the federal and state supreme courts to tell us what we knew all along — I am grateful to see this matter finally resolved,” Senate President Thomas Alexander, R-Walhalla, said in a statement.
After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in May 2024 that the lines did not racially discriminate, the League of Women Voters sued in state court, using Republicans’ arguments that it was party, not race, that influenced the redrawing. Its lawsuit argued legislators violated the state constitution with a map that intentionally gave Republicans the advantage in the coastal 1st District, making it easier for the GOP to keep the seat after it flipped for a single term.
U.S. Supreme Court throws out SC racial gerrymandering ruling

Justices disagreed unanimously.
The state constitution protects an individual’s right to vote. But “there are no constitutional provisions or statutes that pertain to, prohibit, or limit partisan gerrymandering in the congressional redistricting process in South Carolina,” wrote Justice George James in the majority opinion signed on to by justices John Few and Letitia Verdin.
Therefore, a partisan gerrymandering claim is a “political question” outside the court’s authority, he concluded.
Chief Justice John Kittredge offered a more limited view. While he agreed a court can’t resolve this particular claim, it’s possible “a future challenge may present more fully developed constitutional violations,” he wrote in a separate opinion signed on to by Justice Garrison Hill.
In response, the League of Women Voters said the ruling presents a contradiction: It indicates only the Legislature can address partisan gerrymandering, and that’s the same body responsible for the problem.
“Partisan gerrymandering is an attack on our most fundamental right as citizens, the right to vote,” Lynn Teague, the league’s vice president said in a statement, adding that the group “will not stop fighting for fair redistricting.”
She encouraged South Carolinians to demand a constitutional amendment to protect their vote. But that too would require the Legislature’s blessing. State law doesn’t allow a voter-led referendum. In South Carolina, it takes supermajority approval by both chambers just to put a question on the ballot asking voters if they approve changing the constitution.
The ruling comes as other states nationwide redraw their congressional lines mid-way through the normally decennial process to create more safe seats ahead of the 2026 elections, which will determine whether Republicans keep control of the U.S. House.
South Carolina’s justices have essentially condoned that behavior, said Allen Chaney, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina, which represented the league.
“By washing its hands of redistricting, the Court marks itself satisfied with the idea that politicians can game the system to retain their own power and ushers in an even greater entrenchment of political extremism,” he said.

But in his opinion, Kittredge specifically pointed to the one-upmanship by states’ dominating parties as a “troubling prospect,” regardless of the legality.
The trend may end only with a new ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, Kittredge said.
“We are seeing — and will continue to see — state legislatures race to further minimize and perhaps erase the representation of the state’s minority political party in Congress,” he wrote. “These results may, indeed, be in line with each respective state’s constitution and laws, but they collectively have the effect of diminishing our constitutional republic as a whole.”
The Senate GOP declared victory again, discounting the challenge as an attempt by liberal activists to undo Republicans’ redistricting map that Gov. Henry McMaster signed into law in January 2022.
“We worked hard to ensure that South Carolina’s districts reflected the politics of South Carolina’s voters,” Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, R-Edgefield, said in a statement. “If the ACLU and the League of Women Voters aren’t happy with the results at the ballot box, maybe they should ditch their far-left positions, like gender-transitions for children, and get in step with South Carolina values.”

He also made clear South Carolina will not join other states’ moves to further redraw lines.
With six of the state’s seven congressional seats held by Republicans, there’s no need: “So much winning – and we’re not tired of it yet,” the statement read.
South Carolina’s 1st District has long been reliable for Republicans. However, a population explosion on the coast turned it more purple. In 2018, Democrat Joe Cunningham flipped the seat to blue for the first time in nearly 40 years.
Two years later, Mace ousted him by 1 percentage point, flipping the seat back to Republican control. After the redrawing of lines, Mace easily won in 2022 against Democrat Annie Andrews. She won by even bigger margins in 2024 without even acknowledging her Democratic challenger.
With Mace among Republicans seeking the Governor’s Mansion next year, the race to replace her in the district that runs along the state’s southern coastline is growing increasingly crowded.
On Wednesday, Dorchester County Councilman Jay Byars became the fourth Republican to declare his bid for the seat. He joined state Rep. Mark Smith (who replaced Mace in the state House), retired Air Force pilot Alex Pelbath, and retired doctor Sam McCown.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/SCSupremeCourt-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-17 15:57:15.606824

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)After hours of closed discussion, the Iowa Board of Regents has directed state universities to investigate social media posts allegedly made by university employees relating to right-wing influencer Charlie Kirk and his death.
The board began its first meeting of the fall semester with a closed session, added to the agenda after multiple Iowa State University employees were accused of making social media posts celebrating the killing of Kirk last week at a Utah Valley University public debate event.
Board President Sherry Bates said during the meeting universities must “conduct an immediate investigation of alleged violations of board policy,” including rules on social media use that state employees are allowed to post their personal views on their own social media accounts as long as that expression doesn’t violate institutional policies. The board policy manual states one example of this situation is when an employee’s personal expression is threatening to a coworker.

These investigations must be completed within two weeks, Bates said, and employees under investigation should be placed on administrative leave or “removed from the classroom.” Once investigations have concluded, universities must take “immediate action” against employees found in violation of board policies, up to and including termination of their employment.
“We’ve seen some appalling things on social media in the last week, and we also understand that some appalling things are protected by the First Amendment,” Regent Robert Cramer said during the meeting. “So the purpose of this is to delve in and to see if these, any of these, cross the threshold to where they’re so disruptive to the university that they still need discipline in an employment sense.”
Iowa lawmakers and members of the public have called for the termination of Iowa State University staff and faculty who allegedly posted that everyone is alright with political violence and that Kirk “got what was coming.”
Cramer added during his comments that students are not being treated the same as employees, and that the board is not seeking to punish anyone for what they have expressed on social media, but “there’s not an absolute right to employment … if that employee is disrupting the university.”
Regent Christine Hensley said after the closed session that a lack of investigation so far by Iowa’s universities has “slowed the process” and prevented the board from taking action beyond the directives set forward Wednesday.
Regent David Barker expects action on at least one of the investigations to take much less time than two weeks, he said during the meeting, as “there’s very little investigation to do.”
“It’s my expectation that in at least some cases, action will be much faster than in two weeks, and I certainly hope that that’s what occurs,” Barker said.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-17 19:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Entergy Mississippi CEO Fisackerly answers questions on data centers and electricity rates,Katherine Lin,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/17/entergy-mississippi-ceo-fisackerly-answers-questions-on-data-centers-and-electricity-rates/,Mississippi is going all-in on data centers that will need vast amounts of power. Entergy CEO Haley Fisackerly answered questions in an interview with Mississippi Today.,"Three multibillion-dollar data centers are being built in Mississippi.
People are concerned about pollution and electric bill increases that have been seen in data center hot spots around the country. 
Entergy is providing power to two of the centers, Amazon Web Services in Madison County and AVAIO in Rankin County. Haley Fisackerly, the CEO of Entergy Mississippi, sat down for an interview with Mississippi Today to address some of these concerns.
The interview was conducted Sept. 9 and has been edited for clarity and length.
Mississippi Today: The main question we’ve been getting is about electricity rates. Are people’s electricity rates going to go up because of the data centers? You’ve said they won’t, but in other states they really have. Can you explain?
Haley Fisackerly: I appreciate the question because it actually is going to have an opposite effect on our customers. 
Growth is important because if you can improve your sales or your customer base, you have a greater base to spread your costs.
Our dilemma about a decade ago was that Mississippi was not growing. Our sister companies in Texas and Louisiana have seen significant growth.

We recognized that we weren’t growing, the cost of services were driving up and we needed to invest heavily to improve reliability.  We especially have seen that post-COVID with supply chain challenges, inflation, and add to it now, tariffs. We had aging infrastructure, power plants that needed to be replaced, and we, the consumer, use electricity differently. So that means more investment.
When we had to make these investments, we saw our rates escalating dramatically. And we said, “We’ve got to do something about this now.” We do what we can to manage our costs, but we needed to really move that denominator. 
We looked at ways that we could find transformative growth. About eight years ago, somebody said data centers. This data center idea could bring new revenue into the business that would allow us to reinvest. 
We worked with the Mississippi Development Authority and the state to make the state more attractive for data centers. We talked to local counties to see who would have sites and during this time frame we started to impress Amazon Web Services. They saw a state that was really working to try to break down hurdles. Finally, in late 2022, early 2023, they threw out an opportunity, and that’s what brought AWS here. We are now able to bring in a large customer that is bringing in the volume we need. 
After that announcement, other data centers started looking at places in Mississippi and across the South. Most of the data center activity had really centered around northern Virginia, Ohio, Phoenix. Areas in the South were not, from a large-scale perspective, really looked at. There is available capacity, land, and you don’t have the population constraints they’re running into in the northern Virginia area.

Secondly, how do I know we’re protecting customers? We’re regulated by the Mississippi Public Service Commission, and we are required to make sure that any incremental cost by a large customer like that, they are covered by that customer and provide benefits to other customers.
Take AWS and AVAIO. We knew we were going to have to build two new power plants in the early 2030 timeframe. These are expensive. Because of AWS and AVEO coming in, we’re building new power plants and they’re going to be paying a majority of the cost. 
MT: Can I just jump in really quick with a clarifying question? You would have needed to build a new power plant regardless of whether a new data center was going to come in because of the aging infrastructure?
Fisackerly: It was aging. For example, the first plant we’re building is up in the Mississippi Delta.
We’re retiring a plant in Greenville that was built in the late 1950s. The new plant is a natural gas plant, too, but it uses 90% less water and is 50% more energy efficient. You can use less natural gas and get more output. It will be capable of burning hydrogen, which is a cleaner fuel, if and when hydrogen ever becomes economical, and capturing carbon. We are working on a second plant, too, and we’ll probably be eventually looking at additional ones. 
In addition to that, AWS said they wanted renewables. We’re deploying 650 megawatts of renewables that will be connected to the grid, that AWS is paying the incremental cost for.
When electricity flows, it’d be no different than when I pour water on this table. It’s going to flow in the path of least resistance. We put power onto the electrical grid and it serves all customers.
If AWS and AVAIO become larger customers, they’re going to pay a larger percentage. We need to build substations, upgrade transmission lines, and they’re having to pay for those costs. But the other customers are going to benefit from it because you’re improving import capabilities and making it more robust and resilient. We’re getting a better grid at a lesser cost. 
When power moves from a power plant it’s dispatched onto a transmission line then it’s moved to a substation and that voltage is downgraded through a substation to a lower voltage and put on distribution lines to serve customers. In the case of a large customer like this, they will only be transmission served. Power is going to move from the plants on the transmission lines to substations that they will own and pay for at the site. Other customers don’t have to pay for those. 
MT: But data centers just use a large amount of electricity. The supply that you need then is bigger than what you would’ve needed if it was just going to be residential. Doesn’t that increase the cost? 
Fisackerly: It increases the cost because you’re investing more. But because they’re using a larger percentage of it, just through that alone means they’re covering their cost. 
But those plants are there to serve everybody. Say they use X percentage of that plant. They pay their fair share of that percentage. Other customers are not having to pick that up. Plus, the data centers are having to pay certain premiums above that, too, to have the power available when they need it —  the premium, such as the renewables they want. So as we look at carbon capture, they’ll have to pay those incremental costs. We’ll get the benefits of the clean outputs, but they are paying those incremental costs.
MT: Data centers run 24/7. I’ve heard that they use diesel as backup, and they have a capacity on the AWS site. 
Fisackerly: That’s what AWS is doing. I’m not sure what AVAIO’s plans are. But they have backup in case there’s an emergency. They’re limited on how often they can run those under environmental requirements, but yes, that’s correct. 
MT: There’s been some concern in Mississippi because of what’s happening in Memphis with xAI putting up the unregulated turbines that they have. Do you have any concerns that AWS might do something similar?
Fisackerly: No, I do not. First of all, if you look where they’re building, they’re very isolated. They’re leaving a lot of woods around there on purpose, to hide and buffer it. Those backup generators will not run that often. They’re there in the rare event, a major storm. 
Keep in mind they’re not going to be served by the distribution system. The transmission system serves them. We rarely see disruptions on the transmission system because they’re larger wires with larger rights of way, whereas distribution lines are smaller wires running down streets and through neighborhoods. So that lessens a data center’s exposure, too. 
We’re a part of a market called the midContinent Independent System Operator. It’s a regional transmission organization where utilities dispatch all their power into that pool. If you ever had a situation like during the summer that transmission lines were lost, or a power plant went down, then we have certain reserve margins. If we got to a capacity shortfall, the data centers would be curtailed and they would probably run their backup generators. But those are usually very short-term periods. 
MT: Going to go back to the rates: I saw a video on social media over the weekend where someone said they had talked with (Public Service) Commissioner Stamps, and that he said rates were likely going to go up.
Fisackerly: First of all, rates were already going up. The investments were going up. Inflation is driving all of our materials up. Natural gas costs have been higher. Now those are dollar-for-dollar patch throughs that we don’t make profits off of. But that trajectory we were showing is being lowered. So there’s still going to be rates going up.  Everybody’s rates are going up. 
We have a large buyer who’s going to help contribute toward the cost of the grid that benefits all customers. We were hoping to bring in a big, transformative customer that’s going to help reduce cost. Rates are not going to be as high as they otherwise would’ve been. I can’t promise you they won’t go up. But the trajectory has drastically changed. 
In the legislation that approved the AWS deal, there are protections that mean AWS is required to pay the incremental cost to serve and provide benefits to customers. When we started talking to AWS the governor said, “This cannot harm other customers.”
Everybody was like, we’ve got to do this in a way that it benefits customers. And that’s what we did. We also learned from the other states that went before us. 
MT: Yes, they’ve had lots of issues.
Fisackerly: And no doubt that’s happened in other states. But the regulatory process here in Mississippi, especially in our experience with the Mississippi Public Service Commission, they’ve always been supportive of economic development, but they have also had strict requirements. You could go to other states where their policies may be different.

There are some areas where they’ll say, we’re fine with you pushing costs onto customers to attract jobs and industry here. Mississippi’s taken a different approach. We want to be aggressive, we want to attract it, but we do not want you harming other customers. 
MT: There’s been a lot of reporting from Virginia and Georgia about rate increases there. What are some of the lessons that you took away from other states? 
Fisackerly: If you take northern Virginia and other areas where the most data centers were initially built, AI wasn’t really on the table. They were doing data storage. They would put a facility here and another one 5 to 50 miles over there. Machine learning comes in and the capacity they need is much greater. Now, at least from AWS’s point of view, they want to find land that’s isolated and outside of towns where they can get a campus and grow on that campus and quit being scattered. That reduces their cost to serve.
We sat down with the customer and said, look, if we’re going to do this, you’re going to have to front the cost to protect other customers, such as specific materials that were required. There are long lead times, it’s over a year in advance to get transformers.
AWS stepped up to pay the cost on those. And so that protects customers.
We learned lessons from other utilities. AWS and AVAIO have not served under traditional filed tariffs we have with the commission. Each one of them has a very specific contract. The contract protects the customers and the company by one long-term contract, termination fees and lots of balances up front. They have to put dollars up front to cover certain costs. Those things insulate and protect other customers. 
MT: I was looking at the timelines and read online that the new power plants would be completed in 2029, but the data centers were going to be done by 2027. What does that mean for consumers?
Fisackerly: First of all, they’re slowly ramping up so they don’t all slow it up. We will finish the Delta Blues Plant in the summer of 2028. And the second plant will be at the end of 2028. Plus, at the time when we negotiated them, we had excess. We always try to stay it along if power plants ever go down. You want to be able to grow with that. We’re ramping with them, AWS will phase in over time. AVAIO will also phase in. 
Also to protect customers, we can curtail that energy if there’s ever a demand on the grid and things of that nature. We can work with them to reduce our load, to help manage us through any type of load crunches or things of that nature. 
MT: It feels like everybody is looking at bringing in a data center. When you decided to build these two new plants, did you take into account that there was potentially going to be more? 
Fisackerly: You always want to try to plan for growth and have capacity for growth. We also have to have capacity, what we call operating reserves. You didn’t wake up this morning and put your order in for electricity, did you? 
MT: No. I appreciate not having to do that. 
Fisackerly: But I have to make sure the power’s there. For industrial customers we know exactly what they need every day. A residential customer, I don’t know what time you’re getting up, what time you’re turning on the coffee maker, what time you’re coming home. So we use data to make sure we have enough reserves capacity to manage through load swings.
When we do our supply plans, we plan to meet both what our needs are, what our reserves are that are needed to do that, and try to plan for growth. 
What is happening right now across the entire United States is not just data centers, we’ve got electrification and AI going on. An AI search uses 10 times more electricity than a normal search and more companies have deployed some sort of AI product. 
Every three years, we’re required to file our supply plans with the Mississippi Public Service Commission. It gives transparency to our regulators on the status of all our power plants, what we project our load growth to be and what we need in the future.
When we file these plans, we’re also saying here’s what we think our load forecasts are going to be and what we need to supply for. There’s a lot of planning around that.
MT: There was some controversy previously about changes (approved by the Legislature) to the Public Service Commission’s oversight. Could you give me some context for what was going on?
Fisackerly: AWS is a provider of data centers and AI to other customers whereas Meta and Google are doing it for their own use. 
A lot of your Fortune 500 companies have had a huge spike in demand for data centers and AI. They were quickly trying to find where they could go to meet the demand.
They needed to find a partner and a state where they could build and ramp these data centers up over three years. The traditional process here in Mississippi would have taken five to six years. We wouldn’t want this. We need to find some growth to come in to help Mississippi grow and all that.
So we sat down with the governor, the Public Service Commission, and leaders of the Legislature and said, “If we want to do this, what do we need to do?”
So the governor and the Legislature said, “We’ll pass legislation that one has to approve the incentives they’re providing for AWS, but also that would give approval to Entergy for the assets they would have to build and deploy to serve them.”
That process would’ve taken five to six years. Most of that would’ve been on the front end where we would have to go to the commission and seek something called a Certificate of Convenience and Necessity, a CCN. That basically says, “We’re going to need to make these investments because of this reason.” And that is a review process during which they agree to say, “OK, the Legislature who has authority over the commission who makes it, says, ‘We’re going to go ahead and grant that CCN.’” 
We reduced that on the front end. So that allowed us to accelerate that. 
There’s a perception that you circumvented oversight. We did not. If anything, I’m taking greater risk because now every one of those assets we build the transmission lines, substations and the power plants. Each one of them individually has to go in front of the commission for a prudency review. That review can come back and say these costs weren’t prudent. And if that’s found, we have to eat it. And that makes me a little nervous now because of that. 
We’re doing a lot of work on the front end, we have a lot of oversight. We use teams to negotiate the best contracts and the best pricing on materials, and the Legislature requires that the Public Service Commission hire an independent third party to audit it.
So it is true, it accelerated the front end of the process. But those things have to be reviewed and prudent and then put into rates have not been circumvented. If anything, I don’t have the assurances of that.
It just holds us more accountable to make sure as we build these things, we’re pricing on the best we can and we’re executing the best we can and covering our risks.
MT: I think there’s a lot of skepticism about what the benefits to a community will be from having a data center.
Fisackerly: Here’s where the benefits come. First, take Mississippi. We’re probably one of the most rural, most poor states in the nation, and we don’t see a lot of growth.
AWS committed to the state a minimum $10-billion investment and a minimum of 1,000 jobs. Based on those minimum numbers, that is going to be an estimated $80 million a year in ad valorem taxes to Madison County every year. 
Think about what that is going to allow them to do for aging infrastructure. We know that all these counties and cities are dealing with water, infrastructure, sewer and road issues. They now have incremental funding. Think about what they can bond with that.
In Mississippi, nearly half of the ad valorem taxes have to go to the local school districts. That excites me. Think of how we’re going to change young people’s lives.
While a lot of people debate if data centers create a lot of jobs, they still create higher paying jobs. We have brought a new sector to Mississippi. I hope it helps to calm down some of the brain drain we lose because we create opportunities. There is going to be some ripple effect, not the type of ripple effect you would see around a manufacturing facility. 
But what we have seen happen in Mississippi just since this: ABB, located in Tate County, is expanding. They make electrical components used not only at AWS or AVAIO but data centers around the world. Modine in Grenada County just announced a major expansion. They make the coal coils that are used in the cooling systems. They’re expanding because of that, creating more economic investment jobs going into those areas. 
We’re building a power plant in Washington County at $1.2 billion, and we’re going to pay ad valorem taxes to Washington County. It is the largest economic development project in the Mississippi Delta’s history. We will be building solar facilities in Bolivar, DeSoto and Tallahatchie counties. And the other one I think is in Washington County. That’s again bringing more ad valorem taxes and more jobs.
These things would not have happened without AWS. I think it’s going to bring huge benefits. And as a lifelong Mississippian who is invested here, grew up here, I’m excited to finally see Mississippi getting a part of something that a lot of other states haven’t gotten.
It is going to transform communities and young people’s lives, and that’s what I’m excited about. 
MT: I was talking with an engineer from Houston working on the Amazon data center. He comes in for two weeks and he flies out. I’m curious about the ability to attract talent to Mississippi. 
Fisackerly: We saw a similar thing when Nissan first came in. For the first year or two you could drive through that parking lot and see tags from other counties and even Alabama. You go drive through that parking lot, you’re going to see a lot more Mississippi tags and a lot more counties right here in the area.
So that will happen. Those data centers will probably bring in certain talent to train individuals. 
We recruited Continental, we recruited Nissan, we’ve recruited Milwaukee Tools. I’ve never seen a company like AWS, who’s come in and put dollars into the community colleges. They’re doing fiber optic and electrical technician training. 
But most of the jobs they’re going to need, there are technical technician-type jobs. They’re going to need some engineers, they’re going to need some management. If you look at it, 80% of the jobs we need now in the systems don’t require a four-year degree. They need technical training and they’re going to be high-paying jobs. They’re doing a lot of outreach to schools. 
It’s not going to happen overnight. There may be some dislocation because they’ve got to get facilities running. But I guarantee you any facility, we’ve looked and recruited here over time, they will grow it. And they’re incentivized, too by the benefits that the state provided them. And as a large employer myself, too, I want my people living and working in that area. Can’t force you to, but at the end of the day, once I have a choice and when I’m interviewing, that will be a factor. 
MT: One of the things that’s come up when I have talked with residents is that they are very concerned about the environmental impact of both the data centers and the increase in power that they’re going to need. I’m curious, what’s your response to that? 
Fisackerly: Let’s take the water issue. The state of Mississippi as part of the deal made a $215 million loan to Madison County. And you want to verify this with Madison County. I’m not the best one to talk about it, but my understanding is that it is to go support the infrastructure improvements, one of which is the wastewater treatment facility in northern Madison County that was under review by the EPA. The money that the state is floating through a loan to Madison County will go to enhance that facility and build a pipeline to Amazon where they will take the wastewater and treat it and run it through their facilities and recapture it and not tap the water supply there.
Two, the technology is changing quickly. The new chips that are coming out are using new ways of cooling. And, a reason why they also are so energy dependent is that those buildings are cooled, too. AWS will, based on the season, will also reduce their water demands based on when it’s easier to cool the building. 
They’re probably one of the most sustainable companies I’ve ever dealt with. They want clean energy to the point of what they’re doing there to do that loan is it will be paid back by AWS the fee in lieu of tax that they’re paying back to Madison County that then pays the state back. I’ve never seen that before. A lot of times when you’re recruiting industry here, it is, “Give me all the incentives you got and we’ll give it back to you through jobs and taxpayers or a tax ad valorem.”
They’re actually paying that loan back. And so that’s a huge benefit there. The AVAIO project is a much smaller project compared to AWS, but they even use a sustainability project. They’re capturing rain water. 
Part of our research was, “Let’s go see these data centers being built.” And what I saw being built out west and up in northern Virginia five, six, seven years ago compared to what’s being built today. These are very robust concrete buildings. The concrete dampens a lot of sound and makes them more energy efficient. So lots of things that go into it are very different.
 Even the aesthetics around it, they are really focused on how they’re seen from the road. The one up at Madison, that is an industrial complex. You look at the one in Ridgeland though, they’re purposely keeping a tree buffer all the way around that property. And hiding it. 
If you think about it, the state of Mississippi didn’t give anything up because we weren’t getting it anyway. What we got was a large capital customer coming to the state, making large capital investment, bringing large ad valorem taxes and jobs. 
MT: You probably can’t answer this one but I’ve heard that there’s another one coming to Madison. Do you know anything about that? 
Fisackerly: First of all, I can’t comment on any projects. I’m under NDAs. I’ll tell you this. We’re very busy. There are a lot of projects. And they will come as long as they pay the incremental costs and protect other customers. 
The way I look at it is we have four stakeholders. We have our customers, our employees, our communities and our owners. At the end of the day when it provides value to all four, then you do it. The moment one of those are harmed, you don’t do it. 
You have your big players but the interesting thing is there’s these other companies, and they call all the time. Our teams are overwhelmed with them. Some of ’em turn out legit like AVAIO did. And you have to weed through those.
Every one of our counties have economic development arms who are trying to recruit these things. We have to work with the data center companies, but we also have to have the counties see that, this one’s not really going to benefit you. It’s going to create more harm. So we try to work through that. Can’t serve ’em all, but we’ll do the ones that provide that value.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/17103723/Haley-Fisackerly-headshot-1280x780-1.jpg,,,2025-09-17 15:57:15.606824

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator)University leaders say they are struggling to punish college students for hazing following the enactment of state law in 2024 that requires them to follow a standard of evidence more commonly used in criminal proceedings. 
Under the new law, schools must abide by a higher standard of evidence in any case where the offense is punishable by expulsion or a suspension of at least 10 days. Previously, administrators could hold a student responsible if the evidence points to it being at least slightly more likely than not the student is responsible. Even if there is conflicting testimony, a student could be punished if the evidence tipped the scale just past a 50% likelihood. 
Now universities need clear and convincing evidence, a standard used in some court cases such as proving fraud or terminating parental rights. The threshold requires evidence that points to the student’s guilt being substantially more probable than not, and it might require multiple witnesses, photos or other reports to firmly convince administrators.
Clearing that bar can be difficult because, unlike in courtroom proceedings, administrators don’t have as much power to gather evidence. 
“We can’t force anyone to participate or to talk to us,” said LSU General Counsel Trey Jones, a member of an anti-hazing panel that met Tuesday at Pennington Biomedical Research Center. “We can’t subpoena any documents. We have to rely on what the police collect for us, and what we’re able to gather on our own happenstance. That just makes the heightened burden of proof impossible to meet.”
The Louisiana Legislature created the Caleb Wilson Hazing Prevention Task Force earlier this year and named it after the 20-year-old Southern University student who died in an off-campus incident in March while pledging Omega Psi Phi fraternity.
Police said Wilson’s death was the direct result of a hazing incident in which he was punched in the chest multiple times. Several fraternity members face criminal charges, and Southern removed the fraternity from campus. 
The law in question, authored by Rep. Dixon McMakin, R-Baton Rouge, passed the legislature with no votes against it and after little discussion. McMakin, who is not on the task force, declined to comment for this report. 
Sen. Gerald Boudreaux, D-Lafayette, said lawmakers did not know at the time the new standard of evidence would make it harder to hold someone caught hazing responsible. 
Boudreaux and other lawmakers on the task force, including Reps. Jason Hughes, D-New Orleans, and Joe Stagni, R-Kenner, said they would revisit the law and are considering reverting back to the old standard of evidence. 
Lawmakers have taken a renewed interest in hazing on college campuses since Wilson’s death, the first in Louisiana since the fatal 2017 fraternity hazing of LSU student Maxwell Gruver. Gruver, 18, died after a hazing ritual that involved chugging high-proof alcohol. One of the students involved, Matthew Naquin, was convicted of negligent homicide in the case. After Gruver’s death, lawmakers increased penalties for hazing in an attempt to stamp out the practice. 
But hazing is ultimately a cultural issue, university leaders said at Tuesday’s task force meeting. Alumni of organizations that have historically perpetrated hazing, such as fraternities, marching bands and athletic teams, have played a role in preserving it, interim LSU President Matt Lee said. 
Lee described a meeting with middle-aged LSU fraternity alumni after he became interim provost in 2021. 
“These were a group that were deeply, deeply committed to preserving a set of traditions, some of which were deeply toxic, frankly,” Lee said. “I’m sorry, but this is part of the problem, this culture, intergenerational transmission of culture.” 
While university leaders and task force members agreed it would be impossible to totally stamp out hazing, they committed to ending hazing incidents that result in serious bodily harm or death.

Rainstorms last month in Northern New Mexico damaged several dozen acequias, many of them severely, according to an advocacy group concerned that without state or federal help, farmers who rely on the ancient irrigation canals will lose at least two growing seasons.
At least 36 acequias in Taos, Rio Arriba and Santa Fe counties sustained damage in three storms last month, according to Vidal Gonzales, policy and planning for the New Mexico Acequia Association. He told Source New Mexico on Tuesday evening that most of the damage came from two storms Aug. 25 and Aug. 29. 
All told, 19 acequias in the Chimayó area, along with six near Pojoaque and 11 others near Ojo Caliente, sustained several millions of dollars in damage in the powerful rainstorms, he said. 
The storms created floods that poured into the channels, generating enough pressure to crack metal headgates. Debris flows elsewhere left acequias full of silt that will have to be dug out before they can flow again, he said. Others may have to be rebuilt, he said.
“Some of them got blown out just from such a high-intensity rain event in such a short amount of time,” Gonzales said, who shared pictures of the damage. 
Acequias leaders, known as mayordomos, have shared damage assessments with the Acequia Association in recent days, as the organization begins advocating for county or state disaster declarations that would unlock some funding, Gonzales said. The group hopes to compile all that information for Rio Arriba and Santa Fe county officials this week, he said. 
Acequias recovering after NM disasters, but federal cuts loom

But even if Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham were to approve a state declaration, which would mean at least $750,000, Gonzales said he’s unsure where the rest of the money will come from. 
While a federal disaster declaration could provide needed individual assistance and help to public entities like acequas, “I don’t see that happening with this administration,” Gonzales said.
Other federal agencies, like the Emergency Watershed Protection Program or the Natural Resources Conservation Service, are short-staffed and overwhelmed, he said, with other disaster projects and spending cuts. And state funds the Legislature passed specifically for acequias earlier this year have already been allocated, primarily to small projects or engineering and design. 
Gonzales attributes the severity of the floods to human-caused climate change, he said, along with longstanding watershed degradation that will require a multi-faceted approach to address. 
“We’re really between a rock and a hard place here in New Mexico with all these disasters and climate change and everything affecting us,” he said.

The storms mark just the latest natural event to damage the historic irrigation canals, which are largely unique to New Mexico. The association earlier this year estimated that 150 acequias were damaged due to recent wildfires, particularly due to post-fire flooding, in northern and southern New Mexico. 
The Legislature in recent years has approved more than $100 million in disaster loans, including for specific acequias, to help them start recovering, but they often face bureaucratic challenges, including becoming designated public entities eligible for federal or state disaster assistance. 
Mykel Diaz, mayordomo of the Acequia de los Martinez Arriba near Chimayó, told Source that he’s already encountered some of those challenges for his acequia, because it runs over the boundary of Santa Fe and Rio Arriba counties. That’s making the damage assessment difficult, he said, along with other hurdles.
After fire and flood, ash chokes acequias in northern NM

He told Source that the flood damage has affected basically the entire Santa Cruz River Valley, including several major acequias. His acequia has slightly over 100 users — or parciantes — he said, and the Distrito Community Ditch nearby has about 200.
Both suffered severe damage that will cost tens of thousands of dollars, at least, he said. 
The acequia Diaz oversees lost basically an entire mile-long stretch due to 20 “avalanches” that dumped into it during the Aug. 29 storm, he said. For acequias that have been in that area for several hundred years, seeing one storm wipe so much out demonstrates “the fragility of the system,” he said. 
“It just took one epic rainstorm that put two inches of rain in like an hour,” he said, “and took us out.”
Diaz’s acequia has some money to at least begin digging out, he said, which is a rarity among acequias. But he’ll need to convince parciantes to approve moving $10,000 they recently approved for a new diversion project toward recovering from the disaster. 
“If we don’t re-allocate that money, then we’re not going to have any water to divert,” she said. “It’ll be a futile project.”
For other required spending, Diaz said he just hopes that the acequia will somehow be reimbursed for the “freak of nature” storm. 
“Mother Nature really gave it to us that day,” he said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screen-Shot-2025-09-17-at-12.42.54-PM-1024x675.png,,,2025-09-17 14:57:34.198360

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A former Oklahoma lawmaker wants to dramatically alter how the legislature conducts business.
Former Rep. Charles Key, R-Oklahoma City, filed paperwork with the Oklahoma Secretary of State to circulate a proposed constitutional amendment that would require three bills from every lawmaker to be heard in committee. State Question 839 would also require any bills advanced from committee to be heard on the House or Senate floor.
Key, who served in the House for 18 years, said the problem is too few have too much power, which impacts constituents.
Key said lobbyists and large money donors behind the scenes pick which bills get heard.
“It means people from rural districts or not in leadership are not getting legislation that reflects their values,” said Sen. Shane Jett, R-Shawnee, chairman of the Freedom Caucus.
The organization has been critical of the current process where leadership assigns bills to committees and chairs determine what gets heard.

Jett said lobbyists give the bulk of their contributions to leadership and to those who chair committees.
The current process allows members to hide from difficult votes because bills are not being heard, leaving their constituents wondering where lawmakers stand on policy issues, Jett said.
Key said he doesn’t think the measure, if approved by voters, will fully fix a broken system, but it will have an impact.
“This is about fairness and equality,” Key said.

‘Not all bills become law for a reason’
 

But critics of the idea say there is a difference between a bill that has been copied from another state or organization and those that have been well-researched and vetted over several years.
“Every idea does not have equal merit,” said Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City.
It should not be easy to pass a law, said House Majority Floor Leader Josh West, R-Grove. West is involved in determining which bills get heard on the House floor.

“We are here to create good laws,” West said. “Not all bills become law for a reason.”
Hundreds of bills didn’t get a committee hearing in 2025, including Senate Bill 581, by Sen. Dusty Deevers, R-Elgin, that would have allowed residents, employees and businesses to be paid in gold or silver bullion.
Another Deevers measure, Senate Bill 738, would have required county sheriffs to protect people from infringements on rights guaranteed in the U.S. and Oklahoma constitutions.
House Bill 1006, by Rep. Jim Olsen, R-Roland, requiring classrooms to display the Ten Commandments, also wasn’t heard.
West said the current process works, but it requires members to garner support for their legislation, which is often done behind the scenes.
Senate Majority Floor Leader Julie Daniels, R-Bartlesville, said some bills are repeats of ideas that have not worked in the past. Others may be premature or in conflict with other laws or policies, she said.
A lot of factors go into determining which bills will be heard, said Daniels, a key player in determining which Senate proposals will be brought up for a vote.
Sens. Darcy Jech, R-Kingfisher, left, and Julie Daniels, R-Bartlesville, right, speak as they await votes on a veto override during the Senate session on Thursday, May 29, 2025. (Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)
She said the Oklahoma Legislature is one of the most conservative in the country and has passed bills that reflect that ideology.
But the body does not necessarily pass each iteration of a policy, she said.
Timing constraints
Lawmakers say it is not possible to hear the thousands of bills filed during a legislative session, which runs from February until the end of May.
House members are currently limited to filing eight bills that are possible for committee consideration. 
The Senate has no limit.
Institutional knowledge and influence
“Certainly lobbyists, associations or individual constituents can bring an argument that is very persuasive,” Daniels said. “To say just because an argument comes from a lobbyist is invalid or questionable rejects entirely the knowledge and information they can bring to an issue that is not easily agreed upon by all sides.”
In 1990, voters approved a measure that prohibited lawmakers from serving more than 12 years. It became effective with the 1992 election. Although billed as a way to generate fresh ideas, one of the results was a loss of institutional knowledge in the House and Senate, which some observers say puts more power in the hands of staff and lobbyists.
James Milner has been a lobbyist for more than 35 years.
“If you talk to any member, particularly the new ones, they will tell you that if it weren’t for lobbyists coming by and explaining the issue and giving them a perspective of it, they would not know or understand what they are voting on,” Milner said.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas Secretary of State Cole Jester launched an initiative Wednesday to prevent people from voting in multiple states. 
The One State One Vote initiative creates a partnership between Arkansas and neighboring states to ensure citizens aren’t registered to vote in more than one state, according to a news release. States will be able to investigate potential cases of voter fraud by identifying voters with duplicate registrations, the release states. 
Arkansas and all of its neighboring states have Republican secretaries of state.
“This is about putting election security first. People simply should not be voting in multiple states or be registered to vote in multiple states,” Jester said. “In this office, we will always push forward to pursue elections with accuracy and ever increasing excellence.”
Jester has already started working with counterparts in other states to share data on potential duplicate registrations, according to the release. The Arkansas Secretary of State’s office will investigate duplicates to determine who has permanently moved out of state and will start the process of having them removed from the voter rolls. 
Updates will be provided in the coming weeks once each state has shared and processed their data, the release states. 
The governor appointed Jester to his current role in December to fill the vacancy left by former Secretary of State John Thurston when he was elected state treasurer in November. 
Jester ordered an election security review shortly after taking office in January. When the report was released in February, Jester declared Arkansas has “the most secure elections in the country” but cast doubt on the security of absentee voting and the integrity of citizen-led ballot initiatives.
Some state Republican lawmakers also took issue with citizen-led ballot initiatives and passed laws affecting Arkansas’ direct democracy process during the 2025 legislative session. Some of those laws are currently being challenged in court.

Along with Texas Attorney General Ken Paxon, Uthmeier filed a petition in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas last month requesting to intervene in a case challenging the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) regulation of mifepristone, one of two drugs used in medication abortions.
It’s a case that the attorneys general of Missouri, Kansas, and Idaho filed in Texas last year after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a group of anti-abortion physician groups lacked legal standing to bring a suit.
Mifepristone, used alongside misopristol to terminate pregnancies, was approved as safe and effective by the FDA in 2000, initially for up to seven weeks of pregnancy. In 2016, the FDA extended the approval of mifepristone to 10 weeks. In 2023, those medications accounted for 63% of U.S. abortions.
“Often times these medications are sent into the state from out of state and can get into the hands of minors,” Uthmeier said during Tampa at a news conference when asked by a Phoenix reporter about the state’s involvement in the case.
“Now we’ve got serious legal concerns about Florida’s parental consent laws, heartbeat protection laws, you name it. So, obviously, people can read the complaint and see all of our arguments but at the end of the day, we believe that this is dangerous.”
Florida now bans most abortions up to six weeks of pregnancy, before many women are aware they are pregnant. The state also bans accessing an abortion through telehealth.
Yet, as the Phoenix reported last month, a study conducted by #WeCount, a Society of Family Planning project, showed that 13,380 abortions in Florida were provided to pregnant patients under shield laws in 2024. Shield laws are legal protections put in place by some states to reduce legal risk for clinicians who offer abortion to states where it is prohibited or severely restricted.
Florida Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani (D-Orlando), who served as senior director for Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida for six years, blasted Uthmeier’s comments.
‘Junk science’
“The AG is lying and constantly spreads misinformation and junk science for his political agenda,” she told the Phoenix in an email message.
“This is just another example of extreme anti-reproductive healthcare politicians inserting themselves between women and their doctors. Medication abortion is incredibly safe, and it’s important to note that more than 57% of Floridians — based in the support for Amendment 4 in 2024 — want politicians like Uthmeier to stop their anti-reproductive healthcare agenda. He should be focused on going after insurance companies that deny access to care, not trying to take away access to care.”
As Eskamani noted, more than 57% of Floridians supported a proposed constitutional amendment last year that would have repealed the state’s six-week abortion ban and enshrined abortion rights into the Florida Constitution. Although a majority, the proposal failed to reach the 60% threshold required for passage.
The legal complaint, filed on Aug. 22 as State of Missouri v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration, makes several legal arguments as to why the federal court should allow Florida and Texas to join the lawsuit.
One is the allegation that developments regarding two of the three states that filed the original lawsuit may threaten their legal standing in the case. In the case of Idaho, it’s that there could be a ballot referendum restoring abortion rights in 2026. In Missouri, litigation continues regarding a constitutional amendment that legalized abortion to the point of viability but which has never gone into effect.
The filing cites the #WeCount study, listing specifically that 10,290 telehealth abortions  were performed in Florida between May 2024 and December 2024.
The state also lists a report published earlier this year alleging that more than 10% of women who took abortion drugs suffered a ‘serious adverse event.’ That study, published by Ethics & Public Policy Center, reported that the incidence of sepsis, infection, hemorrhaging, or “other serious adverse events” associated with mifepristone abortion is 11%.
However, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and women’s health experts have said that the findings in that study are based on faulty methodology and do not replace years of studies showing that the medication is safe when used as prescribed.
“Across the country, people have learned about abortion pills by mail from resources like PlanCPills.org and have safely managed an abortion from home, without complications,” said Cheyenne Drews, reproductive freedom program director with Progress Florida.
“The study referenced by the Ethics and Public Policy Center is junk science: it is not peer-reviewed, and is based on purchased data from a health insurance claims database, where they used any reason a person visited an ER within 45 days of taking mifepristone and classified it as an ‘adverse effect.’
Shield laws
The filing also alleges that legal developments in Texas and Louisiana have illustrated the difficulty of enforcing abortion regulations against “abortionists in ‘shield law’ jurisdictions.”
Maggie Carpenter, a physician who practices abortion care via telemedicine, was the first to be criminally charged for prescribing over state lines, and is being protected by New York’s shield law against a lawsuit from Texas’ attorney general and criminal prosecution from Louisiana.
Uthmeier was one of 16 Republican attorneys general who signed a letter on July 29 calling on Congress to consider pre-empting abortion shield laws.
In May, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that he had directed the Food and Drug Administration to review its regulations for mifepristone.
Cheyenne Drews with Progress Florida says the state’s intervention in the Texas case is another example of “anti-reproductive freedom politicians inserting themselves in the personal medical decisions between patients and their doctors.”
“If these extremists cared about health, they’d investigate the taxpayer-funded unregulated pregnancy centers, currently operating with no medical or safety standards, and no training on how to diagnose or treat ectopic pregnancies. Instead, they’re focused on adding more barriers to our essential health care,” she said.
Pregnancy centers offer many of the same services as other women’s health centers, including pregnancy testing and care, but often are backed by religious organizations and try to discourage patients from undergoing abortions.

Kentucky lawmakers heard an update on a law passed earlier this year that allows school boards to apply for waivers for “schools of innovation” and subcontract their management to outside entities such as charter school operators.
The discussion before the Budget Subcommittee on Education comes nearly a week after the Kentucky Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case that could allow charter schools to operate in the state without a change to the state Constitution despite Kentucky voters soundly rejecting a constitutional amendment last fall that would have allowed the General Assembly to fund nonpublic schools. 
Paris Republican Sen. Stephen West, who was the sponsor of the legislation, Senate Bill 207, said in the Wednesday meeting he proposed the law after Amendment 2 failed at the ballot box. It’s based on a South Carolina law and allows local school boards to seek waivers from the Kentucky Board of Education to be exempted from certain state laws or regulations for schools that “will improve operations or student academic achievement.”

West, who is also the chairman of the Senate Education Committee, told lawmakers that the law allows “outside private investment” into the public education system. He said that two entities have reached out to him to say they are interested in working on such a program in Kentucky, but he could not publicly say who they are yet. 
“Everywhere you look in your life, choice is almost always better,” he said. “And so whether it’s the car you drive or the movie you go to or whatever, we demand choices. But for some reason in K-12, it’s been pretty stagnant, and there’s a lack of choice.” 
At the center of the Supreme Court case is a 2022 charter school law struck down by Franklin Circuit Judge Phillip Shepherd in December 2023. Shepherd ruled that the state Constitution’s requirement of “common schools” meant schools that “must be open to every child, and operated, managed and fully accountable to the taxpaying public.”
Democrats on the committee expressed skepticism about the process outlined by West. Rep. George Brown Jr., of Lexington, said he was wary of how charter schools can leave out some students, particularly families with fewer financial resources. West argued that his law “gives an opportunity for school choice to kids at the lower end of the economic spectrum.” 
“I think that we have to be concerned about theory to practice, and what actually will happen in terms of the children and their learning, and what happens as a result of that,” Brown said. “Some parents don’t have the financial resources, but they do want what’s best for their children, and I think that is what we have with the Constitution.” 
Rep. Tina Bojanowski, a public elementary school teacher and Democrat from Louisville, asked that with the legislation allowing Kentucky to “subcontract the management of a specific school to an outside entity” if that is “exactly what a charter school is.” 
West answered yes, but a main difference would be “the initiation of the request by the local district,” giving the public school district “more control” than under previously passed charter school legislation. West said such schools could also pay teachers more as an incentive outside of the school district pay scale. 
“A lot of teachers are stuck in the pay scale of the district, and maybe they’re looking for upward mobility,” West said. “And so if you’re getting paid more at this other school that maybe it’s in a rougher part of town, it’s a little bit tougher to operate, but you’re getting a huge pay raise — and hopefully that’s another component of the private money also. Your private infusion of cash could go to increase salaries for teachers.” 
Though there was some bipartisan opposition to putting Amendment 2 on the ballot, Kentucky Republican lawmakers easily proposed the amendment to voters with their supermajority in the legislature. 
Rep. James Tipton, a Taylorsville Republican, told committee members the schools of innovation law provides “just an option” for school boards to pursue. Earlier in the meeting, he gave an overview of the history of model schools allowed in Kentucky, typically through public universities for K-12 students. University officials with school programs for K-12 students, like Eastern Kentucky University’s Model Laboratory School, were present in the meeting as well. 
“I think it’s important for us to understand that not every student learns the same way,” Tipton said. “There are certain students that maybe have a particular interest in a certain area, maybe they excel at a certain area, and I think it’s important for us to offer them opportunities.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-1237956850-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-17 14:57:34.198360

The updated guidance, which aligns with mainstream medical groups, is a rebuke of the June overhaul of the Centers for Disease Controls’ vaccine advisory committee by U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
As recently as Monday, Kennedy appointed five new members to the panel, some of whom have a history of questioning the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines. The West Coast states’ newly announced standards rely upon guidance from national organizations such as the American Academy of Family Physicians and American Academy of Pediatrics. 
Oregon Gov. Tina Kotek, Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said in a joint statement that they were putting safety before politics. 
“Our states are united in putting science, safety, and transparency first — and in protecting families with clear, credible vaccine guidance,” the governors said.

When it comes to the COVID-19 vaccine, the states recommend  that any adult ages 18-64 who wants protection from COVID is eligible for the vaccine, specifically identifying those “who are in close contact with others with risk factors.” 
All children from ages 6 months through to 2 years of age are recommended to receive the shot, as well as those from ages 2 to 18 who choose to receive the shot or haven’t received the vaccine before. The guidelines also include information about Influenza and RSV vaccinations. 
“The WCHA reviewed COVID-19 epidemiology, vaccine effectiveness, safety data, and national medical organization recommendations to arrive at the consensus recommendations,” the new guidelines read. “Individuals with risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection, including age, underlying medical conditions, unvaccinated status, and congregate living facility residence were recommended to receive an updated 2025-26 COVID-19 vaccine. No new safety concerns were reported since the last thorough review.”
Oregon had emerged as a hotspot for questions around vaccine access over the past two weeks since the alliance was initially announced, with critics questioning why the state failed to issue standing orders ensuring COVID-19 vaccine access or deferring to mainstream medical groups sooner. Without guidance from the CDC, tighter restrictions announced by the Food & Drug Administration in late August limited the vaccine to people aged 65 or older or those with an underlying health condition that would risk severe illness. Pharmacists across Oregon have turned away patients without a prescription.
The new guidelines do not yet come with a standing order or further action from Kotek, whose spokesperson told the Oregon Capital Chronicle last week that she was “frustrated” with the federal rollout of the annual COVID-19 vaccine and doing her best to find a solution. 
Other Democratic states, including Washington, have taken steps such as aligning their pharmacy boards with recommendations from mainstream medical groups, ensuring liability protections for doctors who prescribe the vaccine, and requiring insurers to cover the cost of the shot.
The new guidelines say that Oregon’s immunization program has adopted the suggestions made by the health alliance. In a statement, Oregon Health Authority Director Sejal Hathi emphasized the importance of vaccines in saving lives and preventing illness. 
“At a time when Washington (D.C.) is undermining our most basic public health safeguards, Oregon is charting a different course,” she said. “Our actions today affirm that here, public health is about protecting people, not playing politics—and that every family who wants protection during this respiratory virus season should be able to get it simply, safely, and affordably.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/measles-vaccine-1024x737.jpg,,,2025-09-17 14:57:34.198360

When our political reporter Shaun Robinson noticed that Americans for Prosperity (AFP) had incurred a lobbying fine in Vermont, it piqued his interest. While other high-profile groups have often supported liberal causes, it was unusual to see a conservative national network entering Vermont politics in this way. Then our Statehouse reporter Ethan Weinstein received a tip that a misspelling on an AFP mailer led to an online attack on the group’s tactics by the Vermont Democratic Party. 
Robinson and Weinstein handed off their tips to our environmental reporter Austyn Gaffney who ran with them. The seed of the story grew into weeks of reporting that included combing through state documents and public records, attending an AFP event in Rutland, interviewing legislators, politicos and community leaders, digging into years of national investigative reporting on “dark money” politics and partnering with Grist to bring the story to a wider audience.
The result? Investigative journalism at its core: persistent, independent, fact-based reporting that shines a light on forces shaping our democracy and our communities. It doesn’t happen without reader support.

(New Hampshire Bulletin file photo)The New Hampshire Executive Council confirmed Bryan Gould as associate justice of the New Hampshire Supreme Court Wednesday, cementing Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s first pick for the high court.
In a 4-1 vote, the council approved Ayotte’s nomination of Gould, with all four Republicans voting yes and Democratic Councilor Karen Liot Hill voting no.
Republicans praised Gould’s pledges to be neutral before the court at his confirmation hearing Friday. Liot Hill raised concerns about Gould’s past work representing Republicans in election law cases and said she worried he might overturn Supreme Court precedent establishing the state’s duty to pay for an adequate education.
Ayotte quickly celebrated the vote. “I know his exceptional qualifications will make him an excellent Supreme Court Justice, and all of New Hampshire will be better off with someone of such exceptional integrity and character on the bench,” she said in a statement Wednesday. 
Bryan Gould
Gould, 66, will serve on the Supreme Court until he turns 70, at which time he will be required to retire. He replaces Associate Justice James Bassett, who retired in August.
As a director and attorney at Cleveland, Waters and Bass in Concord since 2012, Gould focused on commercial litigation, environmental law, election law, and constitutional law. A member of the conservative Federalist Society, he served as special counsel to Republican Gov. Craig Benson and has represented the New Hampshire Republican Party in several cases. 
He was hired as outside counsel for the Attorney General’s Office to help defend a Republican-passed voting law known as Senate Bill 3, which increased the documentary requirements to register to vote. After a lawsuit brought by the League of Women Voters and the Democratic Party, the state Supreme Court ruled SB 3 unconstitutional in 2021.
Gould also represented Casella Waste Systems for about 30 years and helped the company in its ongoing efforts to seek approval for a controversial landfill in Dalton. 
At his hearing, Gould said he would likely recuse himself from cases before the court involving either Casella or the state Republican Party, though he said it would be inappropriate to commit firmly.
“I cannot imagine a scenario, after representing Casella for over 30 years, that I would ever sit on a case in which Casella, or one of its affiliates, was a client,” he said. He made a similar comment about the Republican Party.
Liot Hill acknowledged those pledges, but said they were not sufficient to earn her support.
“He has refused to make the same commitment in education funding cases like Claremont, ConVal, and their progeny, or in election law and separation of powers cases where he has long represented partisan clients,” she said during the council meeting Wednesday. “These are among the most important constitutional issues facing our state.”
The two Claremont Supreme Court decisions from the 1990s established the constitutional requirement for New Hampshire to ensure and pay for an “adequate” education for its residents. The case of Contoocook Valley School Districts v. New Hampshire, known as the ConVal case, is a recent case in which school districts argued the state is not sufficiently funding public schools in violation of the Claremont precedent. The state Supreme Court ruled in favor of the school districts in July, but left it open to the Legislature to respond appropriately. 
Despite Liot Hill’s objections Wednesday, Republican councilors pointed to a number of times in his hearing in which Gould said the role of a judge is to remove personal beliefs from decision-making. 
“Attorney Gould knows that the principle of politics has no place in the judiciary,” said Councilor John Stephen. “And independence is what I believe strongly after the hearing, after meeting him, he will assert.”
Stephen brought up a 2003 brief Gould wrote on behalf of the Executive Council in which he wrote “the judiciary is required to interpret the Constitution based on principle and not politics.”
“He believes that wholeheartedly,” Stephen said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/execcouncilaudio-1024x662.jpeg,,,2025-09-17 14:57:34.198360

(LV Council screengrab)Kara Kelley, the former President and CEO of the Las Vegas Chamber, will serve out the remainder of former Las Vegas City Councilwoman Victoria Seaman’s term, the City Council voted unanimously Wednesday. 
Kelley may be best remembered for a 2008 study commissioned by the Chamber on public worker salaries that concluded state worker pay and the accompanying benefits diverted money from public services. She was targeted in union ads highlighting her pay of close to $300,000 a year. 
The motion by Councilwoman Nancy Brune to appoint Kelley came after a failed motion from Councilwoman Francis Allen Palenske to give the job to Serena Kasama, who serves as vice-chair of the City Planning Commission.  
City officials say 57 applicants applied for the position but 17 were ineligible. Applicants were required to agree not to run for election to the council next year, although the city has no legal authority to enforce the agreement. 
Council members ranked their selections and chose Kelley, longtime development executive Tom Warden, and Kasama as the finalists. 
Kelley, who currently serves as vice-chair of the Colorado River Commission of Nevada, is a Las Vegas native. 
She told the council that in her position on the Chamber, she spearheaded a .25 quarter-cent increase in the sales tax to fund a second intake straw for Lake Mead. The measure passed with 74% voter approval, Kelley noted. 
 “Now that money has funded a third straw and a fourth straw, and continues to create that critical infrastructure we need for water,” she said.

On Sept. 11, U.S. District Judge Thomas L. Parker sentenced Lisa Evans, 43, of Olive Branch, to 1 ½ years in prison and three years supervised release. She faced a maximum sentence of 20 years for conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
As part of her sentence, Evans must pay $4.4 million in restitution to the U.S. Small Business Administration. She also is prohibited from opening additional lines of credit without prior approval, according to court docket notes. 
She requested to serve her sentence as close to Memphis as possible to be near family. As of Wednesday, information about her location was not listed through the Bureau of Prisons, which makes that determination. 
Between April 2020 to November 2021, Evans submitted fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program loan applications through her Memphis-based tax service business, USA Taxes.
Small businesses and other organizations that qualified could receive a loan to help pay for payroll, mortgage interest, rent and utilities. Instead, Evans applied for PPP loans for multiple people who weren’t entitled to receive them. 
A 2023 superseding indictment detailed how Evans conspired with dozens of other owners to submit loan applications with false documents and statements, including the number of employees, payroll of the business and certifications of how the money would be used. 
After securing the loan, the business owners paid Evans a kickback of between 20-30% of the loan. One owner, referred to H.S. in court records, received about $786,000 and paid Evans about $220,000 in return. 
“Individuals cheating the Paycheck Protection Program stole money from U.S. taxpayers who desperately needed these loans to keep their small businesses afloat and pay their employees during the COVID-19 pandemic,” Reagan Fondren, the then-acting U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Tennessee, said in a February statement. 
Evans was indicted with Lina O’Dea, who allegedly created false federal documents that she used in the loan applications. O’Dea also pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing. Another business owner was charged in 2022, but the charge was dropped.
Evans pleaded guilty in February and agreed to pay restitution in exchange for the federal government not pursuing additional charges against her for fraudulent COVID-19 relief applications submitted in 2020 and 2021, according to court records.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/07092505/c6428-gavel-court.jpg,,,2025-09-17 14:57:34.198360

Talbot Community School in Portland, Maine. (Photo via Gerald E. Talbot Community School/ Facebook)U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree is seeking answers after a parent was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement after dropping off their child at a Portland elementary school last week. 
“It is difficult to imagine any circumstance that could justify staging enforcement activity when children are arriving to learn,” Pingree wrote to ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons Tuesday. “Beyond the harm it causes the community at-large, these actions have caused irreparable damage to the family, who is already dealing with difficult circumstances.”
According to a letter sent to parents from Portland Superintendent Ryan Scallon, on the morning of Sept. 11, unidentified agents in unmarked vehicles wearing vests marked “police” detained a parent on a Gerald E. Talbot Community School access road after dropping off their child.
“The proximity of the enforcement activity to the school raises serious questions about its justification, its impact on the school community, and whether appropriate oversight and approvals were secured,” wrote Pingree, whose district includes Portland.

She went on to cite research that found such actions trigger “measurable harm: lower attendance, diminished academic performance, increased anxiety and depression, and lasting trauma for students and families – including those not directly targeted,” adding that district officials have already reported a drop in attendance since the incident.
Pingree also raised concerns about the fact that the arresting officers were unidentifiable and said the action caused confusion among local law enforcement who were not informed of the activity.
According to the district, an administrator “approached the officers to inquire about their presence” and the officers “did not state what agency they represented.” The district later confirmed with the Portland Police Department that they were not local officers. The police department also assured the district “that if they learn of any proposed enforcement action planned at a school, they will work to ensure that it does not occur there,” Scallon wrote.
Portland police later told the Portland Press Herald that the parent, a Honduran immigrant, had earlier been arrested by local officers on an accusation of a Class D domestic violence assault and was released on bail one day before he was detained by ICE outside the school. U.S. Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper Friday that he is being held at Cumberland County Jail. 
“ICE had to make this arrest at large in the community because Portland authorities do not cooperate with ICE,” McLaughlin said in a written statement.
Pingree’s letter concluded with a demand for “a full accounting of this operation, including which agencies were involved, what coordination occurred between those agencies, and the justification for selecting the school as a location for enforcement activity.” 
She also asked for “a written explanation of any review or retraining that occurs from this incident; a description of the guidance used to determine whether enforcement activity at schools is absolutely necessary; and a list of protocols adapted to minimize harm done to the community while practicing said enforcement activity.”
Several Maine organizations released a guide for students who are members of immigrant and LGBTQ+ communities to ensure they know their rights on and off school campuses.

Many of the issues had been raised in earlier audits, but not addressed. (Stock.adobe.com photo by Fizkes)The state Social Services Administration may have approved guardianship homes for children who are in state care where registered sex offenders lived, and failed to identify a convicted sex offender who worked in a group foster home and later faced criminal charges involving children under his care.
Those are just some of the findings of a 70-page audit released Wednesday by the Office of Legislative Audits that includes a slate of concerning findings dating back to 2008 and new findings that include nearly $700,000 in penalties for failing to meet federal foster care service requirements.
Legislative Auditor Brian Tanen, in a letter with the audit, said the administration “did not have comprehensive procedures to ensure individuals with disqualifying criminal backgrounds did not have access to children in the State’s care.”
The letter also noted that the administration “was not aware of the 7 registered sex offenders we identified that had the same address as an approved guardianship home housing 10 children as of August 2024 and had not identified that an individual employed by a group foster care home had been convicted of sexual assault of a minor. This individual was subsequently charged with crimes involving children under his care.”
The Social Services Administration, part of the Department of Human Services, oversees the work of the state’s 24 local social services departments that provide programs and services to about 24,000 children. There are roughly 12,500 providers and parents that participate in those programs at a cost of about $360 million, according to auditors.
The report covered a period between May 1, 2020, to May 31, 2024, overlapping the administrations of Gov. Larry Hogan (R) and Gov. Wes Moore (D).

Department of Human Services Secretary Rafael Lopez, in a Sept. 9 response to the audit, said his agency takes “the findings of the audit with the utmost seriousness.”
“In the 1.5 years of the 4-year audit period during which I served as Secretary, our leadership team has moved with urgency and challenged the status quo not only with the Social Services Administration, but across the department.”
The agency largely agreed with the more than one dozen findings in the audit.
In response, the agency repeatedly stated that “the safety and well-being of children are our highest priority.”
Seven on sex-offender registry had addresses of  group homes
Auditors noted that the administration failed to ensure that adults “convicted of disqualifying crimes” were not residing at homes in the state’s guardianship program. There were 2,463 such homes approved by the agency in fiscal 2024.
Local social services departments are responsible for criminal background checks on adults living in a home when it is initially approved, but the audit found that in fiscal 2024 the state “did not conduct periodic follow up to identify new adults” living in those homes after the initial approval.
Auditors identified seven adults on the state’s sex-offender registry living at addresses associated with an approved guardianship home as of August 2024. In one case, an individual convicted of sexual misconduct with a minor listed the same address as a home where four children between ages 4 and 8 lived.
“SSA [Social Services Administration] was not aware of any of these individuals until we provided them our match results in December 2024,” auditors wrote.
In its response, the agency said it was “fully committed to ensuring background checks are completed for individuals interacting with children under our care,” but that it does not have “legal authority to conduct ongoing monitoring or background checks” after children are placed in guardianship.
Auditors disagreed, saying the administration is still responsible for certifying facilities and “should implement the recommendations to ensure the ongoing safety of children placed in these settings by the state.”
Abuse allegations involving convicted sex offender
In another instance, auditors found a man convicted of sexual assault of a minor had been employed since December 2022 by a group of foster care homes, and that in June 2023 he “allegedly transported three foster children for an inappropriate activity.” The Washington County social services office determined there was evidence of abuse related to that incident.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Auditors said that DHS’ Office of Licensing and Monitoring had reviewed the home where that individual worked in April 2023, but did not uncover his sexual assault conviction. The audit said the administration could not provide documentation of any corrective action taken as a result to ensure background checks were conducted at foster care group homes.
In its response, DHS said it would ensure background checks are being completed. Additionally, it said the unidentified group home “removed portions of its employees’ criminal background checks to avoid … review.”
The administration ended placements with that provider in November 2023 and revoked the provider’s license a month later. All children were removed from the facility by February 2024.
“Additionally, the team member responsible for reviewing the criminal background clearance and their supervisor were disciplined,” DHS noted in its response.
It vowed to “take action,” including immediate suspension or revocation of licenses, removal of children and corrective action plans, if it identified “disqualifying criminal activity.”
Employee convicted of murder may have had access to children
Auditors used state wage data and Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services conviction records to review employees of 14 vendors that provide  care for some foster children housed in hotels. The review uncovered one individual “who was convicted of murder in 1990, which would preclude them from working with children.”
The auditors noted that the agency was not aware of the conviction and “could not readily determine if this individual had or continues to have unsupervised access to children.” In its response, the administration said the unidentified employee no longer works for the contractor “and we confirmed there is no invoice … referencing this employee.”
Questions on ‘sufficiency and propriety’ of background reviews
Auditors tested a sample of 10 group homes that the SSA said it reviewed in December 2023 and reported that background checks were conducted for all employees in those facilities.
But auditors said they could find “no evidence of a criminal background check in 5 of the homes raising questions about the sufficiency and propriety of those reviews.”

	The review did not turn up any individuals who had convictions that would have disqualified them from working with children, according to the report.
Accountability and compliance ‘remains unsatisfactory’
The audit also contained a half-dozen repeat findings including:

A lack of quality assurance and effective oversight of the local departments’ administration of child welfare programs.
Failing to ensure that local departments provided foster children with required medical and dental exams. Auditors identified 640 children who had not received a medical exam in the last year, and another 110 had not had an exam in up to six years. More than 1,600 children had not had a dental exam in the last six months, including 140 children who had never had a dental exam.
Failure to address instances where local offices did not promptly conduct abuse and neglect investigations. Between January 2023 and June 2024, it said 22 local offices took more than a month for such an investigation, while 10 failed to do so for seven or more months and five had not conducted an investigation for the entire 18-month period.
A lack of an effective process for redetermining eligibility resulting in the loss of nearly $23 million in federal funds.
Failure to pursue nearly $5 million in overpayments to providers.
Failure to ensure that payments made to an unidentified state university for child welfare services were consistent with work agreements, related to the task performed and backed up by adequate documentation.

“Based on the results of our current audit, we have concluded that SSA’s accountability and compliance level remains unsatisfactory,” auditors wrote in their report. “The significance of the findings and the number of repeated findings are the primary factors contributing to the current unsatisfactory rating.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/AdobeStock_251759837-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-17 13:57:33.434006

(Submitted by Christie Peterson)TOPEKA — Christie Peterson says she wasn’t a political activist before February and certainly had never been arrested.
But last week, Peterson, a Kansas 50501 organizer from Oskaloosa, was one of nine Kansans arrested in Washington, D.C., in what they call a planned act of civil disobedience.
“Does it matter that I got arrested? It only matters if it gets more eyes on the pushback and more people willing to join us in calling our representatives, writing our representatives, trying to meet with our senators and showing up for protests,” Peterson said. “My personal belief is it’s going to take thousands and thousands on the streets saying no, like has happened in other countries, and like happened in some periods of our history.”
Peterson and 12 other Kansans traveled to Washington as part of the Free State Advocates to raise awareness about proposed housing cuts in the House and Senate budgets that would affect families nationwide.
“We were seeing it both as taking our message to D.C., also at the same time, we were hearing of D.C. being quote-unquote occupied, and social media is really hard to trust,” Peterson said. “So we also wanted to kind of go put our own eyes on and bring back the message of what is really happening in D.C. at the moment.”
Peterson became involved with 50501 in February, a group that formed with the initial focus of holding 50 protests in 50 states on one day. Peterson attended that first protest and then noticed there weren’t any others planned. She stepped forward.
“I went from zero to 60,” Peterson said.
She learned how to “pull a permit” to protest at the Kansas capitol, and she connected with others in the state who wanted their voices heard too.
For several months, Peterson has been the lead facilitator for Kansas’ 50501 movement, along with other roles, such as volunteer coordinator. She has pulled back some on that now as she’s working with other groups.
Peterson said she connected with other political activists and last week made her way to Washington with the Free State Advocates, a group of Kansas activists focused on human rights.
In the nation’s capital, the group listened to U.S. Rep. Rashida Talib, D-Michigan, speak during a press conference about the impact of cuts to rental assistance programs that are projected to affect 100,000-plus households nationwide.
Then they set up pop-up tents in the Dirksen Senate Office Building’s busy cafeteria and chanted until police arrived to arrest them, Peterson said.
Peterson’s first arrest wasn’t dramatic, she said.
“I will say that I honestly believe the safest police place in America to get arrested is in the capitol,” Peterson said. “They know what they’re doing. They’re not taking it personally. Their energy levels are maintained at a level of calmness.”
Peterson said the Free State Advocates met up with another group, Popular Democracy in Action, and merged with them to support their work. That group practiced with them what it would be like to be arrested and how to stay calm, and explained that with people standing around yelling, the energy can change the way the arrest is handled, she said.
The eight other Kansans arrested were Miranda Bachman, Shelby Hermosillo, Olivia Phillips, Gary Phillips, Becky Norlin, Michelle Jones, Josh Fredrick and Sara Gillum. Eight were released quickly, but Norlin was detained overnight on additional charges of resisting, Peterson said.
In looking at the video later, Peterson said, it looked as if Norlin were trying to turn away to continue chanting.
 
Visiting legislators
While in Washington, the group visited Kansas U.S. representatives’ and senators’ offices, speaking with their staff about the national political environment.

More than 300 yellow notecards written by Kansans were to be delivered to Kansas senator offices. (Submitted: Christie Peterson)

They met with staff of Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat who represents the 3rd District, and Rep. Ron Estes, a Republican representing the 4th District, to talk about the need to protect immigrants, and low-income and queer people, the group said in a press release. They also spoke to Sen. Jerry Moran’s staff to discuss concerns about National Guard deployments to Wichita, as well as education and preserving the federal safety net, the press release said.
“I’m the only trans member of the group. I need to push my voice just as much as I’m helping to push everyone else’s,” said Jesseka Greene, of Abilene, in the press release. “In Moran’s office, I felt heard. I felt the emotional response I got when I got into the details of my experience as a trans woman looking for a job, after a lifetime of struggling through school needing more support.”
Peterson had a different experience in Moran’s office, where she went with a small group to deliver yellow postcards the group had used to create a “yellow brick road” concept on the capitol steps. People had written messages on the cards with the intent to give them to Moran and Sen. Roger Marshall.
But in Moran’s office, Peterson said, she was talking to them about the cards when suddenly the capitol police arrived to escort them out.
“They hadn’t even ever asked me to leave or spoken at all to me, other than letting me in,” she said.
The police explained to Peterson that she wasn’t allowed to bring in documents like that to U.S. capitol offices, although Peterson said other members of her group had dropped letters off the day before.
A spokesperson for Moran said the Kansas Impact Coalition had requested a meeting and Peterson was on the list for that meeting on Thursday. But on Friday, when Peterson was delivering the yellow cards, capitol police were notified of a group of people gathered for an extended time outside a staff office in the Dirksen building. Two police officers arrived after that call, just as Peterson and others went into Moran’s front office.
The spokesperson said the group delivered written messages, some of which said “karma is a b**ch” and “FDT,” and also included a drawing of a coffin with the letters RIP.
Peterson said the group gathered 300-plus “uncensored” messages from Kansans because Moran and Marshall have refused to meet with them in Kansas.
“We condemn violence in all forms. Period,” she said, adding that Moran’s office “cherrypicked” a few angry lines to distract from the message that Kansans are hurting and deserve to be heard.
 
Being heard
Peterson said she and others in her group want to be heard by the politicians who represent them in Washington, D.C., as she believes is the wish of many Kansans.
“I’m biracial, and looking back in history at the civil rights movement, we’re following the pathway that has created change, movement, for the rights we have now,” said Olivia Phillips, one of the protesters arrested, in a press release. “I felt as though I was doing a very similar thing protesting in this way, causing civil unrest like my grandparents and great grandparents stood with in the 60s. We come from the center of the country and we’re not getting heard.”
For Peterson, the reason to become an activist was simple: her two daughters.
“I was really scared by the people that I saw being nominated to lead our nation’s organizations and departments,” she said. “Not a fan of Donald Trump, but it was as I saw all of the things that had been proposed as part of Project 2025 that looked, by the evidence of who they were putting in charge of departments, to really be on the agenda for this administration, I became quite terrified.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DC-arrest-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-17 13:57:33.434006

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The first time I visited Memphis was in July 1978, and my family had taken a weekend trip so my older brother could tour the college then called Southwestern at Memphis, now Rhodes College. 
At 14, I’d been few places outside my hometown and was excited for the opportunity to see a new city. But as it turned out, I didn’t see much. My chief memories of the trip are of military vehicles rolling down nearly empty streets as we headed back to our motel before the enforced curfew set in.
Mayor Wyeth Chandler declared a civil emergency and called for support from the Tennessee National Guard amid a strike by members of the firefighters union. In the wake of the walkout, fires were set throughout the city and more than 300 buildings burned. 
At the time, fire department Director Robert Walker said, “The scars will be there for many years,” and the scars of which he spoke were likely not just physical: the presence of troops is jarring to Americans, unused as we are to seeing armed members of the military walking around our cities.
But here we are again. Friday, Gov. Bill Lee acknowledged that he has for months been in “constant communication with the Trump Administration to develop a multi-phased, strategic plan to combat crime in Memphis.” 
Tennessee governor not ready to deploy troops to Memphis

What’s particularly interesting about Lee’s statement is that just weeks earlier — on Aug. 26 — he told more than a dozen journalists at a press conference that he had just that day received a report showing a decline in Memphis crime of 15% and that he had no plans to send military troops to the Bluff City. 
“We’ve had no conversations with the president or his team about National Guard in Memphis. We have targeted our efforts and our communications with those federal agencies. I even spoke this morning with an FBI official about our efforts in Memphis and Shelby County and how they’re working. So that’s where we are today,” Lee said.
I’ve often taken Lee to task for hypocrisy, such as his advocacy for adoption while also signing into law a measure that prohibits same sex-couples from pursuing adoption. After a family friend was killed during a mass shooting at Nashville’s Covenant School, he called a special legislative session purportedly dedicated to creating gun safety measures but failed to appear at the legislature even one time during the session. His absence and lackadaisical approach made clear he had no interest in pushing any measures that could be construed as anti-gun, including so-called red flag laws. 
But his recent behavior isn’t simply hypocritical: it’s outright dishonest. 
Was Lee lying in August when he said he’d had no conversations with the Trump administration about deploying the National Guard, or was he lying Friday when he said he’s been communicating with the administration for months?
The Lookout has filed public records requests for emails between Lee, his office and the Trump administration, but I think it’s likely we won’t get a definitive answer. Lee may have the political spine of a boiled shrimp, but he’s a master of deflection, calmly turning away tough questions by reporters in what has become a near daily disappointment. 
A sincere effort or pandering to Trump?
It’s true, Memphis does top several lists of cities with high crime rates, but this is nothing new: the city has ranked high for crime for years. But in addition to Lee’s admission that crime is on the wane, statistics from the Memphis Police Department show crime is down by more than 22% in 2025 from 2024 — the MPD says it’s at a 25-year low. 
In August, a story in Axios reported that crime, including murders, is lower nationally than it has been since Barack Obama was president.
As I read the Axios story I noted how many of the states posting high crime rates are in states with lax gun laws, including Tennessee. Multiple organizations that track gun violence, including the Giffords Law Center and Everytown, show a correlation between a lack of safe gun laws and deaths by gun violence. 
Gov. Lee to work with Trump administration to deploy National Guard in Memphis

If Lee is serious about addressing crime, a good start would be to take up some — any — legislation aimed at making Tennessee less of the Wild West. He could also ensure the state continues to provide funding for domestic violence shelters, like the Family Safety Center of Memphis and Shelby County, which is among the victim-serving agencies left on ice when the state cut funds.  
And he could encourage the state’s Republican lawmakers to cease targeting Memphis, as they did when House Speaker Cameron Sexton and Lt. Gov. Randy McNally threatened to withhold tax revenue from the city in 2024 if voters passed referendums on gun control measures.
Imagine the political calculation it takes to try to prevent Memphis officials from making their city safer, then use Trump to call in troops to crack down on crime.
With his final term in office ending in little more than a year, this is the time for him to swing for the fences and to use whatever political capital he has garnered since his election eight years ago. 
But Lee seems more inclined to pander to the interests of President Donald Trump, who in 2024 called Lee a RINO — Republican in name only — and is pushing for military forces to be stationed in mostly cities with Democratic mayors, like Memphis. 
Crime may, indeed, decrease during the National Guard presence — at least for as long as soldiers are standing on street corners. But that’s not a permanent fix, and it’s sure to leave more scars of the psychic and emotional kind on Memphians. 
As for Lee, who has long been thought to have aspirations for higher office, he will leave a legacy in Tennessee of lost opportunities, cravenly caving in for Trump’s approval and a reputation as a first-class hypocrite.

(Screenshot from video from James Uthmeier's X account)A Florida activist group is using an unusual angle to persuade a federal court to keep a strict immigration law blocked: Attorney General James Uthmeier’s argument on open carry of guns.
Cody Wofsy, an ACLU attorney representing the Immigrants’ Rights Project, wrote a brief letter to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit Monday evening citing Uthmeier’s declaration that the open carry of firearms is the “law of the state.” Uthmeier’s memo to law enforcement last week was based on a state appellate court decision striking down Florida’s ban on publicly displaying guns.
Wofsy — part of a large coalition asking the three-judge Eleventh Circuit panel to keep blocking Florida’s SB 4-C immigration law — says Uthmeier’s thought process on why officers shouldn’t arrest Floridians openly carrying guns is identical to pro-immigration groups’ arguments on why state police can’t arrest migrants illegally in the country.
“He stated that this [open carry] decision was ‘binding on all Florida’s trial courts,’ even though there was still a possibility the Court of Appeal might rehear the issue,” Wofsy wrote. He pointed out that both courts enjoined prosecutions of people either openly carrying firearms or illegally in the state, and both cases involved instructing law enforcement not to arrest these individuals.
“Yet here — unlike in the [open-carry case] — Attorney General Uthmeier contests that commonsense conclusion,” Wofsy continued. “Rather than advising that police should ‘refrain from arresting’ for a crime that cannot be prosecuted, he encouraged police to make such arrests in violation of the district court’s order.”
What is the court case about?
Uthmeier has been long locked in a battle with federal judge Kathleen Williams in the Southern District of Florida. In April, following a lawsuit by pro-immigration groups to strike down SB 4-C, she issued a preliminary injunction against the law for infringing on federal authority. Immigration regulation is ultimately a federal power.
Although Williams said this prevented all officers from making arrests of non-citizens, Uthmeier disputed the order’s scope by claiming it only applied to some police, not the Florida Highway Patrol. Williams held him in civil contempt (although he later challenged that ruling and won).
Uthmeier’s office appealed to the Eleventh Circuit, which denied his request to unpause the law. He then asked the U.S. Supreme Court for emergency relief allowing officers to make arrests, but they summarily rejected the motion. Now, the Eleventh Circuit panel must decide whether a preliminary injunction was rightfully applied. Oral arguments will be held in Atlanta on Oct. 9.
SB-4C is a sweeping immigration package approved in February. Its wide-ranging provisions include empowering state prosecutors and officers to arrest migrants illegally in the state, striking in-state tuition for undocumented college students, and mandating the death penalty for noncitizens convicted of capital crimes.
The ACLU and the attorney general’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
Court strikes down Florida’s open carry ban
Last week, the Florida First District Court of Appeal struck down a 1987 Florida law banning the open carry of firearms. This led some sheriffs to immediately vow not to arrest people publicly displaying their guns, although others, like Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, initially cast doubt on whether the DCA’s ruling took precedence over a 2017 Florida Supreme Court decision upholding the ban.
Although the First District said the ruling wouldn’t be final until Sep. 25 to give time for rehearing or other legal motions, Uthmeier as the state’s chief legal officer swiftly addressed the confusion in a memo sent to all state law enforcement, declaring open carry as the “law of the state.”
He referred to a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court case requiring laws addressing the Second Amendment to be based on “historic” tradition. And because no other appellate court had considered the open carry ban since the 2022 ruling, the DCA’s finding was final.
Of note, the open-carry ban had been defended in court by Republican attorneys general in recent years past, including now-U.S. Sen. Ashley Moody and now-U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. But this isn’t the only gun control Florida law Uthmeier has vowed to let die: During the tail end of the 2025 legislative session, soon after he was appointed to his post, Uthmeier said he would not defend a 2018 law banning under-21-year-olds from purchasing long guns.
The Legislature passed the law in the weeks following the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shootings in Parkland.
Along with Illinois, California, and New York, Florida was just one of four states that had explicitly outlawed open carry. Unlike these blue states, Florida allows residents to conceal carry without a permit.

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Treasurer of State Daniel Elliott on Wednesday announced he’s running for reelection as Indiana’s chief investment officer.
“My job is to safeguard your money and put Hoosiers first,” he said, in a news release. “We’ve delivered historic returns, stood up to powerful interests, and made our communities stronger.”
“I’m running to keep that momentum going,” Elliott, a Republican, added.
His campaign highlighted a “conservative, data-driven” investment strategy that has paid off for the state’s coffers — generating more than $1 billion in returns since he took office in early 2023. That includes about $514 million in the last year alone, more than was earned across the decade prior, he said.
Pension board votes to remove BlackRock due to ESG violations

Elliott has also been active in campaigns to cut foreign and “woke” influences from Indiana’s investment programs.
He and Comptroller Elise Nieshalla celebrated the pension’s system’s “speedy” divestment from Chinese entities last summer. And he put BlackRock — one of the world’s largest asset managers — on a state watch list for illegal environmental, social or governance commitments. He and other trustees voted to dismiss the firm from handling the pension system’s portfolio.
Elliott, a prominent “school choice” supporter, also runs the state’s education and career scholarship account programs. But in the most recent two-year budget, despite his protests, lawmakers handed those responsibilities over to the Department of Education.
The treasurer additionally oversees several quasi-agencies.

TrustINdiana, for instance, offers local units of government a way to invest public funds. INvestABLE Indiana, meanwhile, gives disabled Hoosiers a tax-advantaged way to save money without affecting their eligibility for programs like Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income. And Indiana529 is a tax-advantaged investment plan that helps families save for future educational expenses.
The campaign also touted Elliott’s public safety accomplishments: overseeing the modernization of Indiana’s 911 system, completing the first statewide cybersecurity assessment and training more than 400 dispatchers at no charge to counties. Functions like text-to-911, language translation and geolocation were also deployed to boost emergency responses.
“From record investments to safer communities, we’re building a stronger Indiana for every family,” Elliott said. “I’m not done fighting for you.”
Candidates for the role will be selected at political party conventions — not primary elections — in the spring. Those chosen will face off during the general election next fall.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — State Superintendent Ryan Walters will not face criminal charges over reports of explicit images appearing on his office TV, the Oklahoma County District Attorney’s Office announced Wednesday.
A two-sentence news release from District Attorney Vicki Behenna revealed her office found insufficient evidence to file criminal charges. The Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Office and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation both looked into the matter.
Two members of the Oklahoma State Board of Education reported seeing images of naked women on the Samsung TV in Walters’ office during a private portion of the board’s July 24 meeting. Walters called the reports “categorically false,” but an investigation by House Speaker Kyle Hilbert suggested the cause might have been a 1985 Jackie Chan film that spontaneously started playing on the TV’s Samsung movie channel.
The district attorney’s announcement did not discuss whether law enforcement reached a similar conclusion. A spokesperson for Behenna’s office did not immediately return a request for comment on what investigators believe happened.
Walters’ office also did not immediately comment.

Hilbert and the Office of Management and Enterprise Services investigated and learned the TV, which had been recently installed in Walters’ office in the Oklahoma State Department of Education, automatically launched the ​​Samsung TV Plus Channel 1204 (Movie Hub Action) when powered on, the speaker said in an Aug. 5 report. 
Hilbert obtained the channel’s broadcast schedule from a government affairs specialist at Samsung. He said the schedule showed the 1985 film “The Protector” starring Jackie Chan and Danny Aiello broadcast during the hours of the state Board of Education meeting. 
Images from the movie, which includes multiple scenes with naked women, match closely with what board members Becky Carson and Ryan Deatherage, as well as Walters himself, reported seeing on the screen, according to the speaker’s report.
Walters had accused Carson and Deatherage of lying about what they saw, and he suggested their claims were a set-up organized by Gov. Kevin Stitt, who appointed them to the board.

Hilbert, though, said the likely cause was a “bizarre accident,” not a planned conspiracy.
Walters and the board have yet to meet since the incident.
Carson and Deatherage did not immediately return a request for comment after the district attorney’s announcement Wednesday.
After a special board meeting Sept. 3, which Walters did not attend, Carson said even if the law enforcement investigation into what happened finds no criminal wrongdoing, “it doesn’t make it right.”
“I think anybody in this position would appreciate an apology,” she said.

(Photo by Matthew Perschall/Louisiana Illuminator)NEW ORLEANS –Nziki Wiltz, buzzed around a crowded job fair Sept. 4 at the headquarters for the criminal justice reform nonprofit Voice of the Experienced (VOTE), helping people apply for jobs.
“We’re making copies for those that need copies … whatever you need,” Wiltz said, “we’re going to make sure that if we don’t have it, we help you get it.”
Wiltz, a regional policy coordinator for VOTE, said that having a racketeering charge brought against her by the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s Office over six years ago taught her how vulnerable people are to the criminal justice system. The charge was later dropped.
“I lost everything, and then I started learning, studying the law and getting [involved with] more organizations that do work like VOTE,” Wiltz said.
Now, after setting up VOTE’s job fair designed to connect people with criminal convictions with employers willing to hire people with that history, Wiltz and her colleagues have their eyes set on the city’s upcoming election.
Wiltz and her colleagues are advocating for voters to vote to approve an amendment to the city charter to protect people with a conviction history from laws that “arbitrarily and unreasonably” discriminate against them. They hope that the Fair Chance Amendment, as proponents of the measure call it, will serve as a declaration of the city’s residents in support of giving people with past convictions a second chance.
The amendment, if passed, will amend the municipal Bill of Rights, a largely aspirational section of the charter, that “reflects the beliefs, convictions and goals of the citizens of New Orleans,” according to the document.
Although it’s not clear that the amendment will result in any immediate, concrete change for formerly incarcerated people, supporters say it will serve as a foundation to combat discrimination against people with convictions on their record.
“If we vote yes on that, it enshrines a protected class of people with conviction history,” said Ronald Marshall, chief policy analyst at VOTE.
Marshall, who found work with VOTE after getting out of prison, said that he constantly meets people who are getting turned down for jobs and can’t find housing because they were discriminated against due to their status as a formerly incarcerated person.

Nearly 1 in 3 Americans has some sort of criminal record, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Roughly 45 million have had misdemeanor convictions and an estimated 19 million have had a felony conviction. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), the statistical arm of the Department of Justice, Louisiana was ranked 2nd in the nation for imprisonment rates in 2022, behind Mississippi.
Research done by the Historic New Orleans Collection has shown how Louisiana has long been a leader in incarceration in the United States. And a study released by the BJS in 2021, revealed that no more than 40% of formerly incarcerated people they tracked were employed at any given time over a four year period between 2010-2014.
“​​When people are leaving incarceration and coming back to their communities, a job and housing are the two major things that they’ve got to get sorted out in order to restabilize, and oftentimes, you can’t get a job without a house and you can’t get a house without a job,” Monique Blossom, director of policy and communications at the Louisiana Fair Housing Action Center told Verite News in an interview before the job fair.

During a public hearing at City Hall in April for the ballot measure, several supporters of the issue shared how a criminal conviction can stay with a person, making finding a job and housing difficult.
“This amendment is just not about a fairness, it’s about giving our people, our neighbors, a real second chance,” said Ciara Green, a business owner and volunteer with VOTE who spoke at the hearing. “It’s about ending the sentence at the prison gate, not extending it to every job interview, every housing application and every ‘no’ that gets thrown at someone who’s already paid the price.”
Marshall helped advocate in City Hall for the ballot measure. He said that the progress the city made this year, sharpening the city’s existing “Ban the Box” ordinance, has already laid the foundation to support people with a history of conviction when they’re applying for jobs with the city and city contractors. The “Ban the Box” ordinance was originally passed in 2018, and it required the city and its contractors to interview candidates before checking for a criminal record.
This summer, the City Council passed an ordinance that amended the city’s Ban the Box ordinance, adding five criteria that the city’s hiring managers would have to consider before denying a formerly incarcerated person a position. The ordinance also created a means for job applicants to sue in District Court if they feel they were denied a position in violation of the code.
Marshall said that voting to enshrine formerly incarcerated people as a protected class in city law — which the amendment would do, supporters say — ups the ante by creating further legal foundations to protect people with histories of conviction, especially where it does not clash with state law.
“We are preempted from creating local laws on housing. We are preempted from creating local laws on licensures. … We are preempted in a lot of areas by state law,” Marshall said, arguing that in areas where state or federal law does not prevent it, the measure’s passage could create space for formerly incarcerated people to challenge potentially discriminatory practices.
“We’ve got to end the permanent punishment,” Marshall said.
Councilmember Oliver Thomas introduced the changes to the Ban the Box law and the ordinance to amend the Bill of Rights. Dominique Lang Jackson, his legislative director, said the two pieces of legislation work together to protect formerly incarcerated people from discrimination. The latter, if passed by the voters, “will reflect the beliefs of our citizens,” Lang Jackson wrote, and the former “protect(s) formerly incarcerated individuals from discrimination based on conviction history in employment/contracting with the City of New Orleans.”
City Council President JP Morrell, who told Verite News that he “fully supports the amendment on the ballot,” also clarified the limitations of the amendment, in a previous hearing.
“When we amend the charter, that affects the city, not private industries,” he said during a City Council Criminal Justice Meeting in April.
At the Sept. 4 job fair, which offered a wide range of assistance from resume writing to offering free business clothes, others lauded the amendment and what it might be able to achieve for formerly incarcerated individuals.
Local entrepreneur, Sess 4-5, was at the event to promote it on social media and encourage some of his followers to come out and look for a job. When asked about the ballot initiative he said that he was in favor of it.
“It’ll help take the barriers off of folks who were incarcerated, who changed their lives and [are] in the process of becoming productive citizens, so that you won’t have those obstacles or barriers placed on you,” he said. “If you qualify for the job, you should be able to get the job.”
Jordan Bridges, organizing director at the New Orleans Workers’ Center for Racial Justice, was there to tell attendees what services his organization offers.
“As a workers’ center focused on economic justice and labor justice we wanted to make sure that those workers specifically have access to resources in case things go wrong at work,” Bridges said.
The NOWCRJ is preparing for their own event to help people impacted by the justice system — a warrant clinic scheduled for Sept. 20. At the clinic, attendees will be able to address outstanding misdemeanor warrants and associated fines and fees and reinstate their Louisiana drivers licenses with the Office of Motor Vehicles.
With respect to the ballot question, Bridges said they are urging everyone to vote yes.
“Our goal, for even our own warrant clinic, is to make sure that we address systemic issues, we dissolve barriers to employment, and this Fair Chance Amendment gives formerly incarcerated people a chance to participate more fully in society,” Bridges said.

(Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)The warden fired from Jefferson City Correctional Center in the aftermath of an inmate’s death is suing the state, alleging she lost her job due to age, gender, racial and disability discrimination.
Doris Falkenrath, who was fired on June 13, 2024, filed the lawsuit Aug. 27 in Cole County Circuit Court. When she was fired, the lawsuit states, Falkenrath was told she was being disciplined for failing to cooperate with the criminal investigation into the December 2023, death of Othel Moore that led to felony charges against five corrections officers.
Charges against two of the corrections officers have been dropped and trial dates for the other three – Bryanne Bradshaw, Jacob Case and Justin Leggins — are due to be set later this year. Falkenrath has not been charged with any crimes associated with Moore’s death.
Moore died during a planned sweep of the prison by the Corrections Emergency Response Team, or CERT. Moore, 38, was pepper-sprayed in the face multiple times, had his face improperly covered by a hood that blocked his nose and mouth and left unattended in a cell for more than 30 minutes, according to documents in Cole County Circuit Court for the criminal cases.
Warden of Missouri prison replaced after investigation of inmate death

Falkenrath says in her lawsuit that she was absent at a family funeral the day Moore died. She was accused by central office leadership of failing to cooperate in the ensuing criminal investigation by the Cole County Sheriff’s Office, the lawsuit states
Falkenrath “fully cooperated with Cole County but left the interview feeling as though she was being blamed for the offender’s death, despite her absence during the CERT operation and the fact that her supervisor… had authorized the CERT,” the lawsuit states.
Falkenrath details instances from her career where she felt she was passed over for promotion, undermined by superiors and retaliated against for being truthful.
“As a direct and proximate result of defendant’s unlawful conduct,” the lawsuit states, “plaintiff has suffered, and will continue to suffer, damages including past and future lost wages and benefits; detrimental job record; career damage and diminished career potential; garden variety mental and emotional distress in the form of embarrassment, degradation, humiliation, anxiety, loss of enjoyment of life, and loss of sleep; pain and suffering; and other nonpecuniary losses.”
Falkenrath’s attorney, David Lunceford, declined a request for comment on the lawsuit.
The department does not comment on pending litigation, spokeswoman Karen Pojmann said in an email to The Independent.
Falkenrath worked for the Department of Corrections from 1999 to 2005, returning in 2009, according to the court filing. She became deputy warden in 2018 at Fulton Reception and Diagnostic Center and was promoted to warden in 2019.
Falkenrath was named warden at Jefferson City Correctional Center in 2021 despite her objections “citing her approaching retirement and her medical condition of multiple sclerosis,” the lawsuit states. 
She was, in part, concerned the prison is “a maximum security, violent all-male facility and the lack of support she anticipated as an African American female in that environment.”
In addition to discrimination claims, Falkenrath’s six-count lawsuit also alleges department leadership created a hostile work environment and retaliated illegally.
The lawsuit says former corrections director Anne Precythe, who is white and who retired in 2023, viewed Falkenrath as a “diversity hire” and was condescending about Falkenrath’s abilities.
“(Precythe) was consistently condescending and dismissive,” the lawsuit states.
During one meeting at the Fulton prison, when Falkenrath disagreed with Precythe, she “responded to plaintiff’s disagreement by stating that plaintiff ‘had no idea what good looked like’ and advised plaintiff to seek guidance from a more experienced warden.”
In the retaliation claim, Falkenrath asserts she complained to the director of the Division of Adult Institutions about offensive imagery at the corrections central office, including an image of children in blackface, but no action was taken. 
When she complained, the lawsuit states, Falkenrath’s husband’s job at the central office was eliminated.
Falkenrath is seeking to be reinstated with back pay as well as punitive damages for discrimination.

(Photo courtesy Elevatus Architecture)The State Budget Committee on Wednesday approved a request from the Indiana Department of Correction for $15.79 million in state funding to prepare Miami Correctional Facility for use in a new federal immigration detention agreement.
The money will fund a wide range of infrastructure upgrades and equipment purchases, according to budget committee documents obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle. 
Facility needs listed by DOC included enhancements to perimeter fencing and lighting; new temporary housing structures for staff; modifications to intake and processing areas; installation of drug detection and drone prevention systems; and x-ray screening equipment. 
Officials said in the budget committee request that those improvements are “necessary to operate a proposed detention facility at Miami Correctional Facility in order to facilitate the federal immigration and law enforcement activity” and will be undertaken “upon execution of the agreement with the federal government.”
Story continues below.
DOC Budget Committee 09172025
 
The request was approved just after DOC finalized a two-year contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The agreement, signed Sept. 16, commits the state agency to providing detention services for adult men classified as medium-maximum security for stays longer than 72 hours. It begins Oct. 1 runs through Sept. 30, 2027.
DOC Commissioner Lloyd Arnold framed the agreement as a way to bring idle prison space back into use while generating revenue to boost staffing.
“When we came in under this administration, we were trying to find ways … to fill that facility up, utilize those beds,” he said, noting that in 2021, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, DOC shut down roughly half of the prison, which has since left 1,200 beds “unoccupied in that facility.”
DOC’s latest figures for August showed that Miami Correctional Facility was housing 1,845 inmates in 1,862 available beds. The prison site has a total capacity of more than 3,100 beds when fully operational but the agency has been unable to find staff for that.
“Are there ways that we could actually pay staff at that facility, maybe more money, maybe get them to come there … ?” Arnold continued.
Story continues below.

Under the agreement, ICE will pay Indiana a per diem rate of $291.94 for each detainee per day — far higher than the $42 per day Indiana pays county sheriffs to house state inmates, and nearly four times the $75 per day cost for current inmates at the Miami Correctional Facility.
Even so, Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis, pressed Arnold on whether the federal government would directly reimburse Indiana for the $15.79 million in upfront costs associated with housing ICE detainees.
“This amount is seven times higher than we pay our locals,” he said during an exchange with Arnold at Wednesday’s meeting. “Would you agree that, in effect, there is a built in profit for the state in this?”
Arnold confirmed that the contract relies on the per diem rate, not a direct reimbursement of initial expenses. Instead, the state is relying on the volume of detainees and the daily rate to recoup its investment over time. He emphasized that the higher rate is intended to protect Hoosier taxpayers and ensure the facility can be adequately staffed and operated.
“We wouldn’t be doing it if there was not a built-in profit,” Arnold insisted.
Details of the agreement
Arnold said DOC intends to raise Miami’s correctional officer pay from $24 an hour to $28 to stay competitive with nearby auto plants.
“If I can go work at Subaru and make $28 an hour and not have anybody punch me in the face or spit on me … I’m gonna go do that,” he said. “Is there a guarantee? No … but we’ve got to try to find a way to find solutions.”

Arnold further emphasized that the ICE contract applies only to adult men, and that “we should not experience any concern with pregnant women, small children … we will not have any of that at that facility.”
He added that detainees will be held under federal detention standards “to ensure they get back to their country of origin in a safe manner.”
DOC spokeswoman Annie Goeller said the deal covers “housing, clothing, food, medical, translation, access to courts, transportation, and phone and communication services for typical stays of 30–45 days.” 
She added that it also encompasses contracts with Aramark, Centurion, Indiana’s Office of Technology, and other vendors on DOC premises, as well as “a heightened rate for correctional officers and non-custody staff in order to properly staff the facility, in accordance with ICE detention standards.”
The contract guarantees a minimum of 450 filled beds for all but the first 120 days of the full two-year term, and allows for up to 1,000 occupied beds overall. 
That means the value of the deal ranges from about $79 million over two years to as much as $213.1 million if the facility is at maximum capacity the whole time.
Story continues below.
4.3.1-70CDCR25FIGR00258 (Signed)
 
The first task order — covering Sept. 30 through Oct. 31 of this year — already funds $6 million for detention services and $20,000 for on-call transportation.
The Miami contract is part of a broader set of immigration enforcement agreements Indiana entered earlier this year. In addition to DOC’s detention arrangement, state police and other agencies signed agreements with ICE to collaborate on enforcement efforts across the state.
Plans for other state prisons
Arnold also addressed uncertainty around the future of the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City, saying there has been “a lot of misinformation” about whether the facility will close once construction of the new prison in Westville is completed.
Officials confirmed last month that the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City will remain open “for some time” after the new $1.2 billion Northwest Indiana Correctional Facility opens in 2027, backing away from earlier plans to shutter it.
Westville Correctional Facility, located just 14 miles south, will still close as originally planned.
“We have never said, as the Department of Correction, nor the governor’s office, [that] ‘Hey, we’re not shutting down the prison at Michigan City,’” Arnold told the budget committee. “There are concerns because our population is increasing, going across the board.”
He said that the department rescinded a letter of intent signed under the previous administration to transfer the prison site back to Michigan City because “we don’t want to give away state property.”
For now, Arnold said the plan is still to close the Michigan City facility eventually, though the timing is uncertain. 
“Is it in 2027? No, please, no,” he said. “It’s one of those things as we go through time, we may have to continue discussions of what we need to do, what’s best for us, what’s best for the taxpayers, and [whether] keeping that facility either open or closed.”

It is a living community on the Long Island Sound.
Now, United Illuminating wants to rebuild its Fairfield to Congress Railroad transmission line by planting utility poles as tall as 195 feet through the South End, on private and city land in densely occupied community blocks.
 The Connecticut Siting Council should deny this proposal. Doing otherwise would not only damage irreplaceable cultural sites – it would also silence residents’ voices in shaping the future of the neighborhoods they call home. This would not be the first time we have been forced to shoulder the region’s burdens. The South End has unfairly been the designated area for coal plants, substations, and other infrastructure for decades.
The plan would claim acres on actual neighborhood blocks, placing massive monopoles right in our streets, on the land where families gather in churches, children play on sidewalks, and entrepreneurs open storefronts with great hope.
These towers would loom over homes and historic landmarks – including our own 1848 Mary and Eliza Freeman Houses and the Barnum Museum, Bridgeport’s only national landmark. The message has long been that Bridgeport is expendable.
But our history proves otherwise.
In the 19th Century, Little Liberia (1821–1899) stood here as one of the earliest settlements of free people of color, Black and Indigenous. Residents built businesses, a school for colored children, and even Bridgeport’s first free lending library. They created opportunity and community under circumstances meant to deny them both.
That spirit of possibility never left. Lewis Latimer, who lived here, transformed Edison’s lightbulb into a lasting world-changing invention. If Latimer could take something that flickered for only seconds and make it light the world, surely today’s utility can be required to explore alternatives that won’t harm our community.
The current proposal is not the only option. Community partners have identified alternatives – including undergrounding segments – that United Illuminating dismissed as “too expensive.” Independent engineering estimates obtained by local groups suggest otherwise. If the Siting Council denies the application, the company would need to reapply under updated rules requiring a transparent, public analysis of costs and alternatives. That is the process Bridgeport deserves – one based on evidence, not assumptions.
This fight is about more than just utility poles. It is about fairness, transparency, and respect. When concerns arose in more affluent Fairfield, the Council shifted the project to protect that community in a decision that has since been found illegal. Bridgeport –- a designated environmental justice community -– was left to bear the burdens, with utility poles slated near residences like the Windward Apartments, cultural resources, and areas planned for affordable housing and small businesses. That disparity echoes a long history of environmental injustice. But the public is engaged now, and we are watching.
It also threatens to derail the revitalization already underway. Over the last few years, the South End has drawn millions of dollars of investment to restore historic sites, create housing, and attract new businesses. That momentum builds on a legacy of vision – the same community that once hosted a seaside resort hotel for wealthy Black travelers (documented in a letter to abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass) is now striving again to welcome visitors, families, and entrepreneurs. Planting steel poles over these efforts would undermine the economic momentum residents have worked so hard to build.
Bridgeport’s South End is worth protecting – not only for the heritage of Little Liberia, its archaeological sites, or the more than 100 structures eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. It is worth protecting for the people living here today – and the future we are still building.
Tomorrow, September 18, the Connecticut Siting Council is scheduled to vote—but that decision may be delayed, as Gov. Ned Lamont recently suggested. If it is delayed, it must be to ensure a fair and transparent process where everyone has a chance to evaluate and respond to the proposals. 
When the time comes, the council will face a choice: side with a utility that dismissed alternatives out of hand, or stand with a community fighting for its heritage and its right to decide what happens where it lives, works, prays, and plays. It should choose the latter.

In August, Maleyko was chosen by the board in a 5-3 vote from among three finalists. The other two were Lisa Coons, former state superintendent in Virginia and a former Tennessee education official, and Judy Walton, superintendent of Harrison Community Schools.
“I am thrilled to have the opportunity to support children and families, educators, and other school staff at all of Michigan’s public schools,” Maleyko said in a Michigan Department of Education statement Tuesday.
“From my experience in Dearborn Public Schools and the relationships I have with educators across the state, I know that local districts, the Michigan Department of Education, and the State Board of Education are all strongly committed to doing whatever we can to improve student achievement.”
He will be taking on the job at a critical time. State test results released a day after he was selected showed slight gains for students in many areas, but third grade English language arts results reached an 11-year low. There has long been criticism and concern about school performance in Michigan, especially in literacy, with the most vocal critics being many Republican lawmakers and even Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who said earlier this year that the state must “face our literacy crisis with fierce urgency.”
The contract was signed Tuesday by Pamela Pugh, the president of the State Board of Education, and Judy Pritchett, the board secretary. On Sept. 9, the board voted to allow Pugh to negotiate on its behalf with Maleyko.
Here is a breakdown of the contract’s benefits:

He’ll be eligible for the same retirement, insurance benefits, and deferred compensation plans as other state of Michigan cabinet level officials.
He’ll receive 104 hours or 13 days of sick leave each year.
He’ll receive 240 hours or 30 days of annual leave.
He’ll be provided with a state vehicle for work within the scope of his official duties. The vehicle can be used for personal use, but Maleyko will have to reimburse the state each year.
The board will evaluate Maleyko’s work each year. If his work is deemed satisfactory, his salary will be increased by “at least the average percentage increases granted to other department directors in state government,” according to the contract.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — On the recommendations of South Carolina’s college police chiefs, the House education chair says she intends to push next year to strengthen penalties for fake threats and require active shooter training for college students new to campus.
Those were among the takeaways Tuesday after a legislative panel heard from state law enforcement and heads of campus police for the University of South Carolina, Clemson, the College of Charleston, Coastal Carolina and South Carolina State on safety protocols and preparations.
Chairwoman Shannon Erickson, R-Beaufort, said she and Myrtle Beach Rep. Tim McGinnis, who led the panel, initially discussed calling the meeting following a swatting hoax at USC’s Columbia campus in late August.
Last Wednesday’s assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University made the conversation more urgent, Erickson said.
Bills introduced in both chambers in early 2024 sought to up penalties for people convicted of what’s called swatting — named for the heavy response from law enforcement, to include SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) teams, the hoaxes bring.
Neither bill received a hearing, and no one introduced similar legislation this year.
“But just like with a lot of things, it’s grown in its awareness,” Erickson told reporters following the meeting.
The hoax that prompted an active shooting alert to USC students — spreading fear and chaos — remains under investigation by the State Law Enforcement Division and the FBI, campus police Chief Chris Wuchenich told legislators.
A ‘swatting’ hoax prompted active shooter alert at USC

Attorney General Alan Wilson has blamed an “online teen crime group” known as Purgatory, which has claimed credit for a wave of swatting calls at campuses nationwide.
It’s not just colleges, Erickson said, pointing a private K-12 school on Hilton Head Island cancelling classes Tuesday after receiving an unnamed threat.
“Those are the type of disruptions that need a penalty,” she said. “You shouldn’t cause children to lose a day of learning and be able to do something like that and then walk away scot-free. We ought to be able to have some kind of consequence.”
When asked, the police chiefs said they support criminal penalties for people who call in fake threats, as well as making active shooter training a requirement — not just an option — for the state’s college students.
“I am a little concerned that we’re not taking that moment when kids are entering our schools, when those students are coming in, and we’re not giving them that intro to safety in the beginning,” Erickson said.

How campus police prepare
Law enforcement also spoke about how they prepare for potentially controversial events on campus.
At USC, police conduct a formal risk and violence assessment for each event with specially trained officers on its team. For speakers, the review includes what they’ve said and what’s happened elsewhere, Wuchenich said.
When the founder of the Proud Boys and another far-right political provocateur spoke at a USC student event last year, there were officers from state and local police departments positioned on the ground and rooftops, as well as a command center. Drones, bomb-sniffing dogs and police barriers separated protesters and counter protesters.
Following Kirk’s assassination, the potential for a long-distance shooter has been added to the preparation scenarios, Wuchenich said.
Staffing shortage
Richard Johnson, the campus police chief at SC State since May, told legislators he needs more officers.
His department heightened security measures at the Orangeburg campus last week amid unspecified threats to historically Black colleges across the Southeast. Thankfully, nothing happened at the college, he said.
The college has 10 full time police officers. But he needs at least 16 — preferably 20, Johnson told legislators.
His officers often work seven consecutive days for shifts that can stretch 12 to 18 hours. The school relies on an outside security firm for nightly patrols, he said.
“With that, it can become very tiresome, and my officers are constantly being fatigued,” he said.
The school can turn to other Orangeburg law enforcement agencies and SLED for help during special events, but he still has concerns.
“When I think about the shooting incident at Utah Valley with Charlie Kirk, I couldn’t help but think about how SC State is home to the tallest building in Orangeburg,” Johnson said.
The roof of the 15-story building provides a full view of campus.
“That’s scary,” he said. “We are in a climate that has everyone on edge … We definitely need additional personnel. We definitely need additional funding.”
SC State was the only chief to bring up officer shortages.
“I think this is another area that’s going to need our attention,” Erickson said, noting the Legislature’s efforts to stem teacher vacancies.
Other schools
USC’s police force staffed more than 630 events last year, which include football games and other sporting events, accounting for nearly 52,000 staff hours, Wuchenich told legislators. Six of those were classified as high-profile events requiring complex security measures.

USC’s campus safety office has nearly 100 employees, including more than 50 sworn police officers, according to the college’s latest report.
Clemson, in the Upstate, has 48 officers.
And the College of Charleston has 34 of its own officers, in addition to the aid of Charleston’s city police force, to patrol the sprawling campus that blends into the downtown neighborhoods on the Holy City’s peninsula.
Coastal Carolina’s police force covers both the four-year campus as well as that of nearby Horry-Georgetown Technical College, Chief Bobby Pellerin said.
“We are in the heart of one of the most rapidly growing metropolitan areas in the country,” Pellerin told legislators.
“We’ve had President Trump on campus, we’ve had governors, we’ve had mayoral debates, many other politicians, speakers,” he continued. “We will continue to have those events because of the area that we live in.”
Pellerin has 68 people on staff, including 34 sworn officers. He told legislators that’s adequate for his policing needs.
Pellerin also said the school has taken steps to boost communication with a new cell phone application.
The mobile app works two ways, allowing law enforcement to send out alerts to anyone who has signed up and allowing users to send in text, photo and video tips in the case of a crime or emergency.
Erickson commended Coastal Carolina’s safety app and said it might be a useful tool for other colleges.
Having somewhere to send videos to be vetted might have prevented some of the social media rumors that ran rampant during the USC swatting incident, she said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DSC_0139-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-17 11:57:43.535968

(Courtesy of Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services)High-ranking Rhode Island state lawmaker turned top government administrator Daniel Connors has paid a $2,500 fine for unreported and misused campaign finance funds under an agreement with the Rhode Island Board of Elections approved Tuesday.
The elections’ panel’s unanimous vote came without discussion, following a 20-minute executive session.
Connors, who served 14 years as a Democratic state senator for Senate District 19, including as Senate Majority Leader, hasn’t held elected office since 2010 when he chose not to run for reelection in the district spanning Lincoln and Cumberland. But he kept his campaign finance account open through subsequent jobs as a private practice lawyer, a senior adviser to Gov. Gina Raimondo, and a high-ranking official under Gov. Dan McKee, including a five-month stint as interim secretary of the Department of Housing in 2024.
It was during his time with the McKee administration, which began in March 2023 when he got a job as chief of staff at the Rhode Island Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS), that Connors ran afoul of state campaign rules. 
An audit report by the state election board’s campaign finance team shows Connors transferred more than $8,700 into his campaign finance account over a five-and-a-half-year period beginning in January 2020, but did not report the deposits in his quarterly reports to the elections board. Connors withdrew the exact same amount for personal use over that time period. He also failed to report $2,000 in spending from his campaign account.
Connors in an emailed response Wednesday accepted responsibility for the errors, which he blamed on an inadvertent linkage of his campaign account and other, personal bank accounts.
“I apologize for the sloppiness and I admit the error was mine and mine alone,” Connors wrote. “All campaign funds have been accounted for and no money went missing.”
Connors also donated the remainder of his campaign funds — $7,559 — to charity, and closed his campaign account, according to the elections board audit report. While the $2,500 penalty was not due until Dec. 31, Connors said Wednesday has already paid the fine.
He declined to answer further questions by phone Wednesday because he said he was at work. Connors now serves as director of interagency operations at EOHHS, with a $200,000 annual salary, according to the state payroll database. 
After Housing Secretary Stefan Pryor left the job in July, McKee tapped Connors — who long represented McKee’s native Cumberland in the state Senate — as the interim leader for the nascent housing agency. Connors returned to EOHHS in December, after McKee named Deborah Goddard as the state’s new Housing Secretary in December. 
Elections board members Marcela Betancur, Michael Connors and Randall Jackvony were absent from the meeting Tuesday.

He will now face Democrat Corinne Cascadden, who was unopposed in her primary election, in November.
Tremblay is the Berlin police commissioner and previously served as state representative from 2010 to 2012. Tremblay, who started his career as a patrolman in Berlin, made public safety a hallmark of his campaign, promising to stiffen bail laws and shore up police department resources. He beat out Johnathan Henson, 157-10, the Secretary of State’s Office reported.
A former elementary school principal, Cascadden served as Berlin’s school superintendent from 2009 to 2019 and is currently interim Littleton School District superintendent. She has spoken out about New Hampshire’s school funding formula — which relies heavily on local property taxes — and making housing and health care more affordable.
The two will face off in a general election on Nov. 4, per the Governor and Executive Council, which set the special election at its Aug. 13 meeting. The winner will represent Coös County District 5, which covers the city of Berlin.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)More than two months after the U.S. Department of Justice asked Rhode Island Secretary of State Gregg Amore for information about registered voters, Amore has finally responded:
No.
At least, the Trump administration won’t get anything beyond the state voter lists already publicly available — typically requested by filling out an online form and paying $25 —  though Amore indicated he will hand over the information to the Justice Department for free.
The Justice Department, which has sent similar requests to states nationwide, wanted more: Rhode Island voters’ Social Security and driver’s license numbers, even though this data is protected under state and federal laws.
“The current presidential administration has a long track record of seeking to, and in some cases, succeeding in, interfering in the operation of elections and sowing seeds of distrust between the general voting public and the very election processes that maintain and further our democracy,” Amore said in a statement Tuesday. “I will not participate in an unsubstantiated search for data and information.”
Since taking office in January, Trump has continued to promote false claims about election fraud, directing federal agencies to “scrub” voter rolls he claims are rife with noncitizens, even though documentation of noncitizen voting is extremely rare.
Amore’s refusal to comply with the federal directive comes the same day as the Justice Department sued Maine and Oregon for refusing to turn in personal information about state registered voters and applicants, along with state election administrators.
In a letter Tuesday to Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon, Amore hinted that legal action would be the only way he would turn over personal information about Rhode Island voters.
“While I am pleased to voluntarily provide you with the public voter rolls, as you requested, as Secretary of State, I must protect the personally identifiable information of Rhode Islanders,” Amore said in the letter. “I will not be providing the information to you absent a demonstration of a proper legal basis to do so or a court order.”
In 2017, Rhode Island was asked to supply President Donald Trump’s Election Integrity Commission with personal information from the state’s voter rolls, including the last four digits of Social Security numbers for voters dating back to 2006. Then-Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea and Gov. Gina Raimondo refused to comply with handing over any sensitive information not normally included in a standard public records request, according to news reports.
While the 2017 probe was sent to all 50 states, the latest set of requests initially centered on Democratic and swing states. As of Monday, 33 states received written requests for information from the civil or criminal divisions of the Justice Department, or both, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.
Responses have varied. At least 10 states have supplied the voter data that is already publicly available, or offered instructions on how the federal administration can find it. Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales confirmed last week that he also handed over state voters’ Social Security and drivers’ license numbers — the first known state to supply personal data. On the other end of the spectrum, Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows told the Justice Department to “go jump in the Gulf of Maine” during a July 29 press conference.
A history lesson
Amore, a former high school history teacher, cited court decisions and federal laws protecting this information in his response to Dhillon. They include the E-Government Act of 2002, signed into law under Republican George W. Bush, and the Privacy Act of 1974, meant to guard against overreaching government surveillance on the heels of the Watergate scandal.
“You fail to show that any of the statutory prerequisites for the protection of [personally identical information under those acts is in place,” Amore wrote.
The Justice Department first emailed Amore’s office on July 8, proposing a phone call to discuss “potential information-sharing agreements,” on state registered voters. Federal officials did not explicitly say what information they wanted about Rhode Island voters.
While Amore had not directly answered the Justice Department’s request before Tuesday, he had blasted Trump publicly for sowing distrust in elections, including the “false claim” that the 2020 election was stolen. Amore tapped the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office for help reviewing the initial request. The AG’s office responded to the Justice Department on the state’s behalf on July 31 to ask for more information, Faith Chybowski, a spokesperson for Amore’s office, said in an email.
On Sept. 3, however, Amore’s office, along with representatives from the AG’s office and state Board of Elections met virtually with Justice Department lawyers, according to Amore’s office. Five days later, Dhillon wrote to Amore, asking for state voters’ driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of their Social Security numbers within 14 days.
Dhillon’s letter cited the Help America Vote Act of 2002 and the 1960 Civil Rights Act as justification for the administration’s probe.
Amore, however, contended that neither federal law authorizes the Justice Department to access state voter data apart from lawsuits or investigations into illegal voter disenfranchisement. Neither of these reasons were named by Dhillon in his letter.
“I am confident that Rhode Island is a leader in secure, accessible elections,” Amore said in a statement. “Registering to vote requires the provision of personal information – and that information is provided with the trust and understanding that the government here in Rhode Island will do everything in our power to protect it. This is not a responsibility I take lightly.”
The Justice Department did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment Wednesday.
Tim Rondeau, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office, said the office had no additional comment regarding its participation in the meeting with Justice Department officials, or Amore’s response. Chris Hunter, a spokesperson for the state elections board, acknowledged requests for comment but did not prove a response Wednesday.

(Photo by Greg Childress/NC Newsline)N.C. homeless advocates are still trying to figure out their next steps now that a federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, blocking new eligibility requirements for funding for permanent supportive housing from going into effect.
“We’re still wrapping our minds around what this means for North Carolina,” Samuel Gunter, executive director of the N.C. Housing Coalition, said during a webinar on Tuesday. “The concern, and this is tea leaves reading, is that this a harbinger of what all future COC [Continuum of Care] funding is going to look like.”
The problem started when HUD issued new rules on Sept. 5 that said applicants for funding through its “Continuum of Care (CoC) Builds” program could not be sanctuary jurisdictions for immigrants, adopt inclusive policies for transgender people or take a “harm reduction” approach to illicit drug use.
The National Alliance to End Homelessness and the Women’s Development Corporation in Rhode Island filed a lawsuit against HUD and its Secretary Scott Turner on Sept. 11, challenging the new funding restrictions that require compliance with what the plaintiffs contend is the “partisan agenda” of the Trump administration. They also argue that HUD does not have authority to impose such restrictions on federal housing funding.
“In our constitutional system, Congress controls the purse strings and decides what funding to provide, for what purposes, and under what criteria,” the lawsuits states. “And states and localities decide what policies to adopt and implement in their own local jurisdictions. HUD has transgressed both these bounds. .”
On Friday, Sept. 12, the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island granted a temporary restraining order in National Alliance to End Homelessness v. Turner, et al.
“We welcome the court’s decision to stop a rushed, lawless attempt to make essential funding contingent on a community’s compliance with harmful and unlawful restrictions the Trump-Vance administration is trying to impose,” the plaintiffs said in a news release. “This order ensures that service providers can focus on what matters most: providing safe, stable housing and support to people in crisis.”

At stake is $75 million in federal funding for permanent supportive housing, which provides long-term, affordable rental housing and voluntary support services for individuals with disabilities who are experiencing chronic homelessness. Permanent supportive housing is part of the “Housing First” model, which the Trump administration rejects. “Housing First” prioritizes providing immediate housing without preconditions such as sobriety or treatment programs.
The grant is channeled through the federal Continuum of Care Builds program, which provides funding for construction, purchases or rehabilitation of housing units for individuals and families experiencing homelessness, including those living with disabilities.
“When Congress allocates resources like this for federal competition, the intent is that everybody who has a need for these kinds of resources has a fair playing field to compete for those resources, and that it’s based on the need of the community and the quality of the application,” Ann Oliva, executive director of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said in a recent interview with NC Newsline.
Oliva said the money earmarked for permanent supportive housing is substantial and is not made available often.
“The shortage of housing that is affordable to people with the lowest incomes in this country is massive and we need as much housing as we can possibly get that is affordable to people with the lowest incomes and has supportive services attached to it, which this programs requires,” Oliva said.

During Tuesday’s Housing Coalition webinar, Gunter said HUD’s decision to modify the eligibility requiremnts is a “hard pill to swallow” for organizations seeking grant funding, especially when they get notice of the rule changes a week before grant applications are due.
HUD notified Congress Sept. 5 that it planned to issue a notice of funding opportunity, superseding a funding notice issued in May, for the one-time competitive grants for new, permanent supportive housing.
The applications for the grants were due Sept. 12, which means the federal agency would have had 12 business days to review them, select winners and notify Congress before the grants expire Sept. 30.
Democratic Sens. Patty Murray (D-WA) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) asked the independent Office of Inspector General (OIG) to look into whether HUD violated or deliberately sidestepped federal rules by forcing organizations that help the homeless apply for the same grant money for a third time — just days before the funding is set to expire.
“HUD’s unpredictable and capricious decision-making has put a tremendous burden on local community organizations, requiring staff to apply, reapply, and then reapply again for the same amount of funding — each time with different rules and with less time to apply,” the senators wrote.
The first intent to award the grants was issued in July 2024 during the Biden administration, Gillibrand and Murray wrote. The original plan called for $175 million in awards to address homelessness but was trimmed to $75 million after Trump took office. HUD issued a second notice to award the grants in May, which also forced organizations to reapply.
“Faith-based, nonprofit, and local community organizations work, day in and day out, to support those who fall into homelessness, but HUD is making this already difficult job harder by withholding Congressionally appropriated funds and requiring organizations to jump through excessive hurdles.” Gillibrand and Murray wrote.
The new eligibility requirements could discourage North Carolina service providers from applying for such funding, Gunter said, “because no one would fit the bill.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/IMG_3236-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-17 11:57:43.535968

The Alabama Reflector reviewed a database obtained from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that identified the grants that were eliminated. Two state agencies and three universities lost funding because of the administration’s executive order.

“We continue to monitor, assess and address the developments regarding federal activity, and our government affairs professionals are actively engaged,” a spokesperson for the University of Alabama Birmingham said in a statement. “We do not have additional information to share at this time.”
The Alabama Department of Mental Health provided a list of programs that will continue to receive funding because of appropriations from Congress, and added, “At this time, we do not foresee federal impacts for mental health funding due to reduction in grant funding in fiscal year 2026.”
The Alabama Department of Public Health (ADPH) said they have had about $175 million eliminated because of the executive order.
“Based upon ADPH review of its grants, the loss of $175 million is the amount that ADPH can document, at this time,” the Alabama Department of Public Health said in a statement. That figure is lower than the almost $215 million that the agency has lost from the more than $760 million the agency had been awarded based on the analysis from the Alabama Reflector.
“The grants funded portions of programs for detection, prevention, and response to outbreaks of infectious disease in Alabama. While this loss of funding resulted in termination of some programs, ADPH was able to shift employees into other programs or not replace employees who were retiring or chose to move to other employment outside the agency,” the statement from ADPH said. “As a result of this loss of funding, ADPH continues to review its existing programs and determine how current and future funds can be used to support the work required of ADPH. This is all the information ADPH can provide, at this time.”
The Alabama Reflector reached out to Auburn University and the University of Alabama for additional information on the programs whose funding was eliminated.
Government experts warned of the potential consequences of the administration’s executive order and the chilling effect that it could have for research.
One practical consequence of the executive order is that it halts research that has been ongoing for years and possible findings that could result from the studies that could help address chronic and communicable diseases, according to Jill Rosenthal, director of public health policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning organization. 
The second possible fallout is that it slows scientific progress.
“It also impacts America’s standing in scientific innovation,” Rosenthal said. “Those cuts and freezes to funding affect scientists and future scientists who want to go into this work. When their grants are cut or not available, there’s reports of folks looking to go to other countries and doing the research there.”
The Alabama Department of Mental Health lost roughly $22.5 million after grants were eliminated.
The database did not provide full details of the program whose funding was short-changed, but based on the descriptions in the spreadsheet. For example, ADPH lost $190 million for programs meant to prevent and contain emerging infectious diseases, while another $15 million was lost for projects to immunize and vaccinate children.
The description in the database stated that the program involved “immunizations and vaccines for children.” A second program was titled, “National Initiative to Address COVID-19 Health Disparities Among Populations at High-Risk and Underserved, Including Racial and Ethnic Minority Populations and Rural Communities.”
The most significant funding reduction, almost $157 million was for a program called, “2019 Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for Prevention and Control of Emerging Infectious Diseases (ELC).”
The Alabama Department of Mental Health had to forgo about $15 million from a block grant to help address mental health and another $6 million for combatting substance abuse. The titles for programs whose grant funding was eliminated was called “Mental Health Block Grant – COVID Relief.”
The University of Alabama at Birmingham lost almost $7.5 million from $11 million in federal funding the university has been awarded to aid medical and scientific research and fund research opportunities for undergraduates as well as mentorships.
Some of the funding was for research into specific scientific subjects. One, for example, was titled, “Circadian changes in network excitability and Alzheimer disease pathogenesis.”
Both Auburn University and the University of Alabama had one grant each that was affected totaling about $600,000 in lost funding.
The grant for the University of Alabama that lost more than $185,000 was aimed at helping to recruit underrepresented students toward a nursing career. And the G-RISE program at Auburn University whose funding was cut by almost $440,000 was meant to encourage students from underrepresented groups to enter scientific fields.
Aside from slowing scientific advancement, the funding reductions that stem from the elimination of the grants could hurt the economy of states whose researchers receive the grant money.
The Center for American Progress published an article in February that stated the funding reductions would threaten jobs.
“The NIH is a critical driver of biomedical advancements and generates significant economic activity in many states,” the report states. The article said that NIH funding contributed about $5.2 billion to the economy in Pennsylvania and $2.8 billion to Florida’s economy for fiscal year 2023.
Rosenthal went on to say that the executive order violates the process for allocating grant dollars that had been done in the past. Before, the decisions were based on an exact process that relied on the scientific method and on the judgement of scientists who understood the research.
“This process here is fundamentally biased in that it is based only on, in some cases, key word searches. There is talk of people who have lost grants based on a particular word in the grant without any fundamental understanding of what that grant would actually do.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/nihjacket2025_0-1024x576.png,,,2025-09-17 11:57:43.535968

Gun safety advocates are pitching lawmakers on a proposal that would give victims a path to litigate against the industry and require firearm manufacturers and dealers to operate under an established standard of conduct. 
The post Gun safety advocates push for industry accountability in Massachusetts appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","IN THE MIDST of gun violence news again overtaking national and local headlines, gun safety advocates are pitching lawmakers on a proposal that would give victims a path to litigate against the industry and require firearm manufacturers and dealers to operate under an established standard of conduct. 
“This has been a difficult week in the gun violence world, with the news nationally certainly impacting how we are able to talk about what, in fact, does keep us safe and what does not, but also locally,” Ruth Zakarin, executive director of Massachusetts Coalition to Prevent Gun Violence, said at a State House policy briefing. 
Last Wednesday, conservative political figure Charlie Kirk was assassinated while speaking at an event at Utah Valley University, prompting national reaction. That same day, there was also a shooting at a high school in Evergreen, Colorado, and a lockdown at UMass Boston after there were reports of shots fired on campus.
Supporters of Massachusetts gun safety laws say they are among the strongest and most successful in the nation, though critics often claim the regulations burden law-abiding gun owners with excessive requirements. Legislation filed by Sen. Cindy Creem and Rep. Frank Moran (S 1653, H 2672) would add Massachusetts to the list of states that have established a “concrete list of responsibilities” that manufacturers, dealers, wholesalers and others involved in disseminating firearms must follow, Everytown Policy Counsel Elisabeth Ryan said. 
The requirements aim to ensure those who sell guns keep their inventory secure, or not knowingly sell guns to people who will traffic them, the former Executive Office of Public Safety and Security counsel added. The proposal would also enable the attorney general’s office to bring a suit against anyone who violates those requirements, and enable people who have been directly harmed by gun violence to pursue litigation against the industry. 
“Basically, the argument has always been, ‘Well, we’re not responsible for the criminal. When somebody else takes a gun and uses it criminally, that has nothing to do with us,'” Ryan said of the firearm industry. “And this is saying, ‘No, it does have something to do with you, because if you contribute to getting it there unlawfully, then you can be held responsible for that.'” 
A federal law passed in 2005 called the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) shields firearms manufacturers and dealers from lawsuits against them regarding criminal misuse of a firearm, GIFFORDS Law Center senior litigation attorney Billy Clark said. The law provides broad “immunity” for the industry, Clark added, so individuals aren’t able to pursue claims against it for its role in causing harm against them.
“PLCAA continues to be incredibly dangerous for several reasons. The first is, it simply prevents justice to victims and survivors, families who have lost people because of design defects in guns, for example,” said Tanya Schardt, senior director of state and federal policy at Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said.
The new legislation would attempt to give people a pathway to holding the industry accountable, Schardt said, including Black and Brown communities that have been disproportionately impacted by gun violence and people who have died due to trafficked firearms.
According to Gun Owners Action League (GOAL) Executive Director Jim Wallace, the legislation promoted Tuesday has “nothing to do with victims of violence.”
“We don’t allow Chevy to be sued because of drunk driving — people don’t even sue alcohol companies for drunk driving because it’s an abuse of their product. You can’t sue an industry,” Wallace told the News Service. According Wallace, who leads the gun rights nonprofit, the reason the 2005 federal law went into effect was to protect the firearm industry from being sued into bankruptcy.
New York was the first state to pass “industry accountability” legislation in 2021, requiring firearms companies selling guns to follow certain business practices as a way to try to prevent dangerous sales. While the law was almost immediately challenged by gun rights advocates on constitutional grounds, the state’s highest court upheld the law in July. There have been eight other states that have followed suit in passing similar laws since 2021, according to advocates. 
“It really has been the passage of these industry accountability bills that has reshaped the ability to go after the gun industry for their negligence and their irresponsible behavior,” Schardt said.
She said it’s “imperative that states step up” to pass regulations considering shifting federal oversight under the Trump administration.
“We’re seeing calls for cuts [to] funding, cuts to an agency that’s already been drastically underfunded for decades — intentionally, to make sure that there’s not appropriate oversight in the gun industry,” Schardt said. “We can assume that [the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] is not going to be engaging in proper, meaningful or robust oversight of the gun industry in any way, shape or form.”
The federal administration has moved in recent months to make broad changes to the bureau as a way to “reduce ‘unnecessary regulatory burdens,'” as reported by NPR.
Massachusetts overhauled its firearms laws in 2024, aiming to address things like 3-D printed guns and “ghost guns,” and to update the state’s “Red Flag Law.” Opponents of the law claim it violates Second Amendment rights, and have put a referendum on the 2026 ballot that will let voters decide whether to keep the statute. 
Wallace called the 2024 law “a flat-out attack on the Second Amendment community,” and said the proposal promoted Tuesday “is no different.”
It’s not certain whether the Legislature has an appetite to pass more gun-related legislation this session while the broader debate about the 2024 law begins to unfold.
Asked about advocates’ strategy this session considering such opposition, Zakarin said, “It’s always about we can move this work forward in Massachusetts. There’s always more we can do to keep the residents of the state safe from gun violence. And while we were thrilled to get the 2024 law passed, this was not a policy that was included. And so for me, it is around the urgency of continuing to strengthen our policies, to continue to commit to this work, for Massachusetts to continue to be the leader that it has been.”
A recent report on firearm-related activity from the Executive Office of Public Safety and Security found that a firearm was used in more than 13,400 crimes in Massachusetts over the course of 2022 and 2022 — a nearly 14 percent increase over the two-year period before. Officials attributed the figure to an increase in violations of state laws related to the manufacture, sale, purchase, transport or possession of guns.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-17 14:51:41+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT DEEP posted an AI-generated image, and the Internet noticed",Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/17/ct-deep-ai-generated-image/,The CT Department of Energy and Environmental Protection posted an AI-generated image to Facebook last week. The agency soon replaced it.,"With what appears to be an extra finger on his right hand and no actual arrow in his bow, the man featured in the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection’s Facebook post did not look like your typical hunter.
Agency officials said workers used Canva AI to generate the image of a man shooting turkey for a social media post that was shared on Friday.
Users on Reddit and Facebook pointed to the gibberish words on the hunter’s hat and vest, and the feathered game that appeared to be wearing a safety vest of its own.
“We are working with a new graphic design software to craft our social media posts,” DEEP said in a statement. “We did not apply our usual level of scrutiny to the image used in this particular post before posting it.”
DEEP did not disclose using AI in the original post and took it down on Monday afternoon, replacing it with a “better and less confusing” image.
One Facebook user criticized DEEP’s choice to use AI given its known damage to the environment. Several users raised concerns about giving a job to AI rather than a local photographer.
“It is not common practice for DEEP Communications to use AI generated images. We typically use real photos obtained in the field, or stock images, for our social media posts wherever possible,” DEEP said in a statement. 
Connecticut agencies, including “all vendors and third-party stakeholders,” are required to follow the AI Responsible Use Framework. It says “when using AI, State agencies shall confirm that the AI produces accurate and verifiable information. This framework includes procedures on how best to audit and verify AI outputs to ensure clear and accurate information. AI is considered ‘accurate’ to the extent that the AI-provided result is correct and expected.”
The framework acknowledges that AI can be used in “generating text and visual content,” but it does not provide particular guidance on agencies’ use of AI-generated images. In its statement, DEEP said, “future uses of AI in the creation of images will be noted with the post.”
By law, the state of Connecticut must share an annual inventory of AI tools used. Canva, a design platform that launched its AI suite earlier this year, was not included in Connecticut’s 2024 list. Tools used in 2024 included “a small pilot” of ChatGPT, but no tools for the explicit purpose of image creation were listed in the document.
Chas Catania, the Treasurer of Friends of Connecticut Sportsmen, said while the post was “a little bit embarrassing,” he “[did] not think it’s going to create any safety issues.”
“I think what’s very important is that we don’t lose the underlying message, and that is, you know, they’re encouraging safety,” Catania said.
DEEP’s original post sought to inform the public about rules for the fall hunting season starting on Sept. 15, including wearing fluorescent orange. “We should be wearing orange, or be thinking about whether we should be wearing orange,” said Catania.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-16-at-4.15.07-PM-1024x763.png,,,2025-09-17 10:57:23.854898

What is the state doing to slow it?
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Emilia Otte to discuss her article, “Drug overdoses in CT prisons raising alarms,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Emilia’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Emilia, what prompted you to investigate the problem of drug overdoses in Connecticut’s prisons?
EO: I’ve been reporting a lot on the criminal justice system, and it’s a problem that kept coming up in conversations with corrections officers, with people who are incarcerated, the issue just kept coming up in conversations about other things. And so I started to look into the problem of overdoses from a multitude of different types of drugs, opioids, methadone, and now this new drug called K2 or KD or KT, or 1000 other names that are used for it.
WSHU: What did you find was responsible for the uptick in drug overdoses?
EO: So a lot of it is coming from this new drug. I don’t know how new it is, but this drug is called, as I mentioned, K2, and it’s basically the mixture of either insecticides or rodenticides, some toxic chemical with cannabinoids, cannabis-like substances. And the problem with it is that it’s very easy to get inside a prison because it can be sprayed on paper, so it’s almost impossible to detect and stop. This is not just a Connecticut problem, by the way, this is going on throughout the country. Different states have been dealing with it in different ways, but this issue of K2 has been driving up the overdoses significantly.
WSHU: Now you say it can be sprayed onto paper and just licked off? And that’s how you get the high?
EO: Well, not licked off, you would smoke it. So you can, you can use a battery essentially, and like some components of a pen cartridge, or at least that’s how I’ve heard it’s been done. And you can, you smoke it essentially.
WSHU: So that’s why it’s been difficult for the authorities to stop this. It’s not that easy to catch, right?
EO: Yes, exactly.
WSHU: Okay. So what are the prison authorities doing in Connecticut? How are they tackling this problem?
EO: From what the Department of Corrections told me, there have been discussions about getting scanners, which could scan mail that comes in to see if there are chemicals or other substances on it. They don’t have those scanners yet, from what I understand, but that is the discussion. There have been other things tried in other states. I think in Illinois, they tried to pass a law that would ban paper mail from coming in. That didn’t work. There were discussions about, you know, photocopying every piece of mail. I think another state, New Jersey, I believe, has bought these types of scanners, and they say that it’s decreased the amount of drugs coming in significantly.
WSHU: Now this problem is costing the state money because of the much higher number of calls, emergency calls at the correctional facilities, which is costing the local ambulances and fire departments money, and also some of the prisoners, their families have sued the state. So could you just talk a little bit more about that?
EO: I mean, it is expensive. And what I heard, and one of the things that got me interested in K2 specifically, was actually a cost to some of the towns, the town of Sommers, and this was widely reported, bringing forward concerns about the amount of diversion of their ambulances to Osborne Correctional Institute, which is within their area. And so, yes, it is expensive, it is costly, and I think that’s why the state is looking into these scanner machines. With regard to the lawsuits, those are not about K2; those are about opiates or methadone. There have been no deaths in Connecticut that I’m aware of through K2.
WSHU: That’s because methadone and the other prescribed drugs are also leading to overdoses and deaths. Correct?
EO: Yes.
WSHU: And that’s what the lawsuits are about. Could you talk about the prescription of opioids in prisons?
EO: Yeah. So it’s done through something called MAT, medication-assisted treatment. And this has been around in Connecticut for a while. It exists in most of the state’s facilities, and it’s a program that is highly recommended by physicians. They say that this is, you know, experts say that this is the best way to address opiate addiction. The challenge has been that in two instances that I’m aware of, in particular, that I wrote about with Tyler Cole and with Ronald Johnson, there was a problem with the Methadone prescriptions. Possibly the allegation, at least in Mr. Cole’s case, was that too much methadone had been prescribed. I’m not a doctor. I can’t comment on whether or not that’s correct. I will say that their cases are not the only ones. There were some cases going back to 2021 and 22 where there were concerns. I’m aware of at least one other case where there were concerns about methadone prescription, and it was, I think, in 2022, so, yeah, it’s the question of, you know, is this being addressed correctly through these programs, and what’s going on with the prescribing.
WSHU: I also thought it was interesting that you brought in the human toll through your discussions with Tracy and Jason Ciccone, Tyler Cole’s parents. Could you tell us about how they’re taking it?
EO: I’m very grateful to them for speaking with me. I think that it has been extraordinarily hard on them. You know, you get a phone call that your child has died out of nowhere. And you know, Ronald Coleman, who was Ronald Johnson’s father, said to me, you know, when, when I heard that he was incarcerated, I thought, Oh, well, at least he’ll be safe there, because he had been struggling, you know, outside for a while. And then you find out that he died, and it’s just, the shock. I can’t even imagine the shock and the pain of that.
WSHU: Now, is there any silver lining in this? Is there anything that’s happening that might bring some change to the situation?
EO: So the DOC has talked about scanners for a while, not just for the K2 situation, but also body scanners to detect any kind of drugs or contraband coming into the facilities. If those go into place, perhaps they will improve the situation. You know, we’ll see. There’s always a hope that people will read the story, and there will be some discussions about, you know, why this is happening, and whether there is a way to mitigate this a little bit better.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PRISON-OVERDOSES-0830-DE-039-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-17 11:57:43.535968

Eighth Circuit Solicitor David Stumbo became the third GOP candidate to announce his candidacy Tuesday during an event at the Laurens County Museum, promising to be “tough on crime.”
Stumbo, a former assistant attorney general, was first elected solicitor in 2012.
“Political promises don’t protect people – verdicts do,” he said in a statement. “For over twenty years, I’ve gone toe-to-toe with predators, traffickers, and violent criminals, and I’ve beaten them. That’s the kind of fight, and the kind of victory, you can count on with me as your Attorney General.”
Stumbo also promised to combat illegal immigration, as well as drug and human trafficking.
“Criminal illegal aliens, listen closely,” he said in a statement. “Anyone who tries to prey on our people, hear me now: you are not welcome in South Carolina.”
“Like President Trump, I will crush fentanyl, smash the cartels, and treat traffickers like the terrorists they are,” he added.
Stumbo joins state Sen. Stephen Goldfinch, R-Murrells Inlet, and First Circuit Solicitor David Pascoe, who switched parties in April, in the race to become the state’s top prosecutor.
He appeared to call out both of his GOP primary opponents in his announcement.
“I am the only conservative Republican prosecutor in this race,” Stumbo said in a statement. “Others may chase headlines or switch parties when it suits them. I’ve always been a conservative, always been a Republican, and always been a prosecutor who delivers convictions that stick.”
The race for attorney general is wide open for the first time in 16 years as Republican Alan Wilson, first elected attorney general in 2010, runs for governor in 2026.
No one has announced a bid to be the Democrat nominee. South Carolina hasn’t elected a Democrat as attorney general in 35 years.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Solicitor-David-Stumbo-_-Headshot-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-17 10:57:23.854898
,Source New Mexico,2025-09-17 14:34:33+00:00,Source New Mexico,New Mexico can do something about immigration detention here,Allegra Love,,,,,https://sourcenm.com/2025/09/17/new-mexico-can-do-something-about-immigration-detention-here/,Longtime immigration lawyer Allegra Love writes about the terrible conditions in ICE facilities and why New Mexico should address them.,"'Horrifying' conditions in ICE facilities 'are not a secret,' immigration lawyer Allegra Love writes (Getty Photos)I have worked as a lawyer in ICE detention facilities in New Mexico for the last decade. I have held babies rapidly losing their body weights due to malnutrition. I had a client nearly die by their own hands because of a torturously long solitary confinement. I helped engage in a lawsuit after detainees were violently pepper sprayed for demanding masks and soap during the pandemic. I worked through the deaths of two transgender women who were detained in our state. I could write an entire column about each of these experiences and the hundreds more in New Mexico detention centers that lit my conscience on fire and shook my belief in humanity.
The horrifying conditions of ICE detention facilities in New Mexico are not a secret. Deeply committed advocates here in our state and nationwide have been calling this reality out for years. Read “Process by Torment”, a 73-page report published in 2021 about the experience of Otero County detainees by AVID and Innovation Law Lab. Read “What Kind of Miracle” published by the National Immigrant Justice Center about detention in Cibola County in 2017 or a report that Colorado College students published with New Mexico Immigrant Center in 2024 about private prison contractors violations of national detention standards. Check out this website that catalogs 133 news pieces about issues at Torrance County Detention Facility alone. And just this month the New Mexico Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil right released recommendations calling for the closure of ICE detention facilities in our state. 
And yet detention in New Mexico and nationwide became somehow even scarier at the beginning of this month. On Sept. 5, the Board of Immigration Appeals, the quasi-judicial body under the Department of Justice now overseen by Attorney General Pam Bondi, which reviews decisions by immigration judges, handed down a decision called Matter of Yajure Hurtado. What’s important to understand about that decision is that it strips all immigration judges of the ability to award a bond to a person in a detention center who entered the United States without permission. This means that most people arrested by ICE will be effectively stuck inside the detention center for the duration of their removal proceedings with no meaningful opportunity to be released. 
What this amounts to is a sleight of hand that our government will use to justify the rapid expansion of ICE detention and the big, booming business of private prison contracting. With the stroke of a pen on a precariously reasoned legal decision, Matter of Yajure Hurtado makes the terrible idea of Alligator Alcatraz or the recently opened Camp East Montana at Fort Bliss necessary to accommodate the swelling numbers of ICE detainees who are suddenly subject to mandatory detention. 
According to TRAC Immigration, an excellent source of immigration enforcement data, detention numbers hit an all-time high for our modern era in August with more than 60,000 people detained. Importantly, according to TRAC’s data, 70% of the current detention population have no criminal record — and before anyone argues that non-citizens without papers are categorically criminals, unlawful presence in the United States is statutorily not a crime but, rather, an administrative violation. If someone wants to claim that there isn’t really a difference, I would ask them to consider that if immigration violations were in fact crimes, then those accused and incarcerated would have a stronger constitutional claim to a release from detention. This is one of the dark ironies of immigration law practice, that the fact of immigration not being a crime creates spaces where constitutional rights can be more easily violated. Just ask any child who has been held by ICE in family detention. 
As New Mexicans, we have very little control of the Board of Immigration Appeal’s decisions and the $45 billion allotted for the expansion of ICE detention under the Big Beautiful Bill. But we do have a say about whether to expand ICE detention in our state. Although our governor has decided not to put a bill limiting local immigration detention contracts on her call for the Oct. 1 special session, this issue should be front and center at the 2026 legislative session. I would suggest that people curious about the bill follow the ACLU of New Mexico, New Mexico Immigrant Law Center and the Innovation Law Lab.
There are days lately when I feel absolutely despondent about what ICE is doing to my community and state. I am working alongside my colleagues on the case of a DACA recipient with four citizen children being illegally detained in Otero and every day that he stays inside, I am filled with grief over the  diminishing bag of tricks that I can use as a lawyer to get people out of detention centers. When faced with those feelings, I try to remember to focus on the things I can change. We can stop the expansion of detention in New Mexico and show the federal government that we are a state that respects human life and fairness and does not kneel to corporate greed.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1352026749-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-17 10:57:23.854898

In interviews with Mississippi Today at the U.S. Capitol last week, Reps. Mike Ezell and Trent Kelly, both former law enforcement officials, said those who committed crimes in relation to the Epstein case should be prosecuted. But they stopped short of calling for the Justice Department to release the tranche of case files from the sex trafficking investigation into Epstein, the late billionaire financier.
Epstein was accused of paying underage girls hundreds of dollars in cash for massages and then molesting them. He was accused of running a sex trafficking cabal serving mega-wealthy power brokers across the globe. In 2019, he committed suicide in prison while facing federal sex trafficking charges. Conspiracy theories and outrage have swirled around Epstein since his death.
The files have become a political headache for Trump, who has downplayed his connections to Epstein.   
Public fascination with the case reignited after Attorney General Pam Bondi suggested she had an Epstein “client list” on her desk, but then didn’t release documents with any new information. Many Trump supporters and Democrats alike want the government to release the Epstein files, but to their chagrin, administration officials have insisted there’s nothing more to disclose.
Ezell, a former Jackson County sheriff, stopped short of calling for the Justice Department to unveil the files, but he said the attention around the issue would lead to their eventual release. 
“I would expect them to be released. But I’ll tell you this, I just don’t think this needs to be some kind of major priority,” Ezell said. “You know, there are just so many bad things going on right now. And what I think this Epstein thing is is a distraction, a political distraction.”
If the files include incriminating information on Trump, those details would likely have already come to light amid scrutiny of Trump, he said. 
“You know what the FBI did during Trump’s first administration, when he was running for office,” Ezell said. “If there had been anything in there negative with Donald Trump’s name on it, it would have been all over the front page. So I feel reasonably sure that these things will be released at some point in time.”
Last week, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee released a sexually suggestive letter to Epstein purportedly signed by Trump. The president has denied signing the letter and has sued The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times for their reporting on it.
Rep. Trent Kelly, a former district attorney in northeast Mississippi, also declined to come out in favor of releasing the files, citing a process he said had become politicized.   
“You know, I wish they had asked four years ago — they had four years.” Kelly said of the recent push from Democrats. “Personally, I think everybody who’s involved in any way should be prosecuted, but I think most of that is just for political purposes and political purposes only, and I don’t think they truly care about the victims of those cases.” 
Kelly added that he was interested in the contents of the files as a private citizen, but also said Epstein paid the price for his crimes. 
“As a regular person, am I interested? Yes. (But) I think we’re spending a whole lot of time on things for political purposes,” Kelly said. “What are we making better? What is made better, whether they’re disclosed or not disclosed? … I mean, (Jeffrey Epstein) is about as accountable as you can get. He’s no longer here. He was sentenced to prison, and he died there.”
Rep. Bennie Thompson, the lone Democratic member of Mississippi’s congressional delegation, did not respond to a request for comment, but he has signed a petition seeking to force a House floor vote on the release of the files. 
Michael Guest, a former district attorney for Madison and Rankin counties, declined an interview with Mississippi Today last week, and his office did not respond to a question about the congressman’s opinion on the release of the files. 
Guest, however, did tell Mississippi Today at the Neshoba County Fair in July that the Justice Department should release all of the files. 
In a narrow vote last week, Senate Republicans defeated a legislative maneuver by Democrats to insert language into Congress’ annual defense authorization bill that would have forced the public release of the Epstein files. 
Mississippi Sens. Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith both voted with all but two other Republicans to defeat that effort by Democrats. Neither Wicker nor Hyde-Smith’s offices responded to requests for comment on their votes against the measure.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/16145806/AP25248612352946.jpg,,,2025-09-17 10:57:23.854898

Jerry Greenfield, co-founder of Ben & Jerry’s, said Wednesday he would resign from the company in response to alleged political censorship from its parent company Unilever.
Greenfield, who founded the company in 1978 together with Ben Cohen, said in an open resignation letter that he “can no longer, in good conscience…remain an employee.” After he and Cohen sold Ben & Jerry’s to Unilever in 2000, Greenfield had taken up a brand ambassador role at the company.

“Standing up for the values of justice, equity, and our shared humanity has never been more important,” Greenfield in the statement. “And yet Ben & Jerry’s has been silenced, sidelined for fear of upsetting those in power.”
Greenfield’s announcement comes days after he and Cohen launched a campaign to “free” the ice cream brand from Unilever’s planned spin-off, the Magnum Ice Cream Company. Greenfield’s resignation letter appeared both on social media and the campaign website.

The company now “is not the Ben & Jerry’s that we founded,” Cohen and Greenfield wrote in a joint open letter last week.
In the days since, Unilever has responded that Ben & Jerry’s is “not for sale” and the company remains “committed to Ben & Jerry’s unique three-part mission — product, economic and social.”

Stebbins
This story was originally reported by Shefali Luthra of The 19th.  Meet Shefali and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
When fewer people can get abortions, property crime rates go up, a new working paper out Monday suggests.
The analysis, published in the National Bureau of Economic Research, underscores the connection between abortion access and economic stability: more people becoming pregnant and being forced into poverty led to higher property crimes. It tracks the impact of a Texas abortion law enacted in 2013, which imposed a host of new regulations on abortion providers. Those restrictions resulted in the vast majority of the state’s clinics closing; as a result of the law, the distance patients had to travel for an abortion more than doubled, from an average of 21 miles to 53.
Most people who seek abortions are already parents, and their main reason is that they cannot afford another child. Years of research has underscored that denying people abortions entrenches them deeper into poverty.
“Whenever there’s an unplanned or mistimed parenthood, this can actually create some economic shock to these families,” said Erkmen Aslim, an economist at the University of Vermont and the paper’s lead author. ”These downstream outcomes can have huge economic and social outcomes.”
The research team found a link between obstacles to abortion and economic harm — evictions, mortgage delinquency and increased income inequality — but also to increases in property crimes like car theft, burglary and larceny.
The effects were most visible in counties that saw the biggest growth in travel needed for an abortion. Researchers divided affected Texas counties into three categories — those where travel times increased by 25 miles or more, by 50 miles or more and by 100 miles or more — and compared those against control counties that did not experience an increase of 25 miles or more to an abortion clinic.
Counties with meaningful increases in travel saw higher rates of property crime by women and men alike — a finding that suggests that the economic consequences of unplanned pregnancy people regardless of gender, the researchers said. The increases were also more visible for adults compared to minors.
Violent crimes mostly did not go up, with the exception of increases in robbery, which can also be a result of economic desperation, in counties where abortion-related travel distances grew by 100 miles or more.
“We have just discovered a really strikingly large causal relationship between restricting abortion access and property crime,” said Caitlin Myers, an economist at Middlebury College and co-author on the study. “It’s quite striking. It really points to economic vulnerability and striking destabilization for families.”
Working papers published by the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research have not yet undergone peer review. But they are considered a useful jumping off point for economic debate. The bureau’s standards are rigorous, and most of its working papers end up published in academic journals.
The paper does not examine the consequences of the more recent Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which allowed states to ban abortion. But its authors are now starting to examine whether the decision has continued to drive up property crime.
Aslim said he would now anticipate an even larger increase. Texas is one of a dozen states to have outlawed abortion almost entirely, and people living in the state typically have to travel hundreds of miles to get an abortion.
“It’s likely based on everything we know about how [Roe v. Wade’s overturn] is impacting births that this has continued,” Myers said. “But we’re going to measure it. We need to measure.”
The distance people travel for care nationwide could soon grow. An appeals court ruled last week to uphold a new federal policy allowing for “defunding” Planned Parenthood, prohibiting the family planning provider from participating in the federal Medicaid program. The organization estimates the decision could result in the closure of as many as 200 clinics, mostly in states where abortion is legal — a development that could lead to fewer options and longer travel times for people journeying to another state for an abortion.
“Planned Parenthood is an extremely important provider of reproductive health care, particularly in rural and underserved areas,” Myers said. “In a lot of states that do have abortion services in kind of smaller towns and more rural areas, the services are being provided by Planned Parenthood.”
As states have adopted more restrictive abortion laws, health care providers have developed other methods to make the procedure more accessible, including prescribing and mailing abortion medications for patients to take in their homes. That option was significantly less available in 2013, and has helped thousands of people get abortions without traveling for care. Abortion opponents have made restricting medication a top priority, filing civil and criminal suits against telehealth abortion providers and passing new legislation in Texas meant to halt telehealth abortions.
Still, the rise of telehealth hasn’t bridged the gap for many Americans, especially those living the farthest from brick-and-mortar abortion providers, Myers said. Even as more people shift toward getting medications online, she said, the birth rate in states with abortion bans has continued to increase.
“We should be thinking about what this means for the social safety net we provide for poor families and the ways in which these destabilizing effects can have ripple effects into their communities,” she said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DSC_0845-5-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-17 10:57:23.854898

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)Five Republicans running for governor took to the debate stage Tuesday evening to talk about some of the state’s most pressing issues. 
“If any one of us win, we all win,” candidate Ben Midgley said during his closing remarks, in a nod to the broad agreement shared among those on the stage on many of the topics.
The debate was hosted by Common Sense for Maine, a political action committee that formed earlier this year by a group of businesspeople seeking change in the state with the 2026 elections, and moderated by WLOB radio host Ray Richardson. Midgley, the former president of Planet Fitness, was joined in discussion on energy prices, immigration, tax burden and more by Owen McCarthy, David Jones, Jim Libby and Robert Wessels. 
They will first face all other Republican candidates on June 6 in an open primary to determine who will be nominated for the November 2026 ballot. Though they didn’t participate in Tuesday’s debate, Kenneth Capron, Bobby Charles and Steven Sheppard are also running as Republicans. 
With a noticeable presence from local police, the event was dedicated to conservative activist Charlie Kirk who was assassinated at Utah Valley University last week. In early August, Kirk attended an event hosted in the same venue as the debate Tuesday, the Dunegrass Country Club in Old Orchard Beach. 
Here’s a closer look at how the candidates said they would approach child welfare, the state budget and more.
Energy prices 
The candidates all lamented the rise of electricity prices, and said they would support the construction of small modular nuclear reactors in the state. 
State law stipulates that any new nuclear energy system would need to be put to voters through a referendum to be brought online. All candidates said that law should be overturned, but Libby, a state senator, acknowledged that nuclear power would be a long-term solution. He said increased use of hydropower (which other candidates also voiced support for) and generating electricity with organic matter, or biomass, could help in the short-term. 
“You need help right now and lower costs right now,” Libby said. 
Multiple candidates including Midgley and McCarthy, a University of Maine trustee from Gorham, said the state should repeal its solar incentive program known as net energy billing. 
Immigration
There are no circumstances in which any of the candidates in Tuesday’s debate would sign a bill that would bar police from cooperating with law enforcement in other states. 
Additionally, they all said they would veto a proposal currently on the governor’s desk, LD 1971, which prevents state and local law enforcement from detaining someone solely on the basis of a federal immigration-related request.
Wessels, a small business owner from Paris, said like multiple other candidates he would not support Maine becoming a sanctuary state. He said he also wouldn’t allow state funds to flow to cities that decided to become sanctuary cities. 
When discussing immigration, McCarthy and Midgley said the state has a problem with drug activity and overdoses that needs to be addressed. 
State budget 
Some candidates said they would like to replicate President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency to help reduce the state budget. Wessels said he’d like to see deregulation across sectors and the end of certain programs such as the Office of New Americans. 
“We have to look under the hood and find what we are spending money on,” said Jones, who owns F.O. Bailey Real Estate in Falmouth, and previously founded a commercial construction company.
McCarthy proposed a one-year commission to review every program or project in the state and determine if it should be kept, fixed or closed. He said he would get rid of the Governor’s Office of Policy Innovation and the Future — which Democratic gubernatorial candidate Hannah Pingree had led under Mills — and require other department commissioners to make a case for refilling every position that becomes vacant. 
Midgley said he’d like the state to do zero-sum budgeting, which is a process of specifically allocating every dollar and justifying expenses at the start of each budgeting cycle, rather than rely on the previous year’s budget.
Abortion
While Jones and Wessels labeled themselves as pro-life, McCarthy said Republicans have lost too many elections over abortion, in what may have been a reference to former Gov. Paul LePage’s loss to Mills in the 2022 election.
Outlawing abortion wouldn’t work because it has been part of society for many years, Jones said, but “we need to work together to get into the hearts and minds of women so that they understand… [having a child is] the most important thing on earth you can do.”
With the U.S. Supreme Court’s Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision returning abortion regulation to the states, Midgley said Maine can’t be counted on to be a pro-life state, but there are guardrails that could be put in place. In general, candidates opposed late-term abortion and requiring MaineCare to cover abortion costs. 
Though he said he would always recommend life, Libby said that if he were elected governor and presented with a bill that banned all abortions, he would let it become law without his signature. He said he feels people should be led by faith, but the government shouldn’t impose mandates like that on people.
Tax burden
Candidates agreed taxes in Maine are too high. They all said they would repeal the state’s new paid family and medical leave program, calling it another tax on business, but there was some divergence on how to address the tax burden overall.
Jones supports a consumption tax, or a value-added tax, because he said it will divert the tax burden from Maine citizens to the state’s visitors. If income tax could be eliminated, Jones asked, “why not?” He argued that Maine is losing residents to places without income tax, like Florida, so the state needs to make better efforts to retain those residents.  
Libby doesn’t agree with a value-added tax, arguing it would drive businesses to neighboring New Hampshire. Rather, he would reduce income taxes by $1 billion and triple the homestead exemption. 
Who will replace Janet Mills at the helm? Here’s the latest on Maine’s race for governor.

Wessels supports lowering income tax, but would start by making cuts to property taxes.
Child welfare
Challenges in the state’s child welfare system is the number one moral issue in the state because it involves children, Midgley said during the debate. 
“First thing that has to happen is whoever’s governor has to get out there and admit there’s a problem and put a lot of sunshine on it because I think people are going to be horrified,” he said.
His counterparts echoed his concerns about children dying while under state custody. While Libby and Jones also said they would like to separate the Office of Child and Family Services from what they described as a bloated Department of Health and Human Services, Midgley specified that he’d like to see it put under the Department of Public Safety to better integrate the law enforcement component of the system. 
McCarthy said the agency needs a “wartime leader” with a high sense of urgency who is willing to make major changes. 
Infrastructure 
All of the candidates bemoaned the state of Maine’s roads, electric grid, bridges and other infrastructure. 
Last December, the Maine Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers gave the state an overall infrastructure grade of C, which was the highest it’s seen since 2008 and places the state just above the national average. 
With a career background in construction, Jones said he understands infrastructure, so he would ensure the state gets the “best bang for our buck.” Libby said he would focus on bringing investment into the state and lowering taxes, rather than increasing welfare programs, to increase the state’s resources to spend on roads and other infrastructure. 
McCarthy would like to attract more outside investment in the state. He specifically mentioned developing artificial intelligence datacenters and having those entities pay for upgrades to the power grid.

(Submitted)LAWRENCE — An attorney representing 78-year-old Earl Ray Harris asked the Kansas Court of Appeals to toss a felony conviction resulting from a protest against public employees who were digging a ditch on his land without permission.
Reid Nelson, a state appellate defender, said his Crawford County client initiated in March 2019 a lonely but consequential protest of the ditch project. Harris complained to a city council member before going to the site. He made his opinion about the incursion known by sitting on a stool and holding a shotgun. Two public works employees at the scene hid behind vehicles. Eventually, Girard Police Department officers arrested Harris.
Harris was acquitted of aggravated assault, which required proof of an actual threat of bodily harm. A jury found him guilty of “aggravated interference with the conduct of public business in a public building.”
During oral argument on the appeal Tuesday, Nelson reminded the three-judge panel that Harris performed his protest on his own property rather than in a public building. The conviction should be overturned because the law says the impediment must involve a public building, Nelson said.
“In this day and age, when you invoke a weapon, doesn’t that change the character of the message?” said Court of Appeals Judge Amy Fellows Cline.
Nelson said Harris never pointed the weapon at anyone. He said the unloaded firearm was in two pieces and had to be held together with a cable tie during the trial.
“The First Amendment right to freedom of speech and expression and the Second Amendment right to bear arms are both rights that can make people uncomfortable,” he added. “The United States Supreme Court says clearly that before the exercise of these important rights can be criminalized, the jury must determine that the action involves a true threat of violence.”
Nelson said a jury would have a difficult time making that assessment because the interference law was unacceptably vague. It infringed on freedom of speech and expression in the U.S. Constitution and Kansas Constitution’s Bill of Rights, he said. The attorney contended the conviction violated Harris’ Second Amendment right to bear arms.
“There’s nothing wrong with calling the police for this type of thing,” Nelson said. “The mistake came when they arrested him for doing nothing more, really, than walking on his property with his own gun and turning his back, in a completely nonthreatening manner, on these employees.”
The Court of Appeals panel of Chief Judge Sarah Warner, Judge Thomas Malone and Cline convened at the Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas for argument of the case so members of the public could get a glimpse of how the judiciary operated.
Much of their time in the building, which is festooned with memorabilia tied to former U.S. Sen. Bob Dole, was devoted to teasing out meaning of the statute on aggravated interference with public employees.
Andy Lohmann, assistant solicitor general for Kansas, urged the judges to reject Harris’ appeal. He said the law in question wasn’t mysterious. A reading of the statute made clear the Kansas Legislature was interested in protecting government workers beyond physical walls of a government structure, he said.
“Ultimately,” Lohmann said, “you can commit the crime of ‘interfering with the conduct of public business in a public building’ — not in a public building.”
On this point, Lohmann was asked by the panel to confirm he didn’t believe it mattered whether Harris carried out his protest in a building or a pasture.
“That’s correct,” Lohmann said. “He knew he was going to impede public officials by intimidating them with the weapon.”
He told the appellate judges the constitutional issues raised by the defendant’s attorney weren’t relevant to the appeal.
“The right to bear arms is not the right to carry a weapon for whatever purpose,” Lohmann said. “The state has the ability to make sure that someone is not carrying the weapon in order to intimidate a city worker so they stop working.”
Warner, who grew up in Pittsburg and joined the Court of Appeals in 2019, said both Nelson and Lohmann asserted during their presentations that they had a firm understanding of K.S.A. 21-5922.
“It’s kind of a strange statute,” she said. “Everyone is willing to argue that this is a clear statute, but I’m not sure that I’m among your number.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Malone-Warner-Cline-submitted-to-kr-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-17 09:56:28.972548

Mike Dunleavy discusses proposed education legislation at a news conference on Jan. 31, 2025. (Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)Alaska’s governor will not withdraw an executive order proposing to create a new state Department of Agriculture, he said in a letter sent Monday to the leaders of the state House and Senate.
Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s letter comes days after a joint House-Senate panel voted to spend up to $100,000 on a lawsuit against the governor if he goes ahead with his proposal to create the department unilaterally.
Alaska is one of only two states without a cabinet-level state Department of Agriculture, and legislators have spoken favorably about the idea of creating one, but a majority of the House and Senate want to authorize that new department through law, not by the governor’s executive order.
In March, the Legislature voted 32-28 to reject an administrative order that would have created the Department of Agriculture by splitting off part of the Department of Natural Resources, the agency that currently oversees agriculture.
Shortly before the vote, lawmakers in the House and Senate introduced new legislation to create the department. Neither the House bill nor the Senate bill advanced to a final vote, and either could be taken up during the next regular legislative session, which begins in January.  
When Dunleavy called lawmakers into special session in August, he reissued the executive order, but the leaders of the state House and Senate declined to accept the order as valid, saying that the Alaska Constitution does not grant the governor the power to issue an order during a special session.
Lawmakers also say they believe that it isn’t legal to reintroduce a previously rejected order.
“There clearly exists a disagreement between the executive and legislative branch as to the governor’s ability to introduce an executive order in a special session,” the governor wrote in Monday’s letter. “When such a dispute exists, it is appropriate to seek clarification from the courts.”
The governor’s letter notes that lawmakers could have met during the special session to vote down his executive order. Legislators have previously said they did not wish to do so, because taking the vote would have been the equivalent of acknowledging that the governor has the power to issue an executive order during a special session.
Rep. Sara Hannan, D-Juneau, is chair of the Legislative Council, the joint House-Senate committee that authorized the lawsuit against the governor.
By phone on Tuesday, she said she isn’t sure when the suit will be filed, but she expects it to move quickly.
The executive branch is preparing to launch the new department by Jan. 1, and legislators want to stop it before then.
“We have two prime legal issues that we think need to be addressed by a court, because the executive branch is interpreting them completely different,” she said.
Hannan said she expects that once a trial judge decides the issue, the losing party in the case will rapidly appeal to the Alaska Supreme Court for a final determination.
Regardless of who wins the case, Hannan said the state may still end up with a Department of Agriculture by June because legislators are advancing bills that would create the department.
“The 34th Legislature still may create a Department of Agriculture, but the executive order action of creating that and attempting to do it in a special session and after an executive order has been rejected, those are the legal questions that we need addressed,” she said.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSCF4345-scaled-e1751062756632-1024x677.jpg,,,2025-09-17 10:57:23.854898

The Delaware State Housing Authority (DSHA) has announced $3.18 million in preliminary project awards through the 2025 Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) allocation cycle, supporting the creation and preservation of affordable housing across the state.
The funding will go toward four projects that together will create 105 new affordable units and preserve 116 existing units.
“Increasing housing supply, particularly by building new affordable rental units, is one of the many ways we can begin to solve the housing crisis in Delaware. Boosting supply also helps us reduce homelessness, a critical issue that DSHA is working to address,” said DSHA Director Matthew J. Heckles. 
DSHA receives an annual tax credit amount and awards funding through a competitive process, with criteria outlined in its Qualified Allocation Plan. Developers selected through this program claim tax credits over 10 years, using the equity to attract additional financing for construction or rehabilitation.

“Like Governor Matt Meyer, we believe housing is a human right. All Delaware residents deserve to have a safe, secure and stable home, whether they own or rent. The allocation of tax credits we are announcing today will make that a reality for over 200 families immediately and hundreds more over the life of the program,” Heckles said. 
Funded Projects

Village of Francis and Clare, Wilmington — A new senior high-rise with 51 units, the first high-rise project to receive LIHTC credits from DSHA.

Willows at Northstar, Lewes — A 46-unit new construction project, part of a master-planned development integrating affordable housing into a market-rate community.

Georgetown Apartments I, Georgetown — Preservation of 76 units, part of a larger community upgrade alongside Georgetown II Apartments.

Mispillion Station III, Milford — Renovation of 40 units, part of ongoing improvements within the Mispillion community.


“In Delaware, we are more than 19,000 rental units short of what we need to house residents, especially those who need affordable housing,” said Stephanie Griffin, DSHA’s Chief Production Officer. “These four LIHTC awards will enable developers of these projects to leverage their investments to provide much needed affordable housing to state residents.”
Properties financed with LIHTCs must remain affordable for at least 30 years. Since DSHA began administering the program in 1987, more than 10,000 affordable units have been added to Delaware’s housing stock.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LIHTC2025-scaled-e1739900619782-835x1024.jpg,,,2025-09-17 09:56:28.972548

Delaware forward Mikey Johnson faced his own goal tender as he prepared for his touch. Johnson stood in the middle of UD’s offensive zone, his back to the Mountaineer goalkeeper, as freshman Beckett Field flew past his right shoulder behind Mount St. Mary’s defense. Without hesitation or a quick peek behind, Johnson tapped the ball in Field’s direction landing a perfect no-look pass to his young teammate.
Field received the perfectly placed pass, shuffled the ball to his left foot and booted it past the Mountaineer goal tender for the Fightin’ Blue Hens’ first goal of the second half.
Johnson’s assist punctuated a dominant game for him and the Blue Hens offense as they cruised to a 4-0 victory over Mount St. Mary’s, Tuesday evening.
Johnson finished the game with a match-high two goals and one assist, playing in his home state of Maryland. Johnson’s two scores came in the first half amidst a consistent pouring of rain, providing UD with a two-score lead at halftime.
The senior forward’s first goal came in the tenth minute. Johnson converted on the team’s first penalty kick of the season hitting the top right of the net past the outstretched arms of Julian Marcos in net.
Johnson’s second score was slightly more adventurous.
In the 27th minute, Johnson received a pass right in front of the net. He fired the ball toward the net minder, but the kick was blocked by a Mountaineer defender. The ball ricocheted directly to his left foot and Johnson shot across his body, landing the ball at bottom right of the goal.
Field and Sophomore Marius Stenner completed the scoring with a goal apiece in the second half to propel UD to a 7-0 start this season. The undefeated start is a new program best eclipsing the team’s previous best of sixth consecutive wins to open a season set in 1970 and tied in 2014.
The Blue Hens start is a product of both a dominant defense and prolific offense.
UD’s offensive attack entered the night tied for third in the country with 18 total goals through its first 6 games and its defense was tied for second in the country with five shutouts in that span.
The offense bolsters eight different goal scorers with half accumulating multiple scores this season. Stenner leads the group with seven and Johnson sits just behind him with six — already surpassing his career total. The defense is holding their opponents to eight shots per game and Freshman goalkeeper JoJo Elliott Jr. is dominating in his debut season. The Hockessin native has 24 saves and already sits in a four-way tie for the most shutouts in a single season with six.
UD joined the Summit League this season as its football team moved to Conference USA and the FBS level, leading to an adjustment throughout the athletic department. In its inaugural season, the Blue Hens sit atop the Summit League standings as its only undefeated team.
UD will return to the pitch next Tuesday in a road matchup against George Washington before returning home for their first Summit League matchup against UMass on September 27.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/soccer-udd-vs-msm.jpg,,,2025-09-17 09:56:28.972548

Sign up for Votebeat Michigan’s free newsletter here.
Michigan voters serving in the military away from home have a new way to return their ballots starting this week.
With the launch of the Electronic Delivery and Return Portal, these voters will have the option to fill out their ballot and return it all electronically through a secure online portal. It’s a small step for a state that, compared with many others, strictly limits who can return ballots electronically.
Michigan previously required all voters covered by the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, or UOCAVA to return their ballots only by mail. In 2022, lawmakers approved a change for military voters only, allowing them to return ballots electronically, but implementation was delayed until this year to align with other election law updates.
Sen. Ruth Johnson, a Republican from Holly and a former Michigan secretary of state, introduced the bill in 2021. She said at the time that the mail requirement could be “difficult for military personnel in combat areas or on a ship at sea,” where mail service can be slow or inconsistent.
With the change, she said, these voters could return ballots using “the same secure technology they already use to transmit classified documents.”
In Michigan, only military personnel and their families will have the new option to return ballots electronically. Other UOCAVA voters can still receive ballots electronically but must return them by mail. Only a handful of states — Iowa, Missouri, and Texas — have similar restrictions. Most states offer the same electronic options to all their overseas voters. Some offer them more widely even to voters living in state.
Electronic return reduces the risk of ballots getting lost
Expanding the option for military voters first is a normal first foray into electronic return for states, said Will Adler, senior associate director of the Elections Project at the Bipartisan Policy Center. Michigan and other states require overseas military voters to use their verified electronic signature from the U.S. Department of Defense, so ballots have an added level of security.
Most overseas voters choose to return their ballots by mail, Adler said. But in 2024, a majority of states allowed voters to return ballots electronically.
Electronic return through online portals can especially benefit Americans in places without consistent or secure mail access, where a ballot can easily get lost. Fax and email are also valid options for states under federal law, and these are still the most common electronic options that states offer, but they pose security and technical challenges, too.
Experts say that online portals, like Michigan’s new one, tend to be the most secure electronic option. Cheri Hardmon, spokesperson for the Michigan Department of State, said a portal allows for both security and “administrative efficiencies.”
It’s important to have independent testing on such portals, Adler said, but they tend to start from a stronger place than faxes or email.
“Faxed ballots are most likely not encrypted, while emailed ballots might be,” Adler said. “One benefit that a portal should have over email is the ability to block malicious attachments.”
Other states go further with electronic ballot return
While Michigan is just now implementing the change for military voters, a number of states already extend the option to all UOCAVA voters, and in some cases, even to some voters stateside who could benefit. Research last year from the National Conference of State Legislatures found that more than a dozen states allow voters with disabilities to return their ballots electronically.
Some of those states go even further: Colorado allows voters experiencing natural disasters or personal emergencies to use electronic ballot return in some cases; West Virginia allows for qualified first responders to do the same.
It’s unlikely that electronic ballot return will ever be available for all voters, Adler said. The security measures in place make it a viable option only for a small group of voters — Michigan had 21,910 UOCAVA voters cast ballots in the 2024 general election, according to the Michigan Department of State — or just over one-third of 1% of all ballots cast. To open the option up to everyone could lead to major concerns about the integrity of the system overall.
“People are trying very hard to mitigate [the risks], but there’s just a long road ahead to addressing enough of the problems that I would feel comfortable extending it to a large group of voters,” Adler said. “Most security experts agree with that.”

Gov. Gavin Newsom has a lot of decisions to make over the next month. 
His desk is stacked high with hundreds of bills recently passed by the state Legislature in the session that just ended this weekend. With the stroke of his pen, those bills would become law. 
Our reporting team has created this tracker to help you easily monitor the fate of the most consequential of those bills. 
The governor will have a lot of complex state issues to consider – as well as his new national role. 
The Legislature has plopped some significant issues on his desk, like: 

A sweeping overhaul of California’s energy and climate policies
A suite of regulations to put guardrails around AI
A number of direct responses to President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign

Last year, Newsom nearly 16% of all 1,200 bills passed by the Legislature. The typical reasons for his vetoes: bad or redundant policy, costs, controversy or powerful special interests.

Voters haven’t yet passed Newsom’s proposal to gerrymander districts to favor Democrats. 
But it’s already forcing political candidates to make big decisions about what job they want next – and, in some cases, where they’re going to live. 
Newsom created Prop. 50 in response to President Donald Trump’s demand that Republican states redraw their maps to solidify House Republicans’ precarious majority in 2026. 
As Maya Miller reports, Darrell Issa, an 11-term Republican congressman, is suddenly facing new Democratic challengers. 
Marni von Wilpert has experience flipping formerly conservative districts blue. She did so in winning a seat on the San Diego city council in 2020. Now, after assessing the new maps, she’s going to challenge Issa. 

von Wilpert: “When the lines were redrawn, it did open up a valuable opportunity.”




Solar farm bill withers away

From CalMatters water reporter Rachel Becker: 
Assemblymember Buffy Wicks shelved a divisive bill that would have incentivized farmers to plant solar panels on parched fields, citing “implementation” concerns from Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office. 
The Oakland Democrat said she will work with the governor over the fall and hopes to advance the bill next year. 
The bill, AB 1156, aimed to clear away financial penalties under a 60-year-old law called the Williamson Act, which gives farmers substantial property tax breaks in exchange for keeping their land undeveloped. It passed the Senate with 25 lawmakers supporting it, 8 voting against it, and 7 with no vote recorded. 
The bill divided the farming industry. Some saw solar as a way to put dried out fields to use, but others said it undermined a vital protection for California’s farmland.

A male, 29, sustained non-life-threatening injuries from a bear while hiking on the Turbid Lake Trail, located northeast of Mary Bay in Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park said Tuesday in a news release.
The male was hiking alone roughly 2.5 miles from the Pelican Valley Trailhead in the Pelican Valley Bear Management Area when he encountered the bear, the park said.
The news release described the incident, which is under investigation:

The hiker began to deploy bear spray when the bear made contact, and he sustained significant but non-life-threatening injuries to his chest and left arm. National Park Service medics responded to the incident and walked out with the hiker.
Once arriving to the trailhead, NPS transported the hiker in a park ambulance to the Lake Medical Clinic. He was then flown to a nearby hospital for treatment.
The hiker thought the bear was a black bear; however, the location, size, and behavior of the described bear suggest it might have been a grizzly bear. Bear management staff will attempt to confirm the species through DNA analysis, if possible.
The Turbid Lake Trail is closed until further notice. Bear management staff are sweeping the trail to ensure no other hikers are on the trail. Visit Backcountry Conditions for status and conditions of park trails.
Because this incident was a defensive reaction by the bear during a surprise encounter, the park will not be taking any management action against the bear.
This is the first incident of a bear injuring a person in Yellowstone in 2025. The last incident was in May 2021 when a grizzly bear injured a solo hiker on the Beaver Ponds Trail in Mammoth Hot Springs.




 Be bear aware 

Yellowstone recommends the following to help avoid surprise bear encounters:

Carry bear spray and know how to use it.
Be alert. See the bear before you surprise it. Watch for fresh tracks, scat, and feeding sites (signs of digging, rolled rocks, torn up logs, ripped open ant hills).
Make noise.
Hike in groups of three or more people.
Stay 100 yards (91 meters) away from bears at all times.
Stay on trail and don’t hike at dawn, dusk, or at night, when grizzlies are most active.

Don’t run from a bear.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Yellowstone-National-Park-sign-1024x645.jpg,,,2025-09-17 09:56:28.972548

Pam Queen is easing out of the job, CASA's gala is still on but rescheduled, more political notes.","Despite moves by other states, and grumbling by some Democrats in Maryland, Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said it's too early to commit to a mid-decade redistricting. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Maryland’s top Senate Democrat said he is not yet sold on an effort to redraw the state’s congressional districts before the next Census.
Del. David Moon (D-Montgomery) and Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Howard and Anne Arundel) have said they will sponsor bills to redraw the state’s eight congressional districts, in response to redistricting in Texas and other states aimed at shoring up the Republican majority in the House ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
But Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said Tuesday it’s too early to commit to such legislation.
“It’s too early at the moment to make a decision whether … we are or not. I think — what I’ve said from the beginning — is it should be the absolute last option on the table,” Ferguson said when asked about the potential for congressional redistricting in Maryland.
“I hope there is a path that allows us to avoid this mutually assured destruction that is every two years redistricting, state by state, based on each election,” he said.
Gov. Wes Moore (D) has signaled an interest in looking at redrawing the maps approved just three years ago. It would likely face a legal challenge.
“We’re thinking through what it means,” Ferguson said. “We’re looking at the Constitution and the legal framework. It’s not just a matter of just coming in and passing a bill.”
Ferguson called the Lone Star State initiative, aimed at picking up five additional Republican seats, “a terrible precedent” for the country. After Texas redistricted, California and Missouri advanced their own plans and other states are eyeing it.
“It flies in the face of what we should expect for democracy,” Ferguson said. “And Maryland can’t sit back and watch while other Republican states do it by themselves. And so, it has to be on the table.” Ferguson said he has talked with Senate leaders from other states, including Republicans, who are hesitant to follow Texas’ lead.

“I think there is a desire nationally from state leaders to find a way to avoid this, because we recognize that we have very real policy differences,” Ferguson said. “If we are out here changing the rules every two years, it’s hard to give people a lot of faith in the future of democracy.”
Any gains from redistricting in Maryland would be minimal: Democrats hold seven of the state’s eight House seats. Rep. Andy Harris (R-1st) is the sole Republican and efforts to massage district lines in a way that makes Harris vulnerable could open the door to a Republican challenger in one of the seven districts held by Democrats.
In one scenario, Harris’ district could be redrawn to push Annapolis Democrats into his Eastern Shore district. But that could come at a cost to first-term Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd), whose district now includes Annapolis. Other changes might affect first-term Reps. Johnny Olszewksi (D-2nd) or April McClain Delaney (D-6th) — in what is currently the most competitive district — or even veteran Rep. Kweisi MFume (D-7th).
“I think that’s less of my concern,” Ferguson said of possible fallout for incumbent Democrats. “I think in this moment in time, I’m most concerned about democracy, and how can we protect the foundation of representative democracy in a context where we know the federal government is pushing on every norm and breaking every institution.
“What is Maryland’s role in that? That’s what I’m really focused in on and trying to evaluate as other states are working on the same,” he said.
U.S. House Democrats from Maryland met privately last week to discuss possible redisttricting, according to Punchbowl News, but made no announcements.
Queen to retire

Legislators from District 14 announced Wednesday they have filed for next year’s election. Absent from the slate is Del. Pam Queen, 66, a Democrat who has served in the House for nearly a decade.
“I congratulate Delegate Pam Queen on her successful legislative career and appreciate her service to District 14 and the State of Maryland,” former Montgomery County Executive Isiah “Ike” Leggett, said in a statement released by the slate.
Queen is expected to retire at the end of the current term.
Veteran lawmakers Sen. Craig J. Zucker and Del. Anne R. Kaiser, along with Del. Bernice Mireku-North, who was appointed in 2023 to fill a vacancy, will run in 2026 as a Democratic slate in the district.
More time to get that anniversary gift
If you had circled Sept. 18 on your calendar for the CASA anniverary gala, it’s time to get out the eraser and turn a couple calendar pages.
The CASA celebration labeled “40th Anniversary Gala: From Basement to Powerhouse,” originally scheduled for this week, has been rescheduled. The event is now set to take place Nov. 6  at 6 p.m. in the organization’s Baltimore Welcome Center.
The name of the event reflects the fact that the immigrant advocacy group that was founded in the basement of a Takoma Park church now has five offices in Maryland as well as offices in Pennsylvania, Virginia and Georgia. The organization claims to have 173,000 members nationwide and has become a respected lobbying force in Annapolis.
Besides celebrating 40 years of advocacy, the November gala will also pay homage to its longtime executive director, Gustavo Torres, who is stepping down.
As the organization conducts a nationwide search for a new leader, it plans to continue fighting for immigrant rights. That includes speaking out against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) increasing deportation efforts.

Opponents have raised concerns about their cost.,"In summary
California lawmakers sent several bills to the governor that aim to protect consumers and improve patients’ access to care. Opponents have raised concerns about their cost. 


Several health care bills are now on the governor’s desk, aiming to improve access for Californians who can’t afford prescription drugs, shorten delays to medical decisions, and address threats to personal privacy.
This year, California lawmakers backed at least half a dozen bills that would change how consumers access drugs and health care – and set new protections for their medical privacy. Opponents of some of these efforts say more regulations will only make health care more expensive, while advocates say consumers need protection from the federal government and from powerful industry lobbies that drive up costs.
Gov. Gavin Newsom has until Oct. 12 to approve or veto these measures.
Making prescription drugs more affordable
Rising drug costs are one of the leading drivers of increased health spending. Between 2022 and 2023, the most recent year state data is available, spending on prescription drugs increased by nearly 11%. That’s part of why state lawmakers are trying to make prescription drugs cheaper for consumers by limiting out-of-pocket costs and cracking down on companies that control prescription drug benefits.
Newsom vetoed a proposal to cap insulin costs two years ago, pointing to a $100 million state initiative to manufacture low-cost insulin instead. But with that project — named CalRx — yet to produce any insulin, lawmakers returned with a new push to bring immediate relief to diabetes patients.
Reintroduced this year by Sen. Scott Wiener, Senate Bill 40, which passed unanimously in the Senate and Assembly, would cap monthly out-of-pocket spending on insulin at $35. It’s a life-saving drug, but its high cost, which can be hundreds of dollars per month, can lead patients to skip doses and ration medication.

Wiener said he brought this measure back in the hopes of helping patients find financial relief as soon as January. “Whatever happens with CalRx is not mutually exclusive with the goal of capping (out-of-pocket) costs for insulin,” he added.
Wiener focused a lot of attention on prescription drug costs this year. Another of his measures, Senate Bill 41, would create some of the strongest regulations in the country for pharmacy benefit managers.
Pharmacy benefit managers serve as intermediaries between health insurance companies and drug manufacturers. They manage claims, negotiate the price of drugs under a complex system of rebates, and control the list of prescription drugs that insurers will cover.
In California, they’ve gone largely unregulated.
Wiener’s proposal would prohibit pharmacy benefit managers from “steering” patients to specific pharmacies or charging patients more for a drug than they reimburse the pharmacy. It would also, among other regulations, require them to pass all savings negotiated with drug manufacturers on to patients.
Opponents of the measure argue that it would prevent pharmacy benefit managers from effectively negotiating lower drug costs with manufacturers and will cost the state billions of dollars. They also contend that enough regulation was inserted into a budget deal Newsom made in May requiring pharmacy benefit managers to be licensed by the state and note that the state finance department is opposed.
“Californians simply cannot afford policies like SB 41 that would enrich pharmaceutical manufacturers by raising costs across the state’s patients and small businesses,” according to an unsigned statement from the Pharmaceutical Reform Alliance, a group representing pharmacy benefit managers.
Helping Californians with timely access and hospital bills
Thousands of Californians struggle with health care delays and unpaid bills each year. Health advocates say these issues cause many people to wait in limbo while their condition deteriorates or forgo health care altogether.
One of the reasons for delays is prior authorization, a process in which medical providers must get approval from health insurance before they can provide a service or dispense medication. Insurers say prior authorization is needed to keep health spending down by preventing people from getting unnecessary or duplicative services, but doctors and patients criticize it because it can delay care. 
Two Democrats, Sen. Josh Becker from Menlo Park and Assemblymember John Harabedian from Pasadena, want to make it easier for patients to get the care recommended by their doctors without waiting for insurance to weigh in. 
Becker introduced Senate Bill 306, a measure that would eliminate prior authorization requirements for treatments that health insurance plans approve 90% of the time. Harabedian’s measure, Assembly Bill 512, would speed up the process by shortening the time health insurers have to respond to prior authorization requests. Insurers would have to make decisions for requests made electronically within three days for standard requests and 24 hours for urgent ones. 
“Doctors should be spending their time with patients — not drowning in paperwork for treatments that nearly always get approved anyway,” Becker said in a statement earlier this year.
The state’s doctor lobby sponsored both bills. Meanwhile, health insurers opposed them, arguing that current prior authorization rules are necessary for safe and cost-effective care. 
Lawmakers also voted for legislation that aims to make it easier for patients to receive financial assistance from hospitals.
Research has shown that many patients do not know about or do not apply to hospital charity care programs even though they may qualify. Assembly Bill 1312 by Assemblymember Pilar Schiavo, a Santa Clarita Democrat, requires hospitals to check whether patients are eligible for financial assistance or discounted payments before sending them a bill. 
Under the proposal, hospitals would have to presume that people who are enrolled in means-tested programs, such as food stamps and cash assistance, are eligible for financial aid, along with people who are experiencing homelessness. Hospitals would have to proactively screen patients for charity care eligibility if they are uninsured, enrolled in Medi-Cal or in a Covered California health plan. 
If signed, the bill would take effect in 2027.
Protecting sensitive medical information 
As the Trump administration pushes the limits on immigration enforcement and pushes norms on abortion restrictions, California lawmakers are seeking to boost privacy protections for sensitive medical information. 
Sen. Jesse Arreguín, a Berkeley Democrat, sought to add protections for immigrants in medical facilities. His bill came as incidents where immigration agents showed up at hospitals raised questions and confusion, as well as fear among patients and health workers.
Senate Bill 81 would require hospitals and clinics to designate “non-public spaces” in their facilities and restrict immigration agents from entering those spaces unless agents can present a judicial warrant. The Fourth Amendment already protects people from unreasonable searches in places where they can expect privacy, such as a medical exam room. If signed, this bill would add a state-level layer of protection.

“This legislation is urgent and necessary,” Arreguín said in August. “No one should have to choose between seeking medical care and fearing detention or deportation.”
Lawmakers are also attempting to safeguard abortion information after Texas and other states that heavily restrict or ban abortion enacted laws allowing their residents to sue out-of-state abortion providers.
Already doctors in California and New York have been sued for providing abortion medication to residents in states where the procedure is not allowed.
If signed, a bill authored by Assembly Majority Leader Cecilia Aguiar-Curry would allow doctors, pharmacists and other authorized prescribers to prescribe abortion pills without putting their names or the patient’s name on the prescription label. The Davis Democrat’s measure aims to create an added level of legal protection for abortion providers in California during a time marked by conflicting inter-state laws.
In a statement, Aguiar-Curry said the proposal “is about making sure Californians can get the care they need without fear or politics getting in the way.”

Spencer Cox said he’s hopeful about rural Utah’s odds of overcoming a tumultuous economic time in the midst of changing energy technologies and needs. 
That’s because in the nuclear energy space, he notices the executive branches in other states sharing more consensus than disagreements. And, because of those areas’ existing transmission lines and infrastructure.
Rural counties like Emery and Carbon have attracted multiple energy companies, with facilities like the San Rafael Energy Lab, while in the Fillmore, Beaver and Milford area, geothermal projects and existing wind and solar farms are set to make up the Utah Renewable Energy Corridor, Cox said during a panel discussion at the Utah Energy Week conference at the University of Utah.

“That’s where the opportunity lies, an opportunity to bring in jobs, an opportunity to bring in engineers and really talented people to help the people who are already there and to get them hope for a brighter future,” Cox said on Tuesday.
There’s still a challenge in convincing Utahns that implementing nuclear energy technologies in the state is a good idea. However, he said, polling on the issue has lately been “overwhelmingly positive.”
As Cox advances nuclear agreements, he says the cost to develop technology is nothing so far

According to a recent poll from the Deseret News and the Hinckley Institute, 49% of Utahns are in favor of building small nuclear reactors in the state, while 31% are opposed to it and 19% remain undecided. That support has lowered from the 65% the pollsters recorded in 2023, in a survey that asked opinions on a nuclear power plant in the state.
With that broad consensus, Cox said, rural Utah has the potential to be benefitted and help ease the political divide in the state, since polarization is linked to the economy.
“People have felt left out of the new economy. It has left a big segment of our population behind and I can tell you, as someone from rural Utah, we really feel that deeply,” Cox said. “You don’t lose your job in a coal mine and become a coder overnight. That’s not how it works.”
The governor does foresee more job displacement with the emergence of artificial intelligence in urban areas and in white collar jobs.



Let us know what you think...


 


“Which is something we’ve never seen before,” Cox said. “So we’re at this very tumultuous time, anything we can do to reestablish economic certainty in the lives of people is going to what is going to make us healthier.”
John Wagner, director of the Idaho National Laboratory said during the panel that one of the biggest challenges of the 890-square-mile facility is recruiting — even more so if those jobs are in the lab’s nuclear operations since there hasn’t been much training in that area for a long time. 
The Idaho Falls-based lab has grown to have about 6,400 employees. However, Wagner’s concern about the general energy development workforce remains, especially since thousands of workers are needed on site to build nuclear generators.
“Where are those folks going to come from to enable us to (achieve) our current administration goals to quadruple nuclear power by 2050?” Wagner said.
Cox agreed, describing the challenge as “terrifying,” adding that the state needs to also build more homes for the next generation of workers. But, he hopes the state’s higher education system will collaborate in a “universal effort” to encourage people to pursue technical paths.
“I think we made a huge mistake as a country in the way that we educate our young people. We’ve separated work from education for far too long. That education is the thing you do the first 20-plus years of your life, and then you get a job, you do that for the rest of your life,” Cox said. “That is not the way the economy works now. We have to get work earlier into education, and we have to get education later into work as we continue to learn new skills and have new opportunities.”

In a letter sent Saturday, Mackey warned educators about ""inappropriate"" social media posts. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)In a letter sent to school superintendents on Saturday, Alabama State Schools Superintendent Eric Mackey said that “inappropriate” social media posts will result in investigations and disciplinary action.
Mackey said the letter stemmed from what he described as three “inexcusable” social media posts by three Alabama educators about the shooting of right-wing political commentator and talk radio show host Charlie Kirk.
 “Almost immediately upon arrival at home, I became aware of two inappropriate, reprehensible, and inexcusable social media posts regarding the assassination of Charlie Kirk,” Mackey wrote in the letter. “These posts were allegedly created and posted by two of our own Alabama teachers. By the time I went to bed, I had received a third post.”

Alabama Political Reporter first reported the letter. The nature of the posts was not explained. There are currently 48,670 public school teachers in the state.
Mackey said the posts he was made aware of may violate the Alabama Administrative Code and the Educator Code of Ethics but did not state how, and said school officials should report any inappropriate posts for investigation.
“I want to make it clear that each instance will be thoroughly reviewed and investigated by our certification team. If you become aware of any such material allegedly created, posted, and/or reposted by your employees, you should immediately report it to the Alabama State Department Education and work with your legal counsel to determine appropriate disciplinary actions,” the letter said.
Mackey wrote that he has removed teachers from their positions to ensure student safety.
“In my years as state superintendent, I have removed people from our profession and otherwise reprimanded inappropriate behavior in order to protect our students and to safeguard our profession. I will continue to do so, and I will not tolerate a small group of bad actors to diminish our calling or tarnish our profession,” he said in the letter.
Amy Marlowe, executive director of the Alabama Education Association, which represents teachers around the state, said in a statement educators need to “exercise discernment” when posting on social media and while they have free speech, they still serve in a public position. 
“While educators, like all citizens, have a constitutional right to free speech, those rights must be balanced with their professional responsibilities and the operational needs of school systems,” Marlow wrote. “It is important for educators to recognize that while they are private citizens, they also serve in a public role. Community standards and the impact on the learning environment all factor into how an educator’s social media activity is evaluated. Our goal is to help educators safeguard their careers by adhering to their school system’s social media policy while maintaining the highest standards of professionalism.”
AEA will provide services for teachers to ensure they are protecting their rights while also doing their jobs.
“AEA will continue to provide resources, training, and support to ensure educators remain protected and respected as they carry out their vital mission of educating Alabama’s children,” Marlowe wrote.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Eric-Mackey-Feb-5-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-17 08:57:16.214577

 During fall, trees gear up for winter by recycling nutrients from their leaves. And while experts are seeing the effects of drought on fall foliage, changes aren’t uniform across the state.

As days get shorter and nights get colder across Vermont, green valleys and hillsides will soon be flush with splotches of yellow, orange and red. Because of the state’s drought, scientists suspect that some trees may drop their leaves earlier — but not without providing humans a spectacle. 
“Every year is different, and that’s the cool thing about fall foliage,” said Ali Kosiba, who studies the impacts of climate change on trees and forest ecology for the University of Vermont Extension. While we enjoy the beautiful colorscape, trees are responding to events from this summer and past years, she said. 
During fall, trees gear up for winter by recycling nutrients from their leaves, pulling them into their trunks to store for the winter, she said. Canopies change color as they break down those nutrients — drawing onlookers who swarm the state in the annual ritual of leaf-peeping. 
Trees in bogs usually produce a bright red color, Kosiba said. That’s because in very wet conditions it’s difficult for trees to access nitrogen in the soil. That makes it more important to retain nitrogen from their leaves, Kosiba said.

While the color in their leaves is a sight to behold, it really acts as a sunscreen for the tree, she said. The color helps prevent sunlight from hitting the leaf, giving the tree more time to recycle its nutrients, she said. 
As of Sept. 15, the national drought monitor reports that more than half of Vermont is experiencing severe drought, spanning the northeast and central parts of the state, while southern and northwest Vermont are in moderate droughts, according to the monitor. The short-term drought has been going on for about the past month, Kosiba said. 
And while experts aren’t quite sure how dry conditions will affect foliage, they encourage leaf peepers to be flexible and explore different parts of the state. 
In the Champlain Valley and the Connecticut River Valley, scientists are seeing some leaves either going through the fall color progression rapidly, or just turning from green to brown, said Josh Halman, Forest Health Program manager for the Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation.

At a site he monitors in Underhill, Halman usually sees peak foliage the first week of October. But that peak can happen a little earlier up north or at higher elevations, he said. The drought this year may mean that foliage peaks in mid-September, he said. 
While trees in dry conditions may have muted colors, trees on another side of the mountain or a few miles away may be vibrant and bright. Halman’s already seen some impacts of drought on fall foliage, but “it’s not uniform at all across the state,” he said.

Some trees are suffering due to dry conditions coupled with hot temperatures — those two factors together tend to have “a really pronounced effect on plants,” Kosiba said. 
That’s because hot air can hold more water, which means it’s evaporating from surfaces more quickly, Kosiba said. “(Leaves) have these little openings that allow them to bring in carbon dioxide, but water also evaporates from those little pores,” she said.

During a drought, leaves will close up those pores, called stomata, to protect themselves from any water loss, Kosiba said. But that prevents them from taking in carbon dioxide and photosynthesizing, she said. “They basically kind of shut down for a little bit,” she said. 
If water in the soil is also evaporating, the edges of leaves will start to brown, which signals that their cells are dying. The leaves become a liability to the tree’s health, so rather than trying to store their energy, trees might drop them early, Kosiba said. 
Trees tend to feel the most pronounced effects of drought in shallow soils or in rocky landscapes, according to Kosiba. South-facing slopes also tend to dry out faster because they face the sun, she said. 
Vermont’s diverse landscape leaves lots of room for variation in color development. You might see tons of green, then turn a corner and see tons of fall colors, Halman said. 
Kosiba encouraged leaf peepers to look not only at the crowns of trees, but also at the plants in the understory and in their backyard.
“The hayscented fern turns a beautiful golden color, which is really spectacular,” she said.

The exact amount of the rate hike won’t be […]","In 2024, NV Energy served roughly 505,000 non-solar residential customers and 105,000 rooftop solar customers, according to a federal regulatory filing. (Photo: NVEnergy.com solar and energy website).The Public Utilities Commission of Nevada scrapped “more than a third” of NV Energy’s $224 million rate hike request, approved a daily peak demand charge for residential and small business customers in Southern Nevada, and tweaked net metering calculations for rooftop solar customers in the north. The exact amount of the rate hike won’t be known until Oct. 1. 
The changes in rate design are an effort to reduce what regulators say is a $50 million annual subsidy paid by full-service ratepayers to offset the lower costs enjoyed by rooftop solar customers.  
The peak demand charge allows NV Energy to impose a higher kilowatt (kWh) rate for the time of day with the most energy use. 
Opponents of peak usage rates say the scheme penalizes working people who are not home to spread out their use of household appliances. 
In addition to the $18 monthly service charge (reduced from $18.50), the utility will determine the amount of energy consumed during a 15-minute period of peak usage each day, multiply it by four to determine an hourly rate, and charge .19 cents per kWh during that hour, compared to the .11 cents per kWh it currently charges. 
A customer using 5 kWh is expected to pay $27 more per month, while a customer using 6 kWh could pay $38 more per month, according to data provided by Advanced Energy United, a trade group that represents renewable energy providers. 
“This decision undermines energy efficiency and affordability, all at a time when we are in an energy affordability crisis,” Sheila Hallstrom, a regulatory lead for AEU, said in a statement.  “Utilities should be incentivizing smart energy choices, not taking them away and punishing customers.”
NV Energy’s alternative to a peak demand charge was an increase in the basic service charge in Southern Nevada from $18.50 to $24, far less than the projected maximum demand charges. 
As an alternative to imposing peak demand charges, NV Energy asked for an increase to the basic service charge in Southern Nevada from $18.50 to $24, which would have been far less than the projected maximum demand charge, and a lighter increase for consumers.
But the PUC chose the peak demand charge anyway.
“At the end of the day, my goal in drafting this order was to find a way to make sure that folks were paying for the cost of the service that’s provided to them,” Commissioner Tammy Cordova said at Tuesday’s hearing, where there was no discussion or debate on Cordova’s recommended order, which the commission approved unanimously.
Evidence presented by NV Energy suggests the daily demand charge “will lower power bills for nearly all of NV Energy’s customers…” according to a PUC news release. 
The assertion “defies logic,” Las Vegas resident and frequent PUC critic Angel DeFazio said Tuesday during public comment. 
David Chairez, who resigned this summer as the regulatory manager for the Attorney General Office’s Bureau of Consumer Protection agrees the PUC’s assertion is wrong. 
“If you’re increasing rates by roughly $146 million, you’re not going to have a lower bill. You’ll  have a higher bill,” he said. 
Nevada, Chairez noted, “is now the only state that has a mandatory demand charge from an investor-owned utility,” adding he’s been engaged in utility ratemaking for 28 years “and I don’t know what the kilowatt demand is on my air conditioners, or on my oven.”
The PUC also approved NV Energy’s bid to calculate credits for excess energy returned to the grid by rooftop solar systems every 15 minutes rather than monthly. The change will only affect customers in Northern Nevada.   
The shift, another effort to reduce the disparity between rooftop solar and traditional customers,  applies to homeowners who install rooftop solar after Oct. 1 of this year. It’s expected to increase monthly bills for those customers by about $11 a month, and delay the return on investment of those systems.
Rather than the PUC engaging in piecemeal rate design to compensate for the disparity between traditional and solar customers, Chairez contends ratepayers would be better served if lawmakers addressed the root of the problem – a state law passed in 2017 that requires rooftop solar and traditional customers be counted in the same regulatory class, which he says prevents an accurate study of their costs. 
In 2024, NV Energy served roughly 505,000 non-solar residential customers and 105,000 rooftop solar customers, according to a federal regulatory filing.
Rooftop solar customers “would be the third-largest customer class, behind single family residential and multifamily residential,” says Chairez. “It makes sense that they should have a separate cost of service study.” 
“The Commission shares the concern voiced by many ratepayers at consumer sessions and in written comments that costs for everything are increasing and that electric bills are becoming unaffordable,” the PUC’s order said. “However, the same economic pressures that are increasing costs at the grocery store and at the doctor’s office are increasing costs for Nevada Power (NV Energy).”  
The PUC also approved charging Southern Nevada ratepayers for construction work in progress on Greenlink, a $4.2 billion transmission line, which is expected to increase bills by more than $4 a month in the south. The cost of the project is projected to be split 70/30 by customers in Southern Nevada and Northern Nevada respectively. 
The commission “is charged in part with protecting the financial health of the utility,” Cordova wrote in justifying the inclusion of the cost of construction in progress to rates. 
Parties that disagree with PUC orders have 10 days from the day the order is issued to file a motion for reconsideration.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/nvenergysolar.jpg,,,2025-09-17 08:57:16.214577

Kennedy Jr., is expected to vote to delay the hepatitis B shot for newborns. (Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)A key federal vaccine advisory panel whose members were recently replaced by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to vote to recommend delaying until age 4 the hepatitis B vaccine that’s currently given to newborns, according to two former senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials.
“There is going to likely be a discussion about hepatitis B vaccine, very specifically trying to dislodge the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and to push it later in life,” said Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “Apparently this is a priority of the secretary’s.”
The vote is expected to take place during the next meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, scheduled for Thursday and Friday, Sept. 18-19.
For more than 30 years, the first of three shots of hepatitis B vaccine has been recommended for infants shortly after birth. In that time, the potentially fatal disease has been virtually eradicated among American children. Pediatricians warn that waiting four years for the vaccine opens the door to more children contracting the virus.
“Age 4 makes zero sense,” pediatrician Eric Ball said. “We recommend a universal approach to prevent those cases where a test might be incorrect or a mother might have unknowingly contracted hepatitis. It’s really the best way to keep our entire population healthy.”
In addition to the hepatitis B vaccine, the panel will also discuss and vote on recommendations for the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine and COVID-19 vaccines. Pediatricians worry changes to the schedules of these vaccines will limit access for many families, leaving them vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases.
Typically, ACIP would undertake an analysis of the data before recommending a change to vaccine guidelines. As of the end of August, this process had not begun for the hepatitis B vaccines, Daskalakis and another former official said.
“This is an atypical situation. There’s been no work group to discuss it,” Daskalakis said.
In response to questions from KFF Health News, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon wrote, “ACIP exists to ensure that vaccine policy is guided by the best available evidence and open scientific deliberation. Any updates to recommendations will be made transparently with gold standard science.”
The draft agenda for the upcoming ACIP meeting was released to the public less than a week before it is scheduled to begin.
At the last ACIP meeting, in June, Martin Kulldorff, the chair and one of seven new members handpicked by Kennedy, questioned the need to vaccinate every newborn, citing only two of the many ways the virus can spread. Kulldorff is a former Harvard Medical School professor who became known for opposing some public health measures during the pandemic.
“Unless the mother is hepatitis B positive, an argument could be made to delay the vaccine for this infection, which is primarily spread by sexual activity and intravenous drug use,” he said.
The virus spreads via direct exposure to an infected bodily fluid like blood or semen. The disease has no cure and can lead to serious conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer later in life. The CDC advisory panel may maintain the recommendation to inoculate newborns whose mothers have hepatitis B or are considered at high risk of the disease, the former officials said.
Protection from birth
In 1991, federal health officials determined it was advisable for newborns to receive their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth, which blocks the virus from taking hold if transmitted during delivery. While parents may opt out of the shots, many day care centers and school districts require proof of hepatitis B vaccination for enrollment.
The prospect of ACIP’s altering the recommendation has left some people living with the virus deeply unsettled.
“I am goddamn frustrated,” said Wendy Lo, who has lived with the liver disease, likely since birth. Years of navigating the psychological, monetary, medical, and social aspects of chronic hepatitis B has touched almost every aspect of her life.
“I would not want anyone to have to experience that if it can be prevented,” she said. Lo learned she had the disease due to a routine screening to study abroad in college.
Lo credits the vaccines with protecting her close family members from infection.
“I shared with my partner, ‘If you get vaccinated, we can be together,’” she said. He got the vaccine, which protects him from infection, “so I’m grateful for that,” she said.
The CDC estimates half of people with hepatitis B do not know they are infected. It can range from an acute, mild infection to a chronic infection, often with few to no symptoms. Most people with chronic hepatitis B were born outside of the U.S., and Asians and Pacific Islanders followed by Black people have the highest rates of newly reported chronic infections.
When her children were born, Lo was adamant that they receive the newborn dose, a decision she says prevented them from contracting the virus.
The earlier an infection occurs, the worse the consequences, according to the CDC. When contracted in infancy or early childhood, hepatitis B is far more likely to become a chronic infection, silently damaging the liver over decades.
Those who become chronic carriers can also unknowingly spread the virus to others and face an increased risk of long-term complications including cirrhosis and liver cancer, which may not become evident until much later in life.
“Now I’m in my 50s, one of my big concerns is liver cancer. The vaccine is safe and effective, it’s lifesaving, and it protects you against cancer. How many vaccines do that?” Lo said.
Thirty years of universal vaccination
Treatments like the antivirals Lo now takes weren’t available until the 1990s. Decades of the virus’s replicating unchecked damaged her liver. Every six months she gets scared of what her blood tests may reveal.
After a vaccine was approved in the 1980s, public health officials initially focused vaccination efforts on people thought to be at highest risk of infection.
“I, and every other doctor, had been trained in medical school to think of hepatitis B as an infection you acquired as an adult. It was the pimps, the prostitutes, the prisoners, and the health care practitioners who got hepatitis B infection. But we’ve learned so much more,” said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and a former voting member of ACIP.
As hepatitis B rates remained stubbornly high in the 1980s, scientists realized an entire vulnerable group was missing from the vaccination regime — newborns. The virus is often transmitted from an infected mother to baby in late pregnancy or during birth.
“We may soon hear, ‘Let’s just do a blood test on all pregnant women.’ We tried that. That doesn’t work perfectly either,” Schaffner said.
Some doctors didn’t test, he said, and some pregnant women falsely tested negative while others acquired hepatitis B after they had been tested earlier in their pregnancies.
In 1991, Schaffner was a liaison representative to ACIP when it voted to advise universal vaccination for hepatitis B before an infant leaves the hospital.
“We want no babies infected. Therefore, we’ll just vaccinate every mom and every baby at birth. Problem solved. It has been brilliantly successful in virtually eliminating hepatitis B in children,” he said.
In 1990, there were 3.03 cases of hepatitis B per 100,000 people 19 years old or under in the U.S., according to the CDC.
Since the federal recommendation to vaccinate all infants, cases have dramatically decreased. CDC data shows that in 2022 the rate among those 19 or under was less than 0.1 per 100,000.
While hepatitis B is often associated with high-risk behaviors such as injection drug use or having multiple sexual partners, health experts note that it is possible for the virus to be transmitted in ordinary situations too, including among young children.
The virus can survive for up to seven days outside the body. During that time, even microscopic traces of infected blood on a school desk or playground equipment can pose a risk. If the virus comes into contact with an open wound or the mucous membranes of the eyes, an infection can occur. This means that unvaccinated children not considered at high risk can still be exposed in everyday environments.
Future access uncertain
If the CDC significantly alters its recommendation, health insurers would no longer be required to cover the cost of the shots. That could leave parents to pay out-of-pocket for a vaccine that has long been provided at no charge. Children who get immunizations through the federal Vaccines for Children program would lose free access to the shot as soon as any new ACIP recommendations get approved by the acting CDC director.
The two former CDC officials said that plans were underway to push back the official recommendation for the vaccine as of August, when they both left the agency, but may have changed.
Schaffner is still an alternate liaison member of ACIP, and hopes to express his support for universal newborn vaccination at the next meeting.
“The liaisons have now been excluded from the vaccine work groups. They are still permitted to attend the full meetings,” he said.
Schaffner is worried about the next generation of babies and the doctors who care for them.
“We’ll see cases of hepatitis B once again occur. We’ll see transmission into the next generation,” he said, “and the next generation of people who wear white coats will have to deal with hepatitis B, when we could have cut it off at the pass.”

But legislators and Gov. Gavin Newsom couldn't complete a deal on terms by end of session last week.,"Politicians tend to be procrastinators, putting off major policy issues until they can no longer be ignored without political fallout.
Accordingly, the last few days of any legislative session tend to be maelstroms of marathon meetings, loud debates and backroom dealmaking.
As the California Legislature ended its session last week one of its odder scenarios had to do with an on-again, off-again $750 million loan to financially strapped public transit systems and companion legislation that would authorize San Francisco Bay Area bus and rail systems to seek voter approval for a regional sales tax hike.
In a sense, Gov. Gavin Newsom is responsible for the systems’ financial pickle because five years ago, as the COVID-19 pandemic struck, he issued far-reaching orders to close businesses, or at least have their employees work from home, to reduce exposure to the deadly disease. Transit systems immediately saw sharp declines in patronage and farebox revenues.
They received some federal relief funds, but those bailouts eventually ended and ridership continued to lag behind pre-pandemic levels. As the squeeze tightened, Bay Area civic and political leaders began pressing for state permission to place a transit tax increase on the 2026 ballot. They also sought an immediate state bailout to maintain service. 
The state budget approved by legislators and Newsom in June contained authorization for a $750 million loan, even though the budget had a multi-billion-dollar deficit. The $750 million figure emerged after an initial proposal for a $2 billion state bailout to split between systems in Northern California and Southern California failed to gain political traction.
The loan was to be finalized by additional legislation setting forth terms, including repayment and interest, if any. But over the next two-plus months, culminating in the Legislature’s adjournment last week, the people involved never agreed on the details.
Who did or didn’t do what remains something of a mystery. Newsom’s administration and Bay Area legislators have been blaming each other for the failure to complete the deal.
Eventually, just before adjournment, Newsom said he would “offer short-term financial assistance to support Bay Area transit agencies with hundreds of millions of dollars,” but he didn’t give an exact number.
 “Transit is a lifeline to millions of Californians — and after billions in state investment, we’re continuing to back Bay Area agencies with ongoing support tailored to their needs,” Newsom said in a statement. “We’ll keep partnering with them now and into the next year — aligning flexible financing tools to their timelines — so we can deliver a sustainable, rider-first transit system together.”
Meanwhile, the legislation authorizing a 2026 transit tax election in five counties, Senate Bill 63, was passed. But the story doesn’t end there.
As now structured, the transit sales tax — a half-cent in four counties and a full cent in San Francisco — would require voter approval by a two-thirds majority. But advocates may seek to place the tax hike on the ballot via initiative petition, which would then require only simple-majority passage.
Underlying the maneuvering about Bay Area transit support is state officials’ assumption that transit will play a major role in the state’s crusade to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2045.  To perform that role, transit operators would need very large, ongoing injections of taxpayer funds, a new study indicates.
The California Policy Center, a conservative think tank, examined the finances of California’s 85 transit systems, using data from the Federal Transit Administration. It found that overall, the systems collected $897 million in fares in 2023, scarcely 10% of their $8.76 billion in operating expenses. Costs were rising faster than income — and that doesn’t include capital expenditures.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/092222-BART-TRAIN-REUTERS-MHWL-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-17 08:57:16.214577

Some correctional officers at the prison in Norco are trying to keep the  California Rehabilitation Center open by presenting it as an option to solve the overpopulation in county jails. 


This story appeared in Wednesday’s edition of the Inland Empire newsletter. If you enjoy our coverage, please sign up for the Inland Empire newsletter and let me know what kinds of stories you’d love to read.
Correctional officers at the California Rehabilitation Center (CRC) in Norco have started writing Attorney General Rob Bonta to to keep the prison open, presenting it as an option to alleviate the overpopulation in county jails.
California began placing some convicted felons in county jails in 2011, after the Supreme Court ruled that the overcrowding in state prisons resulted in cruel and unusual punishment. Now, according to the lawsuit Attorney General Rob Bonta brought against Los Angeles County on Sept. 8, the county’s jails are overcrowded and uninhabitable.
In March, 878 inmates held at Los Angeles County jail were felon convicts, according to a Sheriff’s Department report. That’s 7% of the population. 
“They’re causing the issue by keeping them in counties, so they say their numbers are down, so they’re closing prisons,” said Correctional Officer Jeremiah Rohbock, who wrote the initial letter.
The Norco prison has open beds, low costs per inmate and more rehabilitation and certification programs than most prisons, Rohbock added. 
The CDCR’s weekly report says that the prison currently has 2,460 inmates, and was designed for 1,822. Rohbock said the facility has enough beds to add additional inmates. 
There are eight criteria the CDCR uses to identify which prisons close. Those include population trends, operational costs, facility condition, geographic considerations, impact on staff, program availability, legislative directives and public safety considerations.
The CDCR did not respond to multiple requests for comment on why the Norco prison was chosen to be closed, the prison’s cost-per-inmate or the potential impact of convicts being held in county jails. 
Their Aug. 4 announcement that the CRC will close by fall 2026 cited projections of lower prison populations and the importance of cost savings. It did not specifically say why the Norco prison was chosen out of the 31 prisons currently operated by the state. A short description of the facility mentioned its origins as a luxury hotel and a Naval hospital.
“As someone who’s worked here at CRC for 15 years, we knew that CRC has this aura about it, that they feel this is some old naval base that has been converted in the 1950’s, and it’s been falling apart,” said Rohbock.
The old hotel, he said, isn’t part of the prison’s operations. The majority of buildings are modular, and maintained as part of the inmates’ rehabilitation programs, he said. As far as the cost, he said the prison is the fifth-most cost effective per inmate.
The letters also invited Bonta to visit the prison.
The Attorney General’s Office declined to comment on the letters. “We are seeking to compel much-needed, comprehensive reform to Los Angeles County jails through our lawsuit, and our complaint includes all we are able to share at this time,” they wrote.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/080912-CRC-Norco-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-17 08:57:16.214577

(Allison Joyce/Getty Images))A federal court heard arguments Tuesday in Alabama’s appeal of a 2024 ruling that blocked a portion of a state law criminalizing some forms of absentee ballot assistance.
SB 1, sponsored by Sen. Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman, made it a Class C felony, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, for a person to knowingly receive payment for “distributing, ordering, requesting, collecting, completing, prefilling, obtaining or delivering” an application. A person convicted of knowingly paying or providing a gift to a “third party to distribute, order, request, collect, prefill, complete, obtain or deliver” would be subject to a Class B felony, punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
U.S. District Judge R. David Proctor ruled last year that a portion of the law violated the federal Voting Rights Act, which allows blind, disabled and illiterate voters to choose a person to assist them with filling out a form.

Alexander Barrett Bowdre, representing the Alabama Attorney General’s office, said Tuesday the purpose of the law is to prevent voter fraud, not to prevent disabled voters from casting a ballot.
“Alabama’s SB 1 incorporates Section 208 of the Voting Rights Act, because both laws have the same overarching purpose, which is to protect vulnerable voters from experiencing manipulation, coercion or fraud during the voting process,” Bowdre told the three-judge panel.
The main question in the case is whether or not Alabama’s law preemptively contradicts the Voting Rights Act.
“We would argue that there is no preemption, because our law is not contradictory. It actually incorporates Section 208 and gives full effect to Section 208,” Bowdre said.
U.S. Circuit Judge Britt C. Grant questioned his argument and the difference between “knowingly” and “intentionally.”
“I guess I don’t understand your argument,” she said. “If the person is a paid health care worker or paid aid, whatever, and the only reason that they’re there, receiving the instruction from the person they’re helping, is to help that person in whatever capacity, including filling out their application for an absentee ballot. Why are they not, as a matter of fact, receiving payment for doing exactly what the statute prohibits?”
U.S. Circuit Judge Robin S. Rosenbaum said the law puts caretakers, who are paid to aid potentially disabled voters, from aiding them in voting.
“It says it from the point of view of the person with the disability, who is blind or who is illiterate, but be the helper, it exposes all of them to criminal liability, up to 20 years in prison if they knowingly accept money in exchange for helping the person,” Rosenbaum said.
Bowdre said Alabama law “does distinguish between knowingly and intentionally.” 
I don’t think that that makes a big difference here, because in the statute, the person would accept payment for distributing, ordering or requesting the ballot applications,” he said.
Anuja Thatte, representing the plaintiffs who initially challenged the law, said that since the law does not define “third party” and later prohibits “a person” from aiding a disabled person in filling out an absentee ballot or application, it creates uncertainty.
“I think part of it derives from going back to the statute of SB 1 itself, which doesn’t obviously define third party. And I think third party can be construed: Are you someone who’s sort of outside the voter-election official transaction?” Thatte said. “I think it’s all sort of vague, and I’m not sure that any of this turns on the usage of the word third party versus not.”
Section 208 of the Voting Rights Act protects the rights of disabled people to vote, with assistance if necessary, except for the voter’s employer or union representative. The 2024 Alabama law includes the text of Section 208, but does not provide explicit exemptions for disabled voters or their assistors. 
U.S. Circuit Judge Andrew L. Brasher questioned the way the law was written, saying it seemed like Sections E and F were put on the end of the law when lawmakers realized there are federally protected voters. Section E protects disabled voters and Section F protects voters that may vote via absentee ballot from overseas deployments.
“Why isn’t that at least a reading of this statute that is good enough that we should ask the Alabama Supreme Court if that’s the right way to read the statute?” Brasher asked.
Thatte advocated for a change in the statute that was not vague.
“To the extent there is a way to protect voters and assisters under (Section) E for any part of this statute, we certainly wouldn’t object to that, Your Honor,” Thatte said. “If there’s a way to read this statute to say voters who pay their assister, liable under Section 208, we certainly would also appreciate that.”

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)The Association of County Commissions of Alabama (ACCA) told members of the Montgomery County Commission Tuesday that the county could lose millions of dollars in revenue if the city of Tuscaloosa prevails in its lawsuit to challenge a state tax on Internet purchases.
The lawsuit, filed in August, alleges the taxing program violates the state constitution because individuals and private corporations do not have the power to levy taxes, which the plaintiffs claim the tax, known as the simplified sellers use tax (SSUT), allows them to do. The Tuscaloosa School District and city of Mountain Brook are also plaintiffs in the case.
The ACCA opposes the lawsuit, citing potential revenue losses by local communities.

“We think the simplified sellers use tax is well within the constitutional framework that the U.S. Supreme Court gave us in the (South Dakota v. )Wayfair case, and to make any changes puts the money at risk,” said Sonny Brasfield, executive director of the ACCA, in an interview after his presentation to the commission.
If the lawsuit succeeds, several local municipalities from the area could forfeit almost $200 million, according to a memo from the ACCA.
The Montgomery County Commission, for example, earned roughly $40 million from SSUT while the city received $85 million. Other areas such as Autauga County and cities, as well as Elmore County and municipalities received about $26 million and $28 million, respectively.
Tuscaloosa mayor Walt Maddox declined comment on Tuesday. On a page on its website, the city says the tax “poses a significant financial threat to Alabama communities by diverting tens of millions of locally generated tax dollars away from essential public services each year.”
“Without reform, SSUT will dramatically undermine funding for education, public safety, infrastructure, economic development and more,” the statement said.
Tuscaloosa officials allege in the lawsuit that the city will lose an estimated $14.6 million in the current fiscal year because of the difference that businesses pay to be included in the simplified sellers use tax program versus the local taxes they would have paid traditionally.
In the past, local taxing authorities such as municipalities could only collect sales or use taxes if the business was based within its taxing jurisdiction. However, the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair in 2018 allowed cities, counties and states to collect such taxes on internet purchases. About 75% of revenue from the SSUT goes to the state General Fund, and the money has helped stabilize what for years was a budget with annual shortfalls.
However, companies who are eligible for the SSUT program are exempt from collecting sales taxes and disbursing it through the state but could instead charge customers the SSUT tax rate at 8%, less than the combined 10% conventional state and local sales tax rate.
The Alabama Department of Revenue website states that companies are eligible to be part of the SSUT program if they conduct business with Alabama from a location beyond the state’s borders.
Lawmakers amended the program in 2017 to allow companies to be eligible unless they have a storefront or an affiliation with another business in Alabama. The plaintiffs in the case allege that the program violates the constitution because the program allows private businesses to opt into the program and gives them the power to decide whether to participate in a tax regulation, a power that the state constitution only gives to the government.
The plaintiffs also allege in the lawsuit that companies who are part of the program are not eligible to participate because only those whose companies are based outside the state can be part of SSUT. The lawsuit cited companies such as Kroger and Target have storefronts in Alabama and should not be eligible to pay the lower tax rate made available because of the SSUT.
This should include Amazon, the lawsuit argues, because even though the company does not have retail presence in Alabama, it operates warehouses in the state.
“The commissioner has therefore exceeded his statutory authority, and has acted in a manner contrary to law, in qualifying such entities for SSUT Program participation, and has failed to fulfill his statutory duty to disqualify these merchants as being ineligible to participate in the SSUT Program,” the lawsuit states.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250916_095534-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-17 08:57:16.214577

But two years ago, after the company had offered traditional insurance coverage for a couple of years, premiums were going to become unaffordable. The Kansas City small business, which only has five employees — including Hewett-Mader and her husband — had to find a different option.
“We had to make a decision at that point,” Hewett-Mader said.
It’s a familiar story for business owners. Large and small businesses alike have been scrambling to absorb rising insurance costs for years, and the 2026 increases are promising to be even worse.

According to Mercer, the global consulting firm, benefit costs per employee for large firms are expected to increase an average 6.5% in 2026, the largest jump in 15 years. And that’s only if businesses take “cost-reduction measures.” If they don’t, Mercer said, plan costs would go up almost 9% on average.
For small groups — businesses with fewer than 50 employees — the increases could be far steeper.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City has requested an average increase next year of 19% for its small-group plans that are regulated by the state of Missouri. Other insurers in the state’s small-group market have requested rate increases of 10% to 13%.
Rick Welsch, an insurance broker in Fairway, said he has already broken the news to clients that rates will be going up “dramatically.” And other insurance brokers in the area said they’re seeing a similar trend.
“I was a little blown away,” Welsch said.
 Business owners ‘hope it’s not awful’

Now business owners may be left deciding how to absorb significant cost increases.
For Alma Mader Brewing, the answer to continuing health benefits was to switch from a traditional insurance plan to a self-funded plan. That means the business pays into a pool of money that covers claims.
The change came with more paperwork and bigger copays for employees. The business also takes on more risk. If claims are higher one year, premiums will increase the next to compensate, which makes Hewett-Mader nervous.
She found out that next year the business will see a 13% jump because claims this year ran higher. But even that rate is doable, unlike the traditional coverage, so employees will keep their health insurance.
“‘It would be really hard to offer it and take it away,” she said.
Karen Crnkovich, owner of DMC Service Inc., a commercial heating and cooling company in Olathe, said she spends hours every year trying to find a plan her company can afford that still provides good coverage for the 23 employees who are insured.
“We hold our breath and cross our fingers and hope it’s not awful,” she said.
Last year she saved $20,000 by moving to an individual coverage health reimbursement arrangement, known as an ICHRA plan. That gave employees a tax-free allowance to buy an individual plan on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. But the model proved to be “too burdensome.” That and expected increases in the cost of marketplace plans next year made Crnkovich rethink that switch. She’s moving back to a self-funded plan.
“Every year we’ve got to look at it,” she said.
Employers face a lot of pressure trying to maintain benefits when costs continue to rise, business owners said.
“It’s kind of like, ‘How can you provide all the benefits and still be above water?’” said Ariel Johnston, who owns The Tasty Balance, a dietitian practice with offices in Prairie Village and St. Louis.
Johnston said the rates for her nine-person company will stay flat next year, but many employers won’t be so lucky.
Businesses confronting surging premiums may look for cost-saving options like adopting a self-funded model, like Alma Mader did. They may offer plans with narrower networks of doctors and hospitals in an effort to steer people to less-expensive providers, or force employees to pay more for going to a doctor not on a plan’s preferred list. Employers might also choose plans that limit what drugs are covered.
In addition, there is growing recognition that health plans that emphasize preventive care and behavioral health care will pay off in a healthier workforce and, eventually, lower premium costs. Johnston said many people don’t realize that dietitian services, like the ones her business offers, are fully covered by most insurance plans.
But to cover bigger premiums next year, many employers will also likely ask employees to pay more for their insurance.
Almost 60% of large employers Mercer surveyed said they would make cost-cutting changes, which generally means choosing plans with higher deductibles and bigger copays next year, adding to employees’ out-of-pocket costs.
 Who will pay?

KFF research found that nearly half of adults are already struggling to afford health care, more than one in three report skipping or postponing care and almost one in four said they have medical or dental bills that are past due that they can’t pay.
One in five people surveyed by KFF said they are paying off debt to a provider, 17% owe a bank or collection agency, 17% have put medical bills on a credit card and 10% said they owe family members.
Additional health insurance increases would compound the problem, consumer advocates said, and add strain when people are already dealing with increased prices for other basic needs.
“We see rising utility rates and rent going up and now health care,” said Mary Shannon of the Consumers Council of Missouri. “It reflects a broader trend of consumer costs increasing.”
Frank Lenk, an economist with the Mid-America Regional Council, said that there will be economic consequences of rising medical costs. When people have to spend more on health care, already a sizable chunk of most household budgets, they’ll have less money to spend on other things, like local stores and restaurants.
“It will be happening when belts already seem to be tightening and the economy seems to be slowing down,” Lenk said.
The changes could also have longer-term consequences, he said. When people have to pay more for the doctor or to fill a prescription, they may be less likely to seek care, which could lead to a less healthy workforce.
“Businesses may save money on the one hand,” Lenk said, “but they may see loss of productivity on the other. It comes down to — there’s no free lunch.”
Employer-sponsored health insurance is the primary source of health coverage in this country.



According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 92% of people had health insurance for at least part of the year during 2024. Employment-based insurance covered 53.8% of that population, down from almost 67% in 1998. Medicare covered 19.1%, Medicaid covered 17.6%, and 10.7% of people were covered by plans they purchased directly, including through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.
Insurance premiums on employer plans have been trending up for years. The national average annual premium per employee enrolled in an employer-based plan was $5,963 in 2015, and jumped to $8.486 in 2024. In the same period Missouri’s average rates went from $5,726 to $8,552, and Kansas’ went from $5,558 to $7,874.
During that time, employers picked up between 75% and 79% of that premium cost. But employee costs still increased, both because the overall premium went up and because out-of-pocket costs climbed.
 Why is insurance going up?

Insurance companies give many reasons for increasing premiums. But the two main factors are the price of health care is going up and more people are using their health benefits, which means insurance companies have to pay more.
Medical costs are set to grow 8.5% in 2026, according to a study by the consulting firm PwC, also known as PricewaterhouseCoopers. That’s the same rate as the last two years, but substantially greater than 2022 when the growth rate was 5.5%.
That slower growth reflected lower medical use during the pandemic, which is also one of the factors driving increased costs now, analysts said.
During the COVID pandemic, people put off doctor visits and routine care. That meant fewer claims being sent to insurance companies. It also caused a backlog of medical visits and procedures and led to growth in serious conditions that are more expensive to treat.
More expensive drugs are also adding to insurers’ costs. PwC said drug spending grew by $50 billion to $487 billion in 2024. GLP-1s, drugs that regulate blood sugar and help people lose weight, were a significant driver of the increase, leading some insurance companies to look at reining in who can get coverage for the drugs and for what conditions.
Insurers are also having to pay hospitals and doctors more, another reason for increased premiums. Analysts said several factors have caused that:

Labor shortages in the medical field have forced hospitals and physician practices to pay higher salaries.
Artificial intelligence, which is helping providers bill for services more efficiently, has prompted providers to track, and bill for, more services.
And hospital system mergers, along with other provider consolidation, have helped providers negotiate higher reimbursement rates from insurers.

But one of the biggest reasons insurers may see higher costs starting in 2026 involves policy decisions coming out of the Trump administration, said Sara R. Collins, a senior scholar who studies health care for the Commonwealth Fund.
“We’re on the brink of some major changes,” she said.
Congress has cut about $1 trillion from federal Medicaid spending and made changes to the Affordable Care Act marketplace, and is expected to allow enhanced tax credits to expire at the end of the year. Those tax credits help more than 90% of participants afford coverage and have helped marketplace enrollment to double since 2021.
All told, those policy changes are expected to result in 17 million people becoming uninsured, which will lead to more people needing free care. And that will drive higher costs for everyone else.
Beyond that, Collins said, President Donald Trump’s tariffs could lead to higher drug costs, which will also increase insurance costs.
All the federal policy changes “will reverberate through the rest of the insurance system,” Collins said. “Those are potential cost drivers on the hospital side and on the provider side.”
 Trend toward self-funded insurance

Health industry analysts said the rising costs are driving changes in the insurance marketplace, which could also contribute to higher premiums.
Derek Skoog, a health care actuary with PwC, said businesses facing big premium spikes are increasingly moving to self-funded insurance models.
This means that rather than paying an insurance company a monthly fee to cover all employee health claims, they set aside a pool of money and pay those claims themselves. If the business has employees who are young, healthy and low-risk, it may be a good bet that paying claims outright will cost less than paying an insurance premium.
The increased number of companies shifting to this self-funded model has been quietly diluting the risk pool for traditional insurance plans, known as fully insured plans, Skoog said. That means fewer premium dollars to cover the actual cost of claims. And potentially more expensive patients to cover.
Skoog said industry analysts had been wondering when that shift to self-funded plans would catch up to the fully insured segment of the market. And it seems to be happening. His firm’s analysis found that underwriting margins in the fully insured segment — basically an insurance company’s profits once claims have been paid — dropped to zero this year.
And that could also be a factor pushing insurance companies to raise rates in 2026, he said.
“The billion-dollar question here is,” Skoog said, “does that then further accelerate … the conversion from fully insured to self-funded?”
He called it a “pretty big concern” if healthier-than-average groups continue to leave the fully insured market.
“The long-term viability of that fully insured group segment, if it starts to run away, that can become a real challenge,” Skoog said.
Centivo, a New York-based company just entering the Kansas City market, is betting that more companies will take the leap to self-funded insurance as premiums for traditional plans climb.
The firm administers self-funded plans for businesses, which includes making deals with hospitals and doctors’ practices to get fixed rates for services. Centivo also works with “transparent pharmacy benefit managers” in an effort to lower the cost of medicine. And the company emphasizes preventive care.
Every Centivo patient is required to have a primary care physician and they pay nothing out of pocket for primary care services as long as they’re in the company’s network. The idea is that treating health problems earlier will help avoid serious issues and keep care costs down for the employers paying the bills.
“If you give them access to care,” said Ryan Moore, Centivo’s chief revenue officer, “all the data … show you’re going to have a lower cost of care in the long run.”
But that model might not hold up over time, said Collins of the Commonwealth Fund.
“Those employers that self-fund end up, as their workforce ages or they have workers who develop health problems, (needing) to come back into the fully insured market,” Collins said.
And that adds to the problem of care costing more and premiums going up, she said.

Last week the Missouri Senate rammed two monumental and controversial bills through without allowing an opportunity for any real deliberation. No amendments were allowed from either party in committee or in the chamber, and for changes to the initiative petition process, not a single minute of discussion or debate was allowed on the Senate floor.
Normal rules were suspended, and it was made clear by Republican leadership that party members had better toe the line. One of only two senators to buck the party line was punished immediately after he voted no.
That all happened in the Second Extraordinary Session of 2025.
Missouri lawmakers pass gerrymandered congressional map, initiative petition limits

Before that, Gov. Mike Kehoe called the legislature together in June to pass legislation that would provide public subsidies to build privately owned facilities (e.g. headquarters and training facilities) for the Kansas City Chiefs and Royals, in spite of constitutional prohibitions of a “grant of public money” to “any private person, association or corporation.”
Sen. Mike Moon, Rep. Bryant Wolfin, and myself are suing to get that bill struck down by the courts. (See: Moon v. State, case number 25AC-CC05910)
That subsidy bill may cost Missouri taxpayers over a billion dollars if the courts let it stand.
That’s a lot of money, but it pales in comparison to what the politicians are attempting to do with the second “extraordinary session” the governor called in September. The second session is an attempt to grow government and party power like never before in Missouri history.
The two pieces of legislation would concentrate power in the hands of a ruling class in total contradiction to founding principles.
Understand this: men like Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, George Washington, Patrick Henry and Thomas Paine disdained oligarchy. The war they fought was against the oligarchical rule of King George and a parliament that was unconstrained by a written constitution. Through policies of mercantilism (we call it crony capitalism or corporatism today) the “favorites” of the king were granted largess at the expense of the Peoples’ lives and liberty.
Yes, much like subsidies for private sports franchises.
The Founders’ solution to oligarchy was a Constitutional Republic in which “all political power is vested in and derived from the people” (Mo. Cont. Art. I Sec. 1) and government that exists at the “consent of the governed.”
The hallmark of the Founders’ vision is a system that prevents the concentration of political power. Separate jurisdictions for federal and state government, three distinct branches of government and a bicameral legislature, distributed power, and constitutionally proscribed “checks” on power were designed to prevent oligarchy.
The people, themselves, also had a “check” — they could “vote the bums out” if they saw public officials abusing power.
By the turn of the 20th Century, the people in about half the states decided that voting was not an adequate check on government power. Like today, the party machines and big money interests could “buy” elections. So the people of those states amended their constitutions to allow themselves, independent of the government, to repeal laws they thought were oppressive by referendum, or to build taller fences around the power of government with constitutional amendments proposed by initiative petition.
The legislation weakening the initiative petition process effectively takes that “check” away from the people of Missouri. It virtually guts the initiative petition “check” on government power.
It makes it virtually impossible for citizen proposed amendments to be approved, but allows the legislature, which is unduly influenced by contract lobbyists and deep pocket special interests, to propose amendments that can be approved with support from just the urban centers of the state, leaving most of rural Missouri with little voice.
In the same “extraordinary session” our esteemed “representatives” in Jefferson City passed a gerrymandered congressional district map that, I believe, was without constitutional authority. The new map effectively disenfranchises both urban and rural voters by lumping in Kansas City and a swath of rural counties as far east as Maries County, north of Rolla.
That map does not result in districts that are “as compact… as may be” as required by Article III Section 45 of the Missouri Constitution.
Like the gutting of the initiative petition process, the gerrymandered map is designed to be oligarchical concentration of power in the hands of the current ruling class. That happens to be Republicans now, buy rest assured, Democrats are taking notes and will do the same once they are in power again.
Missouri politicians have once again proven Lord Action’s maxim: “Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/20230307_134403-scaled-e1715095565131-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-17 07:58:12.168224

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The state of Indiana wants Hoosier employers to train and promote current employees — and it’s willing to pay.
Leaders unveiled Power Up Indiana, an upskilling reimbursement initiative, at a Tuesday news conference.
“Growth doesn’t have to come from somewhere else. It’s already here, inside the businesses here in Indiana,” Commerce Secretary David Adams said. “Your next supervisor, your next innovator, that next leader — they’re probably already working in your business. What they need is a chance to be developed, trained and advanced.”
“That’s why we built Power Up Indiana,” he continued. “It’s not just another incentive program, but a long-term growth strategy for all Hoosiers.”
Businesses can earn reimbursement of $5,000 per employee trained — and up to $50,000 annually — if they meet training and pay requirements. Adams told reporters that $10 million was available for training incentives.
Eligible upskilling includes technical training resulting in industry-recognized credentials, cross-training or reskilling, leadership development, or registered apprenticeships, according to the program manual. Worker pay must rise by at least 25% once training is completed, and exceed the region’s median wages.
“Because we’re placing the emphasis on higher wages, this program will pay dividends throughout our economy,” Gov. Mike Braun said.

Firms of all types and sizes can join as long as they’re located in Indiana, are registered with the secretary of state’s office and have a current unemployment tax account. They can seek reimbursement for employees who’ve undergone training since the beginning of this year.
Businesses can submit an online interest form, then develop and submit a training plan with job descriptions and salary ranges.
Once the plan is approved, prospective participants sign grant and training agreements. They’ll track certain information and submit invoices.
The state will oversee and monitor the program, plus disburse funds to local workforce development boards, according to the manual. Those regional bodies will manage and implement the program, including deciding whether employees meet the requirements and qualify for reimbursement.
Indiana has other upskilling incentive efforts, like the Employer Training Grant program. That program is run out of the Commerce Office vertical, via the Department of Workforce Development, just like Power Up Indiana.
The previous program was limited to certain industries and required lower wages and raises. It’s unclear if or when it will be phased out.
“Everything we’ve tried in the past didn’t quite get there,” Braun told reporters. “This is a new approach.”

Leaders highlighted a two-year rotation program at Keystone Cooperative, an Indianapolis-based agribusiness. It’s called Securing Experience and Employee Development, or SEED.
Twenty-year-old Brent Harvey was part of the company’s inaugural SEED class in 2024.
“I’ve had the opportunity to admit when I made a mistake, take credit when I’ve done something well, and work collaboratively with a team,” he said.
Though he began focused on agronomy, Harvey has since earned a commercial driver’s license and discovered unexpected interests in energy and sales. Soon, he’ll complete SEED and start an apprenticeship with the company.
He described having the space, “with my team, my mentors and leaders, to find a place for a career at Keystone close to home, and I’m excited to see what the next few months have in store.”

Kennedy Jr., is expected to vote to delay the hepatitis B shot for newborns.

A key federal vaccine advisory panel whose members were recently replaced by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to vote to recommend delaying until age 4 the hepatitis B vaccine that’s currently given to newborns, according to two former senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials.
“There is going to likely be a discussion about hepatitis B vaccine, very specifically trying to dislodge the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and to push it later in life,” said Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “Apparently this is a priority of the secretary’s.”
The vote is expected to take place during the next meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, scheduled for Sept. 18-19.
For more than 30 years, the first of three shots of hepatitis B vaccine has been recommended for infants shortly after birth. In that time, the potentially fatal disease has been virtually eradicated among American children. Pediatricians warn that waiting four years for the vaccine opens the door to more children contracting the virus.
“Age 4 makes zero sense,” pediatrician Eric Ball said. “We recommend a universal approach to prevent those cases where a test might be incorrect or a mother might have unknowingly contracted hepatitis. It’s really the best way to keep our entire population healthy.”
In addition to the hepatitis B vaccine, the panel will also discuss and vote on recommendations for the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine and covid-19 vaccines. Pediatricians worry changes to the schedules of these vaccines will limit access for many families, leaving them vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases.
Typically, ACIP would undertake an analysis of the data before recommending a change to vaccine guidelines. As of the end of August, this process had not begun for the hepatitis B vaccines, Daskalakis and another former official said.
“This is an atypical situation. There’s been no work group to discuss it,” Daskalakis said.
The second former senior official spoke to NPR and KFF Health News on the condition of anonymity.
In response to questions from KFF Health News, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon wrote, “ACIP exists to ensure that vaccine policy is guided by the best available evidence and open scientific deliberation. Any updates to recommendations will be made transparently with gold standard science.”
The draft agenda for the upcoming ACIP meeting was released to the public less than a week before it is scheduled to begin.
At the last ACIP meeting, in June, Martin Kulldorff, the chair and one of seven new members handpicked by Kennedy, questioned the need to vaccinate every newborn, citing only two of the many ways the virus can spread. Kulldorff is a former Harvard Medical School professor who became known for opposing some public health measures during the pandemic.
“Unless the mother is hepatitis B positive, an argument could be made to delay the vaccine for this infection, which is primarily spread by sexual activity and intravenous drug use,” he said.
The virus spreads via direct exposure to an infected bodily fluid like blood or semen. The disease has no cure and can lead to serious conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer later in life. The CDC advisory panel may maintain the recommendation to inoculate newborns whose mothers have hepatitis B or are considered at high risk of the disease, the former officials said.
Protection from birth
In 1991, federal health officials determined it was advisable for newborns to receive their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth, which blocks the virus from taking hold if transmitted during delivery. While parents may opt out of the shots, many day care centers and school districts require proof of hepatitis B vaccination for enrollment.
The prospect of ACIP’s altering the recommendation has left some people living with the virus deeply unsettled.
“I am goddamn frustrated,” said Wendy Lo, who has lived with the liver disease, likely since birth. Years of navigating the psychological, monetary, medical, and social aspects of chronic hepatitis B has touched almost every aspect of her life.
“I would not want anyone to have to experience that if it can be prevented,” she said. Lo learned she had the disease due to a routine screening to study abroad in college.
Lo credits the vaccines with protecting her close family members from infection.
“I shared with my partner, ‘If you get vaccinated, we can be together,’” she said. He got the vaccine, which protects him from infection, “so I’m grateful for that,” she said.
The CDC estimates half of people with hepatitis B do not know they are infected. It can range from an acute, mild infection to a chronic infection, often with few to no symptoms. Most people with chronic hepatitis B were born outside of the U.S., and Asians and Pacific Islanders followed by Black people have the highest rates of newly reported chronic infections.
When her children were born, Lo was adamant that they receive the newborn dose, a decision she says prevented them from contracting the virus.
The earlier an infection occurs, the worse the consequences, according to the CDC. When contracted in infancy or early childhood, hepatitis B is far more likely to become a chronic infection, silently damaging the liver over decades.
Those who become chronic carriers can also unknowingly spread the virus to others and face an increased risk of long-term complications including cirrhosis and liver cancer, which may not become evident until much later in life.
“Now I’m in my 50s, one of my big concerns is liver cancer. The vaccine is safe and effective, it’s lifesaving, and it protects you against cancer. How many vaccines do that?” Lo said.
Thirty Years of Universal Vaccination
Treatments like the antivirals Lo now takes weren’t available until the 1990s. Decades of the virus’s replicating unchecked damaged her liver. Every six months she gets scared of what her blood tests may reveal.

After a vaccine was approved in the 1980s, public health officials initially focused vaccination efforts on people thought to be at highest risk of infection.
“I, and every other doctor, had been trained in medical school to think of hepatitis B as an infection you acquired as an adult. It was the pimps, the prostitutes, the prisoners, and the health care practitioners who got hepatitis B infection. But we’ve learned so much more,” said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and a former voting member of ACIP.
As hepatitis B rates remained stubbornly high in the 1980s, scientists realized an entire vulnerable group was missing from the vaccination regime — newborns. The virus is often transmitted from an infected mother to baby in late pregnancy or during birth.
“We may soon hear, ‘Let’s just do a blood test on all pregnant women.’ We tried that. That doesn’t work perfectly either,” Schaffner said.
Some doctors didn’t test, he said, and some pregnant women falsely tested negative while others acquired hepatitis B after they had been tested earlier in their pregnancies.
In 1991, Schaffner was a liaison representative to ACIP when it voted to advise universal vaccination for hepatitis B before an infant leaves the hospital.
“We want no babies infected. Therefore, we’ll just vaccinate every mom and every baby at birth. Problem solved. It has been brilliantly successful in virtually eliminating hepatitis B in children,” he said.
In 1990, there were 3.03 cases of hepatitis B per 100,000 people 19 years old or under in the U.S., according to the CDC.
Since the federal recommendation to vaccinate all infants, cases have dramatically decreased. CDC data shows that in 2022 the rate among those 19 or under was less than 0.1 per 100,000.
While hepatitis B is often associated with high-risk behaviors such as injection drug use or having multiple sexual partners, health experts note that it is possible for the virus to be transmitted in ordinary situations too, including among young children.
The virus can survive for up to seven days outside the body. During that time, even microscopic traces of infected blood on a school desk or playground equipment can pose a risk. If the virus comes into contact with an open wound or the mucous membranes of the eyes, an infection can occur. This means that unvaccinated children not considered at high risk can still be exposed in everyday environments.
Future access uncertain
If the CDC significantly alters its recommendation, health insurers would no longer be required to cover the cost of the shots. That could leave parents to pay out-of-pocket for a vaccine that has long been provided at no charge. Children who get immunizations through the federal Vaccines for Children program would lose free access to the shot as soon as any new ACIP recommendations get approved by the acting CDC director.
The two former CDC officials said that plans were underway to push back the official recommendation for the vaccine as of August, when they both left the agency, but may have changed.
Schaffner is still an alternate liaison member of ACIP, and hopes to express his support for universal newborn vaccination at the next meeting.
“The liaisons have now been excluded from the vaccine work groups. They are still permitted to attend the full meetings,” he said.
Schaffner is worried about the next generation of babies and the doctors who care for them.
“We’ll see cases of hepatitis B once again occur. We’ll see transmission into the next generation,” he said, “and the next generation of people who wear white coats will have to deal with hepatitis B, when we could have cut it off at the pass.”

I work as a doctor in St. Joseph, Michigan. The work is fulfilling yet all-consuming, and I once saw politics as a distraction from what matters most — patient care. But the political decisions being made directly affect my ability to provide that care.
The “Big Beautiful Bill,” passed over two months ago, represents the largest cut to Medicaid in American history and one of the largest to Medicare, and its repercussions are just beginning to surface.
This bill will deteriorate our health care system for every Michigander. Physicians anticipate longer hospital wait times and extended stays for Medicare patients. Projections suggest that one in four skilled nursing facilities will close, significantly reducing discharge options for our patients. After a hospital stay, many patients are too weak for a safe discharge home.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
With fewer skilled nursing placements available, these patients will remain in hospital beds — not sick enough for acute care, but too weak to go home. The longer they stay, the greater their risk of deconditioning and developing hospital-acquired infections. This will also lead to prolonged ER waits for new admissions.
Beyond hospitals, every person who needs to see a doctor or fill a prescription will be affected.
This January, insurance premiums are projected to rise by about 20% for the same coverage, and the Affordable Care Act’s premium tax credits, which kept health care affordable for hundreds of thousands of Michiganders, were not renewed in this bill. The fallout is that premiums are going up, choices are going down, and many families will be forced to continue to choose between groceries, rent, and health care.
I want to invite our Congressman, Mr. Huizinga, who voted for this, to shadow a doctor in our district for one day.
Come alongside us and hold the hand of an elderly patient who is panicking because her family member will now be homeless with no affordable housing after her long-term care facility closed. Come with me to tell a patient that they will need to stay hospitalized indefinitely because there are no discharge facilities with available beds due to these cuts. Admit a patient with me and tell them they will need to stay in the Emergency Department for days because the rooms upstairs are taken.
Then take this experience to D.C. to craft legislation that works for these folks, not just for the special interests that benefit from this disastrous bill.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Medicaid-cuts-nurse.jpg,,,2025-09-17 07:58:12.168224

(Still image from Minnesota Senate Media Services live stream)Editor’s note: The following is the testimony of an emergency physician given Monday to the Minnesota Senate Working Group on Gun Violence Prevention. 
My name is Dr. Tim Kummer, I’m an assistant medical director of Hennepin EMS and an emergency physician at Hennepin Healthcare. 
I was the first physician on scene at the Annunciation school shooting. When I arrived, I joined our paramedics in assessing children who had been shot in the back, in the arms, in the head. As we took in the immense pain and fear in those children’s eyes, we tried to comfort them as they were rushed to the hospital. 
Once all critical patients had been transported, our focus shifted to the children who said they were uninjured, despite having blood on their clothes. We had to confirm that the blood on them was not from their own wounds, but from the classmates they had tried to shield. 
At the same time, we began the reunification process, matching parents to their children, which included the painful task of telling some parents their child had been shot and was at the hospital. Finally, we carried out the devastating task of telling parents their child had been killed while singing in church during the first week of school.
I’ve seen many difficult things in my career, but what I witnessed that morning was unlike anything else. I saw the horror in the eyes of innocent children, the fear of parents desperate to know if their child was alive, and I heard the screams of mothers and fathers when they were told their child had been murdered. 
I still see those faces when I close my eyes and I hear their voices when I try to go to sleep. 
But gun violence is nothing new to our communities. The Black and brown communities we serve have lived with this painful reality for decades. It angers me that it took a church full of children for us to gather here today. And yet, even now, you debate if you should act. I don’t know if or what I could have done differently that day, but I do know this: The level of chaos and the depth of suffering was because of the type of weapon used.
At Annunciation, the shooter fired more than 100 rounds with a high-powered rifle. That is why there were so many victims. That is why the injuries were so severe. The type of gun matters. 
At Annunciation I cared for a 12-year-old girl who had what looked like a very small graze wound to the top of her head – an abrasion, nothing else. But despite that bullet never entering her brain, the energy from the rifle was so powerful it caused severe bleeding in her brain, and she had to have part of her skull removed. 
From a handgun, that wound would likely have only been a graze wound, but from a high-powered rifle, it became a life-threatening brain injury. 
Assault rifles turn survivable injuries into fatal ones. They turn small tragedies into mass tragedies. 
I know some will say that most gun violence involves handguns, not high powered rifles, and that might be true, but in an event like Annunciation, the rifle made everything worse. It turned potentially minor wounds into life-threatening ones. It multiplied the number of children shot, and it amplified the trauma for families, for first responders, and for health care providers. 
I am not a gun expert, but I am an expert in the aftermath. The suffering these weapons inflict and the PTSD they leave with my colleagues and me. I see firsthand how the type of gun determines the destruction. Not banning these weapons compounds our suffering. 
For victims, for families, for first responders, and for health care providers, your inaction is not neutral. Your inaction is acceptance. You have the power to save lives and to decrease suffering. 
Please take meaningful action and swift action to limit access to weapons designed for maximum and permanent damage to life. Thank you.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-16-at-12.13.14 PM-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-17 07:58:12.168224

NJ Transit reported 634 cancellations due to mechanical issues over the three-month period, the highest number under any year since Murphy took office in 2018. This summer, they rose for the third consecutive year.
There was also a spike in cancellations due to equipment availability. At 288, those cancellations also rose to a record high under Murphy, jumping to nearly six times the level seen between June and August last year.
Cancellations due to equipment availability have been that high only during a single summer during Murphy’s two terms as governor. In 2018, 265 trains were canceled due to a lack of available equipment.
“What is happening right now is an inevitable result of years of underfunding of New Jersey Transit,” said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective, a left-leaning think-tank that has advocated for more robust state funding of NJ Transit.

The agency is in the process of replacing its aging train fleet. Some of the 374 new train cars the agency has ordered are due to be put into service by mid-2026, said Jim Smith, a spokesperson for the agency.
“The new cars, which include 58 self-propelled power cars, will significantly enhance service reliability … replacing the oldest and least reliable rail cars in the fleet, the 50+ year-old Arrow III cars, which are increasingly more difficult to maintain due to their advanced age and the subsequent difficulty in sourcing parts,” Smith said.
The new cars will have a mean distance between failures — a metric used to measure the reliability of rail equipment — of roughly 400,000 miles, Smith said. The mean distance between failures for July, the latest month on record, was 47,747 miles, the lowest level seen under Murphy.
The new cars are set to give NJ Transit a fully modernized fleet by 2031, Smith said.
The prospect of new equipment next year could prove cold comfort to riders facing disruptions today, said Ambrose.
“What they care about is that their form of transit is there on time and gets them where they need to go, and riders have not had that experience,” she said.
Amtrak-related cancellations, the leading source of train cancellations last summer, fell precipitously this year. NJ Transit leases tracks and related infrastructure from the quasi-public corporation for some of its rail lines, including the northeast corridor, the nation’s busiest commuter rail line.
Issues with Amtrak infrastructure caused just 38 train cancellations this summer, down from 527 in 2024. Smith credited Amtrak for extensive infrastructure upgrades along the lines leased by the state agency, noting Amtrak had repaired or replaced roughly 10,000 components along 240 miles of overhead wires that transmit power to trains.
Catenary wire systems were a major source of weather-related disruptions last year. Those wires can stretch and sag in extreme heat, leading to electrical failures.
“It’s clear Amtrak has prioritized the rider experience based on this and has made significant improvements where NJ Transit is still struggling,” Ambrose said.
Despite the improvements, Smith said Amtrak infrastructure continued to be a source of train delays, even if cancellations due to the corporation’s infrastructure had fallen drastically. Between June and August, 88.2% of trains arrived within 6 minutes of their scheduled arrival time. With Amtrak delays excluded, 91.2% of trains were on time.

Engineer shortage
Crew-related issues resurged as a major source of cancellations this year after falling close to zero in 2024 and 2023. A lack of available crew or engineers canceled 259 trains between June and August, up from 10 the year before and one in 2023.
A shortage of locomotive engineers was the single-largest source of NJ Transit train cancellations in the first three years of Murphy’s tenure. In each of those years, a lack of workers was responsible for cancelling more than 500 trains. In 2019, the 541 crew-related cancellations accounted for just over half of the 1,081 trains canceled that summer.
This summer’s rise in crew-related cancellations came after NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, the train engineers union, finally settled a yearslong contract dispute that led to a three-day strike by the engineers in mid-May.
That dispute was resolved before the start of June. Two-thirds of crew-related cancellations occurred in August.
NJ Transit said it still employs more than a full complement of locomotive engineers, but had experienced an uptick in unplanned engineer absences this summer.
“There were 284 unplanned engineer absences in July 2024. In July 2025, there were 484 unplanned engineer absences — that is a 70% increase,” Smith said, adding that unplanned absences in the first 18 days of this August exceeded the total unplanned absences in August 2024.
The agency on Aug. 22 sent the union a letter that directed union officials to tell their members to halt the unplanned absences, Smith said.
Tom Haas, general chairman for the NJ Transit union, said he passed the message along to his members, adding that engineers’ work hours and days increased as some went on vacation, in some cases triggering federal regulations that limit the consecutive hours and days railway engineers can work.
“When engineers are being used to work six and sometimes seven days a week, you get into situations where federal regulations require we be off for one or even two days at a time,” he said.
Those regulations could trigger unplanned absences, and such absences had sometimes been included in previous counts, Haas said, though he was unsure if the agency tallied them in this summer’s figures.
Other federal requirements that mandate engineers are familiar with the characteristics of individual rail lines — speed limits and station and signal locations, for example — also limited worker availability, Haas said.
“An individual engineer may only be qualified on, say, three or four or five of those lines, so if there’s a vacancy on another line, even if there’s an engineer who’s not working that day, he can’t be used to operate a train on that line because he’s not qualified,” Haas said.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Local bans on wind, solar and other energy projects are giving Indiana a bad reputation, Indiana’s top energy official said Tuesday. She plans to reward those open for business.
“These local moratoriums are setting our energy policy,” said Energy and Natural Resources Secretary Suzanne Jaworowski said. “And not only that, it’s creating a reputation … where industry doesn’t want to come.”
She spoke at the Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute’s annual luncheon.
Jaworowski knocked communities that “string” companies along for months or years, costing them significant sums of money for development work, before rejecting their projects.
“That’s disgraceful. Personally, I think that those companies should start suing those communities and get serious about it,” she said.
Indiana lacks a statewide siting statute. Jaworowski said she’s taking action “until the Legislature can do something about it.”
Indiana Needs Affordable, Reliable, Renewable Energy to Attract the 21st Century Gold Rush

She described collaborating with the Indiana Economic Development Corp. on a map of local governments that have signed resolutions proclaiming their willingness to host energy or industrial developments. Communities can still include specific installation types they don’t want, Jaworowski said.
“We’ll court all these industries,” she told the room.
“We’re putting out a carrot and saying, … sites that want to be open to what the federal government (and) what the president is saying — that we need AI data centers, and we need energy development — we’re creating our own little group and incentivizing that,” she said.
“We feel like this is part of America250,” Jaworowski continued, referring to President Donald Trump’s semiquincentennial initiative. “If you’re a patriotic community, and you want to stand up and show some unity, show some support for what the country needs to do right now, this is Indiana’s way of showing that.”
She said the state will include a “siting center” at its Global Nuclear Energy Economic Summit in November, held with Purdue University. It’ll promote the local governments that have signed resolutions and been pre-evaluated for hosting small modular nuclear reactors.
Jaworowski further dismissed “misinformation” about Indiana’s supply of energy and natural resources.
“Indiana has plenty of energy now. We will have plenty of energy in the future, and the same is true for water,” she said. “… Our utilities are poised to serve. They are working together with all these large load demands. They will grow together.”
To “anti-folks” blaming rising electricity costs on data centers and nuclear reactor projects, Jaworowski noted that the state doesn’t “have any mega data centers” or active nuclear.
She pointed instead to coal-powered plant closures, inflation, and a resurgence in manufacturing.

Designation could be lifted from parts of the Winds, Bighorns, Absarokas and more. The public has until Friday to comment on the rescission of the land management rule. 
The post Roadless Rule change could harm Wyoming climbing crags, advocates say appeared first on WyoFile .","Climbing advocates are urging the public to oppose the proposed rollback of the Roadless Rule, which could open up prized Wyoming climbing zones such as the Wind River Range and Tensleep Canyon to activities like roadbuilding and timber harvesting.
The rescission of the federal rule, said Access Fund Policy Analyst Katie Goodwin, would leave tens of millions of national forest acres across the U.S. susceptible to the kind of activity “that could impact the very qualities that draw people to these places.” 
Qualities like wildness, serenity and solitude, she said. 
In Wyoming, the proposed repeal would impact the management of 3.26 million acres. Those areas range from swaths of the Bridger-Teton National Forest and Bighorn National Forest to smaller tracts near the Flaming Gorge Reservoir and Medicine-Bow National Forest. It would encompass areas popular for outdoor recreation like climbing. 
For climbers, according to the Access Fund, the proposed rescission is “another attack on the lands we love.”
A comment period on the USDA Forest Service proposal to develop an environmental impact statement for the change closes Friday night. As of Tuesday, more than 1 million comments had poured in. 
The rule has been challenged before, and the latest push is driven largely by President Donald Trump’s executive order aimed at eliminating excessive regulations. 
While conservation and outdoor groups criticize the move, proponents say the rescission is necessary for the common-sense management of forests in a new reality of wildfire risk. 
“For nearly 25 years, the Roadless Rule has frustrated land managers and served as a barrier to action — prohibiting road construction, which has limited wildfire suppression and active forest management,” Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz said in a release.

Today’s forests, he added, are dangerously overstocked and threatened by drought, insect-borne disease and other factors. 
“It’s time to return land management decisions where they belong — with local Forest Service experts who best understand their forests and communities,” he said. 
‘Burdensome, outdated’
The 2001 Roadless Rule established prohibitions on road construction, road reconstruction and timber harvesting in nearly 60 million acres of inventoried roadless areas. Today, the Roadless Rule applies to nearly 45 million acres of national forest lands.
In its 25-year history, the rule has been subject to numerous lawsuits aimed both at dismantling and preserving it. 
In June, U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced the intent to rescind the rule, which she called “disastrous.” The move would aid Trump’s goal of opening America up to more logging, she said, and would place more control in the hands of local governments. 
In late August, the USDA Forest Service published notice that it intends to develop an environmental impact statement for the proposal, opening the comment period that runs through Friday. 
When the comment period opened, Rollins, in a statement, touted the rescission as “a critical step forward” in Trump’s commitment to restoring local decision-making. 
“This administration is dedicated to removing burdensome, outdated, one-size-fits-all regulations that not only put people and livelihoods at risk but also stifle economic growth in rural America,” she said. 
What they are saying  
Outdoor Alliance, the same organization that created a digital map for U.S. Sen. Mike Lee’s proposal to sell off public lands earlier this year, also created an interactive map showing where roadless designations are currently.  




The designation impacts more than 25,000 trail miles, nearly 800 miles of whitewater paddling runs and close to 8,700 climbing routes and bouldering problems, Outdoor Alliance estimates. 
The proposed repeal “would devastate America’s backcountry public lands and the millions of people who rely on them for outdoor recreation, clean air and water, and climate resilience,” Outdoor Alliance said in a call to action.
The rule already offers flexible protections for recreation access and allows for necessary active management to address wildfire or other public safety concerns, OA asserts, making it a common-sense measure. 
Rescission advocates, however, say the fire danger in some roadless areas has become a critical hazard. 
The week before Rollins’ June announcement, Lincoln County Commissioner Kent Connelly told state lawmakers the lack of logging in the roadless-designated Salt River and Wyoming ranges puts Star Valley communities at grave risk from wildfire. 
“Alpine is totally in trouble if we catch the Greys River on fire,” Connelly said. “There’s no way to defend it. Or Star Valley Ranch. That’s all there is to it. You’re going to have to watch it burn.”
Tribal representatives, meanwhile, have come out in opposition, saying the administration acted without legally required consultation on a rollback that could negatively impact access to cultural foods, animals and other resources. 
“Removing the Roadless Rule will lead to the destruction of Indigenous sacred places, areas where we continue to practice our traditions and cultures and are supposed to be legally protected by law,” Judith LeBlanc, executive director of Native Organizers Alliance, said in a statement.

Amid anger and division, it’s important to remember that Wyomingites have more in common than we might realize, Rep. Mike Yin writes.
The post Finding common ground over division appeared first on WyoFile .","I’ve spent the last few weeks traveling Wyoming, holding listening sessions in Rock Springs, Cheyenne, Lander and Casper. What struck me in every town is how much we have in common. People care about their kids’ schools, about making sure we have good jobs that let them stay in Wyoming and about maintaining strong communities where we look out for each other.

Opinion

Those are the things we should be working on together. I want to work on them with my colleagues, and I know many of my colleagues want to work on these issues too. Some of them came to the listening sessions wanting to hear what their constituents wanted to say, and I commend them for joining so we can listen together.
What we heard from those communities was not partisan. Parents ask about whether their kids will want to stay in Wyoming, and how do we keep them here. Folks wondered how we make sure we have access to health care throughout the state. Others wanted to know how we ensure our public lands stay public so their children and grandchildren can hunt, fish and hike in the same places they go. Their priorities show there is a commonality throughout all of Wyoming.
Wyoming also sticks together in adversity. Whether it’s a landslide in western Wyoming or a blizzard that knocks out power in Cheyenne, Wyomingites don’t ask who you voted for before offering to pull your car out of the snow or to check the senior down the street to make sure they have enough stocked. We understand that there are times we need to stick together to get through a tough time and support our neighbors.
However, the aftermath of Charlie Kirk’s death threatens to pull us further apart. The 24-hour commentary we tune into gives us what we want to hear, and conjures the villains we already expect to see. Don’t give in to it. Spend time with your neighbors, volunteer in your communities, get outside and enjoy your public lands. That is where we can find perspective and remember what matters.
The internet can fuel division and thrive on outrage. But here in Wyoming, I’ve seen firsthand that our communities want the same things. Those who want to divide us will try to use this moment to divide us even more. We don’t have to give in to that strife. We shouldn’t pit brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor. We are one country and one community.

Political parties have hijacked our democratic republic, writes columnist Rod Miller.
The post The United States of factions appeared first on WyoFile .","Dr. Hunter S. Thompson (and we’ll tip our Stetsons when that name is mentioned) was a keen and surgical observer of politics in America. He once famously said, “It never got weird enough for me.”

Opinion

It’s a crying shame that Thompson didn’t live long enough to see the current political food fight over the gerrymandering of our country to favor one political party or another. Red states and blue states are stumbling all over themselves to redraw congressional district maps so they can send more talking heads to Washington, D.C. than the other team.
In the normal course of events, congressional redistricting occurs right after the census, every 10 years. This redrawing of district lines — meant to account for population changes —  ensures adequate representation for every citizen. The new district boundaries represent the fluid nature of population — numbers of people moving around, being born and dying. All this is laid out in our Constitution.
Political parties have hijacked that process.
Due to the gnarly influence of political parties, we now see district lines drawn to represent the shifting reality of power, not the shifting around of people. In trying to draw lines that concentrate power in one party or another, we get the squiggly boundaries of congressional districts that make no sense in any reality other than political power.

Columnist Rod Miller.(Mike Vanata)
The United States is splattered with districts that resemble Rorschach inkblots, spaghetti spilled on a tile floor or roadkilled prairie dogs that have been smooshed and smeared by traffic, all in an effort to consolidate political power in the hands of parties.
The weird thing about this is that the term “political party” occurs nowhere in our Constitution or the Declaration of Independence. Nor is that term present in the Wyoming Constitution. The closest that our Founders came to talking about political parties was James Madison’s warning in the Federalist Papers #10. Madison didn’t call them “parties” but rather “factions” and he didn’t have any complimentary things to say about them.
My reading of Federalist 10 leads me to conclude that Madison cautioned that the presence of political parties in our republic would weaken rather than strengthen our system. While citizens are free to do so, adherence to the dogma of political parties diminishes the citizenry as well.
Think about it. We are a nation of 350 million or so individual citizens, each with our own freedom to think our own thoughts and to see the world around us through our individual eyes. Yet, despite our individual intellectual free agency, many of us identify as either Republican or Democrat. We have collectively permitted partisan dogma to override the uniqueness of our own minds.
How can a nation of millions of free thinkers be reduced to only two ways of thinking? What is the allure of political parties that drives us to sacrifice our own intellectual freedom for an imposed system of groupthink? It is mathematically impossible for 350 million to equal two.
Whatever that attraction is, it’s what makes us divide up our country into squiggly lines around political districts that favor one party or another, but do absolutely nothing to improve the lives of citizens living within those lines.
Madison also warned that factionalism and hyper-partisanship would produce the kind of strife that we see in America today. And he warned of demagogues who would capitalize on that strife for their own selfish advantage.
So, before you pledge allegiance to any political party, make sure you pay attention to the fine print at the end of the advertisement and understand all of the side effects.
Aside from the us/them strife that partisan factionalism produces in our society, it also places unnatural limitations on our thinking. Consider the spectrum of political thought available to us in our country — myriad colors that we don’t even consider or appreciate because we’ve been conditioned to see only red or blue.
Our democratic republic is a sumptuous buffet offering its citizens all manner of tasty treats for our political appetites. Yet we fill our plates with only liver or turnips, because political parties tell us that’s what we’re supposed to eat, and anything else will make us sick.
So if we want to un-weird politics, we need to reduce or eliminate the power exerted over us by political parties. We can relegate parties to the private social clubs that they truly are, like the Elks or the Rotary. And we can reassert our rightful place in society as free-thinking Cowgirls and Cowboys.
As Hunter Thompson would say, “Selah.”

Jim Pillen[...],"A Starlink system is shown on September 13, 2024. (Photo Illustration by Scott Olson/Getty Images)LINCOLN — Advocates for rural Nebraska and telecommunications companies are expressing disappointment and some condemnation over the decision to propose spending only $43.8 million of the $405 million in federal money awarded to the state to expand high-speed internet “for all.”
These “provisional” awards by the Nebraska Broadband Office that Gov. Jim Pillen created raise the prospect that $350 million in unspent funds awarded to the state under the Broadband Equity Access and Deployment (BEAD) Act could be returned to Washington, D.C., and not spent here.
It also means, some advocates said, that up to 10,000 locations in rural Nebraska will settle for less-reliable satellite or wireless internet service instead of the top-of-the-line broadband delivered via fiber optic cables.
“If there were a trophy for squandering opportunity, Nebraska would already have it on the shelf,” said Emily Haxby, a Gage County Board member who has been a leader in seeking better internet service in her county and elsewhere.
“The outcome wasn’t what we hoped would be the best for the state,” said John Nelson, CEO of Hamilton Telecommunications, which has provided fiber optic internet for four decades. “I’m concerned that there are a lot of locations that will be left behind.”


What happens to the money not awarded?
What becomes of the $350 million in Nebraska BEAD funds that the state hasn’t proposed to spend?
A battle is erupting over whether that money will be returned to the federal treasury as part of the Trump administration’s effort to cut spending and taxes or whether the state can spend the funds for “non-deployment” broadband needs, such as workforce development, digital training and data centers.
A recent letter from Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry argues that federal statutes make it clear that excess funds are to be retained by the states for purposes related to broadband.
Patrick Haggerty, the head of the Nebraska Broadband Office, told the Examiner that while the final say on the money’s use will be made by the U.S. Department of the Treasury and NTIA, Nebraska will urge the feds to let the state use the remaining funds.
Oliver Borchers-Williams of the Southeast Nebraska Development District said that returning the funds to the feds “without impacting our state would be the biggest disappointment this program has brought so far.”
— Paul Hammel


Seward County Commissioner Misty Ahmic noted that Nebraska ranked last among 39 states by granting BEAD funds for fiber in only 9% of the eligible locations across the state. That’s far lower than states like Iowa and Kansas, which handed out more than 50% and 46%, respectively, toward more desirable fiber.
“Here, instead of fighting, state leaders just rolled over and called it good enough,” Ahmic said. “It feels like they just don’t care.”
Pillen, who created the State Broadband Office, did not respond to a request for comment from the Examiner.
But Patrick Haggerty, who heads the Nebraska Broadband Office, which produced the provisional awards, disputed the criticism in response to the Examiner’s emailed questions. He pointed to a need to comply with federal changes to the BEAD program.
The rules for awarding BEAD funds were “drastically modified” in June by the Trump administration, Haggerty said, putting a priority on the “lowest-cost” technology and removing the program’s preference for fiber-delivered internet.
“We continue to fight for the best outcome for Nebraska,” he said. “We have always known we would have to deploy a mix of technologies to reach every last location while being responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars.”
Haggerty added: “In the end, our goal did not change, and every Nebraska Broadband Serviceable location will be connected.”
The $42.45 billion BEAD program, approved by Congress in 2021, was touted by the Biden administration as bringing high-speed internet “to all,” though it’s also been criticized for its slow rollout and excess regulatory requirements, including the use of union labor.
About 30,000 locations across Nebraska were initially identified as eligible for BEAD-backed internet projects — areas deemed unserved or underserved by adequate broadband. High-speed internet is essential in allowing work-at-home jobs, guiding high-tech “precision agriculture” systems and permitting easier and faster downloads of movies, video games and college and high school coursework.
But the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) announced several changes in the BEAD program designed to reduce spending after the election of Donald Trump as president a second time.
The main change was to end the priority for the extension of higher-cost fiber lines into rural areas and increased focus on the lowest cost technologies, such as fixed wireless from communication cellular towers and signals from satellites, such as those deployed by billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.
In addition, about 7,500 locations in Nebraska once identified as eligible for BEAD grants were deemed ineligible after the NTIA criteria changed.
Nebraska’s provisional awards — which must be approved by the NTIA — were announced this month and include $2.3 million to Bezos’ Project Kuiper system, which is not yet providing service, and $2.5 million to Musk’s Starlink satellite internet system, which is already deployed.
The head of the Nebraska Telecommunications Association, which represents several small and mid-sized companies that deploy fiber internet service, called the awards “disappointing” due to the rule changes that were to the detriment of fiber, which he described as the best technology.
The need for rural broadband connections is nearly universal, though the decision of whether to lay fiber optic cable like this or to connect people in rural places wirelessly or by satellite continues to stir debate. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)
“Does this really bring broadband to unserved and underserved rural areas that’s equal to what you get in urban areas? It doesn’t,” said Tip O’Neill, the president of the NTA.
One organization, the Southeast Nebraska Development District, wrote the Nebraska Broadband Office in its official comment on the awards, saying that the funding decisions fail to solve “the digital divide” between rural and urban areas.
“Business owners, farmers, students, patients, and all Nebraskans benefit when they are connected,” the letter stated. “The Nebraska Broadband Office’s final proposal offers only marginal improvements in this regard, relegating well over 12,000 homes and businesses to second-class technologies.”
The letter also pointed out that Nebraska proposed fiber internet for only 9% of all locations, the lowest percentage of any state in the country — far less than similar rural states.
During a town hall to discuss the awards, a consultant reportedly said that Nebraska’s sometimes flat and treeless landscape likely contributed to wireless internet and satellite services proving the least costly options because of fewer hills and less foliage to block such internet signals.
Haggerty, the state broadband office chief, said he could not say why the broadband awards in neighboring Iowa and Kansas were so different but said, “Nebraska’s approach was rooted in careful analysis and compliance with NTIA’s requirements.”
“We also lacked fiber applications for the areas prioritized for fiber — NBO only received fiber applications for 14 out of 106 areas most conducive to fiber,” he added.
O’Neill, of the state telecommunications association, said that due to changes in the BEAD program fiber companies would have had to spend thousands to re-engineer company proposals that likely had little chance of approval.
Some advocates said Nebraska took far too conservative an approach toward the broadband awards, giving money to wireless and satellite companies when it should have pursued fiber.
Others maintain that Nebraska’s approach might prove wise given that the federal government could drastically amend the fiber awards in other states to save money.
Changes in federal broadband programs upset advocates for rural Nebraska

In Nebraska, for instance, about 4,600 locations are proposed to be served by satellite internet, for about $1,000 per location or $4.7 million. By comparison, it would cost about $14,600 per location to service similar locations via fiber because of the cost of burying lines to remote locations. For fixed wireless, the cost is about $2,200 per location.
Because Nebraska had excess funds, it was able to propose awarding money for broadband at 54 so-called “community anchor institutions,” such as fire halls, hospitals and nursing homes. But advocates said the 54 were short of how many such institutions could have been served.
Overall, Haxby and other rural broadband advocates maintain that Nebraska fumbled an opportunity to help economic development and Nebraska farms and businesses. Fiber, she wrote, is a “lasting” technology that can be upgraded as internet speeds get faster.
“Fiber is the gold standard,” Haxby wrote in a commentary in the Examiner. “And we deserve leaders with the backbone to deliver it. Anything less is a betrayal of every family, farmer, business and student left behind on the wrong side of the digital divide.”

Quagga mussels detected near Twin Falls. But Idaho officials say amount is less than last year.

The board voted to approve deficiency warrant spending authority to fight the quagga mussels during a meeting at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise. 
The deficiency warrant process is similar to using a credit card to pay unexpected bills. 
The process has been used by the Idaho State Board of Examiners and Idaho Department of Lands to allow the state to pay unexpected wildfire costs that exceed the amount of funding provided by the Idaho Legislature. 
Any additional expenses to fight quagga mussels would then be added to the state budget at a time when state revenues are already coming in short of budget projections. The revenue shortfall is occurring after the Republican-controlled Idaho Legislature spent more than $450 million this year to pay for tax cuts and a new education tax credit that reimburses families for expenses including tuition at private, religious schools. 
Gov. Brad Little has already ordered all state agencies other than public schools to cut spending by 3% during the current fiscal year because of revenue shortfalls, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.  
The Idaho State Board of Examiners is made up of Idaho’s governor, secretary of state and attorney general, with the Idaho state controller serving as the board’s ex officio secretary.

 Quagga mussels are an invasive species first detected in the Snake River in Idaho in 2023

On Sept. 12, the Idaho State Department of Agriculture announced that invasive quagga mussels were detected in the Snake River near Twin Falls for the third year in a row, the Sun previously reported. 
State officials said extensive water testing indicates the stretch of river affected by quagga mussels is smaller than a year ago. 
Since 2023, state officials have administered a copper-based chemical in the affected portion of the Snake River in an attempt to eradicate all quagga mussels. In addition to killing quagga mussels, the copper-based chemical also killed thousands of fish in 2023, which floated to the surface of the river.
Among the six or seven tons of fish killed by the copper-chemical in 2023 were at least 48 white sturgeon, the oldest of which was 35 years old and up to eight feet in length, the Sun previously reported.

State officials said they enacted an aggressive treatment plan seeking to kill all quagga mussels because the invasive mussels reproduce rapidly and are capable of clogging pipes used for irrigation or drinking water and can cover the hulls of boats and other watercraft. Left unchecked, mussels could pose a threat to agriculture, drinking water and recreation, officials have said. 
“Quagga mussels pose a serious threat to Idaho’s water infrastructure, ecosystems and economy,” Idaho State Department of Agriculture Director Chanel Tewalt said in a written statement Sept. 12. “Full eradication remains the goal, but even reaching a level of containment is uncommon in other U.S. systems. ISDA’s treatments are critical to prevent widespread impacts to agriculture, power generation and Idaho’s aquatic environments.”  
 How does Idaho plan to pay unbudgeted expenses to fight quagga mussels?

In the event costs to fight invasive species exceed the amount of funding provided in the state budget, Idaho law gives the Idaho State Board of Examiners the power to authorize up to $5 million in deficiency warrants against the state’s general fund budget to fight the threat of an invasive species on state-owned land or water when requested by the director of the Idaho State Department of Agriculture.

The department did not list a specific dollar amount in Tuesday’s request, and the Idaho State Board of Examiners did not specify a dollar amount when approving the request. 
Efforts to reach the Idaho State Department of Agriculture were not immediately successful Tuesday afternoon.
State budget records show the department has already spent millions of dollars fighting quagga mussels. In 2023, the Sun reported the state spent $3 million treating a 16-mile stretch of the Snake River with the copper-based chemical. 
State budget records also show the department had a $6.6 million line item in last year’s fiscal year 2025 budget to fight quagga mussels. That money was used to double water sampling statewide, increase the number of inspection and contamination stations, increase staffing and support communication efforts, state records show. 
Any additional bills paid through deficiency warrants in the current fiscal year 2026 could add even more pressure to a state budget that is experiencing revenue shortfalls. 
Through the first two months of the 2026 fiscal year, state revenues have come in about $22.6 million, or 2.8%, below the Idaho Division of Financial Management’s revised forecast, the Sun reported Monday. 
In simplified terms, revenues are the amount of money the state has available to spend on expenses in the budget. The Idaho Constitution prohibits the state from spending more money than it has in available revenue. 
The state is now projecting Idaho will end the current fiscal year 2026 in June with a $21.8 million surplus. However, that projected surplus may not tell the full budget story. 
Idaho Medicaid needs $60 million more this year, as state faces projected budget shortfall

The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare said it needs another $60 million in supplemental funding this fiscal year to pay its Medicaid bills, the Sun previously reported. The Idaho Legislature is not in session and has not acted on that $60 million request, which is not included in the state’s latest budget projections. 
Additionally, the state’s latest budget projection does not include the cost of conforming to federal tax changes included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed into law July 4. One outside estimate from the nonprofit Tax Foundation estimates it could cost Idaho another $167 million to conform to tax changes such as the no tax on tips, no tax on workers’ overtime, no tax on borrower’s car loan interest and an expanded deduction for seniors, which would all reduce revenues.
Because of the $60 million Medicaid supplemental funding request and the estimated $167 million cost to conform to tax changes authorized by Trump, Idaho House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, told the Sun that Idaho’s projected $21.8 million budget surplus could actually turn out to be a $200 million deficit by the time the current fiscal year is over in June.  
“This is not a disaster on the horizon; this is a disaster right now,” Rubel told the Sun in an interview Monday.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)NASHVILLE — Federal prosecutors are pushing back against allegations they are pursuing human smuggling charges against Kilmar Abrego Garcia in Tennessee as part of a Trump administration retribution campaign.
In court filings Monday, the U.S. attorney’s office in Nashville sought to distance itself from public statements made by administration officials about Abrego, whose deportation to a Salvadoran prison in March as a result of an “administrative error” brought widespread scrutiny to President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown tactics. 
“Even if others in the Executive Branch have alleged ill will towards the defendant, there is nothing before the court to establish that such alleged ill will actually motivated the prosecution team to bring the charges and not a desire to hold human smugglers accountable for their serious criminal conduct,” prosecutors wrote.
Kilmar Abrego Garcia attorneys seek to dismiss Tennessee case as ‘vindictive prosecution’

“Rather, the defendant was charged because the prosecutor determined that, in his judgement, the defendant had committed a serious crime that could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt,” they wrote.
Abrego, as he is referred to in Tennessee court filings, is being held in a Virginia detention facility after being picked up by federal immigration officials shortly after his pretrial release in the Tennessee case on Aug. 22. 
Trump administration officials earlier this month signaled they planned to deport Abrego to the African kingdom of Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland.
After Abrego applied for asylum in the United States, government officials said they would instead seek to deport him to El Salvador, the New York Times reported.
Abrego, 30, illegally migrated from El Salvador as a teen but was granted a deportation stay by an immigration judge in 2019 due to threats of violence in his home country.
Selective and vindictive prosecution
Abrego’s attorneys last month sought to dismiss the Tennessee criminal case against him, arguing it was a clear example of “selective and vindictive prosecution” by the Trump administration.
Abrego is accused of acting as the driver in a national human smuggling ring that took money from migrants illegally in the United States to transport them to points around the country — a case prosecutors say is tied to a 2022 traffic stop in rural Tennessee. At that traffic stop, Abrego was pulled over for speeding with nine men in the back of his vehicle. Abrego was neither arrested nor ticketed in the traffic stop. He has since entered not guilty pleas to two human smuggling charges.

Citing a series of public statements by members of the Trump administration – calling Abrego a “gangbanger,” “monster,” “illegal predator,” “illegal alien terrorist,” “wife beater,” and “human trafficker,” Abrego’s attorneys argued he was the victim of a public smear campaign intended to distract from the administration’s error in deporting him and retaliate against his efforts to assert due process rights. Abrego has denied gang affiliation. 
“The government is attempting to use this case — and this Court — to punish Mr. Abrego for successfully fighting his unlawful removal. That is a constitutional violation of the most basic sort,” they wrote. 
In response, federal prosecutors in the Tennessee case said Abrego’s effort to fight his initial deportation to El Salvador “has nothing to do with his criminal prosecution for alien smuggling, an offense where illegal aliens and natural-born citizens alike can be prosecuted,” they wrote.
“Rather,” they wrote, “the defendant was charged because the prosecutor determined that, in his judgment, the defendant had committed a serious crime that could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.”
Prosecutors also sought to dispel arguments that a three-year delay in bringing charges against Abrego after the 2022 Tennessee traffic stop were part of a broader vindictive scheme by the government.
Judge keeps Abrego Garcia in US at least through October hearing

“The facts of the traffic stop were never presented to any prosecutor until late April 2025,” they wrote. 
Prosecutors accused attorneys for Abrego of including false and misleading statements in court filings about how negotiations for a plea deal unfolded — and then collapsed — in the weeks before he was granted pre-trial release.
Attorneys for Abrego have accused prosecutors of coercing their client to accept a last-minute guilty plea and deportation to Costa Rica just before he was released from pretrial custody in Tennessee to then face detention by immigration officials. 
Both sides were actively engaged in negotiating a plea deal for more than a month that would have required Abrego to plead guilty to one human smuggling charge when defense attorneys filed surprise claims of vindictive prosecution and a coercement, prosecutors wrote. Costa Rica, they said, was the country of Abrego’s choosing.

(Getty Images)The West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection is holding a public hearing on Thursday for community members in Mingo and Logan counties to share thoughts and concerns regarding a pending permit application to construct two data centers and connected natural gas plants near Gilbert.
The public hearing will take place from 4:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Thursday at the Larry Joe Harless Community Center, in Gilbert.
Originally, there was not going to be an in-person public hearing for the project, which has faced growing scrutiny and concerns from local residents. On Aug. 18, the DEP held a virtual public hearing for the project, but advocates helping to organize and inform local residents on the proposals said numerous individuals were unable to attend due to technical difficulties.
A spokesman for the DEP said earlier this month that the meeting was made virtual since a majority of people requesting the hearing were “located at least an hour and 45 minutes from Mingo County, with many residing outside West Virginia.”
Tyler Cannon, the climate alliance coordinator with West Virginia Citizen Action Group, said that it was difficult for those in rural Mingo and Logan counties — where the development is proposed — to access the virtual meeting. Many of those concerned are older and unfamiliar with virtual meetings. Others cited issues with broadband connectivity and internet access.
On Aug. 20, numerous community members drove to Charleston, where they delivered 26 letters from residents to the DEP headquarters in Kanawha City. The letters included pushes for more transparency about the proposed projects — the air quality permit application filed with the DEP was heavily redacted — as well as discontent with the lack of an in-person public hearing. 
While in Charleston, the residents were able to meet with members of the DEP and discuss these concerns, Cannon said. The DEP then extended the public comment period for the project until 5 p.m. on Sept. 19 and scheduled the in-person public hearing for Sept. 18.
The proposed development — called the Adams Fork Energy project — comes from New York-based TransGas and would create the largest natural gas-fueled ammonia plant in the world. The two power plants onsite — which would operate as “microgrids” — would power two new data centers: one at the Twisted Gun Golf Course in Wharncliffe and another near the Mingo-Logan county line at the Harless Industrial Park.
Currently, the DEP is reviewing air quality permit applications from TransGas for the development of the two off-grid power plants. The air permit to construct the ammonia plant has already been approved.
According to the air quality permit applications for the power plants, the facilities would have the capacity to produce more than 2,400 megawatts each. If approved, the two TransGas facilities would be the third- and fourth-highest power-intensive industrial sites in the state, behind the John Amos Power Plant in Putnam County and the Harrison Power Station in Harrison County.
Each facility would house 117 engines powered by methane, with 114 of those running full-time. If no gas is available, the engines would run on diesel that is stored in 40 tanks on site. 
Annually, per the applications, each facility would have the potential to emit up to 206 tons of carbon monoxide, 194 tons of nitrogen oxides, 118 tons of volatile organic compounds and 188 tons of fine particulate matter, or soot.
These kinds of emissions are known to negatively affect air quality in surrounding areas and contribute to climate change. People at risk of developing respiratory problems — including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, black lung or other illnesses — are particularly vulnerable to negative health impacts from emissions.
On Aug. 29, Cannon helped organize an unofficial community meeting with Mingo and Logan county residents in Wharncliffe. About 50 people from the local communities attended the meeting, where they discussed their displeasure with the lack of transparency from both TransGas and the DEP regarding the proposals and their concerns about the unknowns that could come with the development.
Due to redactions, the emissions listed in the permits are an estimate of how much they would put out annually. The DEP, Cannon said at the meeting, would be independently responsible for ensuring that emissions from the facilities are within allowable limits when they first start operating. After that, emissions data would be self-reported by the company.
The permits also include no information on how much water the facilities would need from local water tables to operate. 
Power plants and data centers need a lot of water to function; Some data centers can use up to 5 million gallons of drinking water a day. The consequences of this water usage are becoming clearer as communities across the country that are located next to new data center developments have been tapped dry or had their water contaminated.
Oftentimes, these new developments will tap into municipal water sources. As proposed in Mingo County, however, TransGas wants to tap into mine pools located underneath the golf course.
For residents in Wharncliffe, this was upsetting. Oftentimes, they said, they can go days or weeks without water service due to issues with the centralized water system. Several residents said they’ve contacted the Mingo County Commission about tapping into that underground mine water to service their community in order to avoid these outages.
They haven’t heard any progress on that front, they said in August.
And now, that water — which will have to be treated to remove minerals and potential contaminants before being used by the data centers and in the power plants, the same process that would be used for drinking water — will be committed to TransGas under its current applications.
Residents also talked about how unaware many in the community were about the proposed developments. 
Throughout the state, it’s becoming the norm that communities where data centers and connected power plants are attempting to locate are left in the dark about the developments or the potential environmental or health consequences that could come with them.
In Mason County, residents plan their own community meeting about another data center, power plant
On Tuesday evening, residents gathered in Point Pleasant to have a similar discussion to the one held in Wharncliffe last month. 
There, Texas-based company Fidelis New Energy, has proposed to build and operate a data center complex in Mason County as well as a biomass power plant. The biomass power plant, if approved, would produce hydrogen through burning natural gas and renewables. The project would also include the construction of carbon dioxide pipelines and storage.
The company has said that the project will employ carbon capture technology that limits emissions. Environmentalists and others, however, question the efficacy of this technology being used on a commercial scale.
Fidelis was ushered into West Virginia under former Gov. Jim Justice as a boon for economic development. The state Economic Development Authority approved a three-year $62.5 million loan for the project, which is set to be forgiven if the company meets certain benchmarks for employment and investments.
But residents in Mason County have expressed concerns at what exactly the project will entail. Similar to other projects, several metrics that would impact their lives — water usage, actual emissions and more — are unavailable in the filed permit requests.
Currently, the DEP is considering air quality permits for the data center and biomass power plant.
The public comment period for the project is set to end on Thursday. Again, the agency has opted not to schedule an in-person meeting on the proposed development.
Currently, a petition is circulating for residents to call on the DEP to extend the soon-to-close public comment period as well as host an in-person meeting for those in the affected communities.
Advocates with CAG helped facilitate the unofficial community meeting in Point Pleasant on Tuesday.
Morgan King, the climate and energy program manager with CAG, said it should be the norm that residents in communities affected by these kinds of developments “have the right to hear directly from the government agencies that enable these projects and the companies proposing them.”
“The [state DEP] public comment period is brief and requires a deep understanding of the regulatory public participation process, which is not easily accessible to most people,” King said. “An in-person meeting would allow community members to ask questions, gain understanding and raise concerns in a more accessible manner.”

(Screenshot)A former CIA officer from Kentucky had his security clearance revoked by the Trump administration earlier this year. Now, he’s a Democratic candidate for the state’s open U.S. Senate seat. 
Joel Willett, who is also a veteran and former CEO, launched his campaign Wednesday. Last month, he was one of 37 current and former intelligence officials who had their security clearances revoked by Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard. 
Gabbard said on X that the officials had used intelligence for political or personal gain. However, Willet later said in an NPR interview that he had no official correspondence about the matter and the action against him came shortly after a report said he was a possible candidate for U.S. Senate. The GOP attention is a key focus of his launch video released Wednesday morning. 
“As soon as you have a normal person stand up and try to run for office, look what they do,” Willet told the Lantern in a phone interview. “They weaponize the entire U.S. government against that person to try to shut them up. And I think that’s, unfortunately, the system we live in now. And so I think they thought maybe that would shut me up or deter me. It did the opposite.” 
Willett also worked in the White House Situation Room. He and other staffers in that role were nonpartisan and would have served any president, regardless of party, and the country, he said. While “I’ve never been a political animal,” that experience has shaped his views on America’s global position.
“I believe that the world is a better place with a strong united America in a position of global leadership. I am increasingly concerned that we have abdicated that position of global leadership,” Willett said. “And I think if we can’t get our s- – – together as a country, the rest of the world is going to move on from the time of America occupying that driver’s seat. And so I think that’s another danger of this administration.” 
Willett, 41, grew up in Valley Station in southwestern Jefferson County. He said his experience growing up in a family that faced class and union struggles drew him to the Democratic Party. 
He joined the Army National Guard at the age of 17, shortly after the 9/11 attacks. Willett said his parents worked hard to provide for him and his sister, but “both of them struggled with addiction.” He said his father died of a fentanyl overdose in 2019. 
“This state, good public education, the support of my grandparents, the support of my church family, public service, service in the military — all those things made my American dream possible,” Willett said. “But I think for too many people in the state today that dream is dead or dying, and it’s because they’re getting steamrolled by a political system that they’re invisible to and, when it does bother to take notice, treats families like the one that I grew up in as acceptable losses.” 
Like many other Democratic candidates heading into midterm elections, Willett was critical of the GOP-backed One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which included spending cuts for services like Medicaid and food assistance programs. As for other policy areas he is interested in, Willett said he wanted to work on expanding health care, economic and educational opportunities for Americans and prevent artificial intelligence from replacing jobs in the workforce. 
Willett joins a Democratic primary field that includes former U.S. Secret Service agent and attorney Logan Forsythe, who announced his campaign Tuesday, and Kentucky House Minority Floor Leader Rep. Pamela Stevenson, of Louisville, who has been in the race for months. 
The seat is currently held by longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, who earlier this year announced he is not seeking reelection.

“Metro AAA: Services Meeting the Struggles of Alzheimer’s” by Brenda Landers, executive director of the WVSU Metro Area Agency on Aging.

The conference is part of the “AFA Educating America” tour the foundation started more than eight years ago, Fuschillo said. 
“We travel every single month throughout the entire country, connecting individuals with experts in the field of Alzheimer’s disease, brain health, caregiving tips and strategies, and in this case, we will have an elder law attorney that will talk about advanced planning for health and legal advice as well,” Fuschillo said. “But the whole goal is to empower individuals to have greater knowledge of Alzheimer’s disease and support services that are available.”
In West Virginia, more than 38,000 people are living with Alzheimer’s disease, according to 2025 data from the Alzheimer’s Association. Nationally, there are more than 7.2 million Alzheimer’s patients. 
“In the absence of any new therapy, significant new therapies or a cure, those numbers are expected to significantly increase over the next few years,” Fuschillo said. 
In addition to the sessions, the conference will also offer free memory screenings, a 15-minute assessment of memory skills, thinking and language. Those who take the test will be given a baseline score to compare with future screenings.

(Photo by Marc Piscotty/Getty Images)Research on brain tumors in children that has been supported by the federal government will wind down in March due to cuts in funding from the National Cancer Institute, which is part of the National Institutes of Health. 
The Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, formed in 1999, is a collaboration between 15 hospitals and the National Cancer Institute centered on clinical trials and studies that target pediatric brain cancer. Children’s Hospital Colorado has been in the consortium for the past 10 years, and the doctors who work on its studies say they are looking for options to continue trials that are affected by the federal funding cuts. 
“The uncertainty with this program is deeply disappointing, as it represents a loss of scientific collaboration and shared progress across North America,” Dr. Rajeev Vibhakar, a neuro-oncologist at Children’s Hospital, said in a statement. “In removing this infrastructure, it will be more difficult to advance new therapies in children and will decrease our collective ability to find ways to improve child health and access to the newest, most promising trials and treatments.”

An August update to the NCI website says the consortium “will not be able to apply for another 5-year funding award to continue its funding beyond March 2026.” Some trials affected could be completed “wherever feasible and appropriate” after the NCI decided to prioritize funding for research within another group of hospitals known as Pediatric Early Phase Clinical Trials Network, or PEP-CTN, over the consortium.
Children’s Hospital has trials impacted by NCI’s funding cuts, Vibhakar said, but the hospital hopes the NIH and NCI “will provide clarity on the path forward, so we can build on the momentum and preserve the gains made for pediatric brain cancer patients.”
Dr. Lia Gore, section head of the Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders at Children’s, said there has been no impact to patients yet and that “we hope that the transfer is seamless for the patients and patient families.”
“We are working to understand how quickly new trials can be opened and how to ensure that selected ongoing trials are supported,” Gore said in a statement. 










This unpredictability is understandably stressful for families, especially those whose children were enrolled in trials or awaiting new opportunities.


– Dr. Holly Lindsay, neuro-oncologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado


Dr. Ira Dunkel, who spoke to Newsline as chair of the PBTC, said the consortium has heard verbally about funding cuts that will affect its work, but it has received no formal or written notification other than seeing the update on the NCI website. 
The consortium will shut down on March 31 or shortly after if the NCI funding cuts go through as currently planned, Dunkel said. He said he sees “a very good faith effort on everybody’s part” to transfer as many studies to PEP-CTN, but other trials will likely close prematurely because of the change. Trials that are active and accruing patients at Children’s are in the process of being transferred to PEP-CTN, Gore said. 
“Although we receive additional funding from grants and foundations and philanthropy beyond the NCI funding, the consortium infrastructure really exists based upon the NCI funding, and we use NCI resources as part of our fundamental activities,” Dunkel said. “The PBTC without NCI funding will cease to exist.”
Various foundations and other potential funders have told the consortium they would offer funding to replace what is lost from the federal government, Dunkel said, but “it’s not as simple as that” because of how much of the consortium’s work uses NCI facilities, databases and other resources. He said he’s been told that even with adequate funding, the consortium will not be permitted to use those resources.
It’s possible that private funders could create “a successor organization” to the PBTC, Dunkel said, but that is still an early discussion given how recent the news of funding cuts came through. 
Consortiums essential for kids
The Colorado-based Morgan Adams Foundation funds pediatric cancer research, and Children’s Hospital’s brain tumor research program is named after the foundation. It primarily funds “pipeline ideas” that go on to become clinical trials like the ones run by the PBTC, according to Joan Slaughter, founder and executive director, whose daughter the foundation is named after. The majority of its funding goes to research in Colorado, but Slaughter said the foundation has relationships with most research institutions in the country.  
The cuts to the consortium will affect the future of studies and other work the Morgan Adams Foundation has already provided funding for, Kat Russell, the foundation’s director of strategic marketing, said, as that research may have been further developed through trials overseen by PBTC hospitals. Slaughter said clinical trials are “the only way to really impact the patient population.”
“So if the budget cuts start to reduce the number of trials that can happen in peds, you are really prolonging how long it takes to get new treatments out to our kids, and disrupting that cycle is going to have longer term, very negative effects,” Slaughter said.
The collaboration that multi-institution consortiums like the PBTC offer is essential for successful pediatric cancer research, Robin French, program officer at the Morgan Adams Foundation said, because fewer children get cancer than adults and pooling resources is more desirable for drug companies. 
“These types of consortia are critical to making the trials happen, because that’s the only way you’re going to get enough children to get this full significant group there, a cohort of kids to test the effectiveness of these treatments,” French said. 
The PBTC includes hospitals in states across the country, as well as Washington, D.C., and one in Canada.
No new patients
Dr. Holly Lindsay, another neuro-oncologist at Children’s, said the hospital is looking for opportunities to continue the care it is already providing to patients under the consortium. 
“This unpredictability is understandably stressful for families, especially those whose children were enrolled in trials or awaiting new opportunities,” Lindsay said in a statement. “Cancer is the leading cause of medical death in children, and the risk of losing impactful clinical trials is real.”
Patients currently receiving treatment under a PBTC trial can continue that treatment, but Dunkel said it has suspended accepting new patients into any studies. He said the consortium is “extremely concerned” about the patients currently receiving treatment under trials. 
Patient advocates and families are “outraged,” Slaughter said, because “our job is to protect our children,” and reducing resources available to help them is “not caring for our kids.” “It’s challenging when cancer is politically agnostic and the families that it attacks … you want to step away from that conversation and just really talk about, ‘We should be investing in the future of our kids.’ That’s really what needs to be happening — regardless of who sits in what chair, we need to be taking care of our kids.”
French’s son is a childhood cancer survivor, and she said doctors used experimental treatments for him when he was sick. 
“If someone had told me at that point that I would no longer have access to the care that we were in the middle of, I mean, I don’t know what I would have done. I would have lost it, I think, as any parent would,” French said. “My heart breaks for these people, that someone’s saying ‘I’m sorry, but we have to take you off this trial, because we don’t have the money to do it anymore.’”

When fewer people can get abortions, property crime rates go up, a new working paper out Monday suggests.
The analysis, published in the National Bureau of Economic Research, underscores the connection between abortion access and economic stability: more people becoming pregnant and being forced into poverty led to higher property crimes. It tracks the impact of a Texas abortion law enacted in 2013, which imposed a host of new regulations on abortion providers. Those restrictions resulted in the vast majority of the state’s clinics closing; as a result of the law, the distance patients had to travel for an abortion more than doubled, from an average of 21 miles to 53.

This report was originally published by The 19th. The Illuminator is a founding member of The 19th News Network.

Most people who seek abortions are already parents, and their main reason is that they cannot afford another child. Years of research has underscored that denying people abortions entrenches them deeper into poverty.
“Whenever there’s an unplanned or mistimed parenthood, this can actually create some economic shock to these families,” said Erkmen Aslim, an economist at the University of Vermont and the paper’s lead author. ”These downstream outcomes can have huge economic and social outcomes.”
The research team found a link between obstacles to abortion and economic harm — evictions, mortgage delinquency and increased income inequality — but also to increases in property crimes like car theft, burglary and larceny.
The effects were most visible in counties that saw the biggest growth in travel needed for an abortion. Researchers divided affected Texas counties into three categories — those where travel times increased by 25 miles or more, by 50 miles or more and by 100 miles or more — and compared those against control counties that did not experience an increase of 25 miles or more to an abortion clinic.
Counties with meaningful increases in travel saw higher rates of property crime by women and men alike — a finding that suggests that the economic consequences of unplanned pregnancy people regardless of gender, the researchers said. The increases were also more visible for adults compared to minors.
Violent crimes mostly did not go up, with the exception of increases in robbery, which can also be a result of economic desperation, in counties where abortion-related travel distances grew by 100 miles or more.
“We have just discovered a really strikingly large causal relationship between restricting abortion access and property crime,” said Caitlin Myers, an economist at Middlebury College and co-author on the study. “It’s quite striking. It really points to economic vulnerability and striking destabilization for families.”

Working papers published by the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research have not yet undergone peer review. But they are considered a useful jumping off point for economic debate. The bureau’s standards are rigorous, and most of its working papers end up published in academic journals.
The paper does not examine the consequences of the more recent Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, which allowed states to ban abortion. But its authors are now starting to examine whether the decision has continued to drive up property crime.
Aslim said he would now anticipate an even larger increase. Texas is one of a dozen states to have outlawed abortion almost entirely, and people living in the state typically have to travel hundreds of miles to get an abortion.
“It’s likely based on everything we know about how [Roe v. Wade’s overturn] is impacting births that this has continued,” Myers said. “But we’re going to measure it. We need to measure.”
The distance people travel for care nationwide could soon grow. An appeals court ruled last week to uphold a new federal policy allowing for “defunding” Planned Parenthood, prohibiting the family planning provider from participating in the federal Medicaid program. The organization estimates the decision could result in the closure of as many as 200 clinics, mostly in states where abortion is legal — a development that could lead to fewer options and longer travel times for people journeying to another state for an abortion.
“Planned Parenthood is an extremely important provider of reproductive health care, particularly in rural and underserved areas,” Myers said. “In a lot of states that do have abortion services in kind of smaller towns and more rural areas, the services are being provided by Planned Parenthood.”
As states have adopted more restrictive abortion laws, health care providers have developed other methods to make the procedure more accessible, including prescribing and mailing abortion medications for patients to take in their homes. That option was significantly less available in 2013, and has helped thousands of people get abortions without traveling for care. Abortion opponents have made restricting medication a top priority, filing civil and criminal suits against telehealth abortion providers and passing new legislation in Texas meant to halt telehealth abortions.
Still, the rise of telehealth hasn’t bridged the gap for many Americans, especially those living the farthest from brick-and-mortar abortion providers, Myers said. Even as more people shift toward getting medications online, she said, the birth rate in states with abortion bans has continued to increase.
“We should be thinking about what this means for the social safety net we provide for poor families and the ways in which these destabilizing effects can have ripple effects into their communities,” she said.

 In a time of rising political violence, one of the hardest and most important things we can do is look inward and ask: How might my words, actions, or assumptions be contributing to division and dehumanization? 
This self-examination matters because injustice doesn’t suddenly appear full-blown. It unfolds gradually. The Spiral of Injustice shows us that what might seem like “just words” is often the first step in normalizing division and paving the way to violence. The seemingly small ways we speak about and label others lays the groundwork for avoidance, discrimination, violence, and even elimination.
Refusing to let hate have the final word: the hidden history of human rights in Idaho

Each step strips away humanity. 
Taking a stand against hate is essential, but when that stance hardens into contempt, we risk losing sight of the very humanity we are trying to defend. Once people become “the other” in our minds, indifference creeps in. And with that, the Spiral accelerates. 
Martin Luther King Jr. reminded us, “Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.” His words challenge us to resist the temptation to meet othering with more othering, and hate with more hate. 
Pause for a moment. Whose humanity do you struggle to see right now? What story have you told yourself about them? And what would it take to see their full dignity? 
Interrupting the Spiral of Injustice begins with the choices we make every day. Speaking up when we hear dehumanizing language, refusing to stereotype or dismiss others, and showing respect even in deep disagreement. These deliberate actions slow the Spiral, creating space for justice and belonging. 
When division threatens to pull us apart, we must choose instead to affirm the full dignity of every person. That is how we interrupt the Spiral and build communities where we can all belong and thrive.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-17 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,A Mississippi Prison Murder Indictment Was Forgotten for 3 Years — Until a Reporter Called,"Grant McLaughlin, Clarion Ledger",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/17/forgotten-prison-murder-case-resurfaces-after-reporters-call/,"John Lowe was beaten to death in a Mississippi prison shower in 2021, but the murder suspect was not served the indictment because of bureaucratic missteps.","During a routine prison shift change at the Marshall County Correctional Facility in Mississippi, the deadly attack unfolding on Unit Charlie 2’s security monitors went unnoticed.
When a new crew would take over for the outgoing guards, the security team would be preoccupied with mundane tasks away from the monitors, a lawsuit and testimony later recounted.
At some point during that shift change, John Lowe was severely injured from the beating he received inside the unit’s shower area and was found by security 10 minutes later, bleeding on the tile floor. He died two days later on July 13, 2021.
County prosecutors had the evidence they needed for a murder charge. The security cameras had recorded the beating. A grand jury indicted a suspect a little over a year later.
Then, for the next three years, the case was effectively forgotten by prosecutors and the prison system.
A phone call, then the indictment resurfaces 
Lowe, who was serving a 15-year sentence for armed robbery, was one of at least 43 incarcerated people killed inside Mississippi prisons since 2015. 
In most other cases, the suspects were never charged by local prosecutors, a team of Mississippi news reporters found. Only six people have been convicted in connection with prison killings over the past 10 years.
Outside of court, the private company that ran the Marshall County prison for the state settled the lawsuit filed by Lowe’s family for an undisclosed amount. The agreement requires the family to keep specific details of the case confidential.
The suspect in Lowe’s death, Terry McCline, was indicted on a murder charge in October 2022. He is currently serving 75 years for armed robbery, carjacking and conspiracy, and won’t be eligible for release until he is 98 years old in 2076.
Typically, McCline would have been officially served the indictment, would have gotten a lawyer, and, ultimately, would have headed to trial, where a jury or judge would have decided his fate.
But McCline was never served the indictment to start the process.
A grand jury had indicted McCline during the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, which significantly restricted the operation of the state’s legal system.
McCline’s dormant indictment was resurrected only after a Clarion Ledger reporter asked Marshall County District Attorney Ben Creekmore what happened to the case.
Creekmore said he then realized McCline was never served with the murder charge. The serving of the indictment, Creekmore noted in a June 3 email to a reporter, would happen “ASAP.”
On Aug. 13, McCline was taken from prison, brought before a judge in the county courthouse and handed the indictment. He pleaded not guilty.
McCline has not responded to requests to speak with him. He is the only person indicted in connection with Lowe’s murder. 
Creekmore said while it is his office’s responsibility to make sure every indictment is served, the Mississippi Department of Corrections should have followed through, too.
“What you’re identifying is probably that we need to have a better system in place to make certain they get served quicker,” he said.
MDOC investigators brought him the murder case to present to a grand jury in 2022, a year after the murder, Creekmore said. But by then, McCline had been transferred to another MDOC facility outside the county. Because he was no longer in Marshall County, he could not be served with the county grand jury’s indictment, Creekmore said.
Creekmore said the indictment got lost during the court backlogs caused by COVID-19. The process to indict MDOC inmates is difficult because incarcerated people can’t be served inside a prison, he said.
“There are other issues as well. If somebody is safely kept [by MDOC], it doesn’t just jump off the page and say, ‘Hey, this is something that needs to be taken care of,’ unless I get a call from a victim’s family, law enforcement, the judge,” Creekmore said, “or an investigative reporter.”
MDOC spokesperson Katelyn Head said that it is partly MDOC’s responsibility to ensure indicted prisoners are served because it works with county DAs “when [MDOC] knows” a prisoner has been indicted. MDOC took over operations at the Marshall County prison from the private company two months after Lowe’s murder.
Head also said that McCline was moved to another prison after the killing, but before his indictment. Moving a suspect to another facility is a standard security practice, she said.
Gaps in oversight
At the time of the attack, guards were working for Management & Training Corporation, a private company that managed the prison for the corrections department in 2021. Security staffers routinely left shift change duties undone at several MTC facilities, which included watching the monitors and checking cells, said Chuck Mullins, an attorney who represented Lowe’s parents in their wrongful death lawsuit.
In Lowe’s case, deposition testimony showed guards were not in the control tower at the time of Lowe’s attack, Mullins said.
The 25-year-old Lowe was found on the shower floor shortly before 6:30 p.m. on July 11 and put under medical observation for most of the night. He had skull fractures, scratches and bruises to his head, face and neck, according to video footage and details cited in the lawsuit.
In a recent interview, Lowe’s family members said they viewed the prison security camera footage and saw about four men attacking Lowe in the shower.
“You could see [there were] multiple [people], from what I could see, after watching the video that many times,” Lowe’s brother, Justin, said.
Their lawsuit also stated that “[v]ideo footage captured several inmates attacking” Lowe in “plain view.” 
“The reason why the inmates chose that particular time, and based on the deposition testimony … is that that was during [a] shift change,” Mullins said. “[Guards] would leave their post to go do rounds so the inmates knew no one was going to be in the control tower during that time … They had that kind of knowledge.”
Five hours after being found, Lowe was transported from the prison to a nearby Oxford hospital and then 75 miles to a Memphis trauma center. He died the next day.
Lawsuit settles
The wrongful death lawsuit against MTC was settled out of court in late 2024 for an undisclosed amount. 
The lawsuit initially requested a jury trial for the family’s claim, which asked for more than $75,000 in damages.
If the suit had gone to trial, it could have brought prison records about security staffing, video footage of the murder and more into the public eye. 
Mullins declined to disclose the amount the family received in the settlement, citing the confidentiality agreement. MTC also declined to disclose the settlement amount or discuss Lowe’s murder case. In court records, MTC made no admission of wrongdoing.
The Lowe family settled because they felt they could not prove at trial that MTC neglected its responsibility of keeping incarcerated people safe, Mullins said. 
“There was nothing to indicate to MTC or their employees that [Lowe’s murder] was going to happen,” Mullins said.
Wanda Bertram, a spokesperson and researcher for the Prison Policy Initiative, a nonprofit criminal justice think tank focusing on prisons, said prison operators in other cases have used the defense that, without prior knowledge of an act of violence, there isn’t much in the way of liability. MTC made the same arguments in court papers, saying that it followed the law at all times.
Prisons generally do not prioritize prisoner-to-prisoner security, opting to invest in ways to respond to violent incidents, rather than prevent them, she said. 
“Fundamentally, even if it is technically a security matter when someone in prison kills another person, that’s not really the type of security that prisons are interested in providing,” Bertam said. 
Who was John Lowe?
Before prison, Lowe was looking forward to starting a career. His family never thought he would end up in a Mississippi prison. 
“He was a great brother,” Justin Lowe said recently. “I couldn’t ask God to bless me with a better one, because he was that and, mentally, he challenged me all the time … He just stayed on me and [encouraged me] to stay in my books.”
John Lowe grew up in the Greenville area, competitively boxed at a local gym and helped take care of the family.
“We started out [boxing] when I was about 9, he was 10,” Justin said. “Then we won the Golden Gloves together. And then he kind of just faded out, but he kept me going [with it].”
Before his arrest, Lowe was working toward obtaining his GED and eventually a welder’s license.
“He seemed like he had made up his mind before [his arrest], that he was going to focus on what he’s supposed to do,” his father, John Sr., said.
Lowe was a fan of gospel, R&B and rap music, Justin said. Some of Lowe’s favorite artists include Tupac Shakur, whose music touched on culture, racial politics and the lives of Black men in America.
In prison, Lowe’s parents said he was an avid reader and drawer, and continued his education to stay busy.
Justin and John Sr. both said they are glad the murder case is finally moving forward, but said it almost feels like too little too late. 
The real justice, they said, would have been preventing Lowe’s death in the first place.
“They didn’t make [the murder case] a priority,” Justin said with tears in his eyes. “The situation still makes me very emotional. They could’ve done more. His life was taken under supervision … I can only sit and wait and pray that my brother gets the justice he deserves.”

New data shows that lobbying remained a lucrative industry in the first half of 2025, especially for firms that count health care companies among their clients. 
The post Beacon Hill lobbying still buoyed by health care interests appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","BEACON HILL’S MOST POWERFUL lobbying shops continued to rake in cash at a growing rate this year from clients who want to sway policymakers on everything from sports betting to internet connectivity to, most frequently, health care.
Continuing a long-running trend, many of the companies, industry groups, and other clients that spent the most on lobbying services between January and June work in health care or related fields such as pharmaceuticals.
The Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association, which represents hospitals and providers, and the Massachusetts Association of Health Plans, which represents insurers, were the only two clients that spent more than half a million dollars each to influence state government in the first half of the year, according to data released this week by Secretary of State William Galvin’s office.
MHA jumped into the top-spending spot this year with $577,789, flipping places with MAHP, which spent $550,065. In the same six-month span last year, MAHP ranked first with $616,981 spent and MHA second with $558,312 spent.
“As the challenges of the Commonwealth’s biggest sector intensify, we are privileged to provide our elected officials with a united voice for the hospitals and health systems who rely on smart public policy to innovate, maintain care services, and meet the daily needs of patients,” said MHA spokesperson Sam Melnick.
Lora Pellegrini, CEO of the group representing health insurance plans, said her group has been in regular communication with Beacon Hill this year “to evaluate the impact of proposed federal funding cuts that could disrupt coverage for Massachusetts residents starting in 2026.”
Pellegrini, herself a registered lobbyist who earned more than $247,000 from MAHP in the first six months of the year, said the organization also worked with the Healey administration to implement new hospital oversight and prescription drug cost control laws.
“In addition, as new health care legislation was introduced during the first half of the year, MAHP participated in public hearings to share data and perspectives, helping lawmakers understand how proposals would affect affordability and access for patients and employers across the Commonwealth,” she said.
The next two positions in the rankings also went to health care-related groups: the Massachusetts Biotechnology Council spent $343,030, followed by the Association for Behavioral Healthcare, which spent $282,777 in a ramp-up of its lobbying activity. The organization spent $203,709 – nearly $80,000 less – over the same period last year.
Several other major industry players also figure toward the top of the list, including the Massachusetts Nurses Association (ninth overall with $222,310 spent on lobbying), Beth Israel Lahey Health (11th, with $209,000 spent) and Mass General Brigham (12th, with $207,642 spent).
Health care is a key economic driver for Massachusetts — forming half of the “eds and meds” catchphrase often deployed to describe the state’s biggest strengths — and it’s also an industry facing significant upheaval. Costs continue to grow at rates exceeding inflation, many providers are struggling with workforce issues, and patients face geographic disparities accessing care.
After lawmakers and Gov. Maura Healey implemented a new hospital oversight law and prescription drug cost controls at the start of the year, more action could be on the horizon.
Top House and Senate Democrats are moving this week to provide hospitals and community health centers with a $234 million funding injection, but they have not yet outlined any concrete plans for other legislation.
A couple of other familiar names appear in the list of top-spending lobbyist clients through the first half of this year. The Massachusetts Teachers Association spent about $257,000 on lobbying between January and June, fifth-most of any client, as it works to influence debate about a new, post-MCAS graduation standard and takes early steps toward supporting a new wealth tax that would fund debt-free public college.
Keolis Commuter Services, which is hoping to win another bid to continue operating the MBTA’s commuter rail after the current contract expires in 2027, ranked eighth with $225,000 spent on lobbying.
The list of firms who earned the most in the first half of 2025 remained mostly unchanged, led by the same top three: Smith, Costello and Crawford, Tremont Strategies Group, and O’Neill and Associates. Most of the other big names retained their positions close to the top, with a handful moving up or down the rankings.
Each of the five highest-earning entities hauled in more between January and June than they did in the same span last year, with especially large jumps for Tremont (17.4 percent increase), Dempsey Associates (25 percent increase) and Smith, Costello and Crawford (28.3 percent increase).
Some of that growth has been driven by new clients joining the scene. Smith, Costello and Crawford collected $120,000 — the largest single payment to the firm this year — from HG Vora Capital Management, a New York company that for the first time sought lobbying on “issues related to the regulation of the gaming industry.”
Another gambling-related organization, the Sports Betting Alliance, increased its spending with Smith, Costello and Crawford from $15,000 in the first half of 2024 to $90,000 in the first half of 2025.
Many lawmakers land lobbying gigs after they depart the House and Senate, or outright trade public office for the private sector, and data continue to show they can earn far more working to sway the Legislature from the outside than they do from the inside.
House Speaker Ron Mariano and Senate President Karen Spilka were tied for the highest-paid lawmaker, each with $203,286 in total pay in all of 2024. Twenty-three different registered lobbyists collected more than that amount just in the first half of 2025.
Former rep. Carlo Basile and former Senate president Robert Travaglini more than doubled the 2024 full-year top legislative paycheck in the first six months of this year, earning $425,000 and $412,000, respectively.

(Photo by Getty Images)If you scroll through social media or watch the news, you’ll see our members of Congress and special interest groups practically begging West Virginians to believe that the so-called “Big Beautiful Bill” (HR 1) is good for us. But West Virginians know a bad deal when we see one. This legislation takes away health care and food assistance and raises costs for nearly all of us — while handing giant tax cuts to the wealthy. And with West Virginia among the states slated to be hardest hit by program cuts, it’s our communities who will pay the price. 
The tax cut spin doesn’t hold up
Our members of Congress claim the bill delivers tax cuts for West Virginia families. But their claims do not hold up for everyday West Virginians. Most of the so-called “new” cuts they claim in their figures are already in place. More importantly, the dollar figures they cite are misleading — skewed by massive tax breaks for millionaires. 
Here in West Virginia, the bottom 40% of households are expected to see their taxes increase compared with what they pay now, while the median household will get a tax cut less than half the size of the “average” touted by bill supporters. Meanwhile, the wealthiest households will reap the biggest benefits, with 80 percent going to the wealthiest 10 percent of households. Once you factor in tariffs and other provisions, independent experts project that by 2027, 99 percent of households nationwide will actually be worse off financially.
Cuts to health care and food assistance hit West Virginians hard
The real story of the bill isn’t tax cuts — it’s what those cuts cost. To pay for giveaways to the wealthy, Congress enacted the deepest cuts to Medicaid and SNAP in our nation’s history. In our state, that means more than 50,000 West Virginians will lose their health coverage and 33,000 risk losing food assistance. That includes seniors, veterans, parents and people who worked their whole lives but hit hard times. 
And those cuts will have rippling effects on all of us, whether we directly rely on the programs or not. Rather than increasing the workforce by “getting people to work” as promised, West Virginia is expected to see a loss of 6,000 jobs resulting from deep reductions in federal funds that currently go to health care providers, hospitals and grocers. Experts say both wages and GDP will fall as a result of the legislation, while the national debt will rise by trillions of dollars.
Hospitals that serve a significant Medicaid population will see reduced payments and higher uncompensated care (bills that go unpaid). Combined, this is expected to result in layoffs, reductions in health care services, higher prices for private insurance, and even hospital closures. Just this month, a medical group in Virginia announced the closure of three health care clinics in response to “the One Big Beautiful Bill and the resulting realities for healthcare delivery.”
Rising costs and hungry families
And while our members of Congress have promised that we have years to prepare, health care providers are making hard choices now, and some of the provisions will be felt right away. The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced this month that states are expected to start implementing new SNAP restrictions now. This will result in parents, veterans and older retired West Virginians up to 64 years old losing critical food assistance. Increases in hunger will drive more people to food pantries that are already stretched thin with need and the high cost of groceries. In January, state lawmakers will have to grapple with finding money in the state budget to cover the federal SNAP and Medicaid costs Congress forced onto the states. 
Add in the tariffs baked into this bill, and everyday costs will keep climbing — from groceries to household goods — while paychecks don’t stretch as far. No one feels that squeeze more than working families here at home. 
West Virginians deserve better
Supporters of HR 1 want to frame this debate as simply about tax cuts. That’s because when you zoom out, the picture is devastating: The wealthy get ahead while West Virginia families lose health care, food assistance and jobs, and see costs rise. Polling shows most Americans already believe this law benefits the rich at the expense of the rest of us — and they’re right. 
While the fallout is already beginning, it is not too late to change course. Congress can reverse the most harmful provisions of HR 1 and put forward a real plan to lower costs, strengthen health care, and invest in communities. That’s what West Virginians need — not another round of broken promises and handouts to those at the very top.

Ted Budd’s office in Wilmington to demand his support for VA workers on Friday, Sept. 12, 2025. (Photo: Brandon Kingdollar/NC Newsline)Veterans, nurses, and union activists called on Sen. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) to back the rights of federal workers and help restore collective bargaining agreements with the Department of Veterans Affairs in a protest Friday.
Immediately after the conclusion of the North Carolina AFL-CIO convention, labor leaders led a march to Budd’s office in Wilmington, where they rallied for an hour before dispersing. The protest drew veterans from across the armed forces, with representation from the U.S. Army, the Air Force, Marine Corps, and the Navy, who condemned cuts to the VA as well as President Donald Trump’s decision to end collective bargaining agreements with the department.
“The VA must be fully funded for the veterans who earned it, not gutted to billionaires that put profits over patients,” said Wray Faulkner, a nurse with the Durham VA. “This attack on our union rights is only the beginning. Every worker in this country is at risk. And when they starve the VA of funding, they weaken the public services we all rely on.”
Members of National Nurses United, who spearheaded the protest, attempted to deliver a pledge to Budd calling on him to support collective bargaining rights for the VA, demand an end to reductions in force, and stop money flowing out of the VA to private hospitals.
Labor activists also called on Budd to back two bills, the Protect America’s Workforce Act and the VA Employee Fairness Act, intended to protect federal workers and restore their collective bargaining rights.
Demonstrators said that the office was closed and Budd was not present, so they left their list of demands at his door.




“I did my job, I served this country, I went down range, I did what they asked, but men like him are taking those rights away from me,” said Tony McKinnon, an Army airborne veteran and North Carolina president of the United Postal Workers Union. “What he’s doing is an abomination.”
Budd’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
In a statement earlier this month, VA spokesperson Pete Kasperowicz wrote that the termination of the collective bargaining agreements did not cause any job losses, and argued that the department’s services have only improved under the Trump administration.
“Terminating contracts for VA unions — which have repeatedly opposed significant, bipartisan VA reforms and rewarded bad employees for misconduct — is a huge win for Veterans,” Kasperowicz wrote. “Because of this decision, VA staff will spend more time with Veterans, VA facilities can focus on treating Veterans instead of catering to union bosses, and VA can manage its staff according to Veterans’ needs, not union demands.”
Salette Andrews, a member of the Charlotte City Council and an Air Force veteran, said ending collective bargaining means silencing voices speaking out against changes at the VA that compromise patient care and condemned the department for reducing its staff by 30,000 under Trump. “Veterans need more nurses, more doctors, more staff, not less,” Andrews said.
“VA nurses and federal workers have been on the front lines for years, caring for our veterans, speaking out for patient safety, and fighting back against attempts to dismantle one of our nation’s most vital public institutions,” she added. “This is the care our veterans earned, and it must never be sold off to the highest bidder.”
Also among the protesters was Braxton Winston II, the newly elected president of the NC AFL-CIO. Resisting cuts to the federal workforce was a major theme of the second day of the NC AFL-CIO’s convention in Wilmington.
Winston criticized Budd for signing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — which his colleague, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) broke with the Trump administration to vote against — but said he still had the opportunity to oppose privatizing the VA and help restore collective bargaining rights for government employees.
“We know that he signed the wrong legislation in this past July, when he cut billions of dollars from Medicaid,” Winston said, eliciting cries of “shame” from the crowd. “But look, we are an inclusive movement. We believe in redemption. Senator Budd has the chance to do the right thing, and he can start doing that today.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P9124094-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-17 05:56:34.145395

(Getty Images)If you or someone you know is in crisis, call or text 988 to reach trained counselors 24/7. You are not alone.
In Louisville, we are losing too many lives to suicide — and the data from our recent suicide fatality report makes that heartbreakingly clear.

Read the Suicide Fatality Review Report.

From 2020 to 2023, nearly 80% of suicide deaths in our community were among men. That’s a sharp increase from 67% in 2019. Over half of all deaths involved a firearm. And deaths among Black and Hispanic/Latino individuals have more than doubled in recent years.
These numbers are not just statistics. They are fathers, daughters, coworkers, neighbors — people who matter deeply to someone. People who should still be here.
Suicide is a complex public health issue, but it is also preventable. That’s why Louisville Metro Government, in collaboration with the coroner’s office, the county attorney and community partners from higher education, mental and behavioral health, and primary health care are working to understand the patterns behind these tragedies and find ways to intervene before it’s too late.
Here’s what we’ve learned — and what we must do:
Men are at increased risk. We need targeted outreach and support, especially in male-dominated industries like construction, transportation and manufacturing, where suicide rates are higher.
Over half of suicides involved firearms. Safe storage saves lives.
Suicide affects more than the individual. Nearly a third of cases involved someone else present at the time of death or immediately after. These witnesses — often family or friends — are at increased risk and need support.
Racial disparities are growing. Deaths among Black and Hispanic/Latino individuals have surged. Prevention efforts must be culturally responsive and community driven.
Everyone in our community has a role to play.

Business and community leaders: Offer suicide prevention training like QPR (Question, Persuade, Refer) or Mental Health First Aid to employees. Make mental health resources visible and accessible.
All residents: Learn the warning signs. Talk openly about mental health. Support loved ones who may be struggling. Lock up firearms. Share the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline.
Get involved: Visit afsp.org/chapter/kentucky to learn more about suicide prevention or volunteer. Explore ky988data.org for real-time data and resources.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Sam Harris, who was incarcerated for 24 years in Virginia until last summer, wants “to be a face for second chances.” 
“There are a lot more like me in there,” he said of the roughly 22,000 people behind bars in Virginia as he sat on the steps of the state Capitol building — the place where a change in state law allowed him to begin working towards his goal of representing redemption in earnest. 
With parole all but eliminated in Virginia 30 years ago, reinstating it has been a political nonstarter. Some lawmakers have agreed to pathways like Enhanced Earned Sentence Credits (EESC), which allow qualifying inmates the chance to prove their progress in the Department of Corrections and trim some time off of their sentences. 
And a limited few, like Harris, can petition governors for pardons. Despite Gov. Glenn Youngkin having granted Harris’ request in 2023, he still had to remain behind bars until July, when the use of EESC allowed his release. 
He said he’s taking his personal life slowly — no dating, no alcohol, focusing on reconnecting with friends and family in Hampton Roads. But professionally, he’s fired up about the nonprofit Reentry and Recovery Alliance he started to help support ex-offenders as they reenter society. 
While plenty of other success stories like Harris’ can be found among the Virginians released through EESC, the program’s longtime opponent Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is running for reelection, remains cautious about existing recidivism and has reignited fresh calls to undo the program. 
 A highly politicized program

Miyares’ reasons for attacking the program are not unfounded. He has pointed to VADOC data showing between 49% and 35% of people released via EESC in 2023 and 2024 were rearrested. Of the 35% of those rearrested since last year, nearly 19% of those people were reconvicted and 5% were reincarcerated. 
The bulk of the offences that resulted in new convictions were property related or supervision violations (like missing a meeting with probation officers), according to a more detailed report shared by House Republican Caucus communications director Garren Shipley. There were also four reconvictions for murder and three for manslaughter.
Miyares leans in on law-and-order message ahead of 2025 election

In his reelection bid, Miyares has also attacked opponent Democrat Jay Jones for supporting the law — alleging that violent reoffender charges are Jones’ fault because he supports EESC.
At a July  press conference featuring crime victims, Miyares said EESC “forces the Virginia Department of Corrections to release offenders whose recidivism assessment score still lists them as a high risk for violent reoffending and a high risk for general reoffending.”
Proponents of EESC say the recidivism is low enough to show that the majority of people that earn their second chance aren’t wasting it. 
The program is also young enough to still be proving itself. The full scope of it was  implemented just last summer, with a portion of it taking effect in 2022. 
But the program has been highly politicized every step of the way.
First championed by Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, an ex-felon who made history as Virginia’s first Black House Speaker, the law passed in 2020 with a delayed enactment. At the time, both Miyares and Jones were serving as delegates in the chamber. Jones voted in favor, and Miyares voted against it. 
By 2022, Miyares was attorney general and Youngkin used budget language to block the full implementation of EESC. Miyares’ continued advocacy against the law seemingly spurred Youngkin to continue blocking it until he permitted it to take full effect last summer. Earlier this year he pivoted back to undoing it, but his proposal did not survive budget negotiations. 
Between the longstanding efforts of Miyares and Youngkin to block the program, in 2023 the state supreme court found the administration had unlawfully kept eligible prisoners behind bars. 
Now, as campaign season heightens, Miyares has taken fresh aim at the program. 
On July 14, Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell sent a letter to VADOC director Chad Dotson to kick off a conversation about “any ways we can make the program stronger to address (Miyares’) concerns instead of only focusing on reverting to 1990-era prison policy.” 
Writing on behalf of himself and other lawmakers, Surovell said the cohort was “concerned that the annual whipsawing” about EESC from Youngkin and Miyares paired with multiple court orders “have made it difficult for your staff to plan and implement the existing system.”
In a recent call with The Mercury, Surovell suggested Miyares may have had his hand on the scale all along to sabotage the program’s effectiveness. 
“We need to examine whether or not the governor and the attorney general, with the attorney general’s advice, have worked in a way to undermine the effectiveness of the program,” he said in a recent call with The Mercury. 
When the law passed, state funding was earmarked to implement it. Surovell explained “it costs money on the front end” to provide services to help people prepare to be released, but that the goal is to reduce recidivism in the first place. 
Surovell said “it’s just not clear to me that money was invested the way it was supposed to be,” because “the Youngkin administration has been fighting it from the very beginning.”

Miyares did not make himself available for an interview for this story or respond to questions about his current stance on EESC. Jones declined to comment. 
 ‘A whirlwind of goodness’

In the meantime, beneficiaries of EESC praise the role it had in their reform.

Lynchburg-area resident Reece Neenan emphasized how EESC gave him incentive to keep up the self-improvement he at times didn’t feel inspired to undertake while incarcerated. He also credits a program called Helping Addicts Recover Progressively (HARP) with tackling underlying issues that drove him to crime. 
Neenan now balances college with full-time work at Campbell Heating and Cooling. But his most important job is the one that previously didn’t earn him the best reviews: being a father. 
He said his now 20-year-old son has had reservations about whether or not Neenan had reformed himself from his criminal past and the addictions that contributed to it. His son had also felt pressure to help support the family in lieu of pursuing schooling or a career of his choice, Neenan said. Now, the younger man is pursuing work he cares about and believes in his father. 
“He sees it now, it’s not me telling him,” Neenan said. “He sees the new me and I love it. No matter how down I was or how bad drugs had gotten, that’s not my story anymore.”
Are there exceptions to the rule, people who relapse and reoffend? “Of course,” Neenan said.
“But for the most part,” he added, “people I know out here are staying out of trouble because it’s easy now.”
Neenan described this new chapter in his life as “a whirlwind of goodness” and one that he and Harris hope more people can experience.

RICHMOND, Va. — A new political party is gaining traction in Virginia and has endorsed a candidate for lieutenant governor, along with competitive House seats in the Nov. 4 election.
The Working Families Party is a progressive third-party organization founded as a New York State political party in 1988. They focus on improved living conditions, collective freedom and equality, and reject the two-party system to “ensure everyone can thrive.”
The party endorsed state Sen. Ghazala Hashmi as Virginia’s next lieutenant governor. Hashmi, a Democrat, is running against Republican John Reid. All of the Virginia candidates endorsed by the WFP are Democrats, but not all Democrats are endorsed.
The WFP supports candidates who reflect the values of working-class people, engage in meaningful work outside of politics and run strong campaigns, according to its senior political director Vidal Hines. The party ranked New York representative Zohran Mamdani No.1 of the New York City mayoral candidates in the primary. Mamdani defeated former governor Andrew Cuomo and will face incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, Republican Curtis Sliwa, and Cuomo—who stayed on the ballot.
Hines oversees the political and operational aspects for the WFP in Washington, Maryland and Virginia. He interfaces with officials, partners, labor unions and the public to support candidates’ work on legislative initiatives and community organizing.
The WFP wants to help preserve the Democratic majority in the House of Delegates and potentially broaden its three-seat lead with a few flipped seat opportunities, according to Hines.
However, the WFP does not support Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger, due to her rejection of the repeal of Virginia’s right-to-work law, he said.
“We feel like that’s a direct assault towards working people in the state, and to labor,” he said.
Spanberger does not align with the WFP’s core values, and “endorsement, resources, and time” will not be put into her candidacy, according to Hines.
The WFP has expanded and endorsed candidates in 26 states, according to its website. It sees itself as a home to advance and protect marginalized communities. Under the Youngkin and Trump administrations, these communities are not only unprioritized, but attacked, according to Hines.
“We see that very significantly with our immigrant communities, right? Where people are being literally pulled off the streets,” Hines said. “It’s scary and I think it is setting a tone that is only going to continue to hurt everyday working people.”
The party wants to show it cares about their votes even at a time when other institutions do not, according to Hines.
Idris O’Connor, current president of the Young Democrats of Prince William and Manassas, helped expand the WFP into Virginia.
“This upcoming election is very pivotal for our state,” O’Connor said. “It is important that this election, we as a party, but also voters, support candidates that will stand up for working families.”
O’Connor backs attorney general nominee Jay Jones, a former Norfolk delegate, for his work in consumer protection and civil rights advocacy; Hashmi for her education background and support; and Spanberger for promoting affordable housing and accessible health care.
However, he acknowledged the disagreement with Spanberger’s stance on Virginia’s right-to-work law and said that labor unions were “not too happy about that.”
The WFP also endorsed Democrat Elizabeth Guzmán for the 22nd District House of Delegates seat, which encompasses parts of Prince William County. Guzmán, a former legislator, is focused on affordable housing and childcare, increased minimum wage, paid leave and strong, accessible public schools, she stated.
Guzmán is fighting for a seat in a competitive district against Republican incumbent Del. Ian Lovejoy.
 “The stakes could not be higher,” and a win means securing progressive victories on issues such as collective bargaining and accessible health care, she stated.
“[The WFP] vision of building a multiracial, labor-led coalition that puts working-class voices front and center is exactly what this moment calls for, and I am proud to stand with them again,” Guzmán stated.
The WFP helped launch her historic win as one of the first Latinas elected into the state’s House of Delegates in 2017, according to Guzmán.
The WFP is looking to grow their volunteer network through its “Wolf Pack.” Information is available on the party’s website.
Other Democratic candidates endorsed by the party include:


District 65: Incumbent Del. Josh Cole vs. Republican challenger Sean Steinway


District 66: Nicole Cole vs. Republican incumbent Del. Bobby Orrock


District 71: Jessica Anderson vs. Republican incumbent Del. Amanda Batten


District 73: Leslie Mehta vs. Republican incumbent Del. Mark Earley Jr.


District 82: Kimberly Pope Adams vs. Republican incumbent Del. Kim Taylor


District 84: Incumbent Del. Nadarius Clark vs. Republican challenger Felisha Rose Leffler Storm

But the effects of snowpack decline go far beyond what’s visible, and researchers working in the forests of New Hampshire and the Northeast are learning more about just how far the phenomenon stretches across seasons and landscapes. Their findings reveal how much tracking snow can tell us about the health of our forests and our world, and what is still to learn.
The average amount of snow that accumulates on the ground throughout the winter season, or snowpack, is shrinking from year to year across the Northeast. While data has captured that effect (and linked it to human-caused climate change), many who live and recreate in the region have noticed it in their own lives — including the researchers who later took up the matter in their work.
“I grew up cross-country skiing with my family,” said Emerson Conrad-Rooney, a doctoral student at Boston University whose work focuses on the effects of climate change on northern forests. Conrad-Rooney, who grew up in western Massachusetts, said the places they had grown up skiing through the winter were, in recent years, open only a handful of days all season long. “That’s been kind of separate from this research I’m doing, but just something that me and my family have seen … We’re, I think, definitely feeling that change,” they said.
Eric Kelsey, a meteorologist and researcher at Plymouth State University, also grew up an enthusiastic winter recreator in Nashua. A love of snow and weather led Kelsey to learn more about the integral role of snowpack to the water cycle. But as he read more, Kelsey was struck by the relative lack of cohesive, long-term snowpack data, especially compared to other weather datasets tracking things like daily high and low temperatures and rainfall.
“We just don’t have a climatology of snowpack — that was surprising to me,” Kelsey said.
The problem, Kelsey said, was not necessarily a lack of data. For more than a century, people across the Northeast have logged information about snowfall, from dam operators attempting to predict how snowmelt would affect their rivers to farmers and ski slope proprietors.

Most tracked snow depth and snow water equivalent (the amount of water contained in that snow, a measure that fluctuates with snow density). Their observations, taken as a whole, are a rich collection of information about snowfall in New England, Kelsey said. But the records were also scattered and disparate, making it difficult for scientists to unlock the information they contained. 
Now, Kelsey and Plymouth State graduate student David Zywiczynski are halfway through a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration grant-funded effort to unify and clean that data, which includes measurements taken over yearslong periods from more than 400 sites. Then, they hope, scientists will be able to use it to make sense of long-term patterns in local snowpack, from general decline to years of snow drought — or abnormally low snowfall conditions.
Because snowpack plays an important role in replenishing streams, lakes, and aquifers when it melts each spring, a tool to identify snow drought with more certainty could help forecasters anticipate the dry conditions that will likely persist later in the year, Kelsey said. The “snow drought index” Kelsey and Zywiczynski are working on to facilitate that may be the first tool of its kind in the nation.
As historic data is put to work at Plymouth State, elsewhere in New Hampshire, scientists are tracking ongoing changes in forests as they unfold. 
Just beneath Mount Washington in Pinkham Notch, Appalachian Mountain Club Senior Scientist Georgia Murray oversees the collection of daily snowpack depth and snow water equivalent measurements. Data collected in the notch and above at the Mount Washington Observatory stretches back to the 1930s, Murray said, constituting one of the longer sets of continuous snowpack observations available in the region. 
Measurements from the two relatively close sites are often very different on the same day, highlighting how difficult it can be to assess snowpack, Murray said. Unlike rain, snow blows around once it falls, clearing off some areas completely and piling up in others. Having data from as many sites as possible is desirable for a more comprehensive understanding, Murray said, so she also works to encourage citizen scientists to measure and submit snowpack data across the region through a smartphone app.
“It’s complex with snowpack, because you have, you know, nooks and crannies across the mountain, and so you have so many ways that snow is distributed differently. Having citizen science data fill in the gaps is something we really value in the mountain ecosystem, where we can’t be everywhere,” Murray said.
Citizen science data also helps keep track of the downstream effects of snowpack decline, including its impact on plant life. Plants rely on natural cues to time their life cycles; when some cues, like the presence of snow, change while others, like day length, do not, they may be negatively impacted, Murray said.
“In climate change, there can be these mismatches of synchronicity,” she said. 
Furthermore, as snow melts in spring, the water it releases carries nutrients through the soil, making them more available to the roots of hungry and thirsty young plants. But data shows that the timing of snow melt is changing, too, starting earlier and lasting for longer. Murray hopes citizen data will help shine a light on what that could mean for White Mountain plants, from delicate spring ephemeral wildflowers to alpine trees.
“The snowmelt timing has a strong impact in the spring, and can have a ripple effect over the growing season,” she said.
Understanding those and other ripple effects of snowpack decline is crucial to making informed predictions about what the future might bring for New England, researchers said.
Pamela Templer, chair of the Biology department at Boston University and a researcher who has studied northern forests for more than two decades, established a set of three research plots at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, in the White Mountains, about 10 years ago. The goal of the study, entitled “Climate Change Across Seasons Experiment,” or CCASE, was to assess how seasonal changes play off each other in yearly cycles.
Before that study, researchers had shown that in summer, temperate forests experienced some positive effects from growing seasons that were stretching longer, Templer said. Separate studies, including in Templer’s own work, had revealed the negative impacts on temperate forests from warming winters. But Templer wanted to assess those two phenomena together.
“We didn’t know at that point what the net effect of those two changes in climate were on the forest,” Templer said.
To do so, Templer and her team — including Conrad-Rooney and “a village” of other researchers — simulated the freeze-thaw cycle, which can occur in the forest floor when it is not protected by an insulating layer of snow, by removing snow in some plots and heating the ground before allowing it to re-freeze. Precise measurements of the trees within the plot, taken over the 10 years the study has run so far, tracked the forest’s growth and the amount of carbon it was storing away over that period.
The work is a demonstration of one of the many ways snowpack decline can add stress into an ecosystem, said Kelsey, who was not involved in the study. 
To a tree, damage from repeated freezing and thawing “is, you know, like getting a cut on your finger,” Kelsey said. “It hurts, it will take some resources from your body to heal it, that could be doing other things… And as we know, if there’s too many stressors on a tree, it will die. So this is just adding another stressor to the trees. That’s not good.”
Ultimately, Templer, Conrad-Rooney, and researcher Andrew Reinmann concluded in a study published this July that the benefits to trees from longer growing seasons were outweighed by the damage those trees suffered from repeated freeze-thaw cycles in the winter. That finding, they said, reveals that previous models projecting forests’ role in helping sequester carbon may have overestimated their role in absorbing greenhouse gas.
“If we think that forests are actually storing more carbon than is actually happening, then that means that, maybe, more carbon would be going into our atmosphere than we realize,” Conrad-Rooney said. 
This realization has implications for scientists’ ability to model ecosystem changes into the future. It could also inform land conservation decisions, Templer said.
“We need an accurate accounting,” she said. “If we’re going to use forests as nature-based solutions to climate change in terms of sequestering carbon, then we need to know how much they’re sequestering.”
Researchers expect that as they continue to examine historic and current snowpack data, more effects and ripples of snowpack decline will emerge.
From its role in keeping lakes cool through the summer to protecting the landscape from wildfire, snow impacts the water cycle all year long, Kelsey said. And – as is evident both in the origin of the field’s data and its implications – the study of snow brings together many interests, including those of industry, agriculture, tourism, homeowners with wells, and more.
“It touches our lives in so many ways,” Murray said. “… We hope that people see the science that we’re doing, so that they can understand what’s happening, and how it links to their lives and the outdoors.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/snowpack-1-1024x578.jpg,,,2025-09-17 05:56:34.145395

The companies frantically building and leasing data centers are well aware that they’re straining grids, driving emissions, and guzzling water. The electricity demand of AI data centers in particular could increase as much as 165 percent by 2030. Over half of the energy powering these sprawling facilities comes from fossil fuels, threatening to reverse progress toward addressing the climate crisis.
Some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence say they have a solution: Just stick these colossal computer clusters in space. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told manosphere podcaster Theo Vonn that he considers a massive expansion of data centers inevitable.  “I do guess a lot of the world gets covered in data centers over time,” he said. (This is not, in fact, inevitable, but the result of unfathomably wealthy companies choosing to invest unfathomably large sums of money. Altman has speculated that he would quite literally put trillions into it, and OpenAI is part of the consortium behind the $500 billion Stargate project.)
Altman is aware, however, that some people might not like this. “I’ve spoken with environmentalists,” he said. Then, he offered a suggestion. “Maybe we put [ data centers] in space,” he said. “I wish I had, like, more concrete answers for you, but like, we’re stumbling through this.”
Now, the idea of hurling data centers, the largest of which can cover over a million square feet, into orbit may seem impractical. But Altman’s not alone in considering it. Jeff Bezos and Eric Schmidt are also betting on the idea.
Altman has proposed creating a Dyson sphere of data centers around the sun, referring to a hypothetical megastructure built around a star to capture much of its energy. The rather glaring downside to this is that building it would likely require more resources than exist on Earth, and could make the planet uninhabitable. But somewhat more realistic plans are inching closer to reality. Startups like Starcloud, Axiom, and Lonestar Data Systems have raised millions to develop them.
There are at least 5,400 data centers in the United States, ranging from micro-size to thousand-server “hyperscalers,” and the number is growing fast. These facilities are expected to consume up to 12 percent of the nation’s electricity by 2028. Putting them in space, then, can seem like a panacea: solving the energy-use problem with 24/7 solar power, and freeing communities from the burden of air, noise, and water pollution.
There’s some real science behind this. Ali Hajimiri, an electrical engineer and professor with Caltech’s Space Solar Power Project, sought a patent for a “massively parallel computational system in space” — as in, a data center — back in 2016. Since then, launch costs have gone down (to around $1,500 per kilogram, by one estimate) and solar panels have gotten lighter and more efficient. Hajimiri and his colleagues recently proposed a lightweight space-based solar power system that could generate electricity at 10 cents per kilowatt-hour, significantly cheaper at scale than comparable systems here on Earth. Such technology theoretically could power orbital data centers like those Altman imagines, though Hajimiri is still not sure when they could be built at the kind of scale companies like OpenAI demand. “I never want to say something cannot be done,” he said. “But there are challenges associated with it.”
For one thing, the systems he imagines process data relatively slowly compared to those on terra firma. They’d be constantly bombarded by radiation, and “obsolescence would be a problem” because making repairs or upgrades would be confoundingly difficult. Hajimiri believes that data centers in space could, someday, be a viable solution but hesitates to say when that day might come. “Definitely it would be doable in a few years,” he said. “The question is how effective they would be, and how cost-effective they would become.”
The idea of simply putting data centers in orbit is not limited to the off-hand musings of techies or the deeper thought of academics. Even some elected officials in cities where companies like Amazon hope to build data centers are raising the point. Tucson, Arizona, councilmember Nikki Lee waxed poetic about their potential during an August hearing, in which the council unanimously voted down a proposed data center in their city.
“A lot of people are saying data centers don’t belong in the desert,” Lee said. But “if this is truly a national priority,” then the focus must be on “putting federal research and development dollars into looking at data centers that will exist in space. And that may sound wild to you all and a little science fiction, but it’s actually happening.”
That’s true, but it’s happening on an experimental scale, not an industrial one. A startup called Starcloud hoped to launch a refrigerator-sized satellite housing a few Nvidia chips in August, but the launch date was pushed back. Lonestar Data Systems landed a miniature data center, carrying precious information like an Imagine Dragons song, on the moon a few months ago, though the lander tipped over and died in the attempt. More such launches are planned for the coming months. But it’s “very hard to predict how quickly this idea will become economically feasible,” said Matthew Weinzierl, a Harvard University economist who studies market forces in space.
“Space-based data centers may well have some niche uses, such as for processing space-based data and providing national security capabilities,” he said. “To be a meaningful rival to terrestrial centers, however, they will need to compete on cost and service quality like anything else.”
For now, it’s much more expensive to put a data center in space than it is to put one in, say, Virginia’s Data Center Valley, where power demand could double in the next decade if left unregulated. And as long as staying on Earth remains cheaper, profit-motivated companies will favor terrestrial data-center expansion.
Still, there is one factor that might encourage OpenAI and others to look toward the heavens: There isn’t much regulation up there. Building data centers on Earth requires obtaining municipal permits, and companies can be stymied by local governments whose residents worry that data center development might siphon their water, raise their electricity bills, or overheat their planet. In space, there aren’t any neighbors to complain, said Michelle Hanlon, a political scientist and lawyer who leads the Center for Air and Space law at the University of Mississippi.
“If you are a U.S. company seeking to put data centers in space, then the sooner the better, before Congress is like, ‘Oh, we need to regulate that.’”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)At least 17 states have taken steps to ensure broader access to the COVID-19 vaccine since last month, when the federal government significantly restricted eligibility for the shot.
Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin have issued orders that aim to make it easier for people to get the COVID-19 vaccine. All but Virginia have Democratic governors.
Together, the moves represent an extraordinary state rebellion against the public health authority of the federal government.
For decades, states have followed the lead of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on which vaccines Americans should get, and when they should get them. Now, rejecting the antivaccine stance of U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., an increasing number of states say they will rely instead on their own public health experts and professional medical organizations for that advice.
States break with FDA restrictions on COVID vaccines, ensuring broader access

Previously, the FDA recommended that the COVID-19 vaccine booster be available to anyone 6 months or older. But in August, the federal agency said the booster shot should be limited to two specific groups: people who are 65 and older, and anyone who is at least six 6 months old and has an underlying health condition, such as asthma or obesity, that increases the risk of a COVID-19 infection becoming severe.
Under the new guidelines, children under 18 without an underlying condition can only get the shot if a health care provider is consulted first, meaning parents can’t simply take their kids to a vaccination clinic or pharmacy.
“The American people demanded science, safety, and common sense. This framework delivers all three,” Kennedy wrote on the social media platform X on Aug. 27.
In June, Kennedy ousted the entire vaccine advisory committee at the CDC, replacing some of them with vaccine skeptics. The previous month, he announced that the federal government would no longer recommend that pregnant women get the vaccine.
Currently 43 states — all but Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Oregon, Utah and West Virginia, along with the District of Columbia — allow pharmacies to administer FDA-approved shots without a prescription, according to Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS Health.
But the federal government’s new COVID-19 recommendations have sown confusion. Many people are unsure whether their local pharmacy will give them the shot without a prescription — and if so, whether their health insurance will pay for it.
In the 17 states that have acted thus far, governors and state public health officials are trying to clear up that confusion, empower pharmacists to administer the shot and, in some cases, mandate that insurers pay for it.
As Florida plans to end all vaccine mandates, Western states form vaccine alliance

The latest state to act is Wisconsin. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers signed an executive order Monday directing state health officials to create policies that ease vaccine restrictions, and requiring insurers to keep covering the COVID-19 shot.
“Vaccines save lives, folks. Spreading fear, distrust, and disinformation about safe and effective vaccines isn’t just reckless, it’s dangerous,” Evers said in a news release. “RFK and the Trump administration are inserting partisan politics into health care and the science-based decisions of medical professionals and are putting the health and lives of kids, families, and folks across our state at risk in the process.”
In addition to Wisconsin, Colorado, Massachusetts and Rhode Island have required insurers to cover the shot, and Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs’s executive order calls on state insurance regulators to “encourage” insurers to do so.
In many of the states, including Arizona, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico and Rhode Island, the governor or the chief public health officer issued a standing order clarifying that pharmacies can administer the vaccine without a prescription.
Earlier this month, New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul issued an executive order allowing pharmacies in her state to administer the shot to anyone 3 or older through October 5. The order can be renewed, pending action by the legislature.
And in Connecticut, Delaware and Pennsylvania, state authorities directed pharmacists to follow the vaccine recommendations issued by professional groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
North Carolina Democratic Gov. Josh Stein issued an order stating that pharmacies can administer the COVID-19 vaccine without a prescription to all adults over 65 and anyone over 18 with a broad range of underlying health conditions. Virginia’s top public health official issued a similar order.
Despite federal shift, state health officials encourage COVID vaccines for pregnant women

Earlier this month, the Democratic governors of California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington announced the formation of the West Coast Health Alliance to coordinate vaccine recommendations for their states. The states pledged to use guidelines based on advice from leading medical organizations.
Meanwhile, Republican-controlled Florida doubled down on Kennedy’s antivaccine stance, announcing plans to become the first state to phase out all vaccine mandates, including ending requirements that kids be vaccinated against dangerous diseases before enrolling in schools.
At a news conference earlier this month, Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo said vaccine mandates are “immoral.”
“Every last one of them is wrong and drips with disdain and slavery,” Ladapo said of such requirements.
In Louisiana, Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, who is a physician, suggested last week that state Surgeon General Ralph Abraham should issue a blanket prescription for anyone who wants the COVID-19 shot, the Shreveport Times reported.
Republican Gov. Jeff Landry responded angrily on X.
“The last time I checked you have a prescription pad, why don’t you just leave a prescription for the dangerous Covid shot at your district office and anyone can swing by and get one! I am sure big pharma would love you for that one!” Landry wrote.

The decision will affect the hospital’s labor and delivery unit as well as Clear Creek OBGYN, a separate center which provides reproductive care for patients at all stages of life.
The closure of St. Mary’s labor and delivery unit in Lavonia is one of the first Georgia-based casualties of the federal budget reconciliation package, colloquially known as the “big beautiful bill.” Hospital administrators say the bill, which included a $1 trillion cut to Medicaid funding, contributed to their decision to consolidate OB/GYN services, though it was not the only factor.
“This decision follows an extensive 18-month discernment process that included intensive efforts to recruit additional physicians, create new partnerships, and pursue incremental funding sources,” St. Mary’s, which is owned by Trinity Health Georgia, said in a statement. “Changing demographics in our region, physician recruitment challenges, increasing outmigration for labor and delivery services, and recent Congressional cuts to Medicaid solidified this decision.”
Pregnant patients in at least four Northeast Georgia counties will now be transferred to other facilities, such as St. Mary’s Hospital in Athens, which is over an hour from Lavonia by car. Sacred Heart Hospital’s Emergency Department will still be able to deliver babies in emergency situations, according to a press release, but will not be equipped to help patients who need a “higher level of care.”
The decision also comes as part of a growing trend of rural hospitals closing their labor and delivery units amid budget shortfalls. As of last month, only 36% of Georgia’s rural hospitals still provided labor and delivery services, according to data from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform.
‘The most draconian cuts imaginable’: Health care providers, advocates brace for Medicaid cuts

Health care experts have warned that recent federal Medicaid cuts could accelerate those closures, particularly those in rural areas, where health care providers rely on funding from Medicaid to sustain their facilities. In Georgia, 45% of all births are covered by Medicaid, according to nonprofit health policy research organization KFF. That number jumps to nearly 60% in rural areas.
Closing obstetric services can also harm a community’s economic development, said HomeTown Health CEO Jimmy Lewis, since hospitals are often the main employer in an area. 
“Over a period of the last five to 10 years, we’ve closed somewhere in the vicinity of 14 baby delivery systems,” Lewis said. “And when they close, it puts the community in an extremely adverse situation, both from a health care standpoint and from an economic development standpoint.”
Other hospitals in Georgia are also discussing scaling back services, citing federal cuts to Medicaid. Evans Memorial Hospital, which closed its labor and delivery services in 2010, is now contemplating closing down its Intensive Care Unit due to a $3.3 million budget shortfall. Though the budget reconciliation bill set aside a $50 billion fund intended to offset the impact of the Medicaid cuts, it is up to state governments to apply for and distribute the money.
U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, a Democrat who opposed the Republican-backed reconciliation bill, criticized the service cuts during an appearance at First Congregational Church in Atlanta Sunday.
“It’s not a mystery that in a flourishing society, the means of achieving health and long life are a right accessible to all, and not just to those who live in the right place or have the means,” Ossoff said. “Especially when the disappearance of those services for the people is a result of the pursuit of other priorities, namely to further enrich those who already have the most.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-17 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT slashes more debt – but not from pensions,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/17/ct-slashes-more-debt-state-worker-health-care/,Connecticut wiped out nearly a third of the unfunded obligations in its health care program for retired state workers.,"Though Connecticut’s successful slashing of its pension debt dominates the headlines, state officials and workers have collaboratively reduced another onerous burden dramatically over the past five years.
Connecticut had wiped out nearly one-third of the unfunded obligations involving its health care program for retired state workers entering last fiscal year — almost $7.4 billion since 2020, according to a new report from the legislature’s nonpartisan Office of Fiscal Analysis.
When that burden gets out of hand, it mirrors the state’s pension debt and consumes a disproportionate share of the budget, pulling dollars away from education, town aid and other core programs.
But the risk is far from eliminated. Retiree health care debt was driven down by price-savings negotiated by insurance carriers and by unionized workers agreeing to pump hundreds of millions annually to help fund the benefit — but state officials can’t count on those same factors bearing the same fruit indefinitely.
“There are a lot of challenges that we face, but in the last 10 years, I think the story of Connecticut is getting our fiscal house in order,” said state Comptroller Sean Scanlon, whose office administers health care benefits to more than 85,600 retired state workers and their beneficiaries. “This is part of it.”
“Under Gov. [Ned] Lamont’s leadership, Connecticut continues to make progress in paying down its liabilities,” said Chris Collibee, the governor’s budget spokesman, who noted the trust fund for retiree health care — which didn’t exist two decades ago — entered this fiscal year holding more than $3.1 billion.
That’s enough resources to cover 16.2% of the $19.3 billion analysts estimate Connecticut needs to meet its contractual obligations to retirees in the decades to come.
At first glance, that’s far from the 56% funded assets-to-obligations ratio in the pension program for state retirees.
But just five years ago, Connecticut had put away slightly more than $1.5 billion toward its long-term retiree health care responsibilities, and projected obligations were priced at nearly $25.1 billion. That’s a funded ratio of just 6.1%.
Launched in 1978 by state law and later guaranteed through labor contracts, the retirement health care benefit originally had no pre-pay element.
Neither the state nor the workers set aside any money for this. Employees served residents for 10 years or more, and then future generations of taxpayers had to cover the promised benefit, plus inflation.
By the late 2000s, warning bells began to sound.
In 2009, the Center for State and Local Government Excellence found Connecticut’s retiree health care liability was the third-highest in the nation, behind only New Jersey and Hawaii.
That same year, Gov. M. Jodi Rell and state employee unions reached a deal that, for the first time, required some employees to contribute toward their retirement health care. It stipulated that new hires and current employees with less than five years of service would contribute 3% of their pay annually until their 10th year of service.
Through concessions packages in 2011 and 2017, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and unions expanded contributions requirements to all workers, increased the number of years they had to work to secure benefits from 10 to 15, forced state government to match employee contributions; created disincentives against early retirement; and established a worker wellness program.
A final component required retirees first to use the Medicare Advantage program, meaning 90% of the cost of health services to retired workers age 65 and older are borne by the federal government, not by the state.
And while worker contributions and state matches slowed the growth of debt in this program, the state began to shrink that debt in 2021 under then-Comptroller Natalie Braswell through a big premium savings negotiated with the Medicare Advantage plan carrier.
And when insurance companies sought big premium increases this year for health coverage for current and retired state workers, Scanlon was able to shave $77 million in savings over two years off those hikes.
“It’s a very difficult book of business right now for these companies, and we were able to renegotiate our contract recently that saved the taxpayers of Connecticut tens of millions of dollars,” Scanlon said.
Retirement health care still shifts costs onto future generations
But Scanlon quickly added, “We still have a long way to go, and I don’t think anybody is satisfied by just saying, ‘Hey, we’ve made some progress, and we’re good.’”
According to nonpartisan analysts, the state and its workers dedicated $770 million toward retirement health care in 2024.
But the program analysts say $956 million more was needed if the goal was to leave no expenses for future generations to cover.
The contract that guarantees state employees’ retirement health care benefits runs through June 30, 2027, and Lamont’s administration already is in talks with the State Employees Bargaining Agent Coalition, or SEBAC, about an extension.
Administration officials haven’t shared any details of those talks or if any benefit changes have been proposed.
But union officials, and many members of the General Assembly’s Democratic majority, have expressed fears that the concessions packages in 2009, 2011 and 2017 have watered down public-sector benefits significantly, contributing to understaffing at many state agencies.
“The work of our public workers is even more critical, but too many agencies are already facing crisis level staffing shortages,” SEBAC spokeswoman Drew Stoner said earlier this year when budget cuts threatened staffing in several departments.
Labor leaders and many Democratic lawmakers have called upon Lamont to scale back budget caps that have produced unprecedented surpluses, averaging more than $1.8 billion or 8% of the budget’s General Fund since 2017.
Those savings have been used chiefly to reduce pension debt and bolster reserves. The pension debt, which still exceeded $35 billion entering this past fiscal year and had been amassed over more than seven decades prior to 2011, has understandably become a top priority.
But critics say Connecticut could still could reduce pension debt — albeit at a slower pace — and redirect some dollars to bolster services, preserve worker benefit levels and enhance agency staffing.
Scanlon said his office always will pursue savings involving health care and insurance costs, but medical costs are very volatile, and negotiated premium discounts alone can’t eliminate all unfunded obligations involving retiree health care.
“When that [Medicare Advantage] contract is up again,” he added, “we’ll do what we always do, which is to try to save as much money for people as we can, while still providing the quality plan that people were promised.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0910_SR_StudentLoanRoundtable_139-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-17 05:56:34.145395

Credit: Pixabay.Nearly 10% of Ohio school districts need support to meet state standards, according to the new state report cards the Ohio Department of Education and Workforce released Monday. 
The department uses 1 to 5 star ratings in half increments based on six categories: achievement, progress, early literacy, gap closing, graduation and college, career, workforce, and military readiness.
The state stopped using the A-F letter grade system three years ago.

13 districts earned 2 stars — meaning those districts need support to meet state standards. 
44 districts earned 2.5 stars — Needs support to meet state standards.
102 districts earned 3 stars — Meets state standards.
159 districts earned 3.5 stars — Meets state standards.
147 districts earned 4 stars — Exceeds state standards.
95 districts earned 4.5 stars — meaning the distinct exceeds state standards.
47 districts earned 5 stars — significantly exceeds state standards.

Columbus City Schools, the state’s largest district, earned 2 stars. Toledo Public Schools also received 2 stars. Cincinnati Public Schools and Cleveland Municipal School District received 2.5 stars.

“We must act with urgency to ensure every student is equipped with the knowledge and life skills they need for the future,” said Department Director Stephen D. Dackin. “The Ohio School Report Cards are never an end point, but a building block for data-driven decisions that guide where to focus state and local resources, and, most importantly, how best to support Ohio students.” 
Reading proficiency dropped slightly from 60.9% in 2023-24 to 60.4% to 2024-25, according to the state report card. 
Math proficiency rates went up slightly from 53.5% in 2023-24 to 55.3% in 2024-25, according to the report card. 
The statewide chronic absenteeism rate — missing 10% or more of school hours for any reason — remained mostly steady at 25.1%, according to the report card.

The state’s four-year graduation rate had a slight bump to 88.3%, compared to last year’s 87.3%, according to the report card. 
Dayton Public Schools had the lowest graduate rate with 68.6%, followed by Canton City Schools and Lima City Schools with 72%, according to the state report card. 
This is the second school year school districts are required to teach the science of reading, which incorporates phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.  
For the early literacy category, 48 districts received 1 star; 164 districts received 2 stars; 259 districts earned 3 stars; 101 districts received 4 stars; and 33 districts received 5 stars. 
 “We must keep working to ensure our students grow in all areas of academic achievement and career readiness,” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said in a statement. “This is especially important as schools strengthen literacy instruction through the Science of Reading and as we continue investing in opportunities that prepare students for their futures after graduation.” 
The state report card also lists the number of students in each district that used one of five private school scholarships for the 2024-25 school year— the Autism Scholarship Program, the Jon Peterson Special Needs Scholarship Program, the Cleveland Scholarship, the Education Choice Scholarship, and the Educational Choice Expansion Scholarship Program. 
Ohio lawmakers expanded the Education Choice-Expansion eligibility to 450% of the poverty line through the 2023 state budget — creating near-universal school vouchers. 
In Ohio, K-8 students can receive a $6,166 scholarship and high schoolers can receive a $8,408 scholarship in state funding under the expansion.
Columbus City Schools had 7,384 EdChoice students and 1,817 EdChoice Expansion students in 2024-25. 
Cleveland Municipal had 8,409 EdChoice and Cleveland Scholarship students, and 33 EdChoice Expansion students. 
Cincinnati Public Schools had 6,671 EdChoice students and 1,818 EdChoice Expansion students.

(Photo by YangYin/GettyImages)The price of being a historical witness can at times be quite steep. One moment, witnesses are confronted with uplifting events, just to turn around to be presented with one equally horrifying. Despite this dichotomy, one must not turn away from the unfolding of history. To do so is to risk failing to understand the forces that drive the human experience — or worse, to lose the desire to know why humanity is capable of both greatness and wickedness at the same time.
As filmmaker Werner Herzog once said, “[t]he poet must not avert his eyes.”
I did not avert my eyes when Russia invaded Ukraine. I did not avert my eyes on Oct. 7th, nor during the subsequent Israeli airstrikes.  And I did not avert my eyes when Charlie Kirk was assassinated. 
All of these events evinced human wickedness. However, it was in Kirk’s assassination, much like in the assassination of Melissa Hortman, that I saw a direct threat to the existence of America’s constitutional republic: the choice of violence over discussing political differences. 
Choosing politics
The successful functioning of America’s constitutional republic depends on the choices of its people: the choice to create political institutions that reflect and channel human nature, the choice to allow one’s own ambition to be balanced by the ambitions of others, and the choice to recognize that compromise is sometimes the best way to preserve the health of politics.
The choice-based foundation of America’s democratic experiment was laid bare in Federalist 1, when Alexander Hamilton wrote, “… the people of this country, by their conduct and example, to decide the important question, whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force.”
To make the American republic work, the choice to deliberate and reflect upon differences, then build institutions predicated upon said deliberations, must prevail.
The stunning realization that democracy could function only if its people chose for it to work was a revolutionary thought in 1788. Before this, the only choice that mattered in politics was that of a king or noble. Hamilton knew that the institutions of the American republic would be mere auxiliary precautions against political violence if choices were not nurtured by robust civic discourse.
Violence is much easier to choose than the formation of democratic habits. It is much easier to harm than it is to listen to someone who disagrees with you, especially when you may have to come to a compromise with that person.
Many Americans are worried that we are on a collision course with a major internal violent event. While this feeling and outcome are disappointingly not new in American history, we must begin to examine why Americans are failing to develop the habits necessary for our republic to function properly. 
 Challenges to the habits of democracy

Americans have always been divided along ideological lines. This is why political parties exist. This is also why people get into heated conversations at work and during Thanksgiving dinner. As old as these divisions are, something feels different nowadays. It feels more personal, more visceral. Americans are witnessing a time where they see each other as enemies and threats to each other’s very existence.
As a result, many Americans will not engage with someone who disagrees with them politically. Worse, these individuals develop animosity and hatred toward each other, which sets the stage for acts of violence over discussion.
If we know how important the choice of deliberation is to the health of the American republic, why have we stopped doing it? Why do some Americans see political violence as justifiable? 
What if the issues that currently plague our republic do not stem from one political party, but from social factors that influence our daily choices?
One contributing factor may be the troubling lack of urgency given to civic education in public schools since the early 2000s. With the passage of No Child Left Behind and the wave of standardized testing that followed, social studies has been pushed aside in favor of math and reading proficiency. Yet this shift has done little to produce meaningful gains for American students in either subject.
By allowing civic and social studies education to fall by the wayside, many American students now graduate high school lacking the skills to engage in civil dialogue or thoughtfully examine opposing political views. This may explain why so many enter college believing that perspectives contrary to their own are tantamount to violent attacks. Such a mindset fosters political rigidity and social anxiety, establishing a tacit permission structure of hostility toward perceived opponents.
Another contributing factor to the current uptick in political violence could be our digital information environment. Over half of Americans consume news through social media. Putting aside a discussion about the quality of news encountered on social media, the real issue with this method of news consumption is how social media presents news.
Social media algorithms have a single goal: to keep users’ attention on the screen for as long as possible. By prioritizing engagement, these platforms consistently show individuals content that is designed to either affirm their existing views or provoke outrage. Outrage, in particular, drives engagement at an exponential rate. As a result, consuming news through social media produces a funhouse-mirror version of reality — one that reinforces confirmation bias and heightens anxiety toward those perceived as outsiders or ideological opponents.
Since users can always retreat into digital spaces that reaffirm their own beliefs, they lose both the need and the inclination to engage civilly with opposing viewpoints. This erodes what little remains of the deliberative Tocquevillian public square that once characterized American democracy.
Despite their harm to civil discourse, these factors are not fatalistic. We must acknowledge them and choose to develop better political habits.  
Young minds are watching
In the immediate aftermath of Kirk’s assassination, individuals on both sides of the political aisle spewed escalatory rhetoric. Utah’s Governor, Spencer Cox, struck a calmer tone with an empathic plea for Americans to “choose a different path.” A path not marked by violence toward perceived political enemies but rather by civil deliberation.
In the same breath, Cox called upon the youngest generations to build an America where they could “disagree better.” To choose an America where civility comes before rhetoric and does not provide tacit support for political violence.
This would be a considerably different America from the one we are currently witnessing. That is precisely the point. We must bear witness to the state of politics that we have created to find solutions. If we choose not to witness this moment, we will lose the ability to repair what is broken. More importantly, we will fail to set a proper example for younger generations.
If the younger generations have any hope of disagreeing better, they must witness us doing it first. If all they witness are adults castigating each other as wicked enemies, what will their political habits be? We must choose to form civil democratic habits so that our younger minds have a chance to do the same. If we do not develop these habits, we will hand the reins of democracy over to a generation that will pay a steep price for the politics we have wrought. Political violence might then become a more attractive choice for a generation that has not learned to choose democracy.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/crossroads-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-17 05:56:34.145395

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)In the wake of right wing activist Charlie Kirk’s death, his supporters have started a social media campaign reporting critics to their employers if users deem they posted negatively about Kirk or celebrated his death. They say it’s in the name of accountability, while those being targeted say it’s “cancel culture” and concerning for free speech.
Elected officials, EMS personnel, and private citizens in Ohio are all facing backlash for speaking negatively about Kirk.
“We are seeing people respond in ways that are very threatening to individuals who maybe do not like the person; they are not mourning the way they think they should be,” Rachel Coyle, a progressive activist, said.
Coyle, program director at the organization Ohioans Against Extremism, is one of those being targeted.
She posted online, saying that “condemning violence makes sense,” but “It is deeply disturbing to see so many people treating one of America’s loudest and most damaging white supremacists as a respected public figure.”
Soon after, Kirk supporters denied her claims. Then the threats started and calls for her to lose her job.
“‘If you support someone dying for their beliefs, maybe I should kill you,'” Coyle said, stating a message she received.
And she is not the only one. The City of Cleveland is investigating a firefighter and an EMS employee for comments made about Kirk.
Social media campaigns to get people fired have gone viral online, including a website that used to post critics’ names and employers.
“They’re pushing employers to fire people and making the employer feel obligated to do so,” Coyle said.
Nonpartisan Case Western Reserve University law professor Raymond Ku said there isn’t much that citizens can do if they are disciplined or fired at work.
“Private individuals, private entities aren’t subject to the First Amendment,” Ku said.
It’s harder to fire a government employee, which is why Hilary Jackson had advocated for the resignation of Fairview Park City Council President Michael Kilbane after he made a comment on Facebook saying, “A lot of good people died today. Charlie Kirk wasn’t one of them.”
“Celebrating the brutal and unjust death of someone, that is a line that, of course, many of us felt that he crossed,” said Jackson, who runs the Cuyahoga County chapter of conservative group Moms for Liberty.
Killbane defended his comments to us on Thursday.
“When he was asked about mass shootings at schools, he said that just comes with the territory, as in kids can get killed and it’s all for the Second Amendment,” Kilbane said. “It’s awful what happened to him, but I guess you reap what you sow.”
But he resigned over the weekend, citing the negative attention he brought to the city.
Coyle called this cancel culture, which Jackson denied.
“[It’s] accountability, transparency and responsibility,” Jackson said. “We as Americans have a responsibility to know what we are talking about and what actions can come from the things that we say.”
She completely condemned threats, ones which Ku says can stifle free speech.
“When it spills over into intimidation, it’s ‘I want to shut you out and force you out of a public discourse,’” Ku said.
For Coyle, she said the threats to her life or employment won’t stop her.
“It is my duty as an American to speak out,” Coyle said. “If that leads to some relationships ending, then I feel like that is the cost of speaking freely.”
Ku’s reminder: nothing you put online is private.

Series: America’s Mental Barrier: How Insurers Interfere With Mental Health Care



 More in this series
Reporting Highlights



Payments Denied: After a North Carolina man attempted suicide twice, his wife sought coverage for his mental health treatment. His insurance carrier refused to pay for his care.
Third-Party Reviews: Patients can appeal denials and even ask for additional review by independent physicians. But less than 1 in 10,000 patients eligible for those reviews seek them.
Medical Necessity: Decisions made by those independent reviewers often turn on the issue of “medical necessity.” Reviewers’ decisions are binding and insurers must abide by them.

These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.







The email took Dr. Neal Goldenberg of Cleveland, Ohio by surprise in a way that few things still do.
As a psychiatrist, he had grown accustomed to seeing patients in their darkest moments. As someone who reviewed insurance denials, he was also well-versed in the arguments that hospitals make to try to overturn an insurer’s decision not to pay for treatment.
But as soon as he opened the review last October, he knew something was different. It was personal and forceful and meticulous — and it would lead him to do something he had never done before.
“Based on the indisputable medical facts, we are unsure why anyone would assert that any part of the insured’s inpatient behavioral health treatment was ‘not medically necessary,’” the appeal letter argued.
The battle playing out on the pages before him began in March of 2024. Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield had refused to pay for a North Carolina man’s monthlong treatment at a psychiatric hospital. The man had been suffering escalating mental health issues, culminating in back-to-back suicide attempts. But using a designation insurers commonly employ when denying coverage, doctors working for Highmark determined the care was not “medically necessary.”
Insurance companies deny hundreds of millions of claims a year, and only a tiny percentage of people appeal them. Even fewer take the process to the very end, appealing to a third-party, or external, reviewer like Goldenberg. A recent report found that, on average, less than 1 out of every 10,000 people eligible for an external review actually requested one.
Goldenberg, who is based in Cleveland, had initially picked up the extra job a few years ago to help pay down the massive student debt he and his wife, a family doctor, had accumulated during medical school.
In that role, he has the power to overrule an insurer’s decision to deny a patient coverage and force the company to pay for treatment. Few things anger him as much as patients being denied the care they needed, which compelled him to continue doing the reviews even after the student loans were paid off.
Attached to the appeal letter were nearly 200 pages of records organized by headings and numbers. There was even a glossary of diagnosis codes that are used for billing.
Goldenberg’s first thought was that a lawyer had put together the appeal. But the name on the bottom of the letter didn’t belong to a law firm.
He spent the next hour and a half reading the file: records from eight separate medical providers; research on suicidal ideation; letters from two psychiatrists supporting the appeal, including one that described the patient’s depression and stress as causing “psychological suffering and functional impact.”
Then he did something he hadn’t done in the six years he’s been reviewing cases. He called the name at the bottom of the letter: Teressa Sutton-Schulman.
The line rang several times before going to voicemail.
“Hello. My name is Neal Goldenberg. I am reviewing an insurance claim for your husband,” he began.
A North Carolina couple
Sutton-Schulman’s husband, who ProPublica is identifying by his middle initial “L,” had always been anxious and more than a little obsessive. As an adult, financial matters, especially, threw him into a panic and eventually sent him to therapy.
By January of last year, after deciding that the therapy wasn’t working, he made an appointment with his primary care doctor, who prescribed him an antidepressant and antianxiety medication. After a few days, L called the doctor to say he felt worse. A panic attack landed him in the emergency room about a week later.
Right before Valentine’s Day, he met with a psychiatrist.

The way his mind had begun to shuffle through worst-case scenarios was something Sutton-Schulman hadn’t witnessed before.
They met at Georgia Tech. L had noticed her at a party. When he walked up to her, she told him she was waiting for someone.
“I could be someone,” he responded without missing a beat.
She was drawn to his humor and charm. As an introvert, Sutton-Schulman marveled at the way his presence filled a room, floating between people and the things they talked about with ease. He considered her his rock, his best friend, the person he loved most in this world.
They shared a mutual admiration for each other’s intellect and drive. He skewed nerdy, playing Dungeons & Dragons in his downtime. Not that he had much. As a rising star in the world of software engineering, work consumed him. He craved success the same way he pushed the boundaries of technology — relentlessly.
They decided not to have kids; they had each other and their work. In the early 2000s, they built a software consulting company together. Although Sutton-Schulman trained as a chemist, she went back to school to become a paralegal and the company’s in-house legal expert.
More than 20 years into their marriage, they still held hands like it was their first date. When they entered their 50s and faced the prospect of growing old in their three-story house, they decided to buy a ranch home in the same small North Carolina town outside of Raleigh that they had lived in for more than two decades.
That decision would forever alter their lives.
The pandemic’s housing market, with its skyrocketing prices and houses that sold before they even went on the market, exacerbated his stress. The couple put offers on half a dozen houses. They lost $25,000 in earnest money after backing out of the only two offers that were accepted. The hit hurt, but thanks to L’s job, they had more than enough in the bank.
Finally, in the summer of 2023, they found their house, though it needed some work. They decided to rent out their old house, but that, too, required some fixing up before they could put it on the market. L was determined to get a renter in quickly, and they poured money into both houses simultaneously.
L’s anxiety grew with every expense. They argued about money, about his insistence on undertaking everything at once, about his unwillingness to get treatment, about their five cats. She begged him to get help. He assured her he had it all under control.
After two months, they moved into the new house.
L grew more irrational each day. All he could do was fixate on the finances. On top of it all, they weren’t sleeping. To help with the cats’ transition to the new house, Sutton-Schulman had talked to L about getting them an enclosed space on their patio. But L, who was overseeing the remodeling, didn’t prioritize it. The cats kept them up each night with their incessant whining and scratching at their doors.
She knew that all of his concerns were symptoms of a larger problem, but neglecting to take care of the cats was the final straw. As hard as it was for her to leave him, she felt like she had no other choice. Two weeks after moving in, she packed her bags and her SUV and moved back into their old house.
It took her leaving for him to see a therapist and agree to couple’s counseling.
Buying the house, he told his wife, was a mistake.
“I started catastrophizing every day,” L said at his appointment with his psychiatrist right before Valentine’s Day, medical records show.
L told him that he regularly woke up at 2:30 a.m. in the throes of a nightmare. His heart raced. His legs felt weak. He contemplated ending his life.
The psychiatrist tried to determine how serious his suicidal thoughts were. L admitted he felt anxious and hopeless, but he said he was afraid to die.
“I’m a fucking coward and I can’t do it,” L told the psychiatrist, according to his medical records. “I don’t know how to kill myself.”
Two days later, he swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills and chased them down with bourbon. He slid into the driver’s seat of his Mercedes parked in the garage, turned on the ignition and closed his eyes.
Goldeberg
Goldenberg’s path to medicine began at a young age. He excelled in science in school. He grew up with a dad who was a dentist and a belief that doctors could heal.
But 2003, his first year of medical school, was difficult. He didn’t fit in with some of his classmates who were focused on which speciality would yield the biggest salary.
External reviewers like Dr. Neal Goldenberg have the power to overrule an insurer’s decision to deny coverage for patient care and to force insurance companies to pay for treatment. (Photo by Sarah Blesener for ProPublica.)
Stumbling upon a book by Dr. Hunter “Patch” Adams, the doctor who devoted himself to infusing humor and compassion in medicine, provided the inspiration he needed. Adams’ name became the title of a movie starring Robin Williams, which made the red clown nose he popped on when visiting sick children famous.
Goldenberg reached out to Adams’ nonprofit Gesundheit Institute, which allowed him to volunteer. He soon embarked on a 300-mile bike ride from Ohio to West Virginia to spend the summer after his first year of medical school surrounded by people who, like him, were frustrated by the health care system. They yearned for an approach that focused not just on the illness of one patient, but on the health of a community.
When he got back, he volunteered at a free clinic in Columbus. The experience deepened his appreciation for caring for the sick as well as his disillusionment with a health care system he viewed as farming out the medical treatment of certain patients to trainees.
The next turning point came when he attended a conference of the American Medical Student Association, which encourages doctors to advocate for affordable health care. Seeing so many of his fellow medical students with the same values energized him.
“Vast swaths of our population were uninsured,” he recalled. “I just couldn’t get over how unfair that was and wanted to be part of the good guys fighting to change that.”
Goldenberg met his wife at the conference; together they pledged to improve how medicine is practiced. They both pursued family medicine. But during his residency at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, he fell in love with psychiatry. He found satisfaction in building relationships with patients struggling with mental illness and helping them through it.
Madison had pioneered a team-based model in the 1970s that treated patients with severe mental illness in their homes and communities, rather than at institutions and hospitals. He was so struck by this approach that he specialized in community psychiatry. Later, he became medical director of a nonprofit organization that treated the homeless.
The job reviewing health insurance denials came about after he spotted an online job posting.
With more than 15 years’ experience treating patients at clinics and in hospitals, he was flush with knowledge and a desire to make a greater impact. He told himself that he could walk away at any point if he felt he wasn’t living up to the ethical standards he set for himself. He was determined not to be a rubber stamp for anyone — not for the insurance companies and not for the hospitals.
Perhaps surprisingly, he estimates that he sided with insurance companies about half the time. Some hospitals, he said, admitted patients when they didn’t need to, and some doctors wrote that they had ordered treatments that made little sense given the patient’s diagnosis.
The bulk of his cases are reviews involving the major Medicaid plans in Ohio. The third-party company he worked for approached him in 2023 with another opportunity: to do more in-depth external reviews for commercial insurers. He agreed, but his priority remained his main psychiatry job and the patients he treated there.
The third-party review company that Goldenberg works for declined to comment.
External reviews
State and federal regulations designed external reviews as an attempt to level the playing field between behemoth insurance companies and individual patients. The idea is to provide an added measure that prevents insurers from having the final say in deciding whether they will pay for a claim they had already denied. The Affordable Care Act in 2010 expanded access to the reviews, but barriers regularly get in the way of the process serving as a true check on insurers.
Most people haven’t heard of external reviews, and most denials are not eligible for one. Those that are eligible typically involve medical judgment, surprise medical bills, or an insurer deciding to retroactively cancel or discontinue coverage or determining that a treatment was experimental. Even then, insurers can argue that a denial is ineligible for an external review.
Only after the internal appeals with the insurer are exhausted is an external review an option for some denials. Requests have to be filed within a certain time frame, depending on whether they’re filed under state or federal laws. That distinction can also determine if insurance plans get to pick the company that does the external review.
In addition, it’s nearly impossible to know how effective they are. Insurance companies almost never release data around denials in general. That’s especially true about external reviews.
A recent KFF report looking at federal insurance marketplace plans found that fewer than 1% of of the system’s tens of millions of denials were appealed internally. Of that 1%, about 3% of all upheld internal appeals — only about 5,000 enrollees — went on to file external reviews, though there wasn’t enough data to calculate the rate at which external appeals were upheld.

After L’s suicide attempt last February, a judge ordered him to be committed to a mental health center about 40 minutes south of Raleigh. There, staff took away his phone, shoes and anything that could be a safety hazard. Doctors increased the dosage of his new antidepressant and, while they waited for the medicine to take effect, L spent his days coloring, making bracelets and watching a documentary about meditation.
The court rescinded the involuntary commitment order about a week later, but did so under two conditions: that L be released to his wife’s care and that he see a therapist and a psychiatrist. Sutton-Schulman heeded the judge’s orders and agreed to have him move back in with her.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
When she picked him up, they both cried.
“I never want to do anything ever to go back to a place like that again,” he said as he climbed into her car.
At the house, she didn’t let her emotions show through the reassuring facade she maintained for him. Secretly, she was terrified he would try to kill himself again.
Four days later, she woke up to a quiet house. She assumed he’d gone for a walk, as he usually did.
She heard the front door open and went to greet him. Her eyes immediately found him leaning over the kitchen sink. As she got closer, she glimpsed a knife in the sink covered in blood. Then she saw blood pouring out of his neck, spilling from his wrists, soaking his sweater.
She grabbed a towel to put pressure on the gash on his neck.
“Did you do this to yourself?” she asked.
“Yes,” he said.
For the second time in 11 days, she called 911.
“Just let me die,” he said over and over.
Paramedics rushed him to the hospital. This time, police taped off the house and questioned Sutton-Schulman for two hours until a detective got a call from the hospital confirming that L had attempted suicide in the woods behind the house.
By the time she arrived at the hospital, the bleeding was under control. After the doctor stitched up L’s neck and bandaged his wrists, he agreed to accept treatment. Police drove him to Triangle Springs, a residential treatment facility in nearby Raleigh.
But instead of improving, L’s mental health deteriorated. He began displaying signs of psychosis. He told the doctors that “the coke machine was fuzzy and he could hear just random voices,” his medical records show. During a call with Sutton-Schulman, he told her that he believed the other patients had been planted at the facility by the FBI and authorities were trying to frame him for murder.
“Patient is not considered safe to be discharged,” his doctors wrote in his medical notes on four separate occasions.
Desperate, Sutton-Schulman called a friend who is a social worker in psychiatric hospitals. He’s getting worse, she told her. Where else can I take him?
Of the three facilities her friend recommended, The Menninger Clinic in Houston was the only one that returned her call.
She wasn’t sure she could get him there in his condition, but she knew she had to try. She booked an early-morning flight for the two of them. At one point, he dropped to the airport floor. “I can’t do it anymore,” he told her.
“You have to,” she told him.
She was relieved when they arrived at Menninger. The staff did genetic testing that revealed he could have an adverse reaction to the antidepressant his doctor had put him on. Learning that, she said, felt like the missing piece of a puzzle.
Sutton-Schulman got L settled in, met with his doctors and, for the first time in months, felt some hope.
The system
Goldenberg approached his side job with caution.
When he’d started, a part of him feared he would be pressured to side with insurers regardless of the medical evidence. But that didn’t happen. He soon embraced the job as a way to hold everyone accountable because it wasn’t just insurance companies that tried to game the system.
“Doing these chart reviews has also opened my eyes to the way doctors and hospitals cheat the system, even Medicaid,” he said. “And I don’t like that either.”
Over the years, he said, he’s done hundreds of Medicaid reviews and about a dozen external reviews. He knows more than most that no one is immune to having a mental health episode.

“We all have vulnerabilities, and we all have genetic predispositions, sensitivities to certain kinds of stress,” he said. “Someone who’s been able to handle stuff all their life, if they have just too many things going on, it can push you past your breaking point.”
It’s a bit like how a healthy person can be diagnosed with cancer or get into a car accident. People pay for insurance, he said, so it’s not financially disastrous when that happens.
“I’m working within a system that I know is broken, but doing my best to change it from the inside,” he said.
A part of him wonders if Patch Adams would consider him a sellout for not living up to the radical ideologies of his youth. But his goals haven’t changed. They’re evident in the practice philosophy he spotlights at the top of his CV: “Increase quality of life for those suffering from mental illness in an atmosphere of respect, understanding, and collaboration.”
The spirit of his work, which earned him a humanism in medicine scholarship in medical school, is what prompted him to call Sutton-Schulman.
“I see how opaque the system can be,” Goldenberg said, “how frustrating it is when you feel like no one hears you.”
Denials
On March 19, just a week after her husband was admitted to Menninger, Sutton-Schulman received the first denial from Highmark.
Highmark had sent her a letter in late February confirming pre-authorization for his treatment at Triangle Springs, where L was first treated after his initial suicide attempt. “This approval means that we confirm that the requested services or supplies are medically necessary and appropriate.”
And again a few days later, it sent her another: “We approved the request to extend an inpatient admission for the patient.”
But on that day in mid-March, Highmark showed a balance of $30,599.69.
The reason? The Triangle Springs treatment was not being covered after all; it had been deemed not medically necessary.
The pre-authorization letters included a line saying payment was not guaranteed, but Sutton-Schulman didn’t think much of it. And with good reason. At the top of the letter, in bold, were the words: “We approved your inpatient admission request.” She felt like Highmark was reversing itself.
Sutton-Schulman watched as her husband — one of the smartest men she knew — continued to unravel. When a person is gravely ill, they’re often forced to fight two battles, one against their sickness and the other against the insurance company. As L focused on his health, Sutton-Schulman mobilized against Highmark.
Teressa Sutton-Schulman and her husband on their wedding day.
She was no stranger to taking on powerful companies. She was part of the army of women who took on the pharmaceutical giant Bayer after they blamed the company’s permanently implanted birth control device for serious health complications. They filed reports with the Food and Drug Administration over adverse reactions, they organized protests, and many of them sued Bayer, though Sutton-Schulman did not.
At the end of 2018, Bayer stopped selling the device, despite insisting it was safe.
In her fight with Highmark, Sutton-Schulman leaned on her paralegal skills, beginning with reading the company’s coverage booklet from start to finish. That’s where she learned of the possibility of the external review. Then she began tracking and documenting everything — the calls with Highmark, its promises, denial letters, bills and appeal requests — and developing her own filing system of labeled manila folders and document boxes. She even started recording her phone calls with the company.
Just as she started to get going, a call from Menninger stopped her in her tracks.
Her husband had passed out in the bathroom and hit his head. Menninger took him to a nearby hospital, where he was treated for a severe colon infection, likely brought on by his long-term use of antibiotics to treat the neck wound.
Once doctors cleared out the infection, an ambulance took him back to Menninger to complete his treatment.
Meanwhile, Highmark sent Sutton-Schulman a succession of denials.
Highmark refused to pay for the emergency medical treatment for the colon infection. In a bizarre twist, that denial letter listed her husband as the patient but made reference to the care of a newborn, not that of a 52-year-old man having a mental health crisis.
“It was determined,” the letter said, “that your newborn does not meet the criteria for coverage of an inpatient hospital admission.”
“This is when I really start to think they’re just denying,” she recalled. “They’re not even looking. They’re just ‘deny, deny, deny.’”
Before she could appeal it, she was hit with another denial. The company denied her husband’s first week of care at Menninger.
Then the fourth denial arrived, this one for the rest of the treatment at Menninger.
Doctors at the hospital where her husband was treated for the colon infection had persuaded Highmark to pay for the medical care, but she was responsible for the remainder of the appeals. She soon found herself raging at what she came to believe was “weaponized incompetence.”
Fax numbers were wrong. Key records that included the billing codes and denial reasons that she needed for her appeals were no longer available online. The insurer wouldn’t even give her access to her husband’s medical records, though he had signed a release granting her permission.
“At this time,” she wrote to the insurer, “I can only interpret Highmark’s refusal to respond to appeal requests in a timely manner or provide information as an ongoing, purposeful effort to erect insurmountable obstacles to this process.”
On her 18th call to Highmark, she bristled at the notion that a critical letter from the insurer was lost in the mail.
“I never got a letter,” Sutton-Schulman shot back from her kitchen table.
Complaints and appeals
Appalled, she filed two complaints with the state insurance department in Pennsylvania, where Highmark is based. The first, in June 2024, explained the multiple roadblocks she experienced and wrote that Highmark denied claims as medically unnecessary and impeded her ability to appeal them. The department wrote back and incorrectly stated that the denial was not eligible for an external review because it did not involve medical judgment or rescission of coverage.
Six months later, Sutton-Schulman filed a second complaint with the agency highlighting a litany of additional problems and asking for an investigation into Highmark. After both complaints were closed, Sutton-Schulman wrote the agency again, reasserting the “weaponized incompetence” claim and adding that she believed the company’s goal “seems to be not paying claims or to delay payments as long as possible.”
“Frankly,” she concluded, “I don’t even know why they are allowed to continue operating like this without sanctions or fines.”
A spokesperson for the insurance department did not answer ProPublica’s questions, saying that state law prohibits the department from disclosing details of individual consumer complaints or ongoing investigations.
In a statement, the department said every complaint is “carefully reviewed and informs our broader oversight. When we find systemic issues, we have not hesitated to act, including imposing fines, ordering corrective actions, and requiring restitution to Pennsylvanians.”
The Pennsylvania agency and the Delaware Department of Insurance have fined Highmark and its health insurance subsidiaries at least four times in the past 10 years, including as recently as 2024 and 2023. The fines were levied for denying and failing to pay claims on time, including those for mental-health-related treatment. Just last year, Delaware fined Highmark $329,000 for violating mental health parity laws, which aim to ensure that mental health and physical health insurance claims are treated equally. Highmark said in response that it evaluated its practices and ensured that the same standards are used for mental health as physical health. In addition, it said at the time that it would review and revise its procedures where necessary to ensure compliance with state and federal requirements.
L provided Highmark two signed releases authorizing the company to respond to ProPublica, which the company said were necessary for it to answer questions. He also called the company to ask it to respond. Still, Highmark would not discuss L’s case in any detail, citing patient privacy.
Instead, the company provided a statement acknowledging “small errors made by physicians and/or members can lead to delays and initial denials,” but said those are corrected on appeals. The statement said company officials “recognize and sincerely regret” when prior authorization and claims processing are “challenging and frustrating,” and added that the issues raised by L’s case were “resolved at least a year ago.”
The statement said prior authorization requests are reviewed by licensed physicians and completed based on widely accepted national guidelines. The decision to deny or uphold an appeal, the statement said, is based on the same national guidelines. Highmark said it is working to improve its prior authorization process, including reducing “denials when errors are made, regardless of who or how the errors are made because we are passionate about providing appropriate and timely care to our members.”
“Highmark is dedicated to full compliance with all applicable state and federal Mental Health Parity laws regarding coverage for behavioral health services for our members,” the statement said.
In the end, Sutton-Schulman won the Triangle Springs appeal, but Highmark classified L’s treatment at Menninger as two separate admissions. She eventually was able to get Highmark to pay for the first week at Menninger — more than $20,000 — but the company wouldn’t budge on the $70,000-plus for the other four weeks of treatment.
Final shot
Her final shot was an external review, but getting Highmark to agree to one wasn’t easy — though Sutton-Schulman believed they were eligible. When she finally convinced the company, it gave her less than two hours to file a request before a 5 p.m. deadline. She pressed send on the email at 4:34 p.m.
By the time Sutton-Schulman’s letter landed in Goldenberg’s inbox, he had done enough reviews to know what to expect. But the details of L’s case were striking.
“This is the high-risk case that psychiatrists have nightmares about,” he recalls thinking.
It was also the first time he had received an appeal from a family member, not a hospital. He wondered if he should call Sutton-Schulman. He decided that for a doctor who believes so adamantly in humanism in medicine, this was a chance to be human.
She wasn’t sure what to make of his voicemail. A part of her was relieved, but a bigger part didn’t trust it. After all the denials and broken promises, she couldn’t believe that it could all be resolved in a single phone call.
A little while later, Goldenberg called her again. This time she answered.
He asked how her husband was doing. Did he survive?
He’s back home, she said, seeing a local psychiatrist. “I think they finally have his medication correct and stabilized.”
“I just want you to know that there was a human in this whole process that actually took a look at all this stuff, that actually read it,” he told her. “It probably just felt like that has not been the case for most of it.”
He acknowledged that he probably shouldn’t be talking to her.
“Part of the reason I do this job is to make sure that people get what they need,” he said, “and bad doctors get punished, and shitty insurance companies don’t get to do this kind of stuff to people.”
In response to Highmark’s denial, Goldenberg wrote that the insurer did not understand L’s “complex psychiatric and medical situation.” His treatment was interrupted by a medical emergency — he didn’t leave the facility because he had completed treatment, as the company suggested. After doctors tended to the infection, his “psychosis and depression were still severe.” The resumed treatment, he wrote, was “denied unfairly.”
In total, L’s treatment cost more than $220,000, which includes claims that Highmark approved when they were initially filed. But Sutton-Schulman and L had to pay more than $95,000 out of pocket, burning through their savings in hopes that Highmark would reconsider their denials. Many people don’t have the money to pay for care if their insurance won’t cover it. Highmark ended up reimbursing them more than $70,000. Considering out-of-network and other charges, Sutton-Schulman was content with that amount.
Aftermath
L has recovered and he and Sutton-Schulman continue to process the trauma of his experience.
With their struggles against Highmark behind them, Sutton-Schulman and L are still putting their lives back together. In July, they returned to couple’s counseling; the therapist told Sutton-Schulman she needed to process the trauma of what happened.
“I’m just now starting to do that,” she said, “because I finally feel like I don’t have any insurance to fight.”
She’s also dealing with her own guilt, wondering if moving out pushed her husband over the edge.
L turned to look at her. “You shouldn’t blame yourself.”
“I know,” she said, her voice breaking. “But the reality of knowing that intellectually to be true, and then emotionally, those are two very different things.”
He has tried to assure his wife that he’s better. He’s returned to work, though colleagues don’t know what happened, other than that a medical emergency kept him away. He logs onto meetings from his laptop and travels for business trips. His voice is exuberant, especially when cracking jokes.
“When your mind shatters like this, it’s hard to explain,” he said. “Nothing makes sense, and you just want it to be over.“
Things feel normal until he catches sight of the scar on his neck. It’s small and could pass as a nick from a razor. But every time he looks in the mirror, he is transported back to that moment in the woods. He’s not sure he can handle the world knowing what happened.
The couple still live in separate houses but eat dinner together most nights. On a recent evening, they sat at the round kitchen table where Sutton-Schulman had done so much of the work fighting with Highmark. He chatted about work. She talked about needing to take one of the cats to the vet. As he got up to leave, she walked him to the door and wrapped her arms around him before saying goodbye.
They recognize how lucky they were that their case was assigned to Goldenberg.
The praise makes Goldenberg uncomfortable.
“It shouldn’t even be a big deal,” he said. “It should have happened multiple steps before it got to me.”
Since the review, Goldenberg has gone back to the residents he teaches. As doctors, he tells them, they have the power to make patients feel seen, to spend an extra few minutes filling out paperwork to help someone with a request for time off work, to support an appeal if they believe an insurer wrongly denied coverage.
“Sometimes,” he said, “there’s an opportunity to reach out and connect in a way that adds a little bit of humanity to the world.”

[…],"Twenty members of the Kansas Legislature absorbed public comment on redistricting and the evils of gerrymandering during an August 2021 town hall in Lawrence. Similar town halls were held throughout the state. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)Just because you can do something doesn’t mean you should.
Just because the law allows something doesn’t mean you should eagerly try it.
And just because Kansas Republicans want to redistrict the state to hand their party another seat in the U.S. House doesn’t mean that our best interests will be served in the process.
Let’s get this out the way first. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that states can enact partisan gerrymanders without running afoul of the Constitution. State lawmakers from coast to coast can slice and dice maps however they like to extract the last bit of blue or red juice. That’s usually done once a decade, after the U.S. Census, but Texas decided to go for broke this summer and pass a new set of maps to benefit Republicans. California lawmakers then passed a referendum that would allow similar redistricting there to benefit Democrats.
With the 2026 midterm elections looking like a tough test for the governing party, Republicans see an acute threat. So they’re bringing Kansans along for the ride. Never mind that we have only one seat to offer — the one held by U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat — GOP officials want it anyway.
They have a right to do so. If Republicans stick together and call a special session, they can override any veto from Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly.
They can have their way.
But it won’t be good for the state. It won’t be good for our representation in Washington, D.C. And it won’t be good for those hundreds of thousands of Kansans who want to elect a politician from the party of their choice.
Kansas Reflector reporter Tim Carpenter collected comments from leading Republicans early this month, and a quick scan should show you which way the winds are blowing.
Former Gov. Jeff Colyer: “National Democrats have gerrymandered Congress to make it more liberal than the real America. Kansas needs to lead the way in restoring sanity to our federal government.”
Senate President Ty Masterson said a special session was under consideration: “I am actively engaged in the battle for the heart and soul of America, helping the president to Make America Great Again.”
U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall: “Most of the blue states are gerrymandered to the point that … I don’t know what else they could do to change the ratio. The Democrats have always led in this gerrymandering.”
Both Colyer and Masterson are running for governor next year. That fact perhaps explains their eagerness to curry favor with President Donald Trump, who has encouraged such mid-decade redistricting. Again, however, that doesn’t make redrawing maps a good idea. It strikes me as a nakedly partisan exercise. The comments listed above support that.
Kansans do not overwhelmingly support the Republican Party or Trump. Looking at registered voters in the state, 898,429 are Republican, 497,801 are Democrat and 573,048 are unaffiliated. Taken as a whole, only 41% have declared themselves members of the GOP. In the 2024 presidential election, more than a half-million Kansans voted for Kamala Harris.
Kansans have repeatedly elected Democratic governors — John Carlin, Joan Finney, Kathleen Sebelius and Kelly in my lifetime alone. We have regularly elected Democratic U.S. representatives, such as Dan Glickman, Jim Slattery, Dennis Moore and Davids.
Republicans have tried to defeat Davids through gerrymandering before. Former Senate President Susan Wagle gave the game away in 2020, telling a Wichita audience: “So redistricting, it’s right around the corner. And if Governor Kelly can veto a Republican bill that gives us four Republican congressmen, that takes out Sharice Davids up in the 3rd — we can do that. I guarantee you we can draw four Republican congressional maps. But we can’t do it unless we have a two-thirds majority in the Senate and House.”
The party eventually secured those supermajorities and redrew maps. Surprise of surprises, it didn’t work. Davids hung on to her 3rd District seat. Will she survive next year’s election? It depends on how willing lawmakers are to touch the blazing-hot stove of partisanship.
Kansans have elected Democrats at the federal, state and local levels. State Republicans have the right to enact more obstacles in their path to doing so. But preventing the people you purport to represent the right to elect their chosen candidate?
We’ll see how that works out for them.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Ohio politicians pressured by an openly corrupt president look to be doubling down on blatantly partisan gerrymandering to help them in the 2026 midterms by manipulating congressional district boundaries in 2025 to silence the voices of opposition.
That’s not normal. Neither is armed troops and tanks in American streets. Neither are unidentifiable, masked federal agents seizing people off the streets because they fit a racial profile.
None of this is normal. Not in a functioning constitutional republic. 
But without effective, sustained pushback from fearless pro-democracy leaders and a resolute citizenry determined to keep its inalienable rights, the takeover happening now in Ohio and the country will become the accepted norm by default.
We are not there yet. 
There is still time to dissent — loudly — about political dictates from the Ohio Statehouse and the Trump regime. 
But the window of opportunity is short. 
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, the mastermind behind Ohio’s unconstitutionally gerrymandered legislative and congressional maps — who called the rule of law on redistricting reform in the state “aspirational” and basically ignored it — is already signaling that new congressional districts will be drawn by GOP fiat without buy-in from the minority party. 
Even before the new joint committee on congressional redistricting was announced by Republican legislative leaders, Huffman judged that chances for a bipartisan deal — on GOP plans to grab at least two more congressional districts through gerrymandering — are “not looking good” for passing a map with Democratic support by Sept. 30. 
That means the congressional map that gives unfair advantage to one party over the other (which the Ohio Constitution explicitly prohibits) will go the Republican-majority Ohio Redistricting Commission. 
If the panel can’t convince the two Democratic commissioners to bless the GOP power grab for more U.S. House seats by the end of October, the process returns to the legislature where Huffman and the Republican supermajority can easily pass their congressional map with a simple majority.

The Speaker — who in 2022 thumbed his nose at the constitutional amendment Ohioans overwhelmingly approved to end congressional gerrymandering — figures he can screw voters again and get away with it by dispensing normalizing assurances to follow the “process voters approved” and “stick to the Constitution and make decisions based on that.”
Huffman presents as conventional and law-abiding as he takes gerrymandering to new extremes in Ohio — like Texas and other red states considering similar steps. But make no mistake: He is razor focused on undermining the will of Ohio voters so his party can stay in power in Congress regardless of majority opinion.
Gerrymandering disconnects political power from the will of voters by letting the powerful choose their voters instead of voters choosing their politicians. The result is skewed, unrepresentative district maps where electoral outcomes are virtually guaranteed. 
That is what Huffman has orchestrated repeatedly with Ohio’s congressional redistricting, but he frames it as good faith map-making in accordance with the law to put a sheen on stealing voter power at the ballot box — as if that were normal. 
It is only normal in governments who do not answer to the people they claim to represent. 
Same goes for the unprovoked, unwarranted military deployment of troops and armaments in a free society to police its citizens. 
It is only normal under regimes flexing muscle at the expense of the constitution and the rule of law. 
It is a show of force to intimidate the governed into submission. It is also illegal, ruled a federal judge recently in California about Donald Trump’s use of federal troops for domestic policing in Los Angeles this summer. 
Yet the president plans to escalate his use of troops in U.S. cities saying he’ll deploy to Memphis next — one of several blue cities run by Black mayors Trump has targeted to “fix like we did in Washington.”
Nearly 2,300 National Guard troops were deployed to patrol the nation’s capital a month ago after Trump declared a “crime emergency” in D.C. — even though violent crime in the federal district was at its lowest level in 30 years. 
Trump falsely claimed the city was the most unsafe in the U.S “and perhaps the world” to justify his militarized policing of Washingtonians.
Six red state governors, including Ohio’s Gov. Mike DeWine, rushed hundreds of extra Guard troops to D.C. to sightsee with tourists and score points with Trump.
Bored soldiers, used as political props, were relegated to picking up trash, raking leaves, laying mulch, and taking selfies with onlookers startled to see soldiers with rifles and armored vehicles loitering outside Union Station. 
DeWine could have declined to be complicit in the dress rehearsal of military used against his fellow citizens; others from his party did. But he chose to put more boots on the ground in an American city to support a bogus “emergency” and call it the “right thing to do.”
The governor said his decision to send troops against the wishes of D.C. officials was consistent with past deployments. How on Earth could it be?
Truth is DeWine just wanted Ohioans to think his armed reinforcements to appease a dangerous megalomaniac was normal. 
It was not and can never be as long as democracy has breath in America.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Jared Littmann began his quest more than a year ago to seek the Democratic nomination for Annapolis mayor. The local businessman hopes early tallies show his work has paid off.
In early returns Tuesday night, Littmann had 1,371 votes in the Democratic primary to 771 votes for City Council Alderwoman Rhonda Pindell Charles (D), who is seeking to become the city’s first elected Black mayor.
But Littmann said he believes mail-in ballots, which have yet to be counted, could account for as much as 30% to 50% of the final total. While she didn’t put a number on it, Pindell Charles also said Tuesday’s votes were just round one of the race.
Election officials said it may take up to a week to count the mail-in and provisional ballots and declare an official winner.
But both Democrats were upbeat as they relaxed with supporters at watch parties after the polls closed.
Besides Littmann’s family, dozens of supporters joined him at Seasalt Annapolis to celebrate, including several who sported the blue-and-white campaign T-shirts.
“We’ve had a strong volunteer group from the beginning, and they continue to show up today, both to help me at the polls and celebrate our campaign today,” Littmann, 53, said in an interview. “All that felt great … but no one will be able to claim victory today, unless you just assume that the same trajectory today will be mirrored in the mail-in ballots.”
Not far away, Pindell Charles, 71, was also hopeful as she drank bottled water and ate some chips and salsa with more than a dozen family, friends and supporters at the Pella Windows on West Street.

“I feel good,” she said, before summarizing a background that includes work as a school community outreach specialist, prosecutor in Baltimore City and a brief stint as acting mayor in 2020.
“I’m ready for it [serving as mayor] because I’ve had great opportunities and experiences,” Pindell Charles said. “I’m not trying to be critical of my opponent, but he doesn’t have the depth and the breadth of what I’ve had.”
At least two voters, Christie Burt and Tory Budd, braved the rain Tuesday evening to cast their ballots at the Michael E. Busch Annapolis Library for Pindell Charles. Budd said she would like to see history made by having the city elect its first Black mayor.
“We’ll just put another white boy next to another white boy and it’s going to be another white boy battle,” Budd said of the coming general election. “She’s [Pindell Charles] got the record. She’s a lawyer. She’s capable. I’ve seen her work. She deserves it.”
Whoever receives the Democratic nomination will face Republican Bob O’Shea in the Nov. 4 general election. O’Shea ran unopposed Tuesday. The winner will replace current Mayor Gavin Buckley (D), who is term-limited from serving a third, four-year term.
City Council races
The city also had Democratic primary contests in four of the city’s eight wards. Here’s a summary of the unofficial results.
In the most-crowded race, Ward 1 Alderman Harry Huntley was leading in his reelection bid Tuesday with 256 votes, to 162 votes for Katie McDermott, 67 for Ron Gunzburger, Genevieve Torri with 10 and Ben Bramsen with nine.
The nominee will face unaffiliated candidate Thomas Kriek in November.
The Ward 3 seat is open after Pindell Charles decided to run for mayor. Keanuú Smith-Brown had 219 votes in early returns, compared to the 44 votes received by Deborah “Debbie” Odum. The winner will face unaffiliated candidate Mike Dye.
The Ward 4 race to succeed Alderwoman Sheila M. Finlayson, who did not seek reelection, was neck-and-neck, with 86 votes for Coren Makell and 84 for Janice Elaine Allsup-Johnson. The Democratic primary winner could run unopposed in the general election, because no Republican or unaffiliated voter had filed to run for that seat.
Craig Cussimanio had a lead for the Ward 6 seat with 112 votes, versus Diesha Contee who has 69 votes. The winner will face Republican George Gallagher in the race to succeed Alderman DaJuan Gay, who is not running for reelection.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)State government is investigating teachers over social media comments made following Charlie Kirk’s assassination. Faculty and classroom teacher union leaders are calling it an attack on freedom of speech.
Last week, Florida Education Commissioner Anastasios Kamoutsas wrote a letter to school superintendents statewide, reminding them that he has the power to discipline educators and sanction their certificates for probable cause, including “personal conduct that seriously reduces that person’s effectiveness as an employee of the district school board.”
The Florida Department of Education vowed last week to “hold teachers who choose to make disgusting comments about the horrific assassination of Charlie Kirk accountable. Govern yourselves accordingly.”

Reports have surfaced from around the state of teachers under investigation for making what Kamoutsas called “despicable comments” about Kirk.
“These few are not a reflection of the great, high-quality teachers who make up the vast majority of Florida’s educators. Nevertheless, I will be conducting an investigation of every educator who engages in this vile, sanctionable behavior,” Kamoutsas said in the letter.
The statute permits the Education Practices Commission to suspend a teacher’s license if they are sanctioned or found guilty of personal conduct as described above by Kamoutsas. The law also permits the commissioner to suspend employees from positions interacting with students upon allegation of misconduct that affects the health, safety, or welfare of a student.
A Martin County teacher, who is also a Martin County Education Association official, has been removed from the classroom and placed in a job in the district office pending investigation for posting online about Kirk, calling him a “racist, misogynistic, fear-mongering neo-Nazi,” WPTV News reported Saturday.
Osceola County is investigating four teachers over social media comments, the Orlando Sentinel reported Monday. According to the Sentinel, a teacher in Kissimmee posted, “protect ur rights brother!!!! so proud of you taking this one for the team,” accompanying a Kirk quote declaring that “some” gun deaths were worth it to maintain gun rights.
News4Jax reported that a Clay County school employee was suspended after posting, “This may not be the obituary. [sic] We were all hoping to wake up to, but this is a close second for me.”
Some Lee County teachers will be subject to Kamoutsas’ discipline, Gulf Coast News reported Friday. Teachers at more than one school in that county posted social media comments that grabbed public attention. The school district emphasized their right to due process and is asking for Kamoutsas’ direction, the TV station reported. 
“I certainly think there was a completely different way he could have sent that message without it sounding like he was trying to attack and threaten teachers in our public schools,” Florida Education Association President Andrew Spar told the Phoenix of Kamoutsas.

Kamoutsas, in the letter, acknowledged First Amendment rights for teachers but said, “these rights do not extend without limit into their professional duties.”
“An educator’s personal views that are made public may undermine the trust of the students and families that they serve,” Kamoutsas wrote. 
Florida House Rep. Berny Jacques (R-Seminole) posted to social media a letter he’s sent to Pinellas County Superintendent Kevin Hendrick, calling on him to fire teachers who have conducted “abhorrent” behavior on their social media accounts since Kirk’s death. He cited one instructor who he said posted “good riddance” after Kirk was shot.
The Florida Department of Education on Monday told the Phoenix, which was attempting to gauge the scope of the crackdown, that it “can neither confirm nor deny the existence of a pending investigation.” Press Secretary Nathalia Medina added that Kamoutsas “intends to conduct an investigation of every educator who engages in misconduct and posts vile inappropriate messages about this current situation.”
“For the commissioner to say there’s no longer a second-chance mentality in education and that he’s going to personally investigate and essentially be the investigator, the prosecutor, and the judge and jury in all of these cases is quite concerning,” Spar said. 
The commissioner’s letter sends a “chilling effect throughout the profession,” Spar said.
“We cannot have a McCarthy-style commissioner or Department of Education. We need to deal with issues if they come up, yes, but we also need to support all who work in our schools and be reasonable in how we approach this,” Spar said. 
Spar’s reference was to the period in the 1950s when U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy investigated, widely in the public eye, often inflated allegations of communist infiltration.

Higher education
Monday, State University System Chancellor Ray Rodrigues sent a letter to university presidents.
“[W]hile the right to free expression is paramount it is not absolute. Celebrating or excusing campus violence — and in this case, the murder of Charlie Kirk — by members of our university system will not be tolerated. Such behavior is abhorrent, has the deleterious effects of breeding further violence and undermines efforts to promote civil discourse,” Rodrigues wrote.
Rodrigues asked presidents to review policies and procedures for students and employees relating to social media postings “and ensure such measures are deliberately enforced.”
Also in his letter, Rodrigues pointed out earlier actions related to expression, including the 2018 Campus Free Expression Act and the university system’s Statement of Free Expression. Rodrigues pointed to the system’s annual survey of free speech and a requirement for universities to have an Office of Public Policy Events for hosting debates, too.
Rodrigues said Kirk “modeled what Florida has long promoted: free expression, civil discourse and debate.”
Florida Atlantic University President Adam Hasner, a former Florida legislator and GOP majority leader, said on social media that a tenured professor made “repeated comments on social media” regarding Kirk’s assassination. 
Her comments reportedly included that Kirk was “racist, transphobic, homophobic and more.”
“It is our expectation that all employees consistently pursue the university’s mission and values to promote higher education, cultivate academic excellence, and support the personal growth of our students,” Hasner said. 
The professor was placed on administrative leave, Hasner said. The school’s focus, he continued, is to “promote civil discourse, conduct healthy debate and treat one another with respect. This applies to all students, faculty and staff no matter their political leanings.”
Robert Cassanello, president of United Faculty of Florida, the union representing professors in the state, told the Phoenix that conservatives have tried to “sell to the American public that colleges and universities are hostile to speech, hostile to conservative speech.”
“And if you take these ideas seriously, what they’re saying is, ‘We agree to speech when the speech is conservative and we want to make sure that speech flows freely but, when the speech is not conservative, then all of the sudden we see conservatives turn their back on the First Amendment.’ And I think that’s what we’re seeing here in this case with the FAU president,” Cassanello said.
The American Association of University Professors issued a public statement Monday to remind leaders “of their fundamental duty to protect academic freedom and the absolute necessity to ensure that the freedom to discuss topics of public import without constraint is not curtailed under political pressure.”
“On the one hand, lawmakers are promoting conservative speech on our campuses yet, at the same time, they are punishing what they perceive to be liberal speech,” Cassanello said. 
He cited the Hamilton School at University of Florida, created to “educate university students in core texts and great debates of Western civilization;”  the Adam Smith Center at Florida International University, which promotes free-market economics; and the Institute for Governance and Civics at Florida State University, with a mission of “revitalizing civic education while advancing principles of liberty.” All are creatures of the Republican-dominated Florida Legislature.
Cassanello also cited recent laws prohibiting diversity, equity, and inclusion, like SB 266 in 2023.
A neurologist at the private University of Miami has been fired, The Miami Hurricane reported Saturday. That professor’s post likened Kirk’s assassination to “what has been done to countless Palestinian babies, children, girls, boys, women and men not just of the past two years of the ongoing genocide, but decades,” the campus newspaper reported. 
University of Miami Health said in an Instagram post, “Freedom of speech is a fundamental right. At the same time, expressions that condone or endorse violence or are incompatible with our policies and values are not acceptable.”
Cassanello raised the example of Charles Negy, a professor at the University of Central Florida who was fired after arguing on social media posts in 2020 that Black Americans are not systemically oppressed and that their “being shielded from legitimate criticism is a privilege” following protests in 2020 sparked by George Floyd’s death.
“What you’re seeing now are conservatives kind of flipping the script,” Cassanello said, calling it “complete and utter hypocrisy.”
Following arbitration, Negy won his job back. UCF maintained he was not fired for his speech, but rather for creating a hostile classroom environment. The College Fix, a conservative-leaning outlet, said Nagy “had to defeat a cancellation.”
Alan Levine, vice chair of the Florida Board of Governors, shared his view on the Kirk-related investigations on social media.

This isn’t hard. Anyone who celebrates the death of someone is too untrustworthy and warped to be in a classroom teaching. As a teacher, are you so afraid of competing ideas that you actually wish the person who has a different opinion to die? If that’s you, you simply can’t…
— Alan Levine (@alevine014) September 14, 2025

Levine said he supports Hasner’s action.
Educators nationwide face similar calls from lawmakers and the general public, including in South Carolina, Kentucky, Iowa, and in Texas, where roughly 180 complaints have been filed against educators.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida released a statement about teachers facing investigation and removal Tuesday.
“The ACLU of Florida condemns all forms of political violence. It has no place in a true democracy. Nor does unbridled trampling of constitutional protections.
“The First Amendment does not protect speech that is likely and intended to provoke immediate acts of violence, or speech that expresses a serious intent to commit a specific act of violence, but it does protect robust free expression, which includes criticism of the past words and actions of prominent public figures.
“Dissent, disagreement, and counterspeech that criticizes political views should not be confused with condoning or encouraging violence, and should not be subject to the retaliatory, unconstitutional ire of politicians, which only feeds hostility and division,” the ACLU said.
The ACLU said it stands by prepared to “protect and preserve” the First Amendment, “even when we disagree.”
“Government actors calling for people to lose their jobs and livelihoods because they exercised their right to freely express political views that are controversial — a right Kirk himself exercised and encouraged for others — is alarming. Our state leaders should be focused on quelling tensions, not exacerbating them by stoking further division and punishing viewpoints with which they disagree,” the ACLU wrote.

It is the predictable outcome of decades of failed housing policy.,"Being unhoused is now a crime in the United States. That seems to be the message President Donald Trump sent by deploying the National Guard in Washington, DC, in response to a “crime emergency” despite 30-year low crime rates. 
On July 24, he signed an executive order calling for the removal of unhoused individuals from public spaces and their forced placement into institutions like for-profit prisons —without any plan for due process or rehousing. This anti-homeless rhetoric is echoed across the country, including in New Haven, where police, city workers, and “outreach staff” conduct encampment sweeps. 

Shreyas Nair
After interviewing over a dozen unhoused people in New Haven this summer, my takeaway was clear: these sweeps only reinforce the cycle of homelessness.
An encampment is defined as the congregation of at least one person in a public space as a means for shelter, with sweeps serving as the eviction from this land by city officials. Typical sites for encampments include wooded areas, underpasses, train stations, parks, and vacant lots. 
The main reasons for selection include security, a sense of community among other unhoused people, and proximity to various services in the city. Site choice is rational and survival-based. Unhoused people in New Haven must exist unseen to balance safety, access to resources, and avoidance of police harassment and other types of aggressive enforcement. 
The city may claim that sweeps serve to maintain public spaces; however, their actions are indefensible without offering real alternatives. As one unhoused resident put it: “They need to start housing the homeless if they want to conduct sweeps.”
The current alternatives —warming centers and shelters— are inadequate. While they provide relief for some, many of the interview respondents I spoke with outlined critical flaws. One said they had been placed at number 937 on a local shelter waitlist, underscoring the crisis of capacity. Those who were able to get into shelters expressed dissatisfaction with the facilities, highlighting inadequate supplies, undertrained staff, and major security concerns. The shelters’ inability to care for everyone’s needs coupled with the shortage of affordable housing lies at the foundation of the homelessness crisis.
Interview data demonstrates this instability. Most of the respondents had been unhoused previously, many citing cycles of prior encampment sweeps, incarceration, and job loss. Many reported being without shelter for over a year, and several had been without shelter for at least five years. This highlights long-term systemic displacement. Compounding this, nearly half of respondents said they received no official notice from city officials before a sweep, denying them even the pretense of due process.
As a consequence of these sweeps, respondents reported losing sleeping bags, tents, clothing, vital medications, legal/identification documents, electronic devices, cash, and even sentimental memorabilia. One respondent stated losing stuffed animals they received from a cherished family member. Many watched as city workers tossed their belongings into garbage trucks, with little or no information about retrieval. These losses stripped away necessities for survival, anchors of personal identity, and documents essential for escaping poverty. Encampments, fragile as they may be, provide community and stability; sweeps destroy both.
It is clear that these sweeps do nothing to address the root causes of homelessness. Instead, they destabilize lives, exacerbate health and safety risks, and entrench cycles of poverty. As long as homelessness is framed as a criminal act, these dehumanizing and ineffective measures will persist. And with public land stripped away, shelter capacity scarce, and affordable housing out of reach, the question remains, where else shall they go?
But it doesn’t have to be this way. Evidence from across the country shows that real solutions exist. The “housing first” model, which provides permanent supportive housing with wraparound services, has been proven both more effective and less costly than endless cycles of shelters, sweeps, and policing. Houston, for example, has dramatically reduced homelessness by investing in permanent housing, eviction prevention, and coordinated services.
While New Haven has taken some steps to expand affordable housing, the shortage remains severe. Other municipalities need to follow suit—and the governor’s veto of HB5002, a bill that could still pass in special session, only stalled further progress. New Haven—and Connecticut more broadly—could do the same. Expanding housing-first programs, investing in rental assistance and eviction diversion, strengthening tenant protections through measures like just cause eviction laws, designating public spaces for transitional housing such as tiny homes or sanctioned encampments, and guaranteeing transparency and due process during any encampment action are all concrete, proven steps. Temporary shelter is not enough; treating unhoused residents with dignity requires political will to make housing a human right.
Homelessness is not a crime. It is the predictable outcome of decades of failed housing policy. The question is whether Connecticut will continue punishing people for being poor —or commit to real solutions that break cycles of displacement and affirm housing as a right for all.

The world that Miller wants to make isn’t the legacy we elders want to leave. Instead, we will protest and organize and campaign with all the strength and wisdom we can muster – and that’s a lot!
Miller had better lament our pouring into the streets.  Most of us weren’t actually hippies. But we weren’t born yesterday and we know to follow the money.  We have wisdom accumulated from decades of participation in our democracy, experience honed in major leadership jobs, and rage triggered by the self-aggrandizing greed, racism and misogyny of this moment. Yes, we are a threat.


Trump is doing us a favor. He’s giving us an opportunity to create a whole new democracy – one built on empathy, justice, mercy and empowerment. One that values diversity, and builds economic as well as political democracy. One that values immigrants and people of all stations of life.  One that refuses to exploit the Earth and its resources and turns instead to renewable sources of energy that can be harnessed instead of burned.
We in Third Act CT are a movement of Connecticut elders standing up for democracy and for effective and strategic engagement with climate issues.  We stand irrefutably against the oligarchic autocracy now under construction.  We are elders, yes, but elders who have a vision of a different nation and a different world. We are protesters, yes, but we are also people of hope.  We don’t just protest. We also build the future through our movement, our leadership and our example – for instance, Sun Day CT, to be held on Sunday, September 21 from 12 noon to 4 p.m. at Central CT State University in New Britain.  On that day, we invite all Connecticut peoplke to join us for a free Festival of the Sun – setting the pace for the future of our state together.
The sun, after all, shines on all of us. It offers its energy, its light and its power to everyone regardless of status. From its power comes wind and other thermal gradient sources – and we are already harnessing it without depleting it!  Over 102,000 solar installations grace Connecticut now.  Imagine a future in which giant utilities don’t control your access to electricity and heat!  If there were ever a non-oligarchic source of energy, it’s the sun.
Yes, Miller, we “elderly hippies” have designs on the future – a completely different future than the one you are attempting to engineer. We call on our fellow Connecticut residents to join us in creating that new future, and hope you’ll start by joining us for Sun Day with great music, an environmental magician, gifted speakers, and a ton of activities for all ages – to learn about and support Connecticut’s move to full renewable energy as fast as possible. 
In the face of Miller and his henchmen who are trying to avert that future, we “elderly hippies,” joined with millions of others, are not going home. We are going to campaign, protest, organize and build hope anew across our state and our country.

Just how much costs could rise is still unknown in many states, but advocacy groups such as the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation are trying to estimate the impact to help states and individuals prepare. The nonprofit said that some Marylanders could see monthly premiums more than double if enhanced premium tax credits created during the COVID-19 pandemic expire.
“You have a lot of people who don’t get an offer of coverage from their job,” said Katherine Hempstead, national health policy expert for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
“These are people who don’t have another way to get health insurance because they are not eligible for Medicaid – their income is too high,” she said. “That could be people who work for small businesses … Someone who is self-employed – a musician or an entrepreneur.”
The enhanced federal tax credit was created in 2021 to help more people afford health insurance during the height of the pandemic. But Hempstead said health advocates want them to stick around because they encouraged people to get insurance who might otherwise go without.
US Senate Dems push GOP for extension of expiring health care subsidies

“Enhanced premium tax credits did two thing: It made the tax credits larger and it made more people eligible for them,” Hempstead said. “These enhanced premium tax credits solved a problem that a lot of people had with the marketplace, where they said, ‘That’s great but it’s still not affordable.’”
But the law creating those tax credits is set to expire at the end of the year unless Congress extends it. About  190,000 Marylanders currently benefit from the credits, according to state officials.
The RWJF estimates, released Monday, show how much monthly premiums could increase if the enhanced tax credits expire – which vary depending on age and how close the individual falls to the federal poverty level.
For example, a 40-year-old Marylander earning twice the federal poverty level, which would be a salary of about $31,000, may currently pay $47 in monthly premiums thanks to the enhanced tax credit. Without it, their monthly premium could jump  to $149 if they keep their lowest-level silver plan, according to the RWJF estimates.
A 40-year-old on the same plan at 250% of the federal poverty level could see premiums jump from $122 a month to $240 if the enhanced tax credits expire, nearly doubling their monthly expenses to maintain health coverage.
Hempstead noted that the RWJF estimates are likely more accurate for states that have already finalized their premium rate increases with insurers. Maryland insurance officials and health insurance carriers are still working out rate increases for 2026, according to a written statement from the Maryland Insurance Administration.
In August, the administration warned that carriers were requesting an average increase of 17.1% for all individual plans, accounting for the anticipated loss in enrollment if the tax credits expire. If the current tax credits were extended, rate increases would only jump about 8%, according to state documents.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“The assumption in those rates is that the tax credits will not be extended,” said Johanna Fabian-Marks, deputy executive director for the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange. “Insurers are assuming that individuals will drop coverage because of the premium increases.”
She noted that those most likely to leave the market are healthier individuals, who help keep premiums down because they pay into the insurance pool but are less likely to face significant health risks.
“They have a certain amount budgeted for health insurance and if that increases, they may not have the flexibility in their income to cover that,” Fabian-Marks said. “And they’re going to be deciding between paying that health insurance bill, paying their food bill, paying their rent, and health insurance may be the thing that they decide to gamble on and drop.
“That has knock-on effects for the state as a whole. We could see increases in uncompensated care at hospitals. That can increase hospital costs, which affects all Marylanders,” she said.
The Maryland Health Benefit Exchange runs the ACA marketplace for the state. Fabian-Marks said that MHBE estimates about 190,000 people insured through the marketplace would be impacted by the tax credits expiring, which she said would “drive an average of 68% increase in their premium.”
Insurers seek 17% hike in state marketplace premiums, amid ‘wild uncertainty’ at federal level

The remaining 110,000 Marylanders who have ACA insurance but do not qualify for those tax credits would also see monthly premiums rise due to the proposed 17.1% rate increase.
“That’s a really, really big increase and I’m sure a lot of people are going to say ‘I can’t afford it,’” said Hampstead. “It’s a big sticker shock for people.”
State subsidy bridge
In the most recent legislative session, lawmakers passed legislation aiming to mitigate potential disruptions in the state marketplace due to federal decisions.
That included a proposal to give the MHBE authority to create a state subsidy if the federal premium tax credit comes to an end. That authority would only be available for 2026 through 2028.
Fabian-Marks said that for 2026, the state subsidy would essentially replace the federal tax credit for those under 200% of the federal poverty level while offering partial assistance for others.
“For our lowest income enrollees, they will be kind of held harmless – that’s individuals under 200% of the federal poverty level,” Fabian-Marks said. “Individuals over that threshold, we are going to be able to replace, on average, about 50% of the value of the federal tax credits – up to 400% of the federal poverty level.
“That’s where we have to cut off the state subsidies because of our budget constraints,” she said.
But the state’s fraught fiscal outlook means those state subsidies could be temporary. Fabian-Marks hopes that Congress will choose to extend the tax credits in the next two years, otherwise the state legislature will have to have some “tough conversations.”
“We really can’t afford to maintain that level of generosity that we’ve set the program at for multiple years,” she said. “We’re hoping this could serve as a bridge.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/medicaidhealthinsuranceform-scaled-e1758072836564-1024x661.jpg,,,2025-09-16 23:56:15.936041

”We’ve just had a lot of conversations with neighbors and other residents close by — remembering her and just really feeling about what we can do to move forward. And part of this is also, of course, to take up her legacy at the Capitol,” Lee said.
The Legislature is currently not in session, but Gov. Tim Walz — who announced Tuesday he’ll seek a third term in 2026 — has said he wants to call a special legislative session to enact gun control laws after a gunman sprayed bullets at Church of Annunciation in Minneapolis last month, killing two and wounding 21 others.

Twenty-two youth are suing the Trump administration over the president’s executive orders aimed at supporting the fossil fuel industry, curbing renewable energy and suppressing climate science.
“This case asks a fundamental question. Does the United States Constitution guard against abuses of power by executive order that deprive children and youths of their fundamental rights to life and liberty?” Julia Olsen, founder of the law firm Our Children’s Trust and lead attorney for the plaintiffs said in her opening remarks. “The three executive orders the plaintiffs challenge prioritize pollution over protections for the most vulnerable Americans.” 
Tuesday in federal district court in Missoula, Olsen argued that Judge Dana Christensen should temporarily halt the Trump administration’s executive orders.
The Justice Department argued Christensen should dismiss the case for a lack of standing, on similar grounds as another federal climate-related lawsuit, Juliana v. United States, which was dismissed by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals after nearly a decade of litigation.  
In a brief opening statement, federal attorney Michael Sawyer said the case lacks standing and the plaintiffs are asking for the court to take policy-setting power away from the executive and legislative branches. 
The real matter, Sawyer said, is not an issue of constitutionality, but that the plaintiffs have policy differences with the president’s administration, which they are “entitled to” and can advocate for. 
“What they’re not entitled to is to ask the court to step in and resolve this energy policy dispute by interpreting the Constitution to require a certain energy policy,” Sawyer said.

 ‘Stop the climate from getting worse’

The lead plaintiff, 19-year-old Eva Lighthiser of Livingston, is one of several Montana plaintiffs who were also plaintiffs in the landmark Held v. Montana case, in which a district court and, in late 2024, the Montana Supreme Court, found the youth have a right to a stable climate system under Montana’s constitutional right to a “clean and healthful environment.”
In the current suit, Lighthiser is joined by Rikki Held, Lander and Badge Busse — sons of former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ryan Busse — and six others from the Montana lawsuit, as well as young people from Hawai‘i, Oregon, California and Florida, ages 7 to 25. 
Plaintiffs from Hawai’i were also involved in a successful youth-led climate lawsuit against the state’s Department of Transportation, while other plaintiffs took part in Juliana, a federal suit that sought a nationwide plan to address climate change.
President Donald Trump is a named defendant in the suit, along with 11 federal agencies and their respective agency heads, including the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency and NASA. 
At the heart of Lighthiser are Trump Executive Orders 14154, “Unleashing American Energy,” 14156, “Declaring a National Energy Emergency,” and 14261, “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry.” To carry out the orders, federal agencies have rolled back funding from climate-related initiatives and worked to streamline regulatory processes for extractive industry.  
Olsen said that while the science of climate change and its impacts on the plaintiffs are complex, she believes the lawsuit also carries a simple throughline. 
“The uncontested purpose of these executive orders is to expand fossil fuel use and suppress its biggest competitors,” Olsen said. “Defendants want us to buy more fossil fuels and less renewable energy, more combustion vehicles and fewer electric vehicles. The whole point of the trio of these EOs is to unleash fossil fuels.” 
And such an unleashing, she said, would exacerbate the cascade of harms experienced by the young people sitting in the federal courtroom. 
In a similar strategy to the Held trial, attorneys for the youth — Our Children’s Trust, an Oregon-based law firm, along with Gregory Law Group, McGarvey Law in Kalispell, and Public Justice — are using a mixture of plaintiff testimony and expert witnesses to make their arguments. 
Four young people took the stand on Tuesday, sharing their experiences with increased environmental disasters tied to rising greenhouse gas emissions. 
Joseph Lee, 19, a sophomore at UC San Diego, said that the outdoors “runs in my blood.”
“My connection to nature is a deeply healing one,” Lee said. “I honestly don’t know where I’d be without it.” 
Growing up in California, Lee said he dealt with severe asthma, made worse in extreme heat and smoky conditions from wildlifes. He shared a story of going for a walk during a heat wave, passing out due to heat stroke, and waking up in the hospital with his lungs “on the verge of collapse.” 
“I’m terrified to go outdoors,” Lee said. “Everytime I receive a notification on my phone, it’s a trigger, a reminder of the days two years ago I could have been on my deathbed because of an outdoor climate I can’t control.”
Lee also spoke about his desire to pursue a career in environmental and climate science and selected his university based on its reputation for housing internationally renowned research centers. 
However, Lee said he had recently had to change his major — which was “devastating” — after seeing job opportunities at his school removed and federal grants funding environmental science internships revoked. He said continued funding threats and proposed policy changes left him feeling hopeless about his future in the field.  
“Climate change is a big problem, but what (stopping) these executive orders will do, is they’re going to stop the climate from getting worse, and that’s all I’m asking for,” Lee said. 
Lawyers for Trump challenged a few aspects of the youths’ testimony, including whether any of their grievances could be specifically tied to one of the Executive Orders such as the elimination of climate internship programs or a delay in a high school receiving an EPA grant for electric buses, which another plaintiff testified about. 
They also asked two plaintiffs who own or work with horses if they should be prevented from raising horses to slow climate change.

 ‘Every tonne matters’

“Have the Executive Orders caused climate change?” attorney Miranda Jensen asked plaintiffs’ expert witness Steven Running. 
“They haven’t yet,” said Running, a former NASA scientist and contributor to the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which was awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize for its work. 
But continuing to focus on the fossil fuel industry will contribute to climate change and exacerbate harms to the plaintiffs, Running stated. 
Running shared the basics of climate science and showed how coal mined in Montana ends up as atmospheric CO2. 
Some mined coal is shipped by rail to port cities on the coast, then shipped on barges overseas where it is burned to generate electricity. 
“The carbon dioxide comes back to Montana in the atmosphere faster than the empty barges get back here,” Running said. 
In his testimony, Running distilled several decades of climate research for the court: “Every additional tonne (of carbon dioxide) matters to the whole world and definitely matters to these plaintiffs. The sooner we slow down emissions, the sooner we stabilize the climate. It’s really pretty straight forward.” 
Attorneys for the youth also called John Podesta to testify as a witness focusing on a president’s power to utilize executive orders. 
Podesta served in three Democratic administrations  — as President Bill Clinton’s chief of staff, a counselor to President Barack Obama and as a senior adviser for clean energy and climate policy for President Joe Biden — and spoke about how executive orders are processed. 
His testimony also focused on the far-reaching impacts of the executive orders – including rolling back funding from climate resiliency initiatives, renewable energy programs and scientific research. 
The Trump administration dismissed hundreds of scientists tasked with authoring the next edition of the Naitonal Climate Assessment, and climate-related terminology has been removed from many agency websites. 
Such actions are effectively blindfolding not just the federal government, but state and local governments working to create resilient communities Podesta said.
“If you have those facts in front of you … the decision to ignore it and rush to unleash more fossil fuels and more pollution is going to be challenged as arbitrary and capricious, not well-taken, and certainly going to harm these plaintiffs,” Podesta said. 
The lack of access to knowledge will lead to “more pollution, more extreme weather, more heat waves, more asthma, more trauma, stronger hurricanes, and we’ll be dealing with that and dealing with trying to build resilient communities with a blindfold on.”
“These kids are being harmed by these actions,” he told the judge. “And the court can do something about that.”
A final expert witness who testified on Tuesday was Mark Jacobson, director of Stanford University’s Atmosphere/Energy Program. 
Jacobson shared his work crafting conceptual plans for all 50 states, and D.C. to transition 100% to renewable energy by building more wind, solar and battery projects and using existing hydropower generation.
The benefits, Jacobson said, would be far-reaching, including decreasing national energy use and residential energy costs, reducing land use and preventing nearly 100,000 annual deaths due to air pollution. 
It’s a transition he said is already underway in China, which at current rates could be fully renewable by 2045, while it would take America 100 more years if the government continues to prioritize fossil fuels.

 The forthcoming case for dismissal

The government’s side will take up a larger portion of Wednesday’s hearing as Christiansen focuses on their motion to dismiss the suit. 
Tuesday in his opening statement, Sawyer stated that Trump’s executive order on unleashing American energy includes bolstering some forms of renewable energy including geothermal, biofuels and nuclear energy. 
“Why are plaintiffs, who claim to suffer climate change injuries, asking the court to make it harder to deploy renewables or nuclear energy by halting these executive orders?” Sawyer asked the court.  
While the executive order on unleashing energy mentions some renewable sources, it specifically excludes wind, solar and battery storage from its definition of “energy,” which Podesta had said “hobbles” those sectors. 
Sawyer said challenging broad, sweeping executive orders ordering agencies to consider their regulatory actions was not the correct avenue. 
“… When agencies issue final decisions, they will be subject to judicial review in the courts of appeal. That’s the correct forum for disputes, not a lawsuit where plaintiffs seek wholesale change of national energy policy,” Sawyer said. 
Sawyer said the American people had elected a new administration less than a year ago, and the lawsuit amounted to a request for the court to step in an “overrule the results of that election.”
“At its core, this is an anti-democratic lawsuit,” he said. 
The state of Montana is leading a coalition of 18 other Republican states, and the Territory in Guam, as additional defendants in the lawsuit.

(Photo by Michael G. Seamans/ Maine Morning Star)The U.S. Department of Justice announced Tuesday that it sued Maine and Oregon for declining to turn over personal voter information. 
“Maine has some of the best elections in the nation,” Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said in a statement. “It is absurd that the Department of Justice is targeting our state when Republican and Democratic secretaries all across the country are fighting back against this federal abuse of power just like we are.”
Maine’s Department of the Secretary of State has received no notification of the lawsuit, as of late Tuesday. The Oregon Secretary of State’s Office also told Maine Morning Star’s partner outlet the Oregon Capital Chronicle that it hasn’t seen a court filing. No documents have yet shown up on the court record database PACER.
But in a press release, the U.S. Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division said that it sued the two states and their respective secretaries of state for not providing information about voter list maintenance procedures and electronic copies of statewide voter registration lists.
Bellows, a Democrat, has twice rejected the Trump administration’s requests for sensitive voter data, first on Aug. 8 and most recently on Sept. 8.
Trump administration requested voter data. Secretary Bellows says, ‘Go jump in the Gulf of Maine’

The DOJ sent its first sweeping request for voter data on July 24, which asked for the statewide voter registration list, names of officials who handle the list’s maintenance, the number of ineligible voters the state identified due to noncitizenship and other information from November 2022 through the receipt of the letter. Earlier, on July 10, the Executive Office for United States Attorneys sent an email requesting a phone call with Bellows to discuss a “potential information-sharing agreement.”
The second request from the DOJ, sent Aug. 18, again asked for all fields of Maine’s full voter registration list and added a request for voter registration applications from a 19-month period, from December 1, 2023 to July 1, 2025.
According to the DOJ, the lawsuit against Maine alleges the state and Bellows violated the National Voter Registration Act, the Help America Vote Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1960 by refusing to provide “data regarding the removal of ineligible individuals and to produce an unredacted, computerized state voter registration list.”
In Bellows’ responses to the DOJ, she has questioned the federal agency’s intentions and maintained that the requests seek more information than required by federal law. 
She has also said the data demands appear to violate federal privacy laws, specifically the Privacy Act of 1974 and the e-Government Act of 2004, given that the department hasn’t shared how voters’ personal information will be stored, accessed and retained within government systems. She said “complying would put the privacy and data security of Mainers at risk.”
Last week, the Trump administration confirmed that the Department of Justice is sharing state voter roll information with the Department of Homeland Security in a search for noncitizens.

(Photo courtesy of University of Iowa)National Institutes of Health grant terminations hit the University of Iowa hardest out of the dozens of universities housed in the state this summer, according to a national project working to compile grant dollars that have been frozen or canceled entirely as President Donald Trump and his administration seek to end federal funding for certain research.
There are eight National Institutes of Health grants identified by Grant Witness to have seen termination in Iowa, with only one seeing possible reinstatement. They run the gamut of research — from cancer to cochlear implants, Alzheimer’s to vaccine messaging, genomes to access to research careers.

Many of the projects were multiple years into their work before facing termination, having already received hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of grant funds.
The longest-running project to see its funding terminated has received federal funding since 2013, according to USAspending, an open data source tracking federal spending. The study was set to run through a portion of 2028 and receive a total of $5.7 million, but funding was canceled in May and the project reportedly ended in July.
According to the project summary reported by NIH, the canceled study was looking into using different materials on the surfaces of cochlear implants — a surgically implanted device to aid people with severe hearing impairment — in order to reduce bacteria and lower the risk of infection and other issues.
“Additionally, this work will provide a deserving researcher from an underrepresented group an exceptional career training and mentorship experience,” the summary stated.
A UI program aimed at increasing research accessibility also saw its federal grant terminated this year, with the Maximizing Access to Research Careers (UI-MARC) program having received $1.3 million in funding so far and expecting $1.5 million in total. According to USAspending, the goal of the initiative is to “develop a diverse pool of undergraduates who complete their baccalaureate degree and transition into and complete biomedical research-focused higher degree programs.”
The Iowa Sciences Academy, in which the UI-MARC program is housed, stated in a May story about the program that it expected its federal funding would not be renewed for fiscal year 2026, “due to changing funding priorities at the NIH.”
Other canceled medical research included one study diving into potential therapies for people with early Alzheimer’s disease and another studying new therapies for those dealing with triple-negative breast cancer, which the project summary stated is the only type of breast cancer with no targeted therapy. University of Iowa researchers were also studying responses to a certain therapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
Two of the terminated grants provided funding to studies diving into topics the Trump administration has spoken about previously, namely vaccines and rural health care.
One grant, started in August 2020, was supposed to provide a total of nearly $520,000 to University of Iowa researcher Aaron Scherer to find the motives that spur unvaccinated, older adults to get their vaccines and work with older adults who are hesitant to vaccines to develop motivational influenza vaccine messaging and complete a pilot study to judge its efficacy.
Nearly $3 million has gone to the launch and upkeep of the Iowa Cancer Affiliate Network, a support program for cancer centers and rural hospitals across Iowa, since April 2021, but its grant was terminated in March with six months still left to go and a projected total grant award of $3.6 million, according to USAspending.
The only grant to have been possibly reinstated deals with differences in polygenic scores based on sex. “A novel approach for understanding how sex influences polygenic score associations,” started in September of 2022, explores what is described in its description online as “summaries of the genomic contribution to risk and resilience for biomedical traits.”
Research into polygenic scores has traditionally left out groups like gender minorities, according to the description, and the study seeks to close the gap by developing a new method for study of sex-related differences for both genomic and general research. Its end date is slated in the award summary for July 31, 2026, with $1.4 million of the $1.6 million obligated amount processed.
The grant was ruled to be reinstated this summer according to Grant Witness’s data, but the organization states on its website grants under this category are being listed as “possibly reinstated” because its members do not know what the reinstatement process will look like or how long it will take.

Ann Rest, DFL-New Hope, will retire when her current term ends in 2027 after serving over 40 years in the Minnesota Legislature, having won election to the House the same year the late Walter Mondale lost 49 states to President Ronald Reagan.
Rest, chair of the powerful Senate Taxes Committee, in 2023 shepherded a progressive tax bill that included rebate checks for over 2.5 million Minnesotans and a child tax credit that is estimated to reduce childhood poverty rates in Minnesota by one-third.
“Serving in the Minnesota state Legislature for more than 40 years has been the honor of my life, and it will continue to be until my current term ends next year,” Rest said in a statement. “I’ve seen many changes in that time and made some happen myself; my priority of working to improve the lives of people in my district and across the state remains the same.”
A few years ago, Rest went viral on social media for scolding her colleagues on the Senate floor for failing to adhere to the chamber’s strict rules of decorum. Rest, elected to the House in 1984 and the Senate in 2000, is known for her traditionalism, her generally progressive politics notwithstanding. She joined a small, ad hoc group of women senators in 2021 to talk about Senate attire.
She’s long been known not to suffer fools, winning degrees in Latin and Greek from Northwestern, where she was a Woodrow Wilson Fellow; the University of Chicago; Harvard and the University of Minnesota. She has been both a teacher and certified public accountant with a degree in business taxation, which served her well on the Taxes Committee.
In 2023, she made history as the sole Minnesota legislator ever to chair the Taxes Committees in both the House and the Senate. 
Her retirement announcement creates an opening. Rep. Mike Freiberg, DFL-Golden Valley, is in Rest’s district,  and he didn’t immediately respond to the Reformer’s request for comment about his reelection plans.
In her statement, Rest reflected on the importance of women in politics.
Women, she said, “have provided some of the most significant leadership to renew our society and to direct us to a world that is both sane and safe.” She hinted that she’s hoping her successor will be a woman. Over the past few weeks, Rest said, she has “been encouraging women leaders to consider a run for the state Senate in our district.”
Democrats currently hold a slim, one-seat majority in the Minnesota Senate. All 67 Senate seats will be on the ballot in 2026; Rest’s district is safely Democratic.

States and clinicians are working on getting correct information on vaccines to vulnerable groups amid shifting federal guidance. (Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)The state health department is recommending COVID-19 vaccines for all Wisconsinites 6 months and older and authorizing pharmacies to give the vaccine without an individual prescription.
In addition, Wisconsin’s insurance regulator issued guidance to health insurance companies that the shots are to be provided without a patient co-payment.
Both department declarations were issued Tuesday following Monday’s executive order from Gov. Tony Evers to protect vaccine access.
At the Department of Health Services (DHS), Dr. Ryan Westergaard, chief medical officer and state epidemiologist for communicable diseases, issued a standing medical order recommending the vaccine for all eligible Wisconsin residents this fall. With the order, no prescription is needed, DHS said.
The health department said its recommendation for the vaccine follows guidance from the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Academy of Family Physicians.
States, public health organizations and agencies have been stepping in to recommend the vaccines for COVID-19 and for other communicable diseases following a shift at the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) away from vaccine recommendations under the administration of President Donald Trump and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Kennedy, who has long embraced anti-vaccine views, has replaced the members of a CDC committee on vaccination with vaccine skeptics, and the body is expected to consider softening or eliminating some recommendations for the COVID-19 vaccine and some childhood immunizations. 
The Food and Drug Administration has narrowed its recommendations for the COVID-19 vaccine to people 65 or older, while public health advocates have called for maintaining the vaccine schedule for all ages.
The DHS order states it “is also intended to authorize vaccination for other groups for whom professional society guidance supports vaccination — such as children, adolescents, pregnant people, and healthy adults under 65 — even though these uses are considered ‘offlabel.’”
“Everyone in Wisconsin should be able to make the choice to protect themselves and their families against COVID-19, and that choice should be based on the best available science and medical recommendations,” DHS Secretary Kirsten Johnson said in a department statement. “As the federal government limits access to the vaccine, we want to reassure Wisconsinites that recommendations from our nation’s leading medical associations are clear, and we will work every day to support access to care and resources to help families make the best decisions on how to protect themselves from illness and disease.”
The Office of the Commissioner of Insurance (OCI) said in a bulletin that based on “the evidence-based guidance” from DHS and state laws against discrimination in insurance coverage, “the commissioner continues to expect that all governmental self-funded and fully insured group health plans and individual health plans will cover, without cost sharing, all costs associated with administration of COVID-19 vaccinations for all policyholders.”

(Photo courtesy American Wild Horse Conservation)America’s wild horses have faced competition from livestock, unfair resource allocation, and shrinking habitat for generations. The federal government’s response has been traumatic and controversial, including helicopter roundups at taxpayer expense. These roundups have proven ineffective in the long term, yet they continue, despite the outrageous cost.
Nevada’s Virginia Range is home to a treasured population of wild horses facing a shrinking habitat because of human and industrial encroachment. The Virginia Range, just east of Reno, is also home to the world’s largest wild horse fertility control program, proving another path is possible — and it’s working. American Wild Horse Conservation (AWHC) is leading the way in humanely reversing wild horse population growth through its self-funded fertility control program. Having recently finished its sixth year (and beginning year seven), the program has achieved something remarkable: an 82 percent reduction in foal births between January-June 2025 compared to the same period in 2020.
Seeking to demonstrate that well-researched fertility control could be scaled up, the results of AWHC’s work were analyzed, peer-reviewed and published in the journal Vaccines last year, marking the most successful wild horse fertility control program of its size in the United States — if not the world.
The Virginia Range program uses an immunocontraceptive vaccine known as PZP (porcine zona pellucida). Administered by trained volunteers via remote darting, PZP prevents pregnancy in mares without harming hormone cycles or behaviors, and it’s reversible. Unlike roundups, it doesn’t traumatize or remove horses from their habitat.
The scale of this effort is significant.
More than 40 community volunteers have worked across almost 300,000 acres to reach over 70 percent of reproductive-age mares. Combined with natural attrition and predation, their efforts have begun to reduce the overall population in areas where darting is consistently applied. These results are impressive, and they prove that humane management without cruel and costly helicopter roundups is a viable option for our nation’s wild herds.
Notably, the program operates without state or federal funding. Local businesses, including Blockchains Inc. and the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, have helped support access and logistics, making it a model of public-private cooperation. It’s a humane, scientifically sound, and fiscally responsible approach. And yet it remains the exception, not the rule.
Despite $11 million of funding made available by Congress, federal agencies, particularly the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), have yet to embrace fertility control as a primary management strategy.
Instead, they continue to round up thousands of wild horses each year and house them in long-term holding facilities, where many remain for life, at 30 times the cost per horse of in-the-wild fertility control.
The USA now has more wild horses in captivity than running free on the rangelands in the West.
According to government reports, this system now consumes over two-thirds of the BLM’s wild horse and burro budget, costing taxpayers $100 million annually.
There is no denying that wild horse management is complex. Habitats are shrinking due to development, drought, and competing land uses. But as AWHC’s Virginia Range project shows, compassionate and cost-effective solutions already exist — and they’re scalable. What’s lacking is the political will to shift away from outdated and inhumane practices toward methods that are proven to work.
If the federal government is serious about reforming wild horse management, it should look west to Nevada, where a group of citizen scientists and volunteers is making history.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tracy-Wilson-d-1-1536x1024-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-09-16 19:57:30.347945

Women in the U.S. typically earned 85% as much as men for every hour they spent working in 2024. However, working women are faring much better than their moms and grandmothers did 40 years ago. In the mid-1980s, women were making only 65% as much as men for every hour of paid work.
Women’s wages have improved relative to what men earn in part because of gains in their education and work experience, and because women have moved into higher-paying occupations. But progress toward pay equality has stalled.
As sociologists and demographers, we wanted to know whether changes in American families might also have helped women come closer to pay equality with men. In an article published in June 2025 in Social Forces, an academic journal, we argued that this pay gap is becoming smaller in part because women are having fewer children.
 Moms earn less but dads earn more

In the U.S. and elsewhere, ample evidence shows that parenthood affects men’s and women’s wages differently.
Compared to remaining childless, motherhood leads to wage losses for women. And those losses are larger when women have more kids.
By contrast, after men become fathers their wages usually rise.
Because having kids tends to push women’s wages down and men’s wages up, parenthood widens the gender pay gap.
 Decline in birth rate plays a role

Americans are having fewer kids in general. Women, including those who don’t work outside the home, had an average of about three children by their 40s in 1980. By 2000, that average had fallen to 1.9, and it has been fairly stable since then.
To see whether changes in how many kids working American moms have affects what they earn relative to men, we analyzed data collected from a nationally representative sample of U.S. families. We tracked trends over time in the number of children that employed Americans ages 30-55 have.
We found that employees’ average number of children fell significantly between 1980 and 2000, declining from around 2.4 to around 1.8. That average stabilized after 2000; employees had an average of about 1.8 children in 2018 – the most recent year in our analysis.
At the same time, the pay that women in this age range earned per hour relative to men rose steeply. It climbed from 58% in 1980 to 69% by 1990 and then rose more gradually to 76% by 2018. That is, as people were having fewer kids, the gender pay gap got smaller. For both trends, there was rapid change in the 1980s, followed by slower change after 1990.
We next estimated whether declines in the number of children men and women have can explain the narrowing of the gender pay gap between 1980 and 2018.
We found that, even after adjusting for other factors, such as years of education, prior work experience and occupation, about 8% of the decline in the gender pay gap can be explained by the lower number of children working women and men are having.
Next, we showed that the number of children American employees had declined faster in the 1980s than later on. That slowdown coincided with a deceleration of women’s gains in pay relative to men. Once the average number of children that U.S. employees had stabilized around 2000, so did women’s progress toward earning as much as men.
 Questions about the future of US fertility

U.S. scholars and policymakers are debating whether and why Americans are having fewer children today than one or two decades ago, and what the government should do about it.
We agree that these are important questions.
Our research shows that any future changes in how many children Americans have are very likely to affect how quickly women and men reach pay equality. But it’s not inevitable.
The number of children Americans have affects the gender pay gap only because parenthood decreases women’s wages while increasing men’s wages. As long as these unequal effects of parenthood on what men and women earn persist, they will continue to act as a brake on women’s progress toward equal pay.

The Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter said it could be displaced for up to a month. […],"A foster pup from the Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter. (Provided by the shelter and Facebook)Staff are still struggling and some animals are dealing with the effects of smoke following a drug burn mishap last week that sickened more than a dozen employees of the Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter and sent them to the hospital.
The Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter said it could be displaced for up to a month.
Some animals are being fostered, while others were being held at a separate facility last week. A Facebook post from the organization offered an update Tuesday of the situation for employees and animals.
On Sept. 10, methamphetamine was being burned in an incinerator when a “negative pressure issue” forced smoke into the shelter, a Billings Police Department news release said.
A “partner agency” — which the Associated Press identified as the Federal Bureau of Investigation — was burning the drug in an incinerator usually used for animal carcasses.
“The Billings Police Department follows a set schedule for narcotics destruction, in which the health department is notified as well as documentation of each disposal,” the Billings Police release said. “The Billings Police Department and partner agencies have long used the incinerator for narcotics destruction.”
But the animal shelter said the incident last week is one of a series of similar ones the shelter has reported to the City of Billings since 2023 — and a repair was attempted in 2024. 
The release said staff on scene were able to evacuate the animals in the shelter, which numbered about 75. Staff on scene were taken to Billings Clinic and Intermountain Health. Some staff members were on oxygen for hours.
Animals that were exposed to the smoke have been decontaminated and bathed, with Trailhead Veterinary Services playing a major role, the shelter’s statement said.
In a statement posted to their website, Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter executive director Triniti Halverson said the shelter wasn’t notified of the plan to incinerate meth and laid out what happened. 
“I can firmly and confidently say that, as the Executive Director, I did not know that they were disposing of extremely dangerous narcotics on site,” Halverson’s statement said.
Halverson wrote that when smoke began “pouring” into their feline rooms, she instructed staff to put on masks and begin to evacuate animals. Staff were exposed to the smoke for around an hour, she said.
She then instructed them to go to the emergency room.
“Within minutes of arrival, we were triaged and placed on oxygen,” Halverson’s statement said.
Doctors recommended three hours of oxygen to “prevent short and long term effects.” A Facebook post from the organization on Tuesday said staff were “struggling.”
“Last Wednesday, fourteen of our staff were hospitalized after exposure to meth-contaminated smoke. Ten required hyperbaric treatment at Billings Clinic, with several needing repeated care as symptoms worsened,” the organization said in the post. “Recovery has been slow and uncertain, taking a toll on both our health and our sense of safety. Through it all, our team continues to fight for our mission and care for the animals who depend on us.”
It’s not the first time smoke entering the facility has been an issue.
“Late in 2023, YVAS experienced smoke entering the facility from the crematorium and promptly reported the issue to City administration,” the shelter’s statement said. “There were several continued incidents over the next year, and each time, YVAS escalated the complaints within the City of Billings. In 2024, the City of Billings attempted to repair the crematorium and create protocols to prevent smoke from entering the shelter. YVAS had not experienced issues since then until 9/10/25.”
However, shelter staff had been “told” the police department was using the incinerator, but the shelter’s statement said “no details were ever confirmed.”
The animal shelter has rented part of the 9,002-square-foot building from the City of Billings since 2009. Another section of the building is used by the City of Billings Animal Control Operation, which disposes of wild and domestic animals euthanized by Animal Control Officers, the shelter’s statement said.
Yellowstone Valley is a no-kill shelter, which means it has a “save” rate of 90% or above. 
The building itself is being decontaminated as well and may be out of use for up to a month, the shelter statement said.
“We are displaced, lost, and homeless,” the shelter’s statement said.
The shelter is asking for monetary donations and supplies, which can be dropped off at Trailhead Veterinary services at 1327 Central Ave. Trailhead in Billings.

In the town that kick-started his career, supporters of the assassinated conservative activist mourn his murder.
The post Charlie Kirk memorial service fills Jackson church appeared first on WyoFile .","More than 100 of Charlie Kirk’s supporters gathered Monday to mourn the assassination of the Turning Point founder in the town that kick-started his political career.
A policeman stood guard outside the Redeemer Lutheran Church in Jackson, where the service was held.
“We have no fear,” Pastor David Bott told people in the packed pews. “No fear,” he said, even though there are “concerned folks outside the building who are worried about us.”
Kirk’s death, Bott said, revealed the actual cost of discipleship. “We see how high that cost can be,” Bott told mourners.
Bott prayed that Kirk’s assassin would repent. “He considered Charlie unworthy of life,” Bott said of the person who shot the conservative activist on Sept. 10 during an event at Utah Valley University.
“What was really happening was this guy was coming to town to lead us.” Judd Grossman
The pastor gave his sermon to members of his flock and visiting mourners unfamiliar with the Lutheran way. “My wife told me to pick familiar hymns,” he said while welcoming strangers.
Lynn Friess, wife of the late Foster Friess, who gave Kirk’s organization its first big check, was in the congregation. A day earlier, she announced that she would give $1 million “to support the thousands of new [Turning Point USA] chapters springing up across the country.”
“Foster always believed in Charlie’s vision and often said that helping Charlie build TPUSA was the best investment he ever made,” her Facebook post announcing the donation read.
Devastated
“I never met the man,” Bott said of Kirk. Nevertheless, upon learning of the assassination, “I found myself choked up.”
Many were similarly shocked.
Mourner Hort Spitzer said he had guided two late wives through cancer to their ends. Yet with Kirk, “I’ve never been so emotionally affected by someone’s death.”
Judd Grossman, who met Kirk when Foster Friess first brought the young activist to Jackson to make connections and raise funds, was equally devastated. He called the assassination the most momentous and consequential killing since those of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy.

“I definitely see him as probably the most dynamic leader in the conservative movement besides Trump,” Grossman said. “He was actually a leader of people. He could have been president.”
Among hymns, readings and prayers, Pastor Bott said Kirk had a powerful intellect.
“He simply asked people who disagreed with him questions,” Bott said. “That challenged his detractors to do something they weren’t used to — think.”
When challenged, the pastor said, Kirk “just responded with truth.”
Kirk had critics who said he was hateful, but Bott said the political activist’s trademark speeches on college campuses were polite and respectful.
Grossman got a sneak peek at Kirk’s passion, focus and dedication about 13 years ago. Foster Friess set up a lunch meeting among Kirk, Grossman and the late state Sen. Leland Christensen at the Wort Hotel in Jackson.
“When Foster invited me to something, it was always interesting,” Grossman said.
Didn’t finish his lunch
Despite not having any money, Grossman thought he and Christensen earned an invitation to support Kirk’s mission because of their conservative credentials.
“I felt puffed up,” Grossman said. Kirk was just a teen, Grossman remembered.
“I thought, ‘OK, here’s this young kid. Leland and I will mentor him, impart our wisdom about the deep roots of conservative philosophy. It will be great for the kid.’”
Grossman remembers seeing Kirk silhouetted in the large windows of the Wort, the world passing by on Jackson’s Broadway just outside.
Then began “five to 10 minutes of chit-chat,” Grossman said, “trying to tell him a little about Jackson Hole, the Tea Party.”

The two sensed something amiss. Kirk’s phone rang, he took the call and disappeared for a few minutes. Back at the table, he got to the point.
“I gotta go,” Kirk said, according to Grossman.
“He was gone,” Grossman said, “our meeting was cut short.”
As for the lunch, “I’m not sure he ate much of it at all.
“I was like ‘The nerve of this guy, he’s missing out on all this wisdom,’” Grossman recalled.
“It was kind of funny and a little embarrassing,” Grossman said in hindsight. “I thought I was a little more important than I [really] was.”
Grossman believed he and Christensen were there to pass the conservative torch to another generation.
“What was really happening was this guy was coming to town to lead us.”
“He [was] laser-focused,” Grossman said. “His job was to raise some money. He didn’t have any time to waste.
“It’s extra poignant now that his life has been cut short.”

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — State Auditor Mike Foley in a new report this week accused the mayor of a small western Nebraska town of possibly misusing public equipment and resources for the mayor’s personal benefit, including spraying a weedy area near his driveway with a city-owned utility vehicle.
Foley also raised eyebrows about “excessive” city payments to the mayor’s “Handyman” business.
The auditor on Tuesday released a 20-page report to the Panhandle City of Mitchell detailing findings and including photos. One image, for example, purports to show Paul Murrell, the mayor of the town with a population of less than 2,000 people, using a city-owned weed sprayer vehicle in an area near his home.

When questioned, Murrell reportedly denied allegations and said the vehicle in question was his own and provided a sales and tax statement. Foley’s team dug deeper and, with assistance from the Scotts Bluff County Sheriff’s Office, said it “confirmed” that the vehicle in the photo was city property.
“I am amazed that anyone, especially a government official, would attempt to mislead my auditors,” Foley wrote in a statement. “Do they really think that we won’t verify the information provided?”
Murrell did not respond to the Nebraska Examiner’s request for comment.
Mitchell City Council President Sean Hopkins said Tuesday the city had no additional comment at this time. 
The city’s general response in the report said its leaders do not “take lightly the matters brought forward” and intend to improve. The response says the city plans to implement a policy more clearly prohibiting the personal use of city resources by employees or public officials. It said the city also was taking steps to review all records and agreements, audit all accounts and update policies to ensure an “efficient and transparent system.”
Foley pointed out state law that prohibits intentional obstruction of the auditor and said his team would forward all documentation to the Scotts Bluff County Attorney’s Office, the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office and the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission for review. 
He said Mitchell’s mayor had given the state audit team an all-terrain vehicle and utility-type vehicle sales and use tax form to support his claim that he owned the utility vehicle shown in the photo.
“Likely ignorant of that statutory prohibition and the attendant criminal penalty, the mayor appears to have tried unsuccessfully to dupe Foley’s audit team with a deceptive sales tax form,” Foley said.

In addition, the auditor’s team went through bank statements, City Council meeting minutes, claims listings and invoices to identify “several questionable payments” made between January 2023 and this past March from the bank accounts of a city-owned assisted living and nursing facility in Mitchell called The Center. 
Over that same period, the report said, Murrell’s Handyman business received 12 payments from The Center totaling $47,448. The auditing team said the City Council approved only nine of the payments, totaling about $30,450. 
“This apparent lack of approval by the City Council means that the mayor would have unilaterally authorized and signed the payments to his business, as he is an authorized user on the Center’s bank accounts,” the report said. 
Auditors alleged that the approval process could have run afoul of  the Nebraska Political Accountability and Disclosure Act.
The city, in response, told the auditing team that The Center’s administrator did not relay any concerns regarding work performed by the mayor and said the mayor has performed “a significant amount of pro-bono work” for the city and The Center.
City leadership told auditors that any missing transactions would have been due to omissions by The Center’s administrator, who was responsible for bills presented to the City Council.
Foley said Mitchell taxpayers alerted his office to some of the issues in the report, which prompted the auditor’s investigation.

This is the fifth person from the state to die this year from a vibrio vulnificus inflection, which officials said are occurring at a higher rate than typically reported. 
Vibrio live in coastal waters and are found in higher numbers from May to October, when water temperatures are warmer. Persons can contract the bacteria through open wounds or when eating uncooked seafood, mainly oysters.
The state did not say whether the latest death was the result of an infected wound or consuming tainted seafood.
So far this year, there have been 26 vibrio cases among Louisiana residents – all of whom were hospitalized. Out of those 26 cases, 85% had wounds that were exposed to seawater, and all but two had at least one underlying health condition. 
Vibrio infections spread rapidly, with 20% of cases resulting in death, according to the stat health department. Patients often require intensive care and amputations once limbs are infected.
Anyone can contract vibrio, but people with certain medical conditions or receiving specific treatments are at higher risk for infection and severe complications. Those who are particularly vulnerable are individuals with liver disease, cancer, diabetes, HIV or the variation of anemia known as thalassemia. Patients who are undergoing immune-suppressing therapy, taking medicine to decrease stomach acid or have recently undergone stomach surge are also at higher risk.  
Over the past 10 years, Louisiana has reported an average of 10 vibrio cases and one death per year. Health officials say between 150 and 200 vibrio cases are reported annually in the U.S., with about half coming from the Gulf States, the state health department said.
Florida has reported 25 vibrio cases and five related deaths this year. Alabama has recorded 30 cases. 
As of August, Mississippi counted three vibrio cases and one death from a person inflected through a leg wound, Mississippi Public Broadcasting reported. Texas had reported five cases as of last month, according to the Houston Chronicle.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PXL_20250208_234403564-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-09-16 19:57:30.347945

(Photo by Mark Sanchez for Source NM)The New Mexico Foundation for Open Government on Monday filed lawsuits against two of the state’s largest universities for allegedly refusing to release public records showing how the schools will pay millions of public dollars to student athletes resulting from an antitrust lawsuit.
A federal judge in June approved the terms of a nearly $2.8 billion settlement that paved the way for schools to directly pay athletes. Under the settlement, schools may choose to share revenues with student athletes up to an estimated cap of approximately $20.5 million per institution for the 2025-26 academic year.
The suits against the board of regents and record custodians at University of New Mexico and New Mexico State University allege they are violating the state Inspection of Public Records Act by refusing to release their contracts with student athletes and other documents that would show how they would implement new revenue-sharing rules resulting from the settlement.
Both schools denied NMFOG’s records requests on the grounds that the documents include “educational records” and “trade secrets,” according to the complaints. The other plaintiff in the NMSU lawsuit, high school and college sports reporter Nick Nuñez, alleges that the school initially claimed that it didn’t have any records responsive to his requests, but Assistant Athletic Director of Media Relations Michael Navarette told him they in fact did possess the records.
NMFOG noted in a news release on Tuesday that before the settlement, private third parties paid student athletes to use their “name, image and likeness,” — known as NIL — and compensation terms were largely unknown to the public. After the settlement, public universities like UNM and NMSU are making direct payments to student athletes, and “records of these expenditures by state institutions should be public, like any other state expense would be,” the group said.
“In addition to the universities’ total secrecy on how they will spend millions of dollars,” NMFOG said in a statement, the schools also are “hiding the contractual terms they require students to abide by, meaning there is no way to know whether students are being treated fairly” or whether the schools’ agreements with the student athletes abide by Title IX, a 1972 law requiring schools that receive federal funding to provide equitable opportunities and treatment to men and women athletes.
The lawsuits cite other schools’ revenue-sharing contracts that have reportedly raised concerns, such as one at Florida State University that allowed the school to extend its contract with a student athlete without renegotiating the terms, and one for the South Carolina women’s basketball team that included a nondisclosure agreement prohibiting them from sharing their compensation with anyone.
“It calls into question, what are the terms here?” NM FOG Legal Director Amanda Lavin said in an interview. “Students aren’t necessarily the ones with bargaining power — it’s the universities.”
Neither university would comment.
“We’re just learning about this filing and have no comment at this time,” UNM Interim Executive Director of Strategic Communications Ben Cloutier told Source NM via email on Tuesday.
NMSU Spokesperson Amanda Bradford also said in a written response that NMSU had not yet “received service of the lawsuit” and would be “reserving comment until after that’s been accomplished.”

At least seven households in Richmond have received mailings this month that falsely claim to come from the town and that officials say are likely targeting people who have engaged in contentious local debate over a Black Lives Matter sign and flag.
Josh Arneson, the Richmond town manager, said local police are looking into the spate of mailers. 
The U.S. Postal Inspection Service, which investigates mail fraud and other crimes, has reviewed at least some of the mailings as well but did not deem them enough of a threat to warrant further scrutiny, an agency spokesperson said Tuesday.
A brief discussion about the mailings brought a Richmond Selectboard meeting Monday night to a boiling point. The board’s chair, Jay Furr, declared at the meeting he would step down from that role after other members criticized the way he sharply rejected a resident’s attempt to speak about the mailings. Furr had said the board was not taking public comment on the issue, though the person tried to speak, regardless.
Another board member, David Sander, said during the meeting he had been “harassed” by members of the public about the recent mailers going around town. 
“Everybody just needs to dial it down. Be civil,” Sander said. “This is not Richmond.”

At issue is a 3-0 decision the board made last month, with one member absent and another abstaining, for the town to display a flag and a sign that say “Black Lives Matter” year-round, rather than only for the three months each year following Juneteenth, as was the town’s practice before, according to Arneson. The town first started displaying a Black Lives Matter sign and flag, Arneson said, in the wake of the May 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.
Arneson said residents have voiced a mix of support and opposition for the board’s decision in recent weeks at public meetings and on the online message board Front Porch Forum. At least some of those people now appear to have been targeted with the misleading mail. 
As of Tuesday, the town was aware of three different mailers that were sent out. Town officials did not yet know who sent them, or whether that person lived in town.

One mailer includes a photograph of protesters surrounding and vandalizing a police car with text overlaid that says, “We are the Richmond Selectboard and we support this message.” Another includes text reading, “We got this Richmond!” over a photo of a masked protester waving a Black Lives Matter flag, with flames in the foreground. 
A third shows an image of a clown saying, “Say ‘Black Lives Matter!’…or else!” It also states in large text that “respect for our selectboard” was “missing” during the board’s Aug. 18 meeting, at which it voted to make the flag and sign display year-round. 
All of the mailers that officials have seen so far listed the town office as a return address. At least one used the phrase “Richmond Police Governance” in the return address, which Arneson said could refer to a joint municipal committee the town has with neighboring Hinesburg that has been discussing the feasibility of both towns sharing policing services.
The mention of “police” was what confused Richmond resident Jean Haskin when she received one of the mailings last week. Haskin said her first thought was that she had somehow been issued a speeding ticket, unknowingly, while driving down a hill through town.

But in fact, she received the mailer depicting a clown and referring to the selectboard’s Aug. 18 meeting. Haskin said that on Aug. 18 she posted on Front Porch Forum saying she was among those against the town putting up the Black Lives Matter signage on public property.
“The town should remain neutral and display only the American and Vermont flags and post information related to town activities,” she wrote in the post, which she shared with VTDigger. She said she was confused to get the mailing because it seemed to come from someone who, like her, opposed displaying the “Black Lives Matter” signage. 
“It’s extremely sad,” she said in an interview. “And in light of what recently happened in the world,” she said, referring to the shooting last week of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, “it’s a little bit scary.”
Furr, of the selectboard, said in an interview that others in town who have received the mailers have voiced support for displaying the flag and sign year-round.
Near the start of Monday’s meeting, Furr made a statement saying, in part, that “these letters are addressed as having come from here when they did not, and they contain, essentially, hate speech depicting Black Lives Matter members as rioters who are setting things on fire and saying this is what the selectboard endorses.”
After he made the statement, town resident Cara LaBounty spoke from the audience to raise a “point of order” that public comment should be allowed.
“We will not be taking public comments on this. You can sue us later,” Furr replied, then adding, “Cara, listen. We know you love attention. You crave it. But right now, we’re going to move on.”
At that point, several people in the room started speaking at the same time, and two other board members raised some opposition to Furr’s comments. Furr then apologized for “snapping” at LaBounty, who had left the room, saying that “there is no excuse whatsoever for having replied that way. And I should have kept my mouth shut.”
The board then continued with its business for the night, but about a half hour later, Furr brought up his exchange with LaBounty again. He told his colleagues that he had decided he could no longer handle the role of facilitating board meetings. 
“I think it would be wise if I resign as chair,” Furr said. He said he would ask his colleagues to appoint a new chair at the start of the board’s next meeting. 
Furr said in an interview Tuesday that he is considering resigning from the board entirely. He had been questioning for some time whether he wanted to continue serving as chair, he said, and the exchange with LaBounty on Monday was a spark that prompted him to leave the role.
He said local politics have always been divisive, but he’s noticed town-level discourse become even more contentious since President Donald Trump took office for a second term in January. He said he had received a small number of calls from residents asking about the mailers, but noted the overall tenor of debate has been overwhelming even on far more mundane topics. 
“Things get very, very tense,” Furr said. “I’m sorry that the climate is like that. I’d like us all to get along and be able to equitably, openly discuss policy — without making all these aspersions.”
Sander, who has served on the board for the past decade, also said during the meeting he had noticed a recent shift in tenor.
“I have people calling me, swearing at me. I’ve been harassed at the transfer station. I’ve been heckled at the market. I’ve been heckled at the post office. I’ve been heckled at the hardware store. I have people honking the horn, flipping the bird, screaming obscenities at me,” he said. 
“If anybody has any issue with anything that I do or this board does, please call me,” he continued. “But damn it — I do not like living in a community that has become this divisive, this nasty, this mean, this partisan. It needs to stop.”

As electric truck and SUV maker Rivian broke ground on its Georgia factory Tuesday, questions swirled about electric vehicle manufacturing in the US in light of Trump administration policies. A report released the same day found that, so far at least, the Southeast is still investing in EVs — though there are some wobbles. 
Georgia has seen a bonanza in new factories making EVs, batteries and parts in recent years. But between the Trump administration’s rollbacks of EV tax credits and the recent immigration raid at a battery plant near Savannah, some analysts have worried the EV boom is headed for a bust.
Some projects have been cancelled or paused, with a few hundred jobs retracted in Georgia, according to the new report from the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. But it’s too soon to pinpoint why, the report’s authors said.
“Is that because of what Congress just did?” said Nick Nigro, a consultant with Atlas Public Policy, which compiled the report. “Or is that just the normal cycle of business?”
As Nigro noted, while much of the new manufacturing has been widely credited to the Biden administration’s policies, particularly the EV and domestic manufacturing incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act, some of the projects predate that law. 
Both the massive Hyundai EV plant near Savannah and the Rivian factory east of Atlanta were announced months before the IRA passed. Republican Governor Brian Kemp has pushed to attract the electric vehicle industry to Georgia, citing the state’s business-friendly climate, and the state has offered incentives to companies building here.
The recent immigration raid at a battery plant being constructed by Hyundai and LG Energy Solution adjacent to the Hyundai factory also sent shockwaves through the industry and raised doubts about the future of foreign manufacturing on US soil. Many of those arrested were skilled South Korean workers on site temporarily to set up equipment and train American hires to take over, according to an attorney representing some of the workers – standard practice when companies set up factories overseas. But again, Nigro and SACE analysts said, it’s too soon to say what the impact of the raid will be.
“I’m sure that whatever’s happening behind the scenes at the State Department and elsewhere is trying to make sure that there’s no long-term issues as a result of what happened in that facility,” Nigro said. 
According to the report, the Southeast still lags behind the rest of the country on EV adoption — but people and businesses in the region are still buying EVs and installing chargers. Georgia falls just behind Florida and the national average for available charging ports per 1,000 customers. But Georgia is devoting less state funding to electric transportation than other states in the region, with only South Carolina spending less, according to the report.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG-5312-1024x768-1.jpg,,,2025-09-16 18:56:38.094907

(Photo by Linh Ta/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Senate Majority Leader Jack Whitver announced Tuesday he is stepping down as from the leadership position and will not seek reelection in 2026.
Whitver, a 45-year-old from Grimes, was first elected to the Iowa Senate in 2011. He took leadership roles as Republicans took control of the chamber, becoming Senate president in 2016 and Senate majority leader in 2018.
In recent years, he has faced health struggles. He was diagnosed with a brain tumor in 2024 following the legislative session, beginning a treatment plan and radiation therapy. While Whitver has shared updates that his treatment has shown positive progress, he said in Tuesday’s announcement, “I still have a long way to go,” and his treatment is ongoing.
Whitver reflected on his time in office, saying he started campaigning “hours after my oldest daughter was born” — on the issues of lowering taxes and making it easier to start a business and family in Iowa. Now, that daughter is old enough to drive, he said, and said the Iowa Legislature has tackled the issues he came into office to address.

“I believe I have accomplished my goals,” Whitver said. “I am proud of the work we have accomplished in limiting government, controlling spending, reducing taxes and expanding the rights and freedoms of the people of this great state.”
Iowa GOP Chair Jeff Kaufmann thanked Whitver for his service in the state Legislature, saying in a statement he was a “tremendous leader for our party and for the people of Iowa.”
“He has helped usher in a new way of governance in Iowa, one that puts taxpayers first and ensures Iowa families come out on top,” Kaufmann said. “Beyond his achievements in politics and policy, Jack is a devoted husband, father, and friend. While his leadership will be missed at the Capitol, I am grateful he will be able to devote more time to his family, and I know his impact on Iowa will continue for years to come.”
Whitver will continue serve as leader until Iowa Senate Republicans — who retain majority control, but lost their supermajority hold on the chamber in recent special elections — meet to select a new leader in the “near future,” according to the Senate GOP’s news release. Whitver’s announcement also means Iowa Senate District 23 will have an open seat in the 2026 election.
“My work in the Senate may be coming to a close, but my commitment to making Iowa the best state in the country will always be a part of my life,” Whitver said.
The legislative leader’s announcement has added to the long list of retirements and shake-ups in Iowa politics heading into 2026. At the Statehouse, Gov. Kim Reynolds has also announced she will not seek another term in 2026, and former Iowa House Majority Leader Matt Windschitl announced he would step down from his leadership role while pursuing a bid for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District. Former Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst also stepped down from her position leading the Democratic House caucus as she is running for Iowa’s 3rd District in 2026.
At the federal level, U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst announced earlier in September she will not run for reelection. Two of Iowa’s U.S. House seats will also be open in 2026 as U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson runs for the now-open Senate seat, and U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra has an “exploratory committee” launched to run for governor.

The bus transportation company claims a strike would negatively affect the school community, while the union president said the company is not bargaining in good faith.

Members of a Vermont school bus worker union working in Windham County are preparing to strike after contract talks with their employer stalled out.
Curtis Clough, president of Teamsters Local 597 union, said members are satisfied with the economic proposals currently on the table, and that the company and union could have agreed and ratified a contract. But the bus transportation company Travel Kuz is not “bargaining in good faith,” and wants to take away a longstanding contract provision ensuring workers can choose not to cross the picket line of fellow workers in other locations, Clough said. 
For its part, a Travel Kuz official wrote in a statement Tuesday that the company agreed to the union’s economic requests, but that the union’s readiness to strike to maintain the right to “support distant labor actions” places the interests of the union above the local school community. 
The dispute is the latest in a set of mounting conflicts between the union and Travel Kuz. The company locked out bus drivers and monitors with Vermont Teamsters Local 597 from the Brattleboro headquarters in August to prevent them from working, prompting the union to picket.

Travel Kuz — affiliated with private equity-backed company Beacon Mobility — brought in replacement workers for the start of the school year at Windham Southeast Supervisory Union, which serves 10 schools in Brattleboro, Dummerston, Guilford, Putney and Vernon. 
The company accused the union workers of unlawful and unsafe picketing after the first day of school, but the union president denied the allegations and local police present did not report unlawful activity. 
The labor dispute subsided when Travel Kuz ended the work stoppage on Sept. 2, and workers returned to the job and contract talks continued. 
But now, the bargaining between Travel Kuz and the union has reached a tipping point yet again.
Scott Sheridan, Travel Kuz’s senior vice president of operations, wrote in the statement that the union’s contract demand and potential strike will “jeopardize the safety” of students and inhibit the company from providing reliable transportation for the Windham Southeast school community.
“Sadly, the Teamsters are still threatening to strike beginning Thursday, not over pay or benefits, but over a demand for contract language that would allow Brattleboro drivers and monitors to walk off the job if any other Teamster unit, anywhere in the country, initiates a strike,” Sheridan wrote. 
Clough said Travel Kuz is engaging in “regressive bargaining” by attempting to remove a workers’ rights provision that the company agreed to in previous negotiations and had been present in the contract for around 15 years. 
Travel Kuz’s proposal would require union members to work as replacement drivers and monitors at other company locations, Clough said. Additionally, the proposal would also ban Teamsters Local 597 members from observing picket lines in Vermont initiated by International Brotherhood of Teamsters workers from other states.
“The company’s proposal would give the company the right to force our drivers through their picket lines at their locations,” Clough said. “Our members have always had the right to observe those picket lines, and what that means is they would have the right to individually decide not to cross those lines.”
Travel Kuz is responsible for hiring certified drivers and ensuring safe conditions for students and the school community if the union strikes, Clough added.
For union members, it was a “non-starter” to remove an existing protection and be prevented from standing in solidarity with other workers, Clough said. The Teamsters Local 597 union has given the company until Wednesday to respond to workers’ concerns before implementing plans to strike, he said. 
Windham Southeast Supervisory Union officials were not immediately available to respond to a request for comment.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A former House staffer was sentenced Tuesday to 30 months in prison and ordered to pay a $25,000 fine for his role in a kickback scheme using the state’s constituent mailer program.
Cade Cothren, who resigned as chief of staff to former Speaker Glen Casada in 2019, will also be required to remain on probation for one year after serving his time in federal prison. Attorneys for Cothren said they would appeal the convictions from a four-week jury trial in April and May.
Casada’s sentencing hearing was postponed until Sept. 23 because of the length of time it took to go through Cothren’s sentencing Tuesday.
U.S. District Court Judge Eli Richardson meted out the punishment after wading through a litany of objections Tuesday by the defense as federal prosecutors sought a stiffer punishment.
Former Tennessee House Speaker Glen Casada, ex-aide, guilty in federal corruption case

Casada and Cothren were convicted of setting up a secret company called Phoenix Solutions that tapped into the state’s postage and printing program that provides House members $3,000 a year for constituent mailers. Casada and former Rep. Robin Smith, who pleaded guilty and testified against the pair, steered lawmakers’ business to Phoenix Solutions, which was secretly run by Cothren with the front name of “Matthew Phoenix.”
Richardson found that the sentencing wouldn’t involve $158,000 the trio made from work for the House Republican Caucus and campaigns for individual lawmakers. The judge, though, determined that Cothren used “intricate” money laundering in an effort to cover up the trio’s scheme.
Testimony in the trial showed that Cothren couldn’t be connected to the company because other lawmakers wouldn’t want to do business with him after he resigned from his legislative post over a racist and sexist texting scandal. 
Casada later resigned from the House speakership when the Republican held a no-confidence vote based on the texting scandal, heavy-handed leadership and power moves such as creation of a “bill kill” list.

(Photo by Grace Deng/Washington State Standard)Washington’s Department of Health stands ready to inspect the state’s only immigrant detention center after a court ruling last month.
State inspectors for years have been pushing for access to the heavily scrutinized, 1,575-bed private facility in Tacoma known as the Northwest ICE Processing Center. But the private operator of the site and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have blocked them.
That could be just weeks away from changing.
“As soon as we are legally allowed to go in there, we will,” said Lauren Jenks, the Department of Health’s assistant secretary for environmental public health, who is among the agency staff who have been turned away trying to inspect the detention center during visits dating back to 2023. 
The state and the detention center’s operator, Florida-based GEO Group, have been battling in court since the passage of a state law that year aimed at providing greater oversight of the controversial facility. 
Among other requirements, the law called for The GEO Group to provide fresh fruits and vegetables, air conditioning and heat, free telecommunication services, weekly mental health evaluations and rooms with windows. 
The law also required the state departments of Health and Labor and Industries to conduct routine, unannounced inspections of the for-profit detention center, which holds immigrant detainees before deportation or release back into the United States.
GEO sued over the 2023 law, claiming the state was overstepping its authority. A federal judge in Seattle ordered an injunction blocking the Department of Health from conducting those inspections and enforcing the law’s heightened standards. 
But last month, a panel of judges from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals tossed that order, paving the way for state health inspectors to get in the detention center. GEO on Tuesday petitioned the court for another hearing on its lawsuit.
Now, officials believe they just need that appeals court ruling to be finalized, then they’ll have the legal underpinning to inspect the detention center. 
Early this month, Jenks and other Department of Health officials returned to the center to try to assess the water quality, but GEO denied them entry. State health officials have been turned away from the facility more than half a dozen times in the past couple years.
“There was nothing that would lead us to believe that their opinion had changed,” Jenks said. “But since we’re not barred from doing it, we decided to go again.”
In this case, officials spoke to two people who said they were from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The immigration agents said they “were not prepared to allow us entry into the facility,” Jenks said, adding that they were receptive to the water quality concerns. 
The Department of Health has received more than 2,400 complaints over an array of issues at the detention center, including about drinking water. 
“That gives us some clues about what might be going on and it might be something that we could help with if we could get in and see,” Jenks said.
If inspectors do gain access, they’ll first have to respond to specific complaints, rather than conducting routine, unannounced inspections. 
Those latter examinations will have to wait until the Department of Health finalizes rules on GEO’s new requirements, which is months away. Whether routine means every year or some other timeframe is something the state will iron out in rulemaking.
The law says failing to comply with new state standards can result in fines of up to $10,000 per violation
Examining the drinking water would be a top priority. Other issues raised in complaints to the agency include access to medication, sanitation and concerns that seem to stem from crowding, like the number of beds being put into some rooms, said Joe Laxson, the policy director for the department’s environmental public health division.
The detention center has a history of allegations of mistreatment, abuse and neglect of detainees. It has faced renewed concerns as more detainees have been sent there with President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.
Labor and Industries inspectors have been allowed in to examine workplace conditions, including in September 2024 when they found no violations. 
The state has been taking in complaints from people held at the center for a couple years with little ability to investigate and verify them.
“I am super frustrated that we know that there’s people who are hurting and we haven’t been able to help problem-solve what’s happening there,” Jenks said. “People in a detention center like this are among the most vulnerable people in Washington, and who’s looking out for them?”

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota’s first state public defender and his staff of four have taken on 43 cases since taking their first this winter.
Lawmakers created and funded the Office of Indigent Legal Services in 2024 to address the ballooning cost of lawyers for people who have a constitutional right to one but can’t afford it. 
The state convened a task force to address that issue in 2023, spurred in part by the doubling of county-paid public defense bills in the space of 10 years.
As of two years ago, South Dakota was one of only two states in the U.S. to collar counties with the full cost of indigent defense. A state-level office, the task force concluded, could begin to relieve some of that pressure.
The resulting Office of Indigent Legal Services doesn’t represent clients at trial — counties still pay area lawyers for that — but instead handles appeals of felony convictions and rulings against parents and guardians in abuse and neglect cases.
Lawmakers put $1.4 million in the office’s budget for the current fiscal year, which began in July. The office was expected to save counties $2.1 million overall and bring a net savings of $600,000 to taxpayers.
Leader hired in 2024
Christopher Miles was hired to head up the office. He’s since welcomed three additional attorneys and a paralegal, and is on the hunt for one more attorney. 
The office took on its first cases in February, when the doors opened for appeals from the Sioux Falls and Rapid City areas. In July, it began to take appeals from the rest of the state. 
Q&A: Meet South Dakota’s first state public defender

The state office’s team is now working on appeals from Roberts, Hughes and Lawrence counties, on top of its caseload from the metro areas.
Miles and the other three lawyers each have about 10 cases to handle. Thirteen of them involve abuse and neglect. The rest involve felony convictions. 
“We’re probably picking up a case every week,” Miles said.
The team has an office in Sioux Falls and one team member in Rapid City. 
The only appellate court in South Dakota’s court system is the state Supreme Court. None of the appeals handled by the office have reached the Supreme Court for oral arguments, and the high court has yet to rule for or against the state’s public defenders in cases where they presented arguments on a client’s behalf.
Three cases have been resolved. Two defendants dropped their appeals after consultations with the public defense office. In the third case, the office found no appealable issues and told the state’s high court as much, but the client exercised their right to file their own appeal statement. The Supreme Court dismissed the client’s case by summary judgment, a short statement that doesn’t address specific legal issues.
“We don’t have any wins yet, but we don’t have a lot of cases that have made it through to the point where we’d be expecting an opinion, either,” Miles said.
Scope of work
An appeal doesn’t involve new evidence or new witnesses.
An exciting turning point for the defense of people who can’t afford lawyers

Rather, it involves scouring the existing trial court record to find some error, such as ineffective assistance from a trial court lawyer, erroneous rulings from a judge or a sentence that falls into the unconstitutional category of cruel and unusual. 
If there’s an issue for his office to address, Miles said, it’s got to be present within the four corners of the case record, which would include transcripts from hearings or a trial. A win at the state Supreme Court could reopen parts of a case.
Inmates will contact the office at times with hopes of adding new evidence, Miles said, but “we do our best to explain what the restrictions are.”
Future goals
Minnehaha County Public Defender Traci Smith has been pleased so far. 
Miles was once part of Smith’s staff of 45 lawyers, paralegals and others, and appeals were his only job.
“Now, we don’t have to have an attorney assigned to appeals,” Smith said.
Smith was a task force member, and manages one of three county-level public defenders’ offices in the state. Her hope is that the state office serves as a stepping stone to address other issues surrounding indigent defense in South Dakota, as outlined in a report on the issue from the Sixth Amendment Center.
Among those challenges were a dearth of experienced criminal defense attorneys in rural areas, and funding for high-profile cases in low-budget counties.
“There are a lot of priorities, but the real progress will come by focusing on a few key goals at a time and building momentum step by step,” Smith said.

The 4-3 decision issued Tuesday means the state’s highest court will not review the Georgia Court of Appeals’ December ruling that disqualified Willis from prosecuting the case involving Trump and his remaining co-defendants due to a “significant appearance of impropriety,” which stemmed from a romantic relationship she had with a special prosecutor she hired, Nathan Wade. 
That decision had tossed aside the trial court’s ruling last spring that there was no “actual conflict of interest” on Willis’ part, but had noted a “financial cloud of impropriety and potential untruthfulness” related to the testimony of certain witnesses. That ruling had allowed Willis to stay on the case after Wade resigned. 
A Fulton County grand jury indicted Trump and 18 of his allies in August 2023, charging them with illegally conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results after Trump narrowly lost in Georgia. It’s now the last criminal case against Trump still pending. 
Justice Andrew Pinson, who wrote the concurring opinion, said Willis’ appeal was too narrowly focused for the Georgia Supreme Court. 
“Even if one believes that the Court of Appeals erred in reaching that decision, granting review to answer that question would be mere error correction, and this Court generally does not exercise our certiorari jurisdiction merely to correct errors that do not have some broader impact on Georgia law,” Pinson wrote in the concurring opinion.

Justices Sarah Hawkins Warren, Charlie Bethel and Shawn Ellen LaGrua joined Pinson in the concurring opinion. Justices John Ellington, Carla Wong McMillian and Verda Colvin dissented.
Willis said in a statement she respects the court’s decision and the legal process, despite disagreeing with the outcome, and will work to ensure the prosecutor assigned to the case has access to the case material.
“My office will make the case file and evidence available to the Prosecuting Attorneys Council for use in the ongoing litigation. I hope that whoever is assigned to handle the case will have the courage to do what the evidence and the law demand,” Willis said.
Peter J. Skandalakis, executive director of the nonpartisan Prosecuting Attorneys’ Council of Georgia, said in a statement that while the council will be notified of the Supreme Court’s decision once the case is remitted back to the Fulton County Superior Court, the search for a new prosecutor started immediately.
“PAC will fulfill its duty … to appoint another prosecutor to take over the cases. When that decision is made, it will be announced at the appropriate time. Until then, any action on PAC’s part is premature, and we have no further comments,” Skandalakis said in a statement.
Trump’s return to the White House also adds another complication to the case, with legal experts skeptical that a trial could be held while he is in office. But the case could still proceed in the meantime against the other defendants, like Trump’s former personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and ex-Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. 
Pinson wrote that the court’s review is reserved for cases of “gravity or great public importance” and is not for “mere error correction.” He argued that whether a prosecutor can be disqualified based “solely upon an appearance of impropriety” was not directly addressed in the appeal, as Willis had not cross-appealed the trial court’s finding of an appearance of impropriety. The Court of Appeals’ decision was a narrow ruling about the specific solution — Willis’ disqualification — to the admitted problem of impropriety in this case, Pinson wrote, rather than a broad legal issue requiring the Georgia Supreme Court’s opinion.
“Rather than deciding any broader question about whether an appearance of impropriety can serve as an independent ground for disqualification of public prosecutors, the Court of Appeals’ decision appears to have resolved a narrow, case-specific dispute about the trial court’s choice of disqualification remedy,” Pinson wrote.
In a dissenting opinion, McMillian argued that the court should have agreed to review the case. She wrote that the issue of whether an attorney can be disqualified based on the appearance of impropriety alone affects every active lawyer in Georgia. McMillian pointed out that the Court of Appeals’ decisions on this point are in conflict and that Georgia Supreme Court precedent, which the Court of Appeals’ ruling relied upon, warrants reconsideration.
McMillian also raised concerns that a new state law creates a financial incentive for defendants to seek the disqualification of prosecutors, and that the “amorphous” appearance-of-impropriety standard is easy to meet.
Lawmakers passed a measure during the 2025 legislative session that allows criminal defendants to recoup their legal costs if the prosecuting attorney in their case is disqualified for personal or professional misconduct. The proposal’s main sponsor said the bill was inspired by Trump’s case in Fulton County. 
“This case requires the resolution of a novel issue of gravity about which the state of the law is confused and conflicted —  both in Georgia and across the country — and thus warrants consideration (or reconsideration) by this Court. Moreover, the issue affects the bench and bar across the board and will likely recur such that guidance from this Court is desirable,” McMillian wrote.
Josh McKoon, chair of the Georgia Republican Party, celebrated in a statement, saying that Willis “wasted millions of tax dollars harassing patriotic and law abiding Americans, embarrassing herself and our state, and overwhelming our system of justice with the stench of her mendacity” and called for the United States Attorney, the Attorney General of Georgia and the State Bar of Georgia to open investigation on her conduct.
“But now it is time for a reckoning. She must be held accountable for her actions … This can never be allowed to happen again in our State,” McKoon said.
Attorney General Chris Carr called the Georgia Supreme Court’s decision “the correct one,” saying Willis was disqualified due to a “self-inflicted mistake,” but he did not call for further investigation. He concluded his statement by stating that “‘lawfare’ of any kind cannot stand.”
“When prosecutors use their office to advance a political agenda, the system as a whole suffers,” Carr wrote in an online post.
Trump’s lead attorney Steve Sadow also said in a social media post that the Georgia Supreme Court “correctly denied” reviewing the lower court’s decision.
“Willis’ misconduct during the investigation and prosecution of President Trump was egregious and she deserved nothing less than disqualification. This proper decision should bring an end to the wrongful political, lawfare persecutions of the President,” Sadow wrote.
But Charlie Bailey, chair of the Democratic Party of Georgia, said in a statement that people “deserve full accountability for the election deniers who tried to subvert their votes and silence their voices,” saying that out of the 19 people indicted, four have already pleaded guilty.
“The prosecution of this case must continue so that it can be decided the way all criminal cases must be — according to the evidence and the law,” Bailey said in a statement.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DSC0242_1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-16 18:56:38.094907

In a new motion for summary judgment, the U.S. Department of Justice insists Vermont cannot make polluters pay for harm caused by greenhouse gas emissions.

The U.S. Justice Department asked a judge Monday to rule in its favor in an ongoing lawsuit over Vermont’s law that requires polluters to pay for their carbon emissions, called the Climate Superfund Act.
Attorneys from the department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division filed a motion for summary judgment on the lawsuit  it first brought in May in U.S. District Court in Burlington. 
In August, the state and a pair of intervening nonprofits, the Conservation Law Foundation and the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont, asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit. 
“The Court should deny the motions to dismiss, grant the United States’ motion for summary judgment, declare the Superfund Act unconstitutional and unenforceable, and permanently enjoin Defendants from taking any actions to implement or enforce it,” Riley Walters, counsel to an acting assistant attorney general, wrote in the motion. 
Vermont’s Attorney General’s Office told VTDigger that it was reviewing the filings and would respond by Nov. 17. 
“We disagree with the President’s assessment of the case, as Vermont’s climate superfund law complies with federal law and the Constitution,” Attorney General Charity Clark’s office said in an emailed statement. “We look forward to defending Vermont in Court.”
The Climate Superfund Act is a first-of-its-kind legislation that asks oil and gas corporations like British Petroleum, Chevron and Exxon Mobil, none of which have refineries or operations in the state, to pay for their greenhouse gas emissions between 1995 and 2024. Those emissions warmed the atmosphere and increased the frequency and severity of weather events like heat waves and floods. Such floods inundated Vermont in 2023 and 2024, and again in July 2025.
The Justice Department’s lawsuit called the climate action “unconstitutional.” Another lawsuit also targeted New York, which passed the nation’s second climate superfund law in December, and the Justice Department preemptively filed suit against Hawaii and Michigan to prevent those states from passing such laws. The lawsuits came after an executive order seeking to protect U.S. fossil energy companies from what President Donald Trump called state overreach. 
“Vermont clearly has the right to raise funds and protect the well-being of its people,” said Grace Oedel, executive director of the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont. “NOFA-VT remains committed to defending this law, which will fund key adaptations for our agricultural state as we face the climate crisis. We know what’s behind the worsening extreme weather affecting our farmers, and it’s fair for fossil fuel companies to bear some of the cost of climate adaptation in Vermont.”
The Justice Department stated in a press release on Tuesday that “Vermont is defying federal law… so it can punish disfavored businesses for ill-defined harms, without regard to the real harm to our federal system and the Nation’s energy needs.” 
But research, called attribution science, increasingly shows the links between specific fossil fuel emitters and specific extreme weather events and the specific damages from that event. A new study published in the scientific journal Nature last week shows that climate change made more than 200 heat waves between 2000 and 2023 more likely and more intense, and that the emissions of 180 fossil fuel and cement producers substantially contributed to those heat waves.
Monday’s  motion marks another swipe from the Trump administration at Vermont’s climate programs, following the loss of more than $62 million in federal solar funding the administration cut in August. The administration has also recently cut climate research funding, eliminated scientific studies from federal websites and rolled back federal support for the buildout of renewable energy and the sales of electric vehicles.
The motion argues that “the U.S. constitution and a century of precedent require that federal law govern interstate and global air pollution.” But the White House recently stopped following accepted climate science and public health protections that called for monitoring such pollution.
In July, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rescinding the 2009 “endangerment finding,” which shows greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and should therefore be regulated under the Clean Air Act. Then on Friday, the White House proposed ending a requirement for industrial facilities like power plants and petrochemical companies to report their emissions under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-16 22:15:31+00:00,Mississippi Today,‘Currently insolvent’: JXN Water again raises alarm over financial crisis,Alex Rozier,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/16/currently-insolvent-jxn-water-again-raises-alarm-over-financial-crisis/,"Jackson's third-party water and sewer utility says the system ""iis barreling toward insolvency.""","The capital city’s third-party water and sewer utility is again raising alarms over its inability to fund operations. JXN Water, in a Monday court filing, said it will continue to be “insolvent” without a rate increase or another large influx of money. 
“The System is barreling toward insolvency, meaning it won’t be able to deliver water andsewer services to citizens because system operations shut down due to the lack of sufficientfunds,” the utility wrote.
JXN Water, the utility said, is losing $3 million a month. Many of its positions, such as plant operators and repair crews, are contracted out. The utility said it owes $31 million to those contractors after months of not being able to make payments. The $150 million the federal government set aside for operating expenses ran dry by May, the filing says.
Ted Henifin, the court-appointed head of JXN Water, pleaded with U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate in recent hearings to approve a 12% rate increase he first proposed in April. Wingate, though, insisted on exhausting all other funding options before raising rates in a city with a lower median income and higher poverty rate than surrounding areas.

“My team has repeatedly warned the parties and Court of the critical state of the system’s finances, which have reached a daunting level,” Henifin wrote in the report. 
Both the Jackson City Council and recently elected Mayor John Horhn have come out against the proposed increase. Only Wingate’s approval, though, is necessary for the rate hike to move forward. City officials have called on the utility to improve collection rates, which are about 70%, before increasing rates. Even with 100% bill collections, though, Henifin maintains JXN Water would still operate at a deficit. 
Wingate initially delayed ruling on the rate increase to track down the city’s spending from its settlement with Siemens over faulty water meters. The judge issued subpoenas in July to 18 different parties related to the city and the settlement, but it’s unclear how many have been fulfilled.
Wingate also prioritized chasing large debts from apartment complexes. Last week, WLBT reported, JXN Water arrived at a payment plan with Tracewood Apartments to resolve $910,000 in overdue bills. The judge is also overseeing an ongoing lawsuit between the utility and Blossom Apartments, which JXN Water says owes $400,000 in debt.

Aisha Carson, JXN Water’s communications officer, told Mississippi Today the utility hasn’t heard any updates from Wingate as far as addressing the rate proposal.
Carson said as of now, day-to-day services haven’t changed. Without giving a timeline, though, she added JXN Water could have to scale back certain operations at some point. 
“That doesn’t include our large capital projects, but it will include things like field crews, our ability to respond to water leaks or sewer leaks that come up,” Carson said.
On top of reduced services, the utility also warned of impacts to Jackson’s finances. Part of the revenue JXN Water says it needs is to pay off the water system’s debt, of which it owes $5 million by Dec. 1. If it’s unable to tackle the debt, “sales tax revenues collected by the City will be intercepted and used for debt service beginning November 2025 and continue until debt service is paid,” Monday’s report said. Such diversions could reduce Jackson’s revenue by $7.5 million per year, it added.

The report, which JXN Water filed as a supplement to it’s required financial management plan, listed options for temporary relief, such as converting itself to a public water authority so that it can issue tax-exempt bonds — something the state Legislature paved the way for last session — and securing an “Emergency Drinking Water Loan” from the state Health Department. The former, Carson said, would require approval “from Wingate and/or the Legislature.” 
The utility also raised the potential of privatization or a public-private partnership, saying it “understands the City may be interested” in either option. 
“(JXN Water) wants to be on written record that the financial crisis has gotten to the point where if the City proposes privatization, we believe it needs to be seriously considered,” the report said. 
The report also called on the city to, if possible, issue bonds to support the water system directly or help pay off debt. 
Mississippi Today reached out to city officials for comment on Tuesday morning and will update this post if the city responds. 
Wingate: Customers still not receiving bills
On Tuesday afternoon, Wingate ordered JXN Water to establish a self-reporting method for customers who don’t receive bills. 
“Despite prior remedial efforts, the Court has received credible information that a substantial number of customers continue to receive no monthly bill, leaving revenues uncollected and accountability diminished,” the judge wrote. 
Wingate went on to write, “to this day a significant percentage of accounts in Jackson are either unmetered, inaccurately metered, or not billed altogether.” Henifin, though, has recently said almost all customers have new meters the utility and city have installed in recent years. While the utility says there are over 11,000 accounts with meters but don’t pay bills, it’s unclear how many people aren’t receiving bills altogether. 
“These failures have carried real consequences,” Wingate added. “They erode public trust. They place disproportionate burdens on those customers who do receive bills, often inflated, while their neighbors may receive none.”
The order requires JXN Water to set up ways for customers to reach out online, by telephone, or in person to tell the utility if they haven’t received a bill for at least 60 days. It also authorizes JXN Water to offer customers amnesty from late penalties if a customer reports unbilled usage before Dec. 31.  
Wingate set a hearing for Sept. 19 for the utility and city to give their progress on locating unbilled customers.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/06145106/JXN-flood-2022-DOYLE-65-scaled.jpg,,,2025-09-16 18:56:38.094907

Last year, Christina Sivret was invited to speak at a national conference by the Campaign Legal Center in Washington, DC., a nonpartisan government watchdog. Director of the State Ethics Commission since 2021, Sivret said she was proud to represent Vermont as a beacon among states where ethics is at the forefront.
This year she was asked to participate again by the same organization for the opposite reason, because of recent rollbacks to ethics reforms in Vermont and elsewhere across the country, she said, but decided not to attend.
The Vermont State Ethics Commission was established by the Legislature in 2018 as an independent, non-partisan agency to promote standards of ethical conduct in state government. A 2024 law gave it more purview over ethical standards for local governments, but the commission stopped offering services to municipalities in May, according to an announcement on the website, “due to lack of staffing.” It is continuing to accept complaints related to state government.
For three and a half years, the office has had one part-time administrative assistant and one part-time executive director. “During that time, our workload has tripled with no corresponding increase in resources. For this reason, continuing to provide the same level of service has become an impossibility,” the announcement reads.
The stall comes just months after the commission began to issue guidance to municipal officials on handling local ethics complaints. The 2024 law that created a municipal code of ethics made the requirements effective this year, which led to a flood of queries and complaints since January, Sivri said. 
Now municipalities in Vermont have nowhere to turn for ethics violations and complaints but can continue to access online training.
“It signals a lack of support for ethics accountability in the state,” said Sivret. “We’re talking about a state that’s already very far behind when it comes to an actual ethics accountability framework. I’m talking decades behind most other states that started working on this after Watergate.”
That’s a problem, according to William Stuono, a planning commission member in Charlotte who has previously advocated for the commission to have more funding and power.
“The biggest problem with lack of funding of the Ethics Commission is that it now leaves investigation entirely up to the communities themselves, and has no ‘independent’ way to review complaints,” he wrote in an email. “This creates a ‘fox guarding the henhouse’ scenario, and therefore trust in the process of filing complaints is entirely eliminated.”
Sivret said the commission has been understaffed since Gov. Phil Scott signed Vermont’s first-ever statewide code of ethics for public officials in 2022. Other states with comparable responsibilities have multiple full-time staff members, she said, such as Rhode Island, which has 12 staffers listed online, including multiple attorneys.
“We have repeatedly and aggressively advocated for additional staffing from the Legislature during the past two legislative sessions,” said Sivret, who is a lawyer.
For fiscal year 2026, Sivret once again requested funding for two additional staff members -– a
legal counsel to primarily provide state government services, and a staff attorney to primarily provide advice and training to municipal officials. 
“These positions are necessary so that the Ethics Commission can meet the increasing demand for its services associated with the passage of the State Code of Ethics in 2022, and Act 171 in 2024,” she wrote in a March 13 letter to the Vermont Senate Committee on Appropriations.
The letter outlined the commission being “severely under-resourced” while the need for its statutory responsibilities and services statewide continues to grow, not unlike the situation faced by the Human Rights Commission last year.
From January through early May, the commission received 55 written complaints and 61 complaint inquiries, compared to 23 written complaints and 47 inquiries for all of 2024, according to Sivret. The majority this year came from municipalities.
Last year the state passed an ethics bill in an effort to create uniform ethical standards in local government. Advocates pointed out then that Vermont ranks poorly nationwide for the strength of its government ethics laws and is last among its New England neighbors. 
The bill expanded the commission’s reach by allowing it to investigate complaints but without any enforcement powers beyond issuing warnings and recommendations. It also required municipalities to enact their own ethics procedures to field local complaints. 
All in all, it was “a ‘baby step’ to address the well-documented ethical issues in Vermont,” said Stuono.
“Since then the legislature enacted a new bill to exempt the legislature itself from investigation by the Ethics Commission. They also have refused to fund the Ethics Commission, which is understaffed and overwhelmed with complaints,” he wrote in an email.
The path to ethics reform in Vermont has been murky and riddled with delays, according to advocates for reform. After years of discussion and a F grade from the Center for Public Integrity on ethics enforcement, Vermont was one of the last states to establish an ethics commission in 2017. Set up as a five-member commission with a part-time executive director to handle complaints related to the ethical conduct of public officials, it had no powers to investigate or levy punishment.
Paul Burns, executive director of the Vermont Public Interest Research Group, said on Tuesday that he doesn’t think the commission was designed to succeed.
“It’s like a plane on the tarmac,” he said. “It looks good but without any investigatory powers it lacks engines. And without any enforcement authority, it lacks landing gear. And so it might look like a plane that could get you someplace but this plane is never going to get off the ground.”
After pushing for ethics reform in Vermont for years, Burns was disillusioned about the way it played out. The commission was “worthless,” he said in 2020, providing lawmakers “a fig leaf of protection.” 
In 2019, the year after it was established, the commission decided to withdraw its own “advisory opinion” critical of Gov. Phil Scott. The commission’s first executive director, Brian Levin, quit because he believed the commission had gone too far and exceeded its authority in issuing that opinion. 
Notwithstanding the bumpy start, many in the state continue to advocate for the need to bolster the commission and its work. Some, like Sen. Tanya Vyhovsky, P/D-Chittenden Central, fear that political will and money needed for a high-functioning state ethics commission is not likely to materialize in a year that could see a budget deficit.
“It’s incredibly problematic that we’re not prioritizing funding to our ethics commission,” said Vyhovsky. “That’s not because I think there’s a widespread problem with ethical violations but I think that the transparency and support of a robust ethics commission helps to build trust in government.”
The rollbacks are not a good look for Vermont, said Sivret.
“We’re heading down a very negative path that’s following a very negative national trend at a time when, I would be comfortable saying, the vast majority of Vermonters do not want to see this,” she said.

Helene roared through western North Carolina after the first absentee ballots were in the mail and three weeks before the start of early voting last year. Despite washed out roads, voter turnout in western North Carolina exceeded the state average. 
Brinson Bell told a subcommittee of the Committee on House Administration that preparation and close work with North Carolina Emergency Management and FEMA were key to moving obstacles out of the way of voters. The subcommittee hearing was on running elections in the face of natural disasters. 
State Board of Elections member Stacy “Four’”Eggers IV, a Watauga County resident, and Florida Secretary of State Cord Byrd also testified.  
Given the FEMA funding cuts, Brinson Bell said she was not sure that the federal agency today would be able to supply the seven tents and security needed for polling sites last year. 
Helene and previous disasters show the critical need for strong communication with federal, state and local partners and steady, reliable funding and advanced preparation, she said. 
“Elections administrators are certainly concerned about the reduced support that we’re receiving from the federal agencies, particularly CISA (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency),” she said. “That was a critical partnership in helping us to build out what was really a six-year plan in how we were ready for Helene.”
Under Trump, CISA is doing less cybersecurity work for elections.

Brinson Bell was ousted from her job as state elections director when Republicans took control of the state Board of Elections in May. 
Eggers, a Republican, said he was proud of the bipartisanship the state Board and county boards displayed in their disaster responses. 
Among other allowances, the Board of Elections made it easier for residents of disaster counties to vote by mail. 
“Any last minute changes to the settled rules and deadlines for an election should have bipartisan support,” he said. 
Republican Rep. Greg Murphy (NC-03) praised the election officials for their work in the immediate aftermath of Helene, but he also signaled additional relief should not be taken for granted.
“[What] I hear constantly now is the cry of the federal government is not paying enough. We’re hurtling towards a financial sovereign debt crisis and it’s time actually for states to stop screaming for the federal government to pay, and now states take a little bit more burden,” Murphy said.
Murphy suggested North Carolina’s rainy day fund should be used to supplement the state’s needs.
“If there are discrepancies as we move forward, it’s time for the state to step up. We can’t default, we can’t bankrupt the country because we have things that need to be funded when states can do these also.”

Jim Pillen this week directed about $20 million in unused property tax relief funds and higher-than-expected casino revenues to instead be distributed to taxpayers.
Pillen, in an executive order Monday, said the state had more casino gambling revenue and unused money in two property tax relief funds than lawmakers had anticipated when they passed the state’s latest two-year budget in May. 
Pillen ordered Nebraska Property Tax Administrator Sarah Scott to distribute the full increased amounts as she allocates tax credits in the coming months.
“Whenever possible, we must get bureaucracy out of the way and ensure that Nebraskans receive the full amount of property tax relief possible,” Pillen said in a Tuesday statement announcing the order. “This is a common-sense, good government measure that will help Nebraska families across the state.”
The combined result means an additional $77 million state investment in tax credits to offset local property taxes compared to last year, according to the state budget.

The executive order states that “recent events, increasing revenues, appropriation limitations and transfer timing” meant certain funds had been retained and were not being disbursed in the manner that would “produce the maximum property tax relief” for taxpayers.
Before the additional $20 million, the legislatively allocated total in the Property Tax Credit Cash Fund, with credits allocated to counties as a portion of statewide valuations, was $422 million. Total state funding in the School District Property Tax Credit Fund, which distributes credits to counties based on the prior year’s amount of local school taxes, was $780 million.
Pillen’s office did not specify how the $20 million would be divided between the two tax credit funds.
Lawmakers have sought to use the school district tax credits to supercharge property tax relief efforts, but with the state facing budgetary constraints and stiff opposition to expanding the number of items subject to sales taxes to increase property tax credits, multiple legislative and Pillen-backed efforts have failed to secure long-term, structural changes. That includes the 2024 summer special session focused on property taxes.
Property taxes levied statewide last year did decrease by $6 million out of a $5.3 billion total. It was the first time the state saw a decrease in total property taxes paid in 26 years, a feat largely the result of the state moving community colleges from property tax rolls onto state income and sales tax rolls.
However, property taxes levied statewide increased by about $300 million a year in 2022 and 2023, the largest bumps in state history.
While Pillen and lawmakers have placed some restrictions on how fast schools, cities and counties can increase property tax rates, the governor himself has acknowledged that property taxes are likely to increase next year as he and a supermajority of lawmakers struggle to see eye-to-eye on a path forward.
This spring, lawmakers approved a new statewide commission to examine school financing, with commissioners hoping to produce the first set of recommendations by December. The mostly Pillen-appointed commission next meets on Monday.
Pillen on Tuesday blamed “ideological beliefs and special interest groups” as the reason the Legislature had “unfortunately failed to deliver true and meaningful property tax relief.”
As a response, voters could face citizen-led ballot measures on the 2026 ballot seeking to eliminate property taxes or halve the amount of property valuations that could be used in calculating property tax bills.
“The state should never sit on funds that can be distributed to taxpayers,” Pillen said Tuesday. “We will continue to put all our efforts into getting the crippling property tax crisis fixed for Nebraskans.”

By Brent Burdge – Contributing Journalist
Dover, DE – In a significant move to uphold the rights of readers and safeguard free expression, Delaware Governor Matt Meyer signed House Bill 119, also known as the “Freedom to Read Act,” into law on Monday morning.
The legislation, which has garnered support from various organizations, including the Delaware Library Association and the Friends of Delaware Libraries, aims to protect access to diverse reading materials in public libraries and schools across the state. The bill is seen as a timely and practical measure to resist censorship and ensure that libraries remain places of free expression. However, there are cautionary concerns about access to inappropriate, even obscene, materials.
Key Provisions of HB119 & the Freedom to Read Act
House Bill 119 provides a clear, actionable framework for public and school libraries to develop and implement collection development policies that are consistent across the state. It affirms that library materials should not be excluded or removed based solely on the creator’s background or because of political, religious, or ideological objections. The bill also establishes uniform review procedures and limits who may submit objections to those served by the library, ensuring a fair and locally grounded process for addressing concerns.
Importantly, the legislation protects public and school library workers from retaliation for doing their jobs in accordance with state policy. These protections are essential to maintaining the professional integrity of library services and ensuring that decisions about materials are made responsibly and without undue pressure.
Intellectual Freedom and Protecting Children From Obscenity at the Library
The bill received backing from various organizations, emphasizing the importance of intellectual freedom and the right to read. It passed the House with largely partisan votes of 27-10 and the Senate with 14-6 before being signed by the Governor. The bill was sponsored by several Democratic representatives, including Rep. Krista Griffith and Rep. Debra Heffernan.
Some opposing lawmakers expressed concerns that the bill might not be the right way to ensure access to information. Representative Tim Dukes (R), who represents Delaware’s 40th House District, argued that the bill takes control of what’s on the shelves away from local libraries. Dukes emphasized the need for local control in the review process and expressed concerns about the potential for external influences. He stated, “It really undermines local libraries and the community from the review process. I don’t want somebody in another county making decisions for you. I think it should be done with local control.” Per Nandi Gamble, Delaware Family Policy Council Legislative Analyst, ” HB 119 had the potential to allow minors access to obscene material, since the limitations on removing content could act as a safeguard even for obscene material.” An amendment submitted by Rep. Tim Dukes, HA 8, very specifically points out that there was a conflict within DelCode, specifically in Title 11 where it ‘criminalizes the distribution of obscene materials to minors.’ A major part of this amendment clarifies that nothing in HB 119 will override or negate the provisions of that clause in Title 11 that prevent distribution of obscene materials to minors. Meaning that material that is found to meet the criteria of obscene does not have the same prohibition for removal placed upon it, addressing one of the key concerns of opponents to the original bill.
Bonnie Elliott, the director of the Frankford Public Library, shared her perspective on the issue, stating, “Do I agree with every book that comes in here? No. But do I want people to have their choices? Yes. All libraries in the country allow people from different backgrounds to come together and have a conversation. Your mind opens up to possibilities, and without those possibilities, you become a narrow-minded person.” Elliott also noted that while the Frankford Public Library has not personally had to remove any books, they have had people challenge books on their shelves.
Community Voices: Parents and local inappropriate content
Parents and community members have also voiced their opinions on the new law. Sarah Johnson, a parent from Dover, expressed her concerns, saying, “As a parent, I want to have a say in what my children are exposed to. This law takes away our ability to protect our kids from inappropriate content.” Another community member, Mark Thompson, added, “While I understand the need for diverse materials, I believe there should be more local control over what is available in our libraries. We know our community best.”
Implications for Delaware Libraries
Under the new law, libraries are required to adopt written policies ensuring that books and other materials cannot be removed solely due to partisan, ideological, or religious objections. Public and school libraries must establish clear review processes for objections, but materials under review will remain available until a final decision is made. The legislation also sets statewide standards for how public and school libraries manage challenges to literature on their shelves.
The Freedom to Read Act reflects a broader commitment to resist censorship and uphold the values of diversity and inclusion in educational resources. By establishing clear guidelines, it seeks to empower libraries to serve their communities without undue pressure from external influences.
Ensuring libraries promote transparency and fairness and maintain community standards.
The signing of HB119 marks a significant step in safeguarding the rights of readers and ensuring that libraries remain places of free expression. The legislation aims to create a consistent framework for how libraries handle challenges to materials, thereby promoting transparency and fairness in the review process.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/b48a3831-5249-470c-81e3-03f8fc3039f8.png,,,2025-09-16 17:56:43.749685

The actions all appear to have been prompted by mass reporting of the employees to their employers and mirror efforts happening across the country in the aftermath of Kirk’s fatal shooting last week during a speaking event at a Utah university.
The motive of Kirk’s alleged shooter is still unknown, though politicians and political pundits on both sides have been quick to assign blame. Groups on the political right are calling on businesses to terminate employees for “celebrating” Kirk’s death.
President Donald Trump has vowed to go after “agitators” on the political left, and Vice President J.D. Vance has said the administration will go after “left wing lunatics” that foment a culture of hatred.
Local teachers targeted
Clark County School District Superintendent Jhone Ebert on Monday released a statement noting that the district has received “thousands of emails, social media posts, and direct messages” related to Kirk’s death.
Ebert announced that “to protect all staff and students, CCSD teachers whose posts regarding the death of Mr. Kirk have caused substantial disruption to the District and raised concerns about safety are currently not assigned to classrooms.”
The superintendent also shared a message sent to all district employees earlier stating that the district has the authority to prohibit or restrict free speech rights of public employees under certain circumstances, including if the speech “materially and substantially interferes with school activities,” “does or is likely to create substantial interference to the educational mission and/or operation of the school;” or “is used to engage in harassment, discrimination, bullying, cyber-bullying, or intimidation of another person.”
Ebert’s statement concluded: “Because this is a personnel concern, the District has no additional comment on this matter.”
The Nevada Current asked the district how many teachers had been removed from their classrooms over Kirk-related posts. CCSD responded that it had no further statement.
Clark County Education Association, which represents the district’s teachers and other licensed professionals, said in a brief statement that the “situation is live and pending.”
“CCEA has no comment on this matter until our investigation is complete,”said CCEA Executive Director John Vellardita.
Moms for Liberty Clark County days earlier publicly called for four CCSD teachers to be fired. The Nevada Current is not naming the teachers who are not public figures.
One of the teachers on his private Facebook page posted that he could not think of many people “more deserving” of a gunshot wound to the neck.
The second teacher, also on his private Facebook page, posted he had “watched the video over and over like 50 times by now,” that he loved “every fraction of a second of it” and that “it gets better with every watch.”
Republican state Sen. Lori Rogich, whose husband is the namesake of the school where that teacher works, released a statement saying “glorifying a political assasination is never acceptable.” She did not identify the individual but said she supports his removal.
The third teacher left a Facebook comment saying he was “not celebrating” Kirk’s death but that he “won’t feel sorry for the guy either.
“I feel bad for his kids that their dad was murdered for being a piece of trash human,” that teacher wrote.
The final teacher targeted by the Moms for Liberty group left a comment reading “you reap what you sow” on a post asking people to pray for Kirk.
Clark County School Board Trustee Lydia Dominguez, who until taking office was a member of Moms for Liberty Clark County, said in a social media post that anyone mocking Kirk’s murder “should never be trusted with children.”
She added, “I understand the process is painfully slow, but the district has begun it, and it must be done by the book so no lawyer can twist the outcome, because the last thing our students need is a lawsuit draining money from their classrooms.”
The Current found additional public calls for ousting teachers at Washoe County School District, which as of Tuesday morning had limited comments on its social media, and at least one state-authorized charter school. WCSD did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo last week, when asked about reports that public employees were celebrating Kirk’s death, said agencies who determine their employees acted inappropriately should remove those employees as soon as possible.
Realtor, radio producer fired
Meanwhile, in the private sector, Las Vegas realtor Mark Sivek was fired from Realty ONE Group Las Vegas, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal. Sivek was set to lead the Las Vegas REALTORS board of directors but has been removed from the position.
According to screenshots circulating on social media, Sivek called Kirk “an evil POS” and said “no thoughts no prayers for this POS.”
Sivek also posted that Kirk’s “harmful ideologies have been silenced.” That post continued, “While violence is never an acceptable solution, it’s essential to acknowledge the damage caused by his racist and discriminatory beliefs. Kirk used religion to justify his prejudices, promoting Christian Nationalism, which is a thinly veiled form of white supremacy. This ideology has no connection to the values of compassion and empathy that are central to Christ’s teachings.”
Lotus Communications, parent company of Fox Sports Radio, last week announced they had terminated local radio producer Bobby Machado for a social media post about Kirk.
One of his since-deleted posts, according to screenshots circulating online, read: “i’m just gonna say one more thing about charlie kirk… good f—— riddance…i’ve watched his show…way too much…he’s a piece of human s— and i glad as f— the world is without him…f— him all the way to hell…goodnight.”
Trattoria Reggiano, a restaurant in Downtown Summerlin, and Bonanno’s New York Pizza Kitchen posted identical statements on their social media pages stating one of their employees was “no longer with the company, effective immediately” because of comments made on social media.
The Current is not naming the worker, who is not a public figure.
According to a TikTok video being shared by those calling for her firing, the worker said that when she watches the video of Kirk, she isn’t thinking of him.
“I don’t think of him. I think of the little children in school who had to deal with that, watching that happen to their friends, or watching it happen to themselves. … Children who are not even old enough to form an opinion about any of this stuff. And he lobbied for guns to stay in circulation and said they were necessary deaths. Just like car accidents.”
The post was evidently referring to Kirk’s remarks during one of his shows in 2023, in which he said: “I think it’s worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the second amendment to protect our other God-given rights.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2235594088-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-16 17:56:43.749685

""When I'm told — or scolded — that this is too big of a problem, ‘You can’t save everybody’ — that's true. I can’t. But I can save the person in front of me,"" said Rev. Dr. Walter Brownridge.

This story by Carla Occaso was first published in The Montpelier Bridge on Sept. 16, 2025.
Montpelier’s City Council agreed to pay Christ Episcopal Church $600 per month, for three months, to defray the costs of allowing an encampment on their property. This unexpected quick decision happened during the Sept. 10 council meeting. It came following a presentation of the homelessness situation continuing to develop in downtown Montpelier from the perspective of a local church.
A small grouping of tents covered with tarps is currently gathered on the parking lot surrounding Christ Church’s back door, visible from the bike path and the Capitol Plaza hotel. When The Bridge visited recently, clothes were hanging to dry on nearby outdoor railings and people were sitting together. This encampment has cropped up at its present location just a few hundred yards from the nearby park where, in August, it was dismantled and evacuated by Montpelier city staff. Rev. Dr. Walter Brownridge, Christ Church’s transitional priest, said the number of campers has been fluctuating between 12 and 20.
The church gave permission for people to camp there temporarily, at least until November, Brownridge said. Some people have been permanently “exited” as well, according to Elizabeth Parker, the church’s senior warden, who said seven people who have acted inappropriately have been asked to leave and to stay away. 
However, the arrangement has associated costs, including trash removal and bottled water provisioning among others. Additionally, Brownridge said he would like to give laundry vouchers so people can clean their clothes. Those monitoring and attending to the encampment dwellers are volunteers, and include Parker and Zack Hughes, a member of the congregation and co-chair of the Homelessness Task Force.

Brownridge, along with Parker and Hughes, requested $600 per month for three months to cover the cost of trash bags and trash removal, cleaning supplies, laundry vouchers, bottled water and the rental of a portable toilet. 
“These are all not luxuries, but simple things that, for people living outside in tents, we might need,” Brownridge said. He also said some members of the congregation are uncomfortable with the situation while others support it. He pointed out that there is nowhere else for the people living in the encampment to go. 
“And when I am told — or scolded — that this is too big of a problem, ‘You can’t save everybody,’ and that is true. I can’t. But I can save the person in front of me for at least two or three months, and that is what we are trying to do: Save or help those who are a very vulnerable population,” he said.
Brownridge described the situation as “most critical” and highlighted the need for a collaborative, urgent response. Councilor Jim Sheridan praised the church for “stepping up more than anybody else.” He asserted he would support the funding on the spot considering the urgency. Other city councilors weren’t as quick to agree. Councilors Ben Doyle and Pelin Kohn expressed concern about setting a precedent for similar requests and the lack of a formal application process. Doyle worried aloud that anyone could walk in the door and request funding if a precedent is set in such a manner.
Sheridan argued that although this does set a precedent, it is in response to an unprecedented situation. “I mean, precedents are done all the time because if no precedent is ever set we would still be in the Stone Age,” Sheridan said. “You (set) precedents when you have something that is brand new that you have never had to face before.” He then made the motion to grant the requested $1,800. Councilor Adrienne Gil pointed out that the last encampment cleanup cost $4,000, and that she would support releasing the funds on the spot “because it will save us potential future cleanup costs.”
Parker said measures taken to manage the encampment safely included posting signs to discourage unwanted visitors, working with the Montpelier Police Department, and installing security cameras. She noted that the police have assisted in removing individuals for inappropriate behavior.
And while the funding request was for a short-term need, there was a broader discussion about the city’s lack of long-term homelessness planning. Residents Steve Whitaker and Peter Kelman criticized the city council for neglecting the issue for years and failing to act on previous reports. The church is also exploring options for a winter day shelter and a more permanent, long-term solution.
In the end, everyone decided to support the request.

Ned Lamont on Tuesday suggested that United Illuminating may soon agree to postpone a final decision on the utility’s controversial plan to erect a new transmission line through sections of Fairfield and Bridgeport.
The project, known as the Fairfield to Congress Railroad Transmission Line, has sparked intense opposition from local residents, businesses and elected officials who have objected to both the location and the utility’s plans to string the lines between steel poles up to 195 feet high.
The Connecticut Siting Council, which has jurisdiction over the location of transmission lines, has scheduled a final vote on the project for this Thursday after its members previously indicated their support in a non-binding straw poll.
But the vote could be delayed if Lamont and United Illuminating agree to hold further talks with state and local officials to come up with an alternative plan that would alleviate some of the communities’ concerns. As of Tuesday afternoon, no such compromise had been reached, but Lamont said he was engaged in ongoing conversations with the company.
“We’re here to say we’re not going to let UI rush into a bad decision,” the governor told a crowd that had gathered at the state Capitol to protest the proposal. “Give us time to come up with a better, credible alternative.”
Lamont added that company officials had told him “they would not oppose the delay.” He said the two sides planned to meet again as soon as Friday.
A spokeswoman for United Illuminating declined to comment on the governor’s remarks. 
The company has argued that its proposal to build the transmission line on top of what are known as monopoles  is the most cost-effective option for ratepayers. With the above ground route, the project’s estimated $300 million price tag would be spread across nearly 14 million electric customers throughout all of New England, the company has said.
By contrast, burying the line underground — one of the alternatives most commonly cited by critics — would likely add $500 million in costs that would have to be borne exclusively by ratepayers in Connecticut, the company said.
Lamont challenged that, telling reporters Tuesday that additional costs deemed to be necessary for safety or other practical purposes — as opposed to aesthetic reasons — could be spread out more broadly across the region.
Mary Cate Colapietro, a spokeswoman for regional grid operator ISO New England, said Tuesday that the organization has yet to review the project to determine how its cost should be spread out. 
“If a project that had been proposed to be overhead, is instead required to be underground because of the outcome of state siting, then under [ISO New England’s] procedures, the incremental cost to underground the line would not be regionalized,” Colapietro said.
Lamont’s comments drew a swift rebuke from House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, and ranking member of the Energy and Technology Committee, state Rep. Tracy Marra, R-Darien, who issued a joint statement accusing the governor of “inserting himself” into the siting council’s deliberations.
“If elected officials in these communities wants to have prettier lines, let them pay for it,” the statement said. “Why should the rest of the state bear that cost?”
In Fairfield and Bridgeport, meanwhile, opposition to the project has crossed party lines. 
Earlier this month, a delegation of local lawmakers wrote a letter to the siting council arguing that the project would depress property values while causing other harm to local business, churches and historic sites such as Bridgeport’s Freeman Houses. In addition, they said the 19 acres needed for easements to construct the transmission line violated the property rights of owners.
On Monday, CT Insider reported that Lamont’s office arranged a “peace summit” last week between local leaders and UI that did not result in any agreement being reached. Officials in both Bridgeport and Fairfield are planning to hold a press conference Wednesday asking the siting council to delay its vote.
A representative for the siting council did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) The Iowa chapter of the Sierra Club and some landowners called Tuesday for the Iowa Utilities Commission to reject Summit Carbon Solutions’ petition to amend its pipeline permit.
The petition, filed Monday, requests changes to the initially proposed route and pipe size for the carbon sequestration pipeline project, which had been approved by the IUC in 2024. That approval came with requirements that Summit could not begin construction until it received route permission from North Dakota and South Dakota, and storage permission in North Dakota.
Since the IUC’s initial approval, South Dakota has enacted a law preventing the use of eminent domain in CO2 pipeline projects, and has denied two of Summit’s permit requests. In North Dakota, Summit’s permits were approved, but are facing legal challenges.

In light of these actions in other states, Summit has requested to amend the permit in Iowa, changing language to reflect that “additional options for storage and pathways to storage are developing and may provide a better solution.” The request would remove language referencing North Dakota and South Dakota, changing the petition to state construction cannot begin until it has “secured access to one or more sequestration sites and permits or agreements to allow it to reach such storage.”
Landowners and advocates who oppose the pipeline project or the use of eminent domain in gaining land easements necessary to complete the route, released statements Tuesday calling for the IUC to reject the proposed language change.
Though Summit said in its petition that the move away from state-specific language would not diminish “protections against a ‘pipeline to nowhere'” in the permit, people opposed to the project said the shift is too substantial of a change to be approved as an amendment, while criticizing the business for not providing further details on a new route or storage options.
“This isn’t an amendment, this is a last-ditch effort and half-baked proposal for an entirely new project because South Dakota said no,” Wally Taylor, attorney for the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, said in a statement. “Summit needs to realize that Iowa is saying no, too.”
Brian Jorde, an attorney with Domina Law Group representing landowners with Bold Education Fund’s Iowa Easement Team, called for Summit to withdraw its application for the “Phase 2” route in Iowa. He also said the company should surrender its permit approvals in Iowa and North Dakota, “which were predicated on a plan and route that no longer exists.”
“If Summit truly wants a ‘fresh start,’ they need to come clean with the public, regulators, and landowners about their plans, and start the application process over with a viable route that identifies specific sequestration sites and any ‘industrial use’ partners,” Jorde said in a statement.
Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw criticized the comments from Jorde and the Sierra Club in a statement while expressing support for Summit’s petition.
“As we noted when South Dakota changed their law, there are many places to sequester carbon and there are many ways to get to those locations that do not involve South Dakota,” Shaw said. “It seems to us that Summit’s permit request simply reflects that.”
Though there has been opposition to the project, Shaw said a “super majority of impacted landowners have expressed their support for the project through voluntary easements,” and said the IRFA will continue to support “fair treatment” for carbon capture projects while supporting the protection of landowners rights.
“The demand for ultra-low carbon ethanol is expanding around the world, and we do not want Iowa left out,” Shaw said. “When the carbon sequestration project in Nebraska begins operations this fall, Iowa will lose its 25-year crown as the world’s most profitable place in the world to turn corn into ethanol. There are serious economic ramifications that will follow if that is allowed to last. IRFA will work to ensure Iowa returns to the top while Sierra Club relishes the thought that Iowa’s rural economy will be further diminished.”
In addition to the petition to amend the Iowa permit, Summit announced a community and landownership partnership program Monday, including updated commitments related to safety, transparency and increased benefits for landowners and counties where the pipeline route is planned.
“We’re fully committed to making this project work the right way going forward,” the letter, sent to county supervisors, county emergency managers and landowners, said. “We also realize our significant investment will only be successful if it’s built on genuine partnership, and we know that success depends on working side-by-side with communities and landowners along our route.”
But some landowners opposed to the project, including Kim Junker of Butler County, said Tuesday the newly announced incentives are an attempt to “sweeten and distract from our biggest concerns about the project.”
“Summit is still trying to place a dangerous pipeline near our homes. Summit is still trying to abuse our property rights through the use of eminent domain. Summit is still aiming to take our tax dollars for their privately-owned project. Summit is still threatening our land and our water,” Junker said in a statement. “Nothing about that has changed. This project is still all risk and no reward.”

Edward Kirby, 45, is suing the City of Des Moines in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Also named as defendants are Officers Michael Hoopes and Bryan Loftus.
Kirby alleges that on Aug. 17, 2023, he was filling his car with gasoline at a QuikTrip convenience store on Des Moines’ University Avenue when he noticed Hoopes and Loftus responding to a reported shoplifting incident.

The suspect was a homeless man Kirby knew from his neighborhood and so, according to the lawsuit, Kirby tried to pay for the stolen goods, hoping that would dissuade the officers from arresting the man.
The officers allegedly told Kirby that in addition to the alleged theft, the suspect was trespassing due to his being barred from the store and would be going to jail for that offense.
According to the lawsuit, the officers then used their in-vehicle computer to access information about the suspect and discovered there was no record of him being barred from the store. Kirby, who was unaware of that at the time, alleges he then asked the officers how much the man’s bail was going to be, at which point Loftus told him, “Hey, go away!”
Kirby asked again about the bail, allegedly leading to Hoopes getting out of the patrol car and telling Kirby to turn around and put his hands behind his back, informing him he was being handcuffed and detained for interference with police.
Kirby allegedly protested, explaining that he was only trying to find out how much bail would be, and Hoopes reportedly responded by asking Kirby if he wanted to go to jail.
Within a minute, the lawsuit claims, Loftus advised Kirby the suspect was not going to be arrested for trespassing and was being released. Loftus allegedly then took from Kirby the QuikTrip products that Kirby had just paid for and returned them to the store.
Loftus and Hoopes then released Kirby, with no citations issued. According to the lawsuit, he had been detained by the officers for less than two minutes. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for civil rights violations and false arrest.
The City of Des Moines, which says it has a policy of not commenting on pending litigation, has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, which was initially filed in state court.

(Screenshot from the Oklahoma Supreme Court Network)OKLAHOMA CITY — An initiative petition aiming to reform Oklahoma’s election system and open primaries can begin collecting signatures following a ruling from the Oklahoma Supreme Court. 
The state’s high court on Tuesday ruled 8-0 that a challenge to State Question 836 was premature. Opponents, including the Oklahoma state Republican Party, argued in June the state question’s gist was misleading and the suggested reforms would burden Oklahomans’ right to associate with political parties. 
“The People’s right to propose law and amendments to the Oklahoma Constitution through the initiative process is precious, and any doubt as to the legal sufficiency of an initiative petition should be resolved in its favor,” Justice Douglas Combs wrote in the majority opinion. 
The Supreme Court found the gist was not misleading, that any challenge at this stage was premature, and does not impose any “severe burden” on associational rights. 
The proposed state question needs almost 173,000 signatures to make it onto a future ballot. If approved, it would open primary elections to all voters. While Oklahoma primaries are currently closed, parties can choose to open them to 466,000 registered independent voters. Only Democrats currently do. 
State Question 836 proposes allowing voters to choose one candidate for each office and the top two voter-getters advance to the general election regardless of political party. Presidential primary elections would be unaffected. 
Tony Stobbe, a proponent for the ballot measure and involved in the lawsuit, said in a statement following Tuesday’s ruling that the state question is about giving every voter a voice in Oklahoma elections regardless of party affiliation. 
“Today’s ruling is a victory for Oklahoma voters and a defeat for the insiders and power-brokers who benefit from today’s closed, exclusionary primary process,” he said. “We are eager to begin collecting signatures and to take this transformative conversation directly to the people. In the next few weeks, you’ll see our volunteers on street corners, in parking lots, at sporting events, and in every corner of the state, talking with everyday Oklahomans about why it’s time to open our primaries and put voters first.”
Ronda Vuillemont-Smith, a former Tulsa GOP chair, who is one of the parties challenging the measure, said she wasn’t surprised by the Supreme Court ruling. 
“It was kind of expected,” she said. “When you challenge a case like that, you know that there’s a chance, and after sitting through the hearing I really didn’t think that it was going to come down in our favor. But what it did do is it did postpone their collecting of signatures.”
Supporters will need to collect signatures under a new law, Vuillemont-Smith said. Among other things, Senate Bill 1027 creates restrictions on where signatures can be gathered, which critics say will make it more difficult to qualify citizen-led measures for the ballot. Opponents filed a challenge to the new law. 
The Oklahoma Supreme Court this week halted implementation of the law as it pertains to State Question 836, but denied a broader request to stop it from taking effect for other initiatives while legal proceedings play out.
Vuillemont-Smith said there’s a potential to challenge the state question when signatures are submitted. 
“I do look forward to following this process through and see where it goes,” she said. “It’s something I do not believe is good for Oklahoma.”

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A loan forgiveness plan for new teachers of color in Providence public schools is at the center of a lawsuit the Trump administration filed Tuesday against the city’s school department in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.
The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) alleges civil rights laws were violated when Providence Public School District (PPSD) and the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) partnered with the nonprofit Rhode Island Foundation in 2021 to start the Educators of Color Loan Forgiveness Program. The program supplies up to $25,000 in student debt relief for new hires who identify as Asian, Black, Indigenous, Latino, biracial, or multiracial. A minimum debt of $5,000 was required to participate.
“Helping new teachers pay off their student loans may be a worthy endeavor for public school districts,” reads the complaint signed by Robert L. Galbreath, a senior trial attorney in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division. “But excluding white teachers is racist and unlawful.”
The Rhode Island Foundation funded the subsidies and pledged up to $3.175 million for loan repayments. When the agreement was forged, officials intended to recruit and retain up to 127 teachers of color over five years. 
But since none of the 491 “non-minority teachers” hired between the 2021-2022 and 2023-2024 received the benefit, the DOJ argues, the district flouted longstanding requirements of civil rights in employment practices, especially those under Title VII, which makes it unlawful to compensate people differently on the basis of their race.
“This is race discrimination in public employment, pure and simple,” reads the complaint. “The agreement with [Rhode Island Foundation] requires PPSD to create the Program application, review application submissions, and approve teachers for participation in the Program. RIF merely writes the checks.”
Rhode Island Foundation acknowledged a request for comment but did not respond by press time.
The feds are seeking to block the program via a permanent injunction. The DOJ also wants “an award of equitable relief to non-minority new PPSD teachers who were not eligible for the Program on the basis of race.”
A centerpiece of the feds’ argument is the 2021 memorandum of agreement between PPSD, RIDE and the Rhode Island Foundation which outlines the program. RIDE is implicated in the lawsuit because it assumed control over the capital city’s school district in 2019 and remains responsible for its budgeting and spending decisions.  
The DOJ began investigating PPSD in March over the violations. Suzanne Ouellette, a PPSD spokesperson, wrote in an email Tuesday that local and state school officials have “worked in good faith with the U.S. Department of Justice to reach a resolution on this matter” in months since and that the lawsuit’s sudden appearance came as a surprise.  
“PPSD and RIDE officials have not been served, and we were not informed by federal representatives that they would proceed with a lawsuit,” Ouellette wrote. “Since there is active litigation, PPSD and RIDE will not be commenting further.”
According to the 2025 Rhode Island KIDS COUNT Factbook’s analysis of RIDE data from Oct. 2023, white teachers made up 87% of the state’s educator population. A 2023 study by the Annenberg Institute at Brown University found that PPSD had a higher share of teachers of color, nearly 22%. The Providence public school student body, however, was only 8% white students in 2024, according to the Factbook.
“Students of Color demonstrate long-term academic achievement including higher reading and math test scores, decreased likelihood of dropping out of high school, increased likelihood of going to college, and improved social and emotional development in classes with Teachers of Color,” the KIDS COUNT Factbook states.
Providence’s loan forgiveness program was meant to be “used as an incentive to encourage teachers of color to teach in the District,” according to the 2021 memorandum. A June 2024 update on the Turnaround Action Plan — the guiding document for the state’s 2019 takeover of the district — mentions an 86% annual retention rate among the three cohorts who had then gone through the program. The district’s typical “novice teacher retention” is closer to 70 or 75%, according to the document.
The DOJ suit says the program “continues to operate on behalf of applicants accepted,” although it was unclear Tuesday whether the program was still operational. While the program’s main landing page is no longer available on PPSD’s website, a cached copy on Archive.org shows the page was still live as recently as July 29. Another cached copy is linked in the DOJ’s complaint.
A link accessible through the cached page shows the Google form to apply is still online as of Tuesday afternoon, although it does say that new applications are not being accepted. 
Additionally, the form lists more specific criteria for eligibility, including working at least 135 days in the school year and making a payment to the loan’s creditor at the end of each year in the program. To receive the full $25,000, educators must work three consecutive years, with payments delivered in increasing sums of $6,000, $8,500, and finally $10,500 in the third year. The payments are considered gifts and recipients must pay taxes on them.
The $25,000 loan forgiveness benefit still lives elsewhere on the PPSD website, such as an advertisement for a 2022 hiring fair or a page on the district’s hiring process.
The case has been assigned to District Judge Mary S. McElroy and Magistrate Judge Patricia A. Sullivan. No hearing has been scheduled yet.

The agreement largely mirrors the state's previous memorandum of understanding, but the feds will pay Vermont more for the use of state prisons and the arrangement has no set expiration date.

Vermont has inked a new agreement with U.S. immigration authorities, allowing them to continue using the state’s prisons for federal detentions. 
The memorandum of understanding between the Vermont Department of Corrections, U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Border Patrol signed last week mirrors a previous agreement between the parties. But unlike the prior document, this agreement pays the state an increasing amount per person per day for holding federal immigration detainees and does not have an expiration date. 
While Gov. Phil Scott’s renewal of the agreement is not a surprise, the state’s detention arrangement has attracted scrutiny from Democrats and advocates for noncitizens in Vermont, many of whom have been critical of recent increased federal immigration enforcement actions. Scott has said for months he believes people detained by federal authorities in Vermont are best served by being in the state’s prisons and courts rather than imprisoned elsewhere.
“I think that it’s important for us to do our part, but also protect those here in our state that are detained,” Scott said in August when asked about his support for renewing the arrangement.

The leader of a prominent Vermont immigration law clinic and the ACLU of Vermont have both said the state ideally would not partner with ICE, but ending the state’s detention agreement could do more harm than good for detainees. 
Since President Donald Trump began his second term, the federal government has increased its reliance on Vermont’s prisons to detain people held on immigration offenses. In some cases, people are detained in Vermont and held for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the state’s prisons. Other times, federal authorities bring detainees to Vermont prisons from out of state. In most instances, people detained by immigration enforcement agents remain in Vermont for only a few days, according to corrections officials, before being transported elsewhere. 
A previous VTDigger investigation revealed frustrations within the Department of Corrections as prison leaders dealt with safety concerns and increasing demands from ICE agents. 
Like the previous memorandum of understanding, the latest agreement requires Vermont to provide medical services to federal detainees and requires any party to give 120 days notice to terminate the deal. But rather than the $180 per person per day the feds previously paid, Vermont will now receive a rate that increases over time, beginning at $185 from Sept. 17, 2025, to July 31, 2026, and steadily rising each year to $208.22 from Aug. 1, 2029 to July 31, 2030. 
The rate then increases by 3% each year, according to the memo.
Those rates appear far higher than many of those paid elsewhere in the country. According to reporting from The New York Times, ICE typically pays $70 to $110 per day per detainee. 
Unlike the state’s previous agreement with federal immigration authorities, which expired after a year, the new deal remains in effect “unless terminated by the parties.”
A spokesperson for Scott said the payment rate and termination date are the only changes to the agreement. 
Neither memo specifies a maximum number of people the state can detain for ICE, but the state maintains the ability to refuse detainees due to capacity limitations. In recent months, Vermont’s population of immigration detainees has fluctuated from the single digits into the 20s. 
Vermont law gives the governor sole authority to enter into certain agreements with federal immigration authorities after consultation with the Vermont Attorney General. According to a spokesperson for Scott, the detention memo is not an agreement that requires such consultation. A spokesperson for Attorney General Charity Clark said the office did not have enough facts to provide a legal analysis.

(Commonwealth Media Services)Gov. Josh Shapiro said Tuesday leaders have a responsibility to “speak and act with moral clarity” when condemning political violence in America.
“During moments like this, I believe we have a responsibility to be clear and unequivocal in calling out all forms of political violence and making clear it is all wrong. That shouldn’t be hard to do,” Shapiro said during a roughly 25-minute speech in Pittsburgh.
“Unfortunately, some from the dark corners of the internet, all the way to the Oval Office, want to cherry pick which instances of political violence they want to condemn. Listen, doing that only further divides us and it makes it harder to heal,” he added. “There are some who will hear that selective condemnation and take it as a permission slip to commit more violence, so long as it suits their narrative or only targets the other side.”
The governor delivered the speech on Tuesday at the 5th annual Eradicate Hate Global Summit, a three-day gathering that intends to bring people together to confront violence. The annual conference began in response to the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill  neighborhood. The Oct. 27, 2018, attack is the deadliest attack against Jews in American history. 
Shapiro said political violence and hate that fuels it has become “far too common” in society today. The examples that he cited over roughly the past year or so included the assassination attempt against President Donald Trump in Butler, the murder of  UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City, the assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
“Different places, different people, different perspectives,” Shapiro said. “One common thread: people using violence to settle political differences.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Shapiro also highlighted his personal experience by recalling the night that he, his family, and visitors were forced to evacuate the governor’s residence when it was firebombed, just hours after they celebrated the first night of Passover.
“I thank God every day that we were able to evacuate safely, that no one was physically injured or, worse yet killed, that all the staff who worked at the residence, the brave police and firefighters and first responders who ran toward danger were okay,” Shapiro said. 
“But understand that doesn’t mean that the attack hasn’t left emotional scars,” he added. “I can attest to that, especially as a father, a father to four children, knowing that my life choices put them at risk.”
Preliminary hearing waived for the man suspected of firebombing the Governor’s Residence last April

Shapiro described all forms of violence as “unacceptable,” but singled out political violence as being “particularly dangerous,” saying it intends to “injure, maim or kill, it seeks to intimidate and terrorize and silence.”
However, Shapiro assured the audience that it would not deter him from performing his duty of governor. 
“And I sure as heck will not be silenced,” he said.
Citing Pennsylvania as a model, Shapiro noted how all of the former living governors – Republicans and Democrats –  and their spouses and children offered support in the wake of the attack.
“We’ll never know, but perhaps the words they shared, the mere fact that they gathered together, stopped other hate filled or hate inspired actions, and brought down the temperature of a nervous Commonwealth,” Shapiro said.
Former Gov. Tom Corbett, a Republican, spoke before Shapiro and said that preventing hate fueled violence is not a partisan issue.
“It is one that requires all of us around this country and around the world to work together, and events such as Eradicate Hate show that there is a real desire to forge a lasting change,” Corbett said. “Progress is possible, if we do come together.”
Shapiro said that censorship would not solve the problems of ending political violence, but instead promoted more opportunities for peaceful and respectful dialogue.

Shapiro accuses Trump of “failing” leadership test
Following his speech, Shapiro spoke to reporters for just over 10 minutes on a variety of topics, mainly centering around political violence.
The governor was asked if he was worried about the temperature being more heated, following the assassination of Kirk.
After replying, “Yes,” he added, “I think what we need right now is calm.”
He had harsh words for Trump’s current response to Kirk’s assassination in Utah last week.
“What we’re seeing now from the president of the United States and some of his allies, is by cherry picking certain violence that is okay, and certain violence that is not okay. That is making everyone less safe, and it’s raising the temperatures instead of lowering the temperatures,” Shapiro said. “This should be a moment where we should be able to stand together in universal condemnation.”
“It should not be hard to stand up to some people who are celebrating the killing of Charlie Kirk and say that’s wrong, and it should not be hard to stand up to people who are calling for vengeance and revenge in the wake of the killing of Charlie Kirk,” he added.
To Shapiro, it doesn’t matter if the comments were coming from the right or the left, everyone should condemn that violence.
“And the President has once again failed that leadership test, failed the morality test, and it makes us all less safe,” Shapiro said.

The White House sent out a statement on Tuesday afternoon pushing back on Shapiro’s criticism.
“As the survivor of two assassination attempts — and now watching his dear friend Charlie be assassinated — no one understands the dangers of political violence more than President Trump,” White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said. “That’s why, following Charlie’s assassination, President Trump delivered powerful and unifying remarks urging all Americans to ‘commit themselves to the American values for which Charlie Kirk lived and died. The values of free speech, citizenship, the rule of law, and the patriotic devotion and love of God.’ 
“But President Trump, and the entire Administration, will not hesitate to speak the truth – for years, radical leftists have slandered their political opponents as Nazis and Fascists, inspiring left-wing violence,” Jackson added. “It must end.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/28341_gov_eradicateHate_17-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-16 17:56:43.749685

For over 20 minutes during a Criminal Justice Oversight Council meeting last week, Hammond, part of a panel discussing human trafficking, articulated a story of terror, deception and pain. 
She told the council about her captivity and brought specific asks of the body.
One of the main ones — echoed by other victim advocates — is to help train law enforcement on the signs of human trafficking. And more importantly, they said, how to get victims out of the situation.
“No officer ever made me feel comfortable enough to disclose what was really happening in my life. I was treated as a criminal, just another addict, another problem, when in reality, I was someone’s daughter being sold,” said Hammond, a victim advocate from Billings who survived almost five years of exploitation in Las Vegas, “That fear kept me silent. I wish every law enforcement agency required trauma-informed training. Officers need to recognize the signs of exploitation and how to respond in a way that makes victims feel safe.”
For nearly two hours last week, Montana’s Criminal Justice Oversight Council heard testimony from Hammond and other human trafficking victims along with requests for more funding and better training on the issue for state employees.
The state has taken steps in recent years to address human trafficking — including SB 245 in the 2025 legislative session, which trains bus drivers on the issue — but more emphasis on the issue is needed, advocates said. 
Representatives from the Yellowstone Human Trafficking Task Force spoke for more than an hour to members of the committee, which includes legislators and representatives from multiple state agencies.
Two victim advocates shared deeply personal stories of being groomed, sold, raped, beaten, and cut off from their families during the meeting. They also explained why education on the issue is vital. State law enforcement officers are only required to have four hours of training on human trafficking.
The task force is a nonprofit co-founded in 2016 by Penny Ronning, who also spoke to the council — her mother was a human trafficking victim, she said. Around 2010, Ronning was a Court Appointed Special Advocate in Billings and worked with kids who had been trafficked. 
“My very first CASA case that I had, it was a young, 15-year-old girl who was trafficked here in Billings through a fast food restaurant,” Ronning told the Daily Montanan in an interview. “And that’s when I learned that what had happened to my mom in the early 1940s in rural South Dakota was happening today to children in the community in which I lived.”
The task force has grown in size and scale over the past few years, becoming a nonprofit in 2020.

The task force was created to coordinate law enforcement, service providers, community groups and volunteers in the Yellowstone County area, the organization’s website states.
It’s also looking to help those groups “investigate and prosecute traffickers and buyers, to assist victims of labor and sex trafficking, to increase community awareness, and prevent future trafficking.”
Multiple members of the Federal Bureau of Investigation are on the task force, as is assistant U.S. Attorney Zeno Baucus. The Bureau of Indian Affairs and the state’s Department of Justice are among the many supporters and partners of the task force, according to the organization’s website.
Ronning said the organization has been invited to the White House twice and works closely with U.S. Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican, and previously worked with former U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat, along with other politicians across the political spectrum. It has also begun work with two other members of Montana’s federal delegation, U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy and U.S. Rep. Troy Downing, Ronning said.
The organization was awarded the FBI Director’s Community Leadership Award in 2021.
The organization was invited to be part of the panel earlier this year, which Ronning said they were “thrilled by” and provided statistics before the council heard from the victim advocates. 
Data on the issue is a major hurdle, Ronning said, saying police reports do not always “separate prostitution and human trafficking” because they were not able to identify the difference, which she called “problematic.” 
The state Department of Justice had 91 human trafficking cases and 40 arrests since 2022, according to data from the task force. But those numbers are likely low in relation to how common human trafficking is, Ronning cautioned.
Ronning also pointed to a large-scale study from Polaris, a human trafficking advocacy organization. It found that 90% of those trafficked are women and up to 50% are minors. Native American and Alaska Native women, who face high rates of sexual violence — over half experience it in their lifetime, according to the National Congress of American Indians — account forabout 40% of sex trafficking victims, according to the University of Cincinnati. 
According to the BIA, approximately 4,200 missing and murdered cases remain unsolved in the country.
Lea Wetzel, a victim advocate, also recounted her story to the council. She works with the state Department of Public Health and Human Services, and is an alternate for the Blackfeet Tribe on Montana’s Missing and Murdered Ingenious Women task force.

She said it impacts people of all demographics, across the socioeconomic divides.
“Trafficking doesn’t hit just Indigenous communities. It doesn’t hit just people in poverty,” Wetzel told the committee. “It doesn’t hit just people with addiction.”
Victims enter the human trafficking world in different ways, and for Hammond, it was a friend’s sister, she said.
She thought he was a handsome guy, but said she was then manipulated. 
“This is known as a Romeo-style grooming, and it works especially well on young people from small towns and rural states, because we don’t know any better,” Hammond said. “It feels new, exciting, glamorous. It feels like someone has come along like a white knight to fix all your problems, but not everything that glitters is gold. And in this case, what looked shiny and glamorous was in reality dark, violent and gruesome.”
Hammond said in Las Vegas, she moved to different strip clubs and between multiple traffickers. She eventually escaped after help from her mother. 
“His violence escalated so badly over the years that I knew that if I didn’t get out, I was going to die. And at that moment, I decided that the risk of telling my mom the truth was less than the risk of staying,” Hammond said. “My mom bravely befriended my trafficker, and after six months of building his trust, she convinced him to let me come home temporarily to care for my grandfather. Once I was past airport security, I felt like I could breathe for the first time since October 6, 2011.”
Montana has taken steps to address the problem, with the state hiring full-time human trafficking investigators in 2019 after legislative action. The nonprofit has also pushed for a better phone tip hotline — which has gotten almost 400 tips in the last three years — which has helped with the speed of law enforcement response. Prior to advocacy on the issue, the phone line was operated by people out of state and communication speed is a problem the task force has sought to highlight.
Ronning would like to see increased trauma-informed care among law enforcement and corrections employees to help identify victims of human trafficking. The task force would also like to see more investigators, and it’s working on  an assessment tool in partnership with the state Department of Corrections.
“There’s a need for those victims who have been incarcerated to be identified as victims of human trafficking,” Ronning said.
She said if people who are forced into crime need to get proper services, and those who work with them need to understand “forced criminality.”
“We need to be taking a different look at this,” Ronning said.
Human trafficking victims are sometimes arrested on prostitution charges, she said, and there’s a want to decriminalize the victim. That doesn’t, however, mean Ronning nor the organization support legalized prostitution, which she said would make things worse.

“Wherever full decriminalization has happened, now you’ve told violent individuals it’s fully legal to go rape that vulnerable person,” Ronning said. “Now it’s fully legal to go be violent against that individual who is now deemed a sex worker. What we know in prostitution is that 98% of what we would call victim workers in prostitution are not there because that is what they’re choosing to do.”
The organization has also been active in Billings, helping to push an ordinance targeting illicit massage parlors. Ronning is a former city councilor who also ran in the Democratic primary for the U.S. House of Representatives in the eastern district.
One female victim could generate between $3,800 to $18,000 a month, Ronning said. Part of the fight against trafficking, Ronning said, is understanding how traffickers are using technology to find their victims.
“Technology is evolving, so this is what we have to be focused on when it comes to youth,” Ronning told the committee. “This is how trafficking is happening now. It’s happening through digital means. This is the way that the trafficker and the buyers connect, and this is the way that victims are sold, and this is the way addiction to pornography is is really pushed through the algorithms.”
Bots using artificial intelligence to find buyers are one way law enforcement has used technology to fight human trafficking, something Ronning would like to see come to Montana.
Montana has begun to look at ways to address the issue — Rep. Amy Regier, for example, brought House Bill 408 during the 2025 Legislative session, which would have required companies to put an obscenity filter on electronic devices. That bill ultimately stalled in the Senate’s judiciary committee and was supported by the task force.
The effort built on laws passed during the 2023 Legislative session requiring adult websites to have age verification. Montana also passed Senate Bill 413, from Helena Democrat Sen. Laura Smith, surrounding so-called “deep fake” pornography, especially targeting images created by artificial intelligence software.
Regier said they need to look at putting “sideboards for kids” on some of this technology. She said it’s important to figure out what human traffickers are using and how they’re using it in order to stop it.
“It seems that the internet has a huge impact on human trafficking,” Regier said last week.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/230426-CapitolStockPhotos08-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-16 17:56:43.749685

Green International Airport. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)The board overseeing Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport has awarded a nearly $97,000 performance bonus to the airport’s CEO on top of a 9.2% pay raise and extended his contract for another two years.
A new contract approved by the Rhode Island Airport Corporation’s board of directors Tuesday morning pays CEO Iftikhar Ahmad an annual base salary of $527,728, up from $483,276 in the three-year agreement the panel approved in January 2024.
Under that contract, which was set to expire Oct. 12, 2026, Ahmad was eligible for a maximum bonus of 20% of his base salary and a pay increase contingent upon an annual performance review by the board. His latest review was completed Tuesday morning by the board’s executive compensation committee and then considered in a 30-minute closed-door session during the full board meeting.
Upon return to open session, Ahmad was showered with praise by the head of the board’s compensation committee.
“The CEO’s performance was exemplary,” board secretary Christopher Little said. “If we had a score of higher of 10 with regard to some of the initiatives, it would have been higher.”
In addition to recommending Ahmad’s bonus, Little urged the board to amend his contract to include a cost of living adjustment. The panel approved the change unanimously, but a copy of the new contract released to Rhode Island Current did not include a mention of the cost of living adjustment. 
The board ratified a resolution commending Ahmad for the “transformational progress” he’s made at T.F. Green since taking the helm of the airport corporation in 2016. Before landing in Warwick, ​​Ahmad served as director of aviation at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport.
Before his arrival, the board’s resolution notes the airport faced chronic underperformance and needed an executive who would foster a high-performance culture.
The resolution touts accomplishments such as spearheading major renovations within the Warwick terminal, creating more brand awareness by partnering with the New England Patriots, increasing the number of nonstop flights 118% over the last nine years, and becoming the permanent base for Breeze Airways.
Officials also cite Ahmad’s tenure in helping T.F. Green reach the distinction of being the best in the world, according to Travel + Leisure magazine.
“Things have changed,” Ahmad told reporters after the meeting. 
But his tenure has hit some turbulence in the past year.
He has had a very rocky relationship with unionized police officers and firefighters, who last  February unanimously delivered a vote of no confidence in airport leadership,citing a hostile work environment and the unwillingness of Ahmad to negotiate a new contract.
A new contract was eventually ratified in March, but only after a bitter dispute with the union’s president, who had been fired months earlier.
Airport officials had also considered privatizing TSA duties over “unacceptable” wait times, only to withdraw its petition after observing “significantly enhanced performance at the checkpoint” and facing pushback from members of Rhode Island’s congressional delegation.
Most recently, unionized janitors have expressed frustrations over a new vendor to handle janitorial duties at the airport, fearing the proposal under review could slash hours and put jobs at risk.
Ahmad acknowledged certain aspects of leading the airport have been bumpy but that major changes have come at the direction of the board in its quest to “transform” T.F. Green. He invoked a cooking analogy to suggest how messy change can sometimes be.
“If we weren’t doing what we’re doing, this stuff wouldn’t happen,” Ahmad told reporters. “And yes, sometimes there are omelets to be made.”

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)As farmers in Maine continue to face financial stress after funding cuts and other uncertainty from the Trump administration, organizers of the Common Ground Country Fair hope the upcoming event will raise public awareness about those challenges and bring in additional cash to help farmers weather the moment.  
“It has been a hard year for farmers on multiple fronts,” said Sarah Alexander, executive director of the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association, which runs the fair. 
Tens of thousands of people are expected to travel to Unity September 19-21 for the nearly 50-year-old tradition of celebrating and learning about the state’s agricultural traditions. 
“The original goals of the fair are still very similar to what they are today,” Alexander said, “which is education, first and foremost, and connection.”
That education this year will include a focus on the importance of federal assistance in ensuring a viable future for the agriculture sector in Maine, through keynote speeches and volunteers helping fairgoers get involved in social and political action.
President Donald Trump has frozen or eliminated billions of dollars in U.S. Department of Agriculture grants and programs, and more than 100 farmers and supporters paraded through Augusta in protest of the cuts in the spring. Maine farmers have also raised concern about Trump’s tariffs that they say could eat away at their already thin profit margins.

Other federal changes have also impacted Mainers’ ability to access food. Most recently, with a federal nutrition grant on pause, a state program that helps food insecure Mainers buy fresh produce is being downsized. 
Alexander will be joining Rhiannon Hampson, formerly the state director for USDA Rural Development under President Joe Biden, and Jim Hightower, former Texas agriculture commissioner, for a joint keynote address on Sunday to make the case for public funding for Maine’s farms and food consumers.  
Supporting farms is “something that needs a bigger effort than just shopping with our local dollars,” Alexander said. 
Hampson had overseen a number of the federal programs that were interrupted or cut this year, including the Rural Energy Access Program, which many Maine farmers previously tapped into to be able to put solar panels on their farms or make other energy upgrades to improve their farm financials.
“Thankfully the reimbursements did finally come through after a few months of really advocating for those,” Alexander said, “but the future of the program is really uncertain.” 
USDA announced in early summer that it wouldn’t be accepting applications this year. 
The Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association is also seeing federal programs the organization’s membership has long relied on being halted. For example, the Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program has funded the group’s journeyperson and beginning farmer programs for the last 12 years, but USDA hasn’t announced if it will continue to offer the program, Alexander said.

The USDA did not respond by publication to a question about whether they would be accepting applications for that program this year.
“Even programs that, in theory, should not be controversial and have been happening year after year at USDA that really do benefit our farmers directly on the ground, they’re just not administering those programs moving forward,” Alexander said. 
The Trump administration has cited broad goals of eliminating government waste and what the administration deems diversity, equity and inclusion programs in defending some of its cuts.  
For example, the administration cut several grants to nonprofits, tribes and local governments across Maine as part of its effort to roll back environmental justice measures, which seek to establish equitable access to healthy environments.
The fair’s offerings will touch upon equity issues, including a public policy teach-in Saturday afternoon that will examine the idea of food justice.  
Farmers are generally encouraged to engage in a “race to the bottom” in terms of price and quality of their food. Fairgoers will have a chance to engage in debate about whether it is possible to address the underlying issues of injustice in the food system and still produce enough food to feed everyone.
In addition to education programming, the fair itself is a large market for the state’s organic farmers. 
Each year, Alexander said millions of dollars are generated through direct sales with vendors at the fair’s farmers market as well as through local farmers selling their products to food vendors. 
The fair requires that, whenever possible, the roughly 500 food vendors use ingredients that are produced organically in Maine.
“A lot of our farmers also end up selling to our food vendors, which creates another market for them,” Alexander said.

The conclusion came during a data release presentation on Tuesday from the Michigan League for Public Policy. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXFor years, the nonpartisan organization has tracked data on various aspects of childhood wellbeing as part of a national effort to measure changes at the state and local level. The Tuesday presentation and ensuing discussion marked the release of the organization’s 2025 Kids Count in Michigan data book.
Anne Kuhnen, the Kids Count in Michigan policy director, told the Michigan Advance on Monday that the data in last year’s report remained steeped in pandemic-era policies, reflecting support from several programs that benefited both families and kids. 
This year’s report focuses on data from 2023 and 2024.
“We saw some pretty positive trends this year in child health,” Kuhnen said. “But then, we also see some of those areas like education where we continue to need to do more.”
The data book notes several improvements in health outcomes for Michigan children, with 97% receiving coverage from some form of health insurance. 
Michigan experienced a decrease in infant mortality between 2018 and 2023, as well as a decrease in the number of births coinciding with less than adequate prenatal care.
There has also been a substantial decline in teen pregnancy, which is associated with negative incomes for both the mother and the child, including a higher likelihood of the child growing up in poverty. The data also pointed to a decline in educational outcomes, with a 4.3% decrease in the number of third graders proficient in reading between 2018 and 2024. The number of students proficient in eighth-grade math also declined 9.7% across the state.

While 65.4% of Michigan students were not college ready in 2018, that number increased to 71.9% in 2024. 
With negative trends in education, the League also pointed to the rising cost of childcare in 77 of the state’s 83 counties. The poverty rate for children up to the age of 17 has declined by 9% since 2018, which the League said is an indicator that many Michigan families are struggling to make ends meet.
The data book noted an increase in the number of children facing food insecurity, rising from 14.7% in 2018 to 17.9% in 2022. That was a point of particular concern, Kuhnen told the Advance, considering a more than 20% increase in children facing food security following a decade of improvement.
Food insecurity rates could continue to rise, Kuhnen noted, pointing to federal cuts to SNAP benefits, and the lack of specific funding for free school meals in the Michigan House of Representatives’ school aid budget. 
“This combination of factors, both at the federal and state level could be very damaging moving forward,” Kuhnen said.
The League on Tuesday issued several policy recommendations to improve health, education and economic wellbeing for Michigan children and families. 



Recommendations include: 

Fully funding early childhood care and education including investments into the workforce and a focus on affordability 
Providing continuous Medicaid coverage for young children 
Increasing access to mental health services in public schools
Fully funding the Opportunity Index, the formula used to shift funding to schools with greater needs and higher levels of poverty
Reducing teen smoking by increasing state spending on tobacco prevention and cessation programs
Expanding the earned income tax credit to young adults under 25 
Adopting universal free community college
Ending life without parole for young adults
Adopting a Michigan Child Tax credit that includes kids who are left out of the federal credit because their parents earn too little
Enacting a paid family and medical leave policy for Michigan employers
Investing in affordable housing
Increasing access to the Family Independence Program, which provides cash assistance to families with dependent children




In Michigan, children rely on lawmakers to prioritize their needs in the state budget and in their policy decisions, Kuhnen said. The investments the state makes today, determine the future those children will grow up into. 
While the state has begun providing avenues for students to receive community college for free or at a reduced cost, barriers remain. Students must attend a community college within their district to have their tuition  covered. Students attending schools outside their districts receive discounted tuition instead.
“This leaves out thousands of young adults who live outside of established community college districts,” the League’s President and CEO Monique Stanton said while presenting the data book. “Universal free community college should be made available to young adults so they know that they can get a good start in life.”
As the federal government shrinks its investment into the states, that raises questions on how states will continue to meet their residents’ needs, Laila Bell, the vice president of learning and impact at the Detroit-based Skillman Foundation said during the panel discussion. 
“It puts pressure on state budgets,” Bell said. “The funding landscape is now creating challenges for our schools and for programs across the state, as we’re trying to make up what has been a loss of investment at the federal level in Americans and in citizens.”

(Dana DiFilippo/New Jersey Monitor)Two environmental groups are warning state residents about the amount of energy and water that is set to be used following the construction of AI data centers in southern Wisconsin. 
In an analysis released Tuesday, Clean Wisconsin found that two data centers approved for construction in Ozaukee and Racine counties will consume enough energy to power 4.3 million homes — nearly double the 2.8 million housing units in the state. 
The first AI data warehouse, operated by Microsoft, is set to open next year in Mount Pleasant. The company has promised it will support 500 jobs. The $3.3 billion project is located at the site initially planned for Foxconn’s massive manufacturing plant. 
Further north in Ozaukee County, Denver-based Vantage Data Systems has acquired 700 acres of land in rural Port Washington. The company has planned a campus that will hold 11 data center buildings and five substations, according to concepts approved by the local government. 
Clean Wisconsin’s analysis found that these two projects will require a combined 3.9 gigawatts of power and hundreds of thousands of gallons of water to keep the buildings cooled. 
“To put this in perspective, that is more than three times the power production capacity of Wisconsin’s Point Beach nuclear plant,” Paul Mathewson, Clean Wisconsin science program director, who conducted the analysis, said in a statement. “And because only two of the data center projects have disclosed their power needs, we know this is really just a fraction of what the energy use would be if all those data centers are ultimately built.”
The power needs of the two sites are just the tip of the iceberg for the energy and water needs of data centers, which house the servers used to host chatbots such as Chat GPT, stream video and use social media. Microsoft has plans for a smaller data center in Kenosha County. Work is also underway on a data center on 830 acres in Beaver Dam reportedly for Facebook owner Meta. In addition, a Virginia-based company has eyed a site in Dane County, Wisconsin Rapids has plans for a $200 million data center and Janesville is seeking to build a center in a former General Motors assembly plant. 
A proposed project in Caledonia has been delayed following  local resistance to the project’s proposed rezoning of 240 acres of farmland. The community’s plan commission postponed a July vote on the proposal until later this month. 
Environmental advocates say local officials and the state’s power companies are rushing to attract data centers to Wisconsin based on the ambiguous promise of jobs without accounting for the effect they could have on a community’s water sources and energy needs. Increases in the amount of power used by the state could result in the state relying more heavily and for longer periods on non-renewable sources of energy and raise energy rates for households. 
‘More questions than answers’
“If data centers come to Wisconsin, they must benefit  — not harm — our communities. But right now, we have far more questions than answers about their impacts. How much energy and water will a project use? How will those demands be met? Will there be backup diesel generators on site and how often will they be fired up for testing? Our communities don’t have the transparency they need and deserve,” Chelsea Chandler, Clean Wisconsin’s climate, energy and air director said. 
Data centers also often emit a constant humming sound as the servers work inside, creating an irritating noise pollutant for neighbors.
Both the Mount Pleasant and Port Washington projects are close to Lake Michigan, raising further complications about the centers’ use of water and the protection of the Great Lakes. The Foxconn site in Mount Pleasant was already at the center of a controversial plan to divert 7 million gallons of water per day from Lake Michigan. 
“There has been very little transparency about the amount of water that will be used on site at these proposed data center campuses. Add to that a lack of transparency about energy use, and it’s impossible to know what the impact on Wisconsin’s water resources will be,” Sarah Walling, Clean Wisconsin’s water and agriculture program director said. “Communities need to know what the on-site demand will be on the hottest, driest days of the year when our water systems are most stressed. And we need to understand how much water will be needed off site to meet a data center’s enormous energy demands.”
Demanding water-use information from Racine
Earlier this week, Midwest Environmental Advocates filed a lawsuit against the city of Racine for records about the Mount Pleasant center’s projected water usage. Water for the center will be provided by the Racine Water Utility under an agreement with the village of Mount Pleasant. 
The lawsuit, filed on behalf of Milwaukee Riverkeeper, is seeking to force Racine to hand over information about projected water usage requested through an open records request in February. In a news release, MEA noted that many companies constructing data centers across the country require that local governments sign non-disclosure agreements. 
The legal advocacy group noted that data centers can use as much water as a small to medium sized city and the public has a right to know the scale of water use. 
“Wisconsin law requires public officials to respond to public records requests ‘as soon as practicable and without delay.’ Yet more than six months after making their request, our clients are still waiting,” MEA legal fellow Michael Greif said. “This blatant disregard for the Public Records Law violates their rights and deprives them of the transparency they deserve. Community members have a right to know how much water a data center will use before it is built.”

State Attorney General Lynn Fitch’s office filed a notice of appeal on Tuesday against the preliminary injunction granted by U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate in August. The injunction prevented the law from being enforced until there’s a final decision in the lawsuit. 
Now, the case will go before a three-judge panel on the conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. 
The attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“I don’t know why the state’s educational authorities would want to try and resurrect these ridiculous provisions which would create chaos in the schools and give our students a thoroughly substandard education,” said Rob McDuff, a Mississippi Center for Justice attorney and one of the lead lawyers representing the plaintiffs. 
“Hopefully, their appeal will fail and sanity will prevail,” he added.
McDuff said the preliminary injunction, in the interim, will stand unless and until the 5th Circuit reverses it. 
Over the past few months, attorneys for the plaintiffs have argued that House Bill 1193, passed by the Legislature this year following a wave of similar bills across the country, is unconstitutional. They said it violates the First and Fourteenth amendments by banning classroom discussions about race, sex, gender identity and sexual orientation. The attorneys have said that would include books and discussions about the Civil War, women’s rights and slavery — topics that define the country’s history. 
But the state’s attorneys said that the plaintiffs were reading the statute in bad faith, and that public employees do not have First Amendment rights in the workplace. 
It’s unclear what the timeline will be for the New Orleans-based appellate court to consider the appeal, but they will likely issue a schedule in the coming weeks for the parties to file legal briefs.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/07010318/MG_0550-scaled.jpg,,,2025-09-16 16:57:58.932429

LaMonica McIver’s claims that she is the victim of selective prosecution are “little more than ‘whataboutism,'"" prosecutors say.","Rep. LaMonica McIver is accused of assaulting officers on May 9 as they tried to arrest Newark Mayor Ras Baraka at the Delaney Hall migrant jail in Newark. (McIver photo by Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)Federal prosecutors are asking a judge not to throw out an indictment accusing Rep. LaMonica McIver of assaulting federal officers during a scuffle outside a migrant jail in Newark in May.
McIver’s claims that she is the victim of selective prosecution are “little more than ‘whataboutism,’” her allegation that federal authorities ignored the actions of Jan. 6 rioters also accused of assaulting officers is “nonsensical,” and her argument that she is being prosecuted for constitutionally protected actions is contrary to both common sense as well as case law, prosecutors say in a new court filing made public Monday.
They also refute claims by McIver, a Democrat, that federal authorities are to blame for creating chaos on the day in question, when agents moved to arrest Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and, authorities allege, McIver assaulted officers during the ensuing fracas.
“McIver, as a Member of Congress, was perhaps better situated than most to de-escalate the situation given her powerful position, but instead chose to heed the unidentified male who goaded the crowd to ‘circle the mayor’ … in an obvious call to impede the Mayor’s arrest,” the filing says.
Prosecutors’ filing — a response to McIver’s motions to dismiss the case — does not shed much new light on what they claim transpired on May 9, the day of Baraka’s arrest. But it does confirm a claim from a recent McIver filing that the order to arrest Baraka, a Democrat, came from the deputy attorney general of the United States, Todd Blanche. Federal prosecutors dropped their trespassing charge against Baraka mere days later.

In August filings seeking to dismiss the case, McIver’s attorneys argued that the indictment omits key details from that chaotic encounter, that she is being singled out for political reasons, and that she cannot be charged for official acts under the U.S. Constitution’s speech or debate clause, which limits when lawmakers can be prosecuted for carrying out official duties. They also claimed that the U.S. Department of Justice’s dismissal of dozens of cases targeting Jan. 6 rioters who had also been charged with assaulting federal officers shows federal prosecutors are singling her out improperly.
But prosecutors noted that the Jan. 6 rioters were pardoned by President Donald Trump, meaning prosecutors were required to drop their charges.
“The pardons required the dismissal of the then-ongoing January 6 prosecutions without any inquiry into the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. That makes the January 6 Defendants not similarly situated to McIver. McIver’s selective prosecution claim fails for this reason alone,” the filing reads.
McIver’s lawyers have said the Constitution does not allow prosecutors to distinguish “between those it chooses to charge and those whose behavior it chooses to ignore.” Prosecutors’ new filing says the cases of the Jan. 6 rioters were not ignored.
“There can be little doubt that the investigations of the January 6 Defendants involved the dedication of huge amounts of resources both in terms of manpower and finances,” it says.
Regarding McIver’s claims that she is being targeted because she’s a Democrat, prosecutors said she fails to provide any proof for this claim, saying she’s relying on “out-of-context statements” from the Trump administration. Prosecutors note that Trump, when asked about McIver’s charges in May in an exchange McIver cited in her motions to dismiss, claimed not to know who she is.
“Rather than evidence of discriminatory intent on the part of the President, this exchange shows that the President had no involvement in the charging decision and perhaps no idea about McIver’s political affiliation until the reporter disclosed it,” their filing says.
Prosecutors also scoffed at McIver’s claim that her actions on May 9 were the constitutionally protected actions of a lawmaker, a claim McIver has made publicly numerous times. Just because McIver was allowed to visit the migrant jail, Delaney Hall, for an oversight visit doesn’t mean she was allowed to do anything she wanted while she was there, they said.
“Imagine, for example, that McIver, while touring Delaney Hall, smuggled in contraband that she surreptitiously slipped to a detainee. Such conduct would violate a number of federal and state statutes, and it would certainly have no legitimate legislative purpose. But under McIver’s theory of immunity, she would be immune from prosecution because it occurred during an otherwise legitimate legislative act,” Monday’s filing says.
The new filing also defends acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a personal lawyer to Trump, from allegations that she told a podcaster she’d use her office to help “turn New Jersey red.” McIver cited those comments in her motions to dismiss, but Monday’s filing says Habba’s comments have been taken out of context.
“She was responding to a question premised on the notion that ‘good governance’ could continue a voting trend that was potentially favorable to Republicans. In response, Ms. Habba essentially agreed that effective law enforcement through the implementation of the Administration’s policies would likely inure to the benefit of Republicans, a notion that makes logical sense. At no point did she advocate for the targeting of Democrats, and she limited her discussion to priorities in law enforcement that were not political in nature,” the filing says.
McIver was never mentioned during the podcast, prosecutors noted.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Arden Barnes)FRANKFORT — State government general revenues will fall $305 million short of hitting budgeted expectations in the fiscal year that began July 1, according to a forecast made Tuesday by the group of economists charged with making state government revenue forecasts.
During a nearly four-hour meeting at the Capitol Annex, the Consensus Forecasting Group agreed on a new projection. The adjustment reduces by about 2% projected annual revenue of more than $15 billion in the state’s 2025-26 budget.
Kentucky’s budget situation is such that a $305 million shortfall presents no cause for alarming spending cuts. (The state’s so-called “rainy day” fund which exists to cover revenue downturns, is expected to have a balance of about $3.7 billion at the end of this fiscal year.) 
Bruce Johnson, chairman of the Consensus Forecasting Group and a professor of economics emeritus at Centre College, said after yesterday’s meeting that the new downward revision “is not going to change the course of Kentucky state government. … As for any adjustments that have to be made, I’ll leave that to the elected officials to comment on.”
Gov. Andy Beshear’s office did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the new forecast.
KY’s Democratic governor warns of possible state revenue shortfall. GOP speaker is skeptical.

It was Beshear who asked for the revised forecast two weeks ago when he warned of a possible shortfall. At the time Beshear said he was concerned that “uncertainty surrounding federal tariffs” would affect the economy and state revenues. He also cited the General Assembly’s decision early this year to cut the state income tax rate from 4% to 3.5% effective Jan. 1, 2026.
That was the latest in a series of half-percentage point income tax rate cuts lawmakers have approved since 2022.
Officials of Beshear’s budget office told the forecasting group they were concerned that revenues from the sales and income taxes fell far below expectations last fiscal year. A year-end shortage was avoided only because of a windfall in one-time revenue from major business taxes.  
Members of the nine-member forecast group agreed the trend justified a downward revision for revenue and discussed three scenarios, one pessimistic, one optimistic and an in-between “control” scenario that projected the $305 million shortfall.
“At this stage we felt justified going with the control forecast,” Johnson said. Johnson and other members said the lagging sales and income tax receipts in the last fiscal year as well as uncertainty over trade and tariffs were reasons for the downward revision.
“But it’s important to remember that we’ll be coming back in December to revise the forecast again. … We’ll have several more months of actual receipts in hand by then. We’ll have more clarity then,” Johnson said.
At its December meeting, the group will not only revisit the current year estimate, but also project revenue for the 2026-28 budget to be considered by the 2026 General Assembly.
The state’s General Fund collects money from most revenue sources (sales and income taxes, business taxes, property taxes, the lottery, etc.) and that money is appropriated for most state programs such as education, public health, public safety, the courts, the legislature and most major state programs.
The other major state fund is the Road Fund, which collects revenue from the gasoline tax, the sales tax on vehicles, drivers’ and vehicle licenses, and other transportation taxes to pay for road construction and maintenance and other transportation programs.
Also on Tuesday, the forecasting group lowered its forecast for Road Fund revenue for this fiscal year by $82 million — from $1,894 billion to $1,812 billion.

“At this time, there is no evidence to suggest the individual was physically attacked before his death,” Bolivar County Coroner Randolph “Rudy” Seals Jr. said in a statement Monday.
Reed, 21, was from Grenada, Mississippi, and was Black. Mississippi has a history of lynchings of Black people, and speculation has been rampant on social media that Reed had broken bones or was a victim of an attack.
Reed’s body is being sent to the Mississippi State Crime Lab for an autopsy, Seals said. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, the Bolivar County Sheriff’s Department and the Cleveland Police Department are working with campus police in the death investigation. 
Delta State University said in a statement Tuesday that hundreds of people took part in a prayer vigil Monday night to honor Reed’s life.

The university’s president, Dan Ennis, said in a video statement Tuesday that school officials remain in contact with Reed’s family.
“We give them our love and support, and we know that we can never fully heal this wound,” Ennis said. “None of us will fully heal, but we have to go on.”
Ennis also said school officials and Reed’s family are keeping track of the investigation.
“As you might imagine, we can only release information that’s appropriate, and we will never release any information or make any statement that compromises the ability of authorities to get to an answer that is true, that is real, and that, if not satisfying, at least helps us understand a little bit better what occurred,” Ennis said.

At Northern Counties Health Care (NCHC), they know that recovery—whether from mental health challenges, substance use, or both—can feel overwhelming. Sometimes what makes the difference is connection to someone who’s walked a similar road and understands. 
That’s where Peer Support Workers come in.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  There’s nothing like talk[...]","Walking Beside You, Not Ahead of You
NCHC’s Peer Support Workers have lived through their own struggles and are trained to walk alongside you through life’s toughest moments.
Meet Neil Goerz, Peer Support Worker at NCHC’s Danville Health Center.
“I had a struggling client walk in once in full withdrawal mode. They were desperate to stop using and were scared and frustrated. I shared a little about my own past struggles and how I overcame them. Right away, they relaxed—they realized I truly understood what they were going through,” says Neil.
That connection made all the difference. With Neil’s ongoing support, the patient stayed engaged in their recovery, secured a steady job, and recently bought their first truck.
What Peer Support Is—and Why It Matters
Peer support is built on mutual understanding. It connects people who’ve experienced mental health or substance use challenges with others facing similar struggles. NCHC Peer Support Workers have lived experience navigating the system themselves and know how overwhelming it can be to do alone.  That shared experience creates trust, hope, and encouragement.
Peer Support Workers:

Have lived experience with recovery.
Offer non-judgmental, strengths-based support.
Provide encouragement, practical strategies, and resources that make a difference.
Walk with you on your recovery journey—without pressure, requirements, or stigma.

At NCHC, Peer Support Workers are also Community Health Workers. This means they know the area’s assets, and are able to coordinate the right resources, at the right time for the situation, and for the patient.  This includes connecting patients to resources for things like transportation, food, intimate partner violence support, housing, and employment.
Peer support does not replace clinical care. Instead, it enhances it by breaking down barriers of stigma and fear, making it easier to take the next step toward healing. 
“I’m a regular person reaching out with support and honesty to regular people who sometimes are too proud or embarrassed to ask for help,” says Neil.
The Benefits of Peer Support
Decades of experience—and growing research—show that peer support helps people stay engaged in recovery and lowers relapse risk. Patients who connect with peer support often experience:

Better quality of life and self-management.
Stronger engagement with health services.
Fewer hospitalizations and ER visits.
Greater use of supportive, outpatient services like primary care.


As Dr. Emily Oleson, Family Physician at Danville Health Center, explains:
“Neil has been invaluable in supporting our most vulnerable patients. He makes it easier for patients to connect with care—and he makes my job easier, too.”
Kathryn Burnell, Family Nurse Practitioner, adds:
“Neil is an amazing asset. He’s generous with his time, always available to listen, and provides seamless support in the office—even during a crisis.”
Expanding Access in the Northeast Kingdom
For nearly 20 years, NCHC has led the way in integrating behavioral health into primary care.  With clinics across the Northeast Kingdom—and new funding from HRSA—NCHC has added Peer Support Workers at multiple sites, including walk-in Express Care locations in Newport and St. Johnsbury. 
This means more patients have easier, more immediate access to high-quality and specialized support—right where they already receive care.
Speaking about Express Care Peer Support Worker, Rachel Cutler; Abby Provost, Family Nurse Practitioner reflects:
“Yesterday at Express Care, Rachel worked with a patient with significant mental health needs who often uses the ER. She coordinated with his case worker, arranged transport to Front Porch, and spent two hours ensuring appropriate care—preventing an unnecessary ER visit. This was her first case in the new role, and she effectively used resources to provide quality care.”
As for the patient Neil spoke about at the beginning, he added, “I am very proud of them, this story, and hope they can continue to face the world head on.”
Ready When You Are
Recovery is a journey. Whether you’re just beginning, rebuilding, or working to stay on track, NCHC’s Peer Support Workers are here for you. No judgment. No stigma. Just real people offering real support—close to home.
Ask your provider about meeting with a Peer Support Worker at your local clinic in Concord, Danville, Hardwick, Island Pond, or St. Johnsbury.

(Photo by Susan J. DemasTariffs lodged by President Donald Trump would have an outsized impact on Michigan’s economic standing, particularly its manufacturing and automotive sectors, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said in an economic speech Tuesday.
“Michigan understands the negative consequences of unfettered trade with other countries that don’t play fair,” Whitmer said. “Decades of offshoring and outsourcing shipped hundreds of thousands of good-paying, middle-class jobs overseas and shuttered hundreds of factories. The ripple effects were devastating. Fewer people, empty main streets, crumbling roads, and shrinking schools.”
The speech, delivered at Michigan’s Heritage Hall in Lansing, had two goals: addressing the state’s budget impasse and detailing the damage Trump’s tariffs would continue to have on the state.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXAlthough Whitmer acknowledged that the state had little control over the import taxes, she said it was irresponsible for the federal government to “capriciously swing the tariff hammer at every problem.”
“I hear this from employers in Michigan and in every meeting on the investment mission to Japan and Germany,” Whitmer said. “Companies that have invested in Michigan for decades brought up uncertainty caused by our national tariff policy. They want to invest in Michigan, but tariffs are keeping them on the sidelines. Uncertainty breeds paralysis. And paralysis costs jobs.”
Whitmer’s address came following a weeklong stint in Japan on a venture to secure job deals. The Democrat has made trips like this since she started her second term in 2023.
The governor said no industry is more at risk from tariffs than automakers and suppliers, with 1.2 million Michiganders employed in the automotive supply chain. That equates to one in five Michigan jobs. 
Whitmer toughens budget talk against Michigan Republicans with shutdown looming

“Canada and Mexico are our biggest auto trading partners, with car parts crossing both borders an average of eight times,” she said. “But now, additional 25% tariffs have been slapped on foreign-made auto parts, including those from Canada and Mexico. Even higher tariffs on steel and aluminum, two materials crucial for building cars, exacerbate the problem. ”
Uncertainty, Whitmer said, has been crippling manufacturing from making investments. It was in that vein that Whitmer also hinted at new policies for job creation in Michigan, noting that the state needs new tools to leverage its workforce in manufacturing to compete with other states and nations.
The governor outlined three goals toward that aim: make it easier to build factories in Michigan, create and retain jobs to run them, and make it easier to incentivize innovation.
A key tool Michigan has tried in the last few years was in the form of economic and monetary incentives for companies, which have mixed results, especially in the face of Trump’s tariffs.
Whitmer seemingly acknowledged the difficulty of using incentives or other proverbial carrots to spur innovation and business growth on Tuesday.
“No tool is perfect, but we have to do something to deliver more wins for Michigan, because competition is fierce,” she said.

State Ports Authority) MOUNT PLEASANT — The Port of Charleston last month recorded its third-highest cargo levels ever for an August, relying on a rush of pre-tariff imports that have boosted the S.C. State Ports Authority’s finances this fiscal year.
The authority said 230,150 cargo containers measured in 20-foot equivalents moved through the port’s terminals in August. That is a 15.6% increase from a year ago and a rebound from last month’s cargo declines, according to data released at Tuesday’s board meeting.
Nearly half of last month’s boxes were filled with imported consumer goods and manufacturing supplies bound for points throughout South Carolina and the region.
The rest included exports and empty containers being moved between ports in the U.S., Asia and other regions.
“Even among broader trade concerns, SC Ports remains a reliable and efficient port,” Phil Padgett, the authority’s president and CEO, said in a statement.
Last month’s import total was the highest since March and represents an 11.7% year-over-year increase.
It’s similar to the numbers ports nationwide have seen this summer as shippers moved extra cargo before President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariffs took hold.
Trump announced reciprocal tariffs against dozens of countries on April 2, but the duties have been paused and revised numerous times before resuming Aug. 7 on U.S.-bound cargo leaving from most foreign ports.
The import rush has helped to strengthen the authority’s bottom line, with containerized cargo accounting for about 70% of the agency’s receipts. Revenues through the first two months of this fiscal year, which started July 1, are 10.5% ahead of budget plans.
In addition to the money from more cargo, the authority has benefited from storage fees charged to shippers who expedited goods ahead of the tariffs but left them at the port’s terminals rather than moving them to overcrowded warehouses.

Those good times could soon be coming to an end, however.
Byron Miller, the authority’s chief commercial officer, said retailers have told the agency they shipped early to avoid higher tariffs and have plenty of stock on hand.
“They are expecting, effectively, no peak toward the end of this year,” Miller said.
That forecast is shared by analysts with the National Retail Federation, which reports the “near-record peak of imports this summer is expected to steadily decline for the remainder of the year,” according to a new release.
“Retailers have stocked up as much as they can ahead of tariff increases, but the uncertainty of U.S. trade policy is making it impossible to make the long-term plan that are critical to future business success,” Jonathan Gold, the federation’s vice president for supply chain and customs policy, said in a written statement. “These tariffs and disruptions to the supply chain are adding costs that will ultimately lead to higher prices for American consumers.”
The retail group said it expects imports nationwide will decline by 6.8% year-over-year in September and 20.1% for the full year.
“The trade outlook for the final months of the year is not optimistic,” Ben Hackett, founder of maritime analyst Hackett Associates, said in a statement.
Depending on how tariffs play out, Charleston’s port could see cargo levels land somewhere between an 8% loss and a 6% gain by the time the current fiscal year ends next June, according to an analysis by Joey Von Nessen, a research economist at the University of South Carolina.

In May 2025, Lopez Lopez pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of possession of a fictitious license. In June 2025, he was sentenced to 180 days in the Woodbury County Jail, with all but 170 days of that sentence suspended. He was also placed on probation for one year and fined $430.
A few weeks later, a warrant was issued for his arrest, alleging he had violated the terms of his probation by failing to contact the Iowa Department of Corrections. Days later, with Lopez Lopez in the county jail, prosecutors filed a motion to dismiss the probation-violation charge.
In the meantime, however, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement had arrested Lopez Lopez, placing him in what’s called “immigration custody.”
According to the lawsuit recently filed by his attorneys, Lopez Lopez then requested a bond hearing in front of an immigration judge. The judge rejected the request, citing a lack of jurisdiction based upon her agreement with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s latest interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act.
The lawsuit argues that the judge’s decision amounts to “an unconstitutional denial of Mr. Lopez Lopez’s liberty,” and to “unlawful detention.”
Lawsuit: Man has lived in Iowa for almost 13 years
In the petition filed in Lopez Lopez’s behalf, attorney Christopher Roth argues the courts have ruled that the Fifth Amendment — which shields people from being deprived of their liberty without due process — protects everyone in the United States, including noncitizens facing deportation proceedings.
Roth also argues that immigration court records show Lopez Lopez is neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community, but that without a bond hearing he cannot make that argument and seek release on bond while the immigration case is pending.
“Mr. Lopez Lopez is a longtime Iowa resident with deep family and community ties, no serious criminal history, and clear eligibility for custody review,” Roth argues in asking that a federal judge assume jurisdiction over the matter.
The lawsuit seeks a preliminary injunction and temporary restraining order that either calls for the immediate release of Lopez Lopez while his immigration case is pending or directs the U.S. Department of Justice, ICE and Homeland Security to approve a bond hearing in the matter.
Such an injunction, Roth claims, is “in the public interest because it will prevent these agencies from repeating such unlawful actions in the future” and will protect the due process rights of thousands of immigrants.
According to the lawsuit, Lopez Lopez has now been detained for more than a month and a half —  “separated from his sick mother, partner, and child” — while in jail and with no opportunity to argue for his release on bond.
Roth said Tuesday that for years, the usual practice in cases of individuals accused of entering the country illegally had been to at least grant them a hearing on a request for bond. Now, he said, the practice is to deny any request for a bond hearing.
As a result, Roth said, people are being held in jails, without the opportunity to argue for release, for “anywhere from a few weeks to few months and sometimes longer.”
The lawsuit alleges that Lopez Lopez has lived in Iowa for nearly 13 years and poses no danger to the public. A check of Iowa court records indicates the most serious charge he has faced in state court has been the 2024 identity theft offense.
Named as defendants in the lawsuit are Woodbury County Sheriff Chad Sheehan; Peter Berg, the director of ICE’s St. Paul field office; Todd Lyons, acting director of ICE; Kristi Noem, the head of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security; U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi, and President Donald Trump.
The defendants in the case have yet to file a response to the lawsuit.

This year’s YIMBYtown conference in New Haven was organized by Desegregate Connecticut, which advocated for House Bill 5002, the measure vetoed this summer by Connecticut’s Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont. He was not invited to the conference, which began Sunday and ended on Tuesday.
The conference’s name stands for “Yes In My Back Yard,” a counter to the “Not in My Back Yard” argument against development of more apartments largely in single-family home neighborhoods.
Connecticut lawmakers spoke on a Monday panel, following a keynote speech from Republican Gov. Kelly Armstrong, of North Dakota, and other speakers focused on legislative wins for the movement in the red states of Texas, Arkansas and Florida.
“Permitting reform is good because you can build stuff faster, and you can build it better, and you can do it quicker, and you can allow communities to adapt to whatever’s happening on the stage,” Armstrong said during his keynote speech Monday.
North Dakota saw a population increase and the need to build more housing in the wake of an oil industry boom in the early 2000s. The state has legalized tiny homes and accessory dwelling units, manufactured housing and put state money toward building more affordable housing, among other initiatives.
The conference comes just months after Lamont vetoed H.B. 5002, a sweeping bill that aimed to improve the affordability and accessibility of housing. The bill tackled issues including zoning, transit-oriented development, parking, homelessness and fair rent commissions.
Town officials and some residents objected to measures in the bill that required municipalities to plan and zone for a set number of units of affordable housing and the removal of minimum off-street parking mandates for smaller apartment buildings.
Lamont said he wanted to get towns on board with housing legislation when he vetoed the measure. He said he’d call a special session to pass a new bill, but that date hasn’t been set.
Organizers with Desegregate Connecticut asked the close to 1,000 people registered for YIMBYtown to film videos encouraging Lamont, whose name drew boos from the crowd, to call a special session.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff said during a panel that other states “are eating our lunches on housing.”
“They are moving exponentially on housing, and anything that we are doing compared to that is modest,” Duff said. “If we tried to do what Texas or Florida has done, I mean, we would be running out of the building.”
Earlier this year, the Florida legislature passed its “Live Local Act,” that increases housing opportunities, including by allowing more building of smaller apartments and establishing a tax credit program for housing construction. 
In its last legislative session, the Texas legislature passed seven bills on a range of housing and zoning topics on minimum lot sizes for housing, allowing conversion of commercial and office space to residential and allowing more unrelated people to live in the same home.
A measure to require towns to allow the conversion of commercial space to residential was in the vetoed Connecticut bill.
Red states have largely passed their zoning and housing legislation with Republican support based on the idea that landowners should have the right to do what they want with their land, speakers said.
In Connecticut, lawmakers said Lamont was under public pressure to veto the bill from outside groups and some constituents from Fairfield County.
“It’s not the entire county, and I don’t want to blame an entire county for it, when it really is a small subset of people who have a very narrow worldview of what their community should look like,” said Planning and Development co-chair Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, D-Avon. “However, we are politicians. And so is the governor, and it is very difficult when you are a political person to be hearing from the people in your backyard in volume.”
Lamont’s spokesman has said that the governor wasn’t responding to political pressure but to the voices of residents and whether local leaders would be able to achieve the goals of the bill.
The lawmakers offered few details on what the details of a new bill will be, but said they want to see a strong measure.
“I think he [Lamont] feels very strongly that he can bring some of these chief elected officials along,” said House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford. “We will see if that’s true. And even if it isn’t, I still think we can arrive at something that is going to move an agenda forward.”
Duff said one of the good things to come about from the veto was that people across the state are talking more about housing policy.
“I don’t know if everybody would have come back to the table again had there not been that kind of — what’s the word I’m looking for?” Duff asked, pausing.
“Outrage, pushback, outcry,” members of the audience offered.
“Reaction,” Duff finished.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/YIMBYTOWN-0915-DE-Cannon-183-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-16 16:57:58.932429

Free.,US Senate Dems push GOP for extension of expiring health care subsidies,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-dems-push-gop-extension-expiring-health-care-subsidies,,"WASHINGTON — A trio of Senate Democrats urged Republican lawmakers at a Tuesday press conference to extend and make permanent the enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, along with Sens. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, warned that the expiration of these credits would lead to “skyrocketing” costs for millions of enrollees unless the GOP-controlled Congress takes action. The credits are used by people who buy their own health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.Stopgap spending billThe extension is among congressional Democrats’ broader health care demands in order to back any stopgap funding bill to avert a government shutdown before the next fiscal year begins Oct. 1. House GOP leadership did not negotiate with Democrats on the seven-week stopgap funding bill released on Tuesday.Schumer, alongside House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, said in a joint statement Tuesday that “the House Republican-only spending bill fails to meet the needs of the American people and does nothing to stop the looming healthcare crisis.” They added that “at a time when families are already being squeezed by higher costs, Republicans refuse to stop Americans from facing double-digit hikes in their health insurance premiums.” At the press conference, Baldwin called for legislation she and Shaheen introduced earlier this year that would make the enhanced premium tax credits permanent to be included in the stopgap government funding bill. “Time is of the essence — families and businesses are planning for next year, and we need to get this done,” Baldwin said. “The only question is whether Republicans will join us and stand for lower costs for families or not.” Shaheen said that “as we near the deadline for government funding, I hope that our colleagues here in Congress will join us, that they will act to extend these tax credits and to keep health insurance affordable for millions of Americans.” Premiums expected to soar without actionThe enhanced premium tax credits, established by Democrats in 2021 as part of a massive COVID-19 relief package, were extended in 2022 through the Inflation Reduction Act. They are set to expire at the end of 2025.Premiums, on average, for enrollees would soar by more than 75% if the credits expire, according to the nonpartisan health research organization KFF. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said Tuesday at a press conference that “Republicans have concerns” about the credits because they have no income cap and certain high-income people can qualify for them. He also said Congress has until the end of the year to decide what to do.At the Democrats’ press conference, Schumer said President Donald Trump “has taken a meat ax to our health care system,” adding that “it’s vicious, it’s cruel, it’s mean” and pointing to some of the repercussions of the GOP’s mega tax and spending cut law on Medicaid recipients. Meanwhile, open enrollment begins in November, meaning Congress would have to act before the end of the calendar year to avoid premium spikes.",,,,2025-09-16 16:57:58.932429

The Florida Board of Pharmacy announced this week that it will have a discussion on 2025-26 Covid-19 vaccine administration as well as a rule allowing for “additional immunizations or vaccines.” 
The board’s actions comes after Gov. Ron DeSantis and state Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced a push to eliminate all vaccine mandates, including those required of school-aged children. Some of that push requires legislative approval but some of the mandates can be eliminated through the rule process.
The pharmacy board is scheduled to will meet virtually on Sept. 23 at 10:30 a.m. to discuss the rules. A link to the meeting is here.
The board is administratively housed in the Department of Health, which Ladapo runs.
Four of the board members’ terms have expired, although they continue to serve on the panel — Miami pharmacists Dorinda Segovia and Cristina Medina, St. Johns County pharmacist Jeenu Philip, and Tallahassee pharmacist Patty Ghazvini.
Board Chairman and Tallahassee pharmacist Jonathan Hickman, consumer member Ryan West of Tallahassee, and attorney and pharmacist Jeffrey J. Mesaros, of Orlando, serve terms that expire Oct. 31.

Unlike other medical boards whose members made political contributions to DeSantis or other Republicans, for the most part Board of Pharmacy members haven’t contributed heavily to politicians or political committees. Chair Hickman gave $1,000 to DeSantis’s re-election efforts in 2022 but he’s the only member to have done so, a Florida Phoenix review of campaign databases shows. Other members gave an occasional campaign contribution to political action committees, but nothing to the governor or Republican Party of Florida.
Pharmacists in Florida working under supervising physicians are authorized to administer Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-approved immunizations or vaccines for adults. They can also administer vaccines that have been approved for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or those approved by the Florida Board of Pharmacy in response to an emergency declaration issued by the governor. 
Pharmacists in Florida can also administer flu shots to children aged seven or older if they work under the established protocol of a physician.
DeSantis administration pushes to eliminate all vaccine mandates in Florida

Moreover, the Board of Pharmacy Rule 64B16-27.650 allows certain pharmacists to administer Covid-19 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines. RSV is a virus that infects the lungs and the respiratory tract and can cause difficulties with breathing.
The Board of Medicine — which regulates physicians — is slated to meet Sept. 26 in St. Augustine. At press time, there was nothing related to vaccines on the board’s agenda but there is time allotted for “new business.”
The DeSantis administration made national headlines earlier this month when Ladapo said he’d like to eliminate all vaccine mandates from Florida statutes and rules, a move that could affect schoolchildren but also college students and even nursing home residents.
Ladapo said at the time that mandates drip “with disdain and slavery.” 
The DOH subsequently announced that it was updating its immunization requirements and forms for childcare and school admission, plus opt-out provisions.
The Florida Chapter of the American College of Physicians (FCACP) and the Florida Academy of Family Physicians (FAFP) have asked the DOH to hold a meeting on its proposed new rules but the department hasn’t announced in the Florida Administrative Register whether it intends to do so. Ladapo has the authority to deem the meeting unnecessary.

(Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current)President Donald Trump’s opposition to offshore wind crystallized long before he won re-election. But the justification for the administration’s abrupt halt to the Revolution Wind project on Aug. 22 has remained murky. 
Until now.
New court filings from the U.S. Department of Justice reveal the rationale behind the U.S. Department of Interior’s (DOI) decision to shut down the 65-turbine project that was already 80% finished: Developers allegedly failed to turn in required plans on how the project off Rhode Island’s coastline would affect national ocean research and defense work.
“As of the date of this Declaration, still DOI not received any information that these requirements have been satisfied and given how long they remain pending, the department has concerns as to whether they will ever be met,” Adam Suess, acting assistant secretary for land and minerals management for the interior department, wrote in a Sept. 12 affidavit. 


Gov. Dan McKee enlightens Burgum in texts
As Ørsted and the attorneys general in Rhode Island and Connecticut look to federal judges for relief, Gov. Dan McKee is taking a different tack to restart Revolution Wind: negotiation with the Trump administration.
“My job is to create a political resolution,” McKee said in an interview Tuesday. “In the end, I believe political resolution is going to be the fastest path.”
McKee has not heard back on his Sept. 3 letter to Burgum asking for a face-to-face with Trump. But the governor and Interior Secretary exchanged text messages last week, with the latter thanking McKee for the information he provided on the project status.
“Secretary Burgum was not even aware that we had a transmission line that traveled down the bed of the ocean to Quonset that is 90% complete,” McKee said Tuesday. “I don’t think they fully understand the consequences of what they are doing here.”
While he has not talked to Trump directly, McKee said, “I am sure this is getting back to the president.”


Suess’ written testimony counters the criticism from state officials and project developers accusing the Trump administration of arbitrary and unlawful abuses of power in a pair of federal lawsuits filed Sept. 4.
Ørsted and Skyborn Renewables, co-developers of the $5 billion wind project, filed their lawsuit against Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and other federal agencies and directors in D.C., while attorneys general in Rhode Island and Connecticut took their legal challenge to Rhode Island federal court. The two southern New England states were under contracts to buy electricity from the 704-megawatt project starting next year. Now in limbo, thousands of labor jobs are on the line, along with both states’ abilities to meet their climate change mandates and the reliability of the regional electric grid. 
The administration has yet to respond to the AGs’ lawsuit. But in documents submitted in the D.C. lawsuit filed by project developers, federal officials claimed Revolution Wind developers failed to submit required information about how the project might affect national security and scientific surveys.
The yearslong, expansive federal review process for permitting new offshore wind projects typically requires developers to satisfy all mandates around construction, operations, environmental and economic operations before receiving final approval. But federal agencies allowed Revolution Wind developers to turn in a few details late.
The project received final federal approval in November 2023, with construction beginning shortly after. However, a May 2024 letter from the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management’s (BOEM) Office of Renewable Energy Programs authorized an extension until July 2025 for Ørsted to submit a plan for how it would minimize interference with federal marine fisheries surveys.
A separate agreement signed in the fall of 2024 between the Department of Defense and project developers outlines the need to “deconflict the project with national defense interests.” Project developers agreed to coordinate work with at-sea defense contractors, acknowledging potential interference from fiber optic and acoustic monitoring equipment and “risk related to foreign investment.” However, no additional documentation had to be turned in to the Defense Department unless the layout or structures of the project changed, according to the agreement. 
Suess suggests the administration is awaiting information, though.
“To date the department of interior has not received any information that any of these national security concerns referenced in this paragraph have been addressed by Revolution Wind,” he wrote.
Meaghan Wims, a spokesperson for Ørsted, declined to provide additional comment Tuesday. However, Ørsted executives in prior court filings painted a different picture of communication with federal agencies.
Since receiving federal approval in 2023, the developers have maintained an “ordinary course” of coordination and cooperation with a string of federal agencies, Melanie Gearon, head of northeast permitting for Ørsted North America, wrote in a Sept. 5 court affidavit. 
That included twice-monthly meetings with the BOEM and the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement to discuss construction updates, reports and efforts to reduce local harms. The groups met most recently on Aug. 20, Gearon wrote. 
“Despite the fact that this latter meeting was held only two days before BOEM’s Director issued the Stop Work Order, at neither of these meetings — nor at any other recent Project meetings or in correspondence — did BOEM raise the possibility of a Stop Work Order or the need for any disruption of or conditions in the Project’s ongoing construction relating to any concerns regarding national security or interference with reasonable uses of the exclusive economic zone, the high seas, and the territorial seas, or for any other reason,” Gearon wrote. 
Revolution Wind is number 11 on this National Renewable Energy Laboratory map of North Atlantic offshore wind projects in the production pipeline as of August 2024. (Offshore Wind Market Report: 2024 Edition. National Renewable Energy Laboratory.)
No objections five years ago
Amanda Barker, Rhode Island state committee lead for New England for Offshore Wind, echoed Gearon’s defense, calling the stop work order “illegitimate” in an emailed response Tuesday.
Barker pointed to the years of rigorous federal review, which included signoff from the agencies now questioning the project. The Pentagon voiced no objections to the location for the project when it was consulted in 2020 during Trump’s first term in office, Barker noted.
“From a big-picture perspective, this stop-work order sends a troubling signal to the offshore wind industry: if developers can invest years of work and resources to secure full federal approval, only to have the plug pulled afterward, it raises questions about the certainty needed to move projects forward,” Barker said.

Indeed, Ørsted has forecast major financial losses if the project is not completed on time, especially if utility companies that agreed to buy power from the wind turbines pull out of their contracts. A 2018 agreement between developers and Rhode Island’s primary utility supplier — then under the ownership of National Grid — offers an out if the project is not up and running by Jan. 15, 2027.
If construction work does not pick back up by the last week in September, the project might not be completed by the January 2027 deadline, Paul Murphy, senior engineering, procurement and construction director for Revolution Wind, wrote in a Sept. 5 affidavit.
“Revolution Wind currently has no mechanism for extending those deadlines, and the [agreements] would be subject to termination, significantly threatening the financial viability of the entire Project and posing an existential risk to the Project, and thus to Revolution Wind,” Murphy wrote.
Caroline Pretyman, a spokesperson for Rhode Island Energy, whose parent company PPL Corp. bought the state utilities from National Grid in 2022, confirmed the company is not presently contemplating ending its purchase agreement with the developers. However, Pretyman did not rule out the possibility in the future.
“This is a very fluid situation that we are watching very closely and do not have a date in mind — instead, we hope that there can be a solution reached in the near term,” Pretyman said in an email Tuesday.
In the meantime, project developers estimate they are losing more than $2 million per day, roughly $16 million per week, on installation and manufacturing contracts with specialty vessels needed to transport and construct the towering turbines, according to Murphy’s affidavit. 
Take, for instance, the 3,000-ton White Marlin — specifically designed to lift the top of the offshore substation onto its support frame— and only under contract for the project until Dec. 15. There is no other substitute vessel or barge for storage, Murphy wrote. “Thus, the lack of contracted vessels, particularly when coupled with worsening weather conditions offshore during the winter, presents a significant risk to the Project.”
Elizabeth Peace, a Department of Interior spokesperson, declined to offer further comment Tuesday, citing the pending lawsuits.

How university heads in other neighboring states stack up

University of Alabama System Chancellor Sid Trant takes home $884,716 after a 36% increase from his pay as interim chancellor approved in the spring, according to AL.com.
Peter Hans, University of North Carolina System president, also got a big raise this year, according to the News & Observer, going from about $455,000 to $600,000 on June 1.
Ray Rodrigues, Chancellor of the State University System of Florida, has a salary of $441,252, while Michael Amiridis of the University of South Carolina system makes $352,184, according to state data.
Randy Boyd, University of Tennessee System president, who is independently wealthy, takes no salary but reportedly accepts a $10,000 stipend to cover health insurance costs.




In a statement after the vote, Board of Regents Chairman T. Dallas Smith likened the raise to merit and market-based pay increases available to other university system employees.
“As chairman, I know the Board of Regents takes seriously its responsibility to serve students, campuses and the public while ensuring careful stewardship of state resources,” he said. “While today’s decision applies specifically to the chancellor, USG has also worked with institutions to provide limited merit increases and market-based adjustments for eligible employees. This reflects USG’s ongoing commitment to responsibly rewarding and retaining the leaders, faculty and staff who make the system one of the nation’s best.”
Perdue, 78, was appointed by Gov. Brian Kemp in 2022. Between the fall semesters of 2022 and 2024, the system touted a 9% enrollment increase to nearly 365,000 students. The system also boasts that it contributed $23.1 billion to the state’s economy during the last school year, up more than 5% from the year before, and that University System of Georgia graduates earn about $1.4 million more over a lifetime than they would without a bachelor’s degree.
Perdue’s time in office has also seen controversy.
His lack of an academic background led some to call his appointment a political move, and questions about political interference in higher education have followed him. This year, Perdue raised the hackles of some students and faculty by expressing skepticism toward online classes despite a USG study that did not show much difference in academic outcomes between online and face-to-face classes, and by mandating employees return to full-time in-person work.
A requirement for professors to publish their syllabi online, which passed in May and began rolling out with the start of the new semester, has also raised cries of political interference, with opponents arguing the policy allows activists to harass and dox professors over ideological differences.
According to data compiled by the Georgia Department of Audits and Accounts, Perdue’s salary in fiscal year 2024 was $531,900, which made him one the top-earning state employees in Georgia.

“I’m a conservative at heart. I believe in fiscal accountability and that there is no greater responsibility than making sure Colorado is a safe and affordable place to raise our families,” the 55-year-old Republican said in a video posted to his campaign website.
There has not been a Republican elected to statewide office since 2016.

The state treasury essentially functions as Colorado’s bank for public funds and manages the state’s investment portfolios, debt and unclaimed property fund. Treasurers can also help guide the state’s economic policy in the Legislature.
Grantham became a state senator in 2010 and served as Senate president from 2017 to 2018. While in the Legislature, he was on the bipartisan Joint Budget Committee, which crafts the state budget each year. He is in his second term as a Fremont County commissioner.
In a statement, Grantham criticized the growth of the treasury department, noting that the number of employees has doubled under current Treasurer Dave Young, a Democrat.
“Thanks to the last seven years of reckless spending and not enough concern for the hardworking taxpayers of this state, Colorado has become increasingly unaffordable for too many. Since 2019, the staff in the Treasurer’s office has doubled while the population has only grown by 3% — something is wrong with that picture,” Grantham said.
He is against use of the approximately $1.8 billion in the Unclaimed Property Fund to pay for legislation, a strategy that some lawmakers have tried in recent years in an increasingly tight budget scenario. A successful bill this year, for example, directs the state to borrow interest from the fund’s investments to make sure safety net health care providers get paid. A bill from a recent special legislative session originally would have used the fund to soften health insurance premium increases, but the funding mechanism was amended to rely on tax credit sales instead.
“I will work tirelessly to make sure we return taxpayer’s unclaimed property faster than the Legislature can spend it,” Grantham said.
The treasurer’s office returned about $62 million to 73,900 people during the 2024 fiscal year, according to the office’s most recent budget request document.
Grantham has not yet filed his candidate paperwork with the secretary of state. Sen. Jeff Bridges, Rep. Brianna Titone, Jefferson County Treasurer Jerry DiTullio and John Mikos, all Democrats, are also in the race.

Robinson has been charged with multiple crimes, including one count of aggravated murder, which is a capital felony. If convicted, Robinson could face the death penalty — a sentence that Gray said he plans to pursue. 
“I do not take this decision lightly, and it is a decision I have made independently as county attorney based solely on the available evidence and circumstances and nature of the crime,” Gray said.

The survey of 1,000 likely 2026 voters commissioned by Conservatives for Clean Energy Florida shows that 78% support clean energy initiatives, including 63% of Republicans.
Two-thirds of voters overall in the poll (67%) would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supports growth of solar power in Florida. The survey also shows a shift toward support for nuclear power. When described “as something that Trump and large corporations support,” 62% of voters support increasing nuclear energy production.
“Pocketbook issues are clearly the number one issue of concern going into the 2026 election cycle, and connecting the dots here it’s very easy to see that Florida voters across the political spectrum understand that diversifying our portfolio and taking an ‘all of the above approach’ is going to be key to actually bringing their costs down,” said Zachary Colletti, executive director of Conservatives for Clean Energy. “That’s the most important story here.”
Solar power provides only 8% of the state’s electricity portfolio now, but that’s expected to increase over the next decade. The amount of solar power that will fuel the state will rise to 28% by 2032, according to a report published earlier this year by the Florida Public Service Commission.
The solar industry in Florida and across the country suffered a huge blow this summer following passage of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” which removes a 30% tax break for individuals who buy rooftop solar panels, effective at the end of this year.
“Solar power has been getting a bad rap as of late, mostly because the public does not want to see green space turned into solar farms — which is totally understandable,” said Jake Hoffman, president of the Tampa Bay Young Republicans, in an email message.
“However, solar farms are not the only solar solution. If we want to be serious about filling the immediate need for energy independence, our government should be accelerating all forms of energy and solar energy with battery storage in locations that make sense as a major part of that equation.”
The survey shows that nearly three quarters of Republicans and two-thirds of NPA voters support nuclear power, while Democrats are split on the issue. Nuclear power supplied about 11% of Florida’s energy portfolio in 2024, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Florida Power & Light operates the only two functioning nuclear power plants in the state — at St. Lucie and Turkey Point. A third nuclear plant at Crystal River was shut down in 2013 by Duke Energy
Politics
Byron Donalds, the Naples Republican U.S. House member running for governor, is a supporter of nuclear power. He co-sponsored a resolution in 2023 expressing Congress’ commitment to embracing nuclear power as a clean baseload energy source.
Paul Renner, the former Florida House Speaker who recently entered the Republican race for governor, supported energy legislation (HB 1645) in the 2024 legislative session that erased several instances of the words “climate change” from state statutes.
“We are looking at ways — including clean energy ways — to make sure that we are not ever subject to brownouts and blackouts that places like California have suffered and other places are predicted to suffer that are not focusing on a reliable grid,” Renner told reporters in December 2023
“And, unfortunately, that works at cross-purposes with the uber-aggressive timeline that climate activists have put us on where they want us to go tomorrow. And if I had a magic wand and I could say, ‘All energy is clean energy and we will never use fossil fuels again and we can do that tomorrow at no cost,’ I would do it,” Renner continued. “Everybody should want a clean future. But that’s not realistic.”
The Florida Democratic Party’s leading candidate for governor, David Jolly, has said that if elected he would appoint people to the Public Service Commission “to begin to require our utilities to incorporate more clean and renewable energies.”
Nearly 12 million customers of Florida Power & Light Co. faced potentially the largest rate hike in U.S. history as recently as last month. However, days before the Public Service Commission was set to hear arguments in the case, FPL filed a four-year rate settlement agreement that reduced its original revenue request by approximately 30%, according to FPL.
The survey of 1,000 likely 2026 general election voters was conducted by Cygnal, a Virginia market research group, for Conservatives for Clean Energy Florida. The survey took place on Aug. 26 and 27. It has a margin of error of +/- 3.09%.

(Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)Two Arkansas River Valley Republicans announced Monday that they will seek their party’s nomination to succeed Sen. Gary Stubblefield, who died earlier this month.
Mark Berry, a former state representative from Ozark, said in a statement posted on Facebook that Stubblefield left behind “some big shoes to fill.” Berry said his years of state government experience have given him “knowledge, skills, abilities and legislative relationships” that make him “uniquely qualified” to finish Stubblefield’s term, which ends in 2029.
Brad Simon, a Paris businessman, announced Monday that he would run for Stubblefield’s seat instead of for GOP Rep. Jon Eubanks’ House seat as he previously announced.

Berry SD26 campaign announcement 
“I’ll be a listener and a fighter for the people of District 26 if they put their faith and trust in me,” Berry said.
Berry declined to run for reelection to the House last year after serving two terms. He is a veteran of both the U.S. Air Force and the Arkansas Air National Guard. He served as adjutant general of the Arkansas National Guard from 2015 to 2019 and was Secretary of the Military for part of that time.
Senate District 26 includes parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties. Berry is from Franklin County; Simon is from Logan County.
Simon wrote on Facebook: “While no one can truly replace the late Senator Gary Stubblefield’s legacy of service and leadership, I stand ready to carry forward the work with humility and determination by representing our rural conservative values.” 
Stubblefield had been a strong opponent to a 3,000-bed prison that Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders supports building in Franklin County. Simon said in the news release announcing his candidacy that he also opposes the prison plan, which has garnered frustration from both lawmakers and Franklin County residents.
“Crime is a serious problem in Arkansas, and we absolutely need to take decisive action to keep our families safe and hold criminals accountable,” Simon said in the release. “But dumping a billion-dollar mega-prison in the heart of the River Valley isn’t the solution — it’s government overreach that risks our water, environment, and local economy.”

Simon SD26 campaign announcement 
Berry’s campaign announcement did not mention the proposed prison.
Berry and Simon both said their policy priorities include education, the Second Amendment right to bear arms, and cutting taxes. 
Simon said he would also fight to “secure our borders” and “block Chinese influence on our farms,” while Berry said “protecting the unborn” is a priority.
Until Monday, Simon was among five Republicans vying for their party’s nomination to succeed Eubanks, who will leave office in January due to term limits.
Curtis Varnell of Subiaco, Brian Cooper of Booneville and Ted Tritt and Tonya Fletcher, both of Paris, remain in the House District 46 primary. Tritt and Cooper are businessmen, Varnell is a teacher, and Fletcher is a Paris city councilwoman.
No Democrat had announced a bid for Eubanks’ or Stubblefield’s seats as of Tuesday.
Before Sanders can announce the date of the special election to succeed Stubblefield, both the Republican and Democratic parties of Arkansas must inform her office by Sept. 25 whether they plan to hold a primary election or a convention of delegates to choose their candidate.
Stubblefield, a Republican from Branch, died Sept. 2 at the age of 74. He served a dozen years in the Senate after serving four years in the House.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Capitol4-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-16 15:57:06.188762
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-16 19:40:38+00:00,CT Mirror,Expiring federal health subsidies could cost CT $295M to make up,Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/16/ct-enhanced-premium-tax-credits/,"Governors including Ned Lamont are urging congress to extend the subsidies. If they expire, more than 4M people could lose health coverage.","Gov. Ned Lamont and governors from 17 other states are calling on congressional leaders to extend federal subsidies that help more people afford health coverage through state-based insurance exchanges like Access Health CT.
The subsidies, known as enhanced premium tax credits, are set to expire at the end of the year. If they do, states will have to pick up the cost — or individuals will pay significantly more for health coverage.
The governors on Monday wrote to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, raising alarms about the impact of the expiring tax credits and urging congressional leaders to extend them.
Govs. Kathy Hochul of New York, Phil Murphy of New Jersey, Maura Healey of Massachusetts, Dan McKee of Rhode Island, Gavin Newsom of California, Tim Walz of Minnesota, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and others co-signed the letter.
“For millions of hard-working Americans, these subsidies are the only reason health insurance is still within reach in a country where the cost of living keeps going up,” they wrote. “If they expire, premiums will rise by thousands of dollars for many families, millions will lose coverage, and people will be forced to make impossible choices between paying for health care, rent, or groceries.
“Hard-working American families, older Americans not yet on Medicare, small business owners, and rural communities — where marketplace coverage is often the only option — will be hit the hardest. The timing couldn’t be more urgent.”
Nationally, if the subsidies expire at the end of the year, the Congressional Budget Office projects that more than 4 million people would lose health care coverage over the next decade, citing increases in out-of-pocket expenses because of more costly premiums.
The expiration of enhanced tax credits will lead to out-of-pocket premiums for ACA marketplace enrollees increasing by an average of more than 75%, with insurers expecting healthier enrollees to drop coverage, according to a Peterson-KFF analysis. That, in turn, drives up underlying premiums.
Connecticut residents who get insurance through the state health care exchange could pay an average of $1,700 more a year.
State officials would have to spend more than $295 million annually to pick up the costs of the enhanced premium tax credits if Congress fails to extend them, a spokesperson with Access Health CT said.
“Our entire health care system will be undermined by the failure to renew these premium tax credits,” U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal said during a press conference at the state Capitol on Friday. “Health insurance and these premium tax credits are absolutely essential to lowering the cost of health care.”
Blumenthal has co-sponsored federal legislation that would make the enhanced premium tax credits permanent.
Amid the changes in the federal health policy landscape and the expiring tax credits, the Connecticut Insurance Department last week approved double-digit rate increases for state-regulated health plans in 2026.
The department signed off on an average rate hike of 16.8% for individual plans and 11% on small group policies.
The plans collectively cover about 224,000 residents (158,000 in individual policies and 66,000 in small group). Insurance department officials said expiring federal subsidies were factored into the insurers’ requests for higher rates this year.
Across 312 insurers participating in the ACA Marketplaces from 50 states and the District of Columbia, the Peterson-KFF analysis shows a median proposed premium increase of 18% for 2026, about 11 percentage points higher than last year. This is the largest rate change insurers have requested since 2018, the last time that policy uncertainty contributed to sharp premium increases. On average, ACA Marketplace insurers are raising premiums by about 20% in 2026, the analysis found.
“Insurers are already setting 2026 rates. If Congress acts quickly, states can lock in lower premiums and spare families a wave of sticker shock this fall,” Lamont and the other governors wrote in their letter. “If not, the damage will be felt for years. This isn’t a partisan issue. It’s about protecting working people who are doing everything right but are still struggling to get by.
“Extending these tax credits is one of the simplest, most effective steps Congress can take to keep health care affordable and provide real stability for millions of families.”
While the subsidy extensions seemed to be on the table, Republican leadership recently indicated it wouldn’t be a part of negotiations.
But Democrats haven’t been the only ones pushing for the renewal of those subsidies, especially with the political reality that many Americans would lose coverage or face higher premiums at the start of the midterm election year in 2026. 
Some Republicans have also been supportive of extending the tax credits, and a group in the House recently backed legislation before spending talks ramped up.

(Photo by Lyle Muller)Back in the day when newspapers I worked at published a daily police log we often we got calls from people who ended up there. Their pathway to the log included shoplifting, drunken driving, simple assault, things like that.
The call went something like: Please don’t put my name in the paper. If you do, I will be fired. Or, my wife will find out. Or, in the case of college students, I won’t get into law school or medical school or get my first job after I graduate.
Our usual response made sense: Won’t you get fired, in trouble with your wife or with your grad school application because you shoplifted, drove drunk or beat someone?
Another call, especially at college newspapers, would be something along the lines of: Please don’t put my name or picture in your story about the political protest I was at because it will cause trouble for me. Sorry, we would say. You were in a public event, likely in a public place, causing a public disruption in order to change public policy.
That answer might be changing, and that is cause for concern.
College newspapers are being forced to rethink identifying people in stories because of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown and revocation of F-1 visas for selected college students. The immediate reaction some of you have to that probably is that these students should not have to worry if they behave themselves and don’t disrupt things in the country that willingly took them in so they can take their knowledge back home.
If only it were that simple.
I wrote about this last spring, but reports of students taken into custody for what they wrote or said in a public forum has students, faculty and staff at colleges and universities on edge, genuinely worrying that the Trump administration vindictively will come after them simply for things Trump and his followers do not like. That would include writing a letter to a student newspaper protesting U.S. policies. It famously happened earlier this year with the deportation case of Rümeysa Öztürk, the Tufts University graduate student from Turkey who wrote an opinion piece for The Tufts Daily student paper about divesting university funds from companies with ties to Israel.
Closer to home you have University of Iowa grad students on F-1 visas who sued to overturn their spring 2025 government-ordered deportation. The case still must go to a resolution but the international students have been winning court rulings.
Colleges and universities are working to protect their international students from government harassment. One result across the country has been requests from international students to remove their names from stories previously published online. Moreover, the requests extend to removing photos and even entire stories featuring international students who fear they are at risk as the federal government scans the internet for someone to target.
Öztürk’s effort to regain her F-1 status is in federal court. She is free from custody after serving 45 days in a Louisiana processing facility. A judge has determined that the Trump administration had no legal right to send masked feds after her and take her from a public street and into custody because of the letter she wrote.
“Throughout, I was disoriented, hungry and nauseous,” Öztürk wrote in a piece for Vanity Fair and her student paper about being in custody. “In Georgia, after suffering a severe asthma attack without my primary inhaler and having a hard cry, I was feeling completely hopeless. In Louisiana, I found myself in a cramped, cagelike bus, waiting for hours. I watched as countless people arrived from a nearby plane, all shackled — hands, feet and waists.”
So, yeah, international students are worried and young journalists on a lot of campuses are scrambling to figure out how to cover them.
The student journalists worry that the common practice of identifying people in stories — for accuracy but also ethical reasons dealing with authenticity — might cause undo harm to those people. The Tufts Daily editors have thought about it and have a policy that says requests that names be removed from online stories get reviewed by an Ethics and Inclusion Committee and the Managing Board, with the newspaper holding the right to grant or refuse the request.
College student editors questioning whether or not they should identify people who make public calls to change public policy is serious business. We need accuracy and knowledge of those who have an effect on our notion of what is normal. Withholding public information could alter factual descriptions of a newsworthy, historical event.
Grinnell College student Tammy Zywicki was a staff photographer for The Scarlet & Black. Her unsolved murder made national news in 1992 when she failed to show up for the beginning of the fall semester. Her body was found in Missouri. This is a photo of the page layout for a Sept. 8 story in the newspaper about her death and photos for the paper. (Photo by Lyle Muller)
On the other side of the news desk, students who stop expressing opinions in their college paper or do not participate in a political event for fear of being identified on a news website and arrested by feds have a chilling effect, too, especially if they are not committing a crime. Losing their voices can raise questions years down the road that range from “what were they thinking?” to “why didn’t they do anything to stop that?”
Students I work with as the Grinnell College Scarlet & Black professional adviser are trying to come up with a policy as quickly as possible to deal with requests by students who fear being identified. That includes stories previously published and online for some time. It also goes forS&B staff who are part of a college known for its diversity and international student population. Real names give stories credibility. But for some that now comes with a risk.
“In normal circumstances, we wouldn’t necessarily be going back and, like, redact all sorts of things,” S&B co-editor in chief Sarah Evans said. “But these are not necessarily normal circumstances.”
Evans said the policy will be explained to its audience once it is completed. “I think it’s been a little bit difficult to do that in real time,” she said. “We’re trying to make a policy that makes sure that our journalism isn’t doing any harm to the people we’re covering, or just to the general Grinnell community as a whole. And that takes into account a lot of the changes that we’ve been seeing in the past.”
The college reported in the latestS&B edition that only 24% of international students offered a spot accepted and enrolled for the fall semester. The rate was 42% for 2024 and 41% for 2023. College admissions officials said they suspect anti-immigration rhetoric and administration actions against international students left some wary of coming to the United States. Also, The S&B’s Akash Roy reported, incoming students were having problems getting appointments for visas as late as going into August.
For those who think all of this is coddling and nonsense, you need to see a larger picture. You don’t want lawbreakers you can ship out of the county to be here? Makes sense. But due process should be used to send them back according to the law, not a trumped up (pun intended) charge based on a political belief that may include criticism of the United States.
If the infraction is writing a letter, protesting a perceived injustice, demonstrating in favor of a political view, check the First Amendment and how the U.S. Bill of Rights applies to anybody, not just U.S. citizens.

LOUISVILLE — From 2019 to 2023, men in Jefferson County were at the highest risk of dying by suicide, according to a Suicide Fatality Report, released by the Louisville Metro Department of Public Health and Wellness. 
In 2019, most suicide deaths — 67% — were among men. From 2020-2023, that number rose to around 80%. 
The first of its kind report breaks down data only according to a gender binary but says that 2022 and 2023 each saw the death of a transgender individual and “their death was reported in the category that most aligned with their gender identity.” 
People who work in construction, transportation, food preparation and service, sales and similar fields were at the highest risk, the report shows. People working in construction accounted for 18% of suicide deaths in 2022 but are just 3% of the metro population. 
Guns were used in the majority of suicides (57%), the report shows, particularly among men.

Laura Frey, a key researcher on the project, said the use of guns is a potential factor causing men to be more likely to die. 
“A firearm is a much higher lethal means — you’re more likely to die from an attempt using that — so that’s certainly a reason why we might see more men dying, in that they are more likely to use a firearm,” said Frey, an associate professor at the University of Louisville. 
Other factors are interpersonal discord such as disagreements or divorce that can leave people with “a loss of a sense of belonging in someone’s community,” substance misuse and involvement in the justice system, she said. 
The high number of lives lost to suicide in the construction industry is “concerning given the smaller proportions working in those fields here in Jefferson County,” Frey said. 
Key takeaways 
Tuesday’s report focused on patterns of suicide loss and not on causes, though researchers hope to dig deeper into factors and ways to engage in targeted prevention in the future. 
This report showed: 

In 2020, there were 15 suicide deaths among Black and African American Louisvillians, which increased to 34 in 2022. 
Suicide deaths among Hispanic/Latinx Louisvillians doubled from three  in 2019 to six  in 2022. 
Suicide deaths among women 25-34 and 45-54 decreased the most during the pandemic, returning in 2022 and 2023 to pre-pandemic levels. 
About a third of all suicide deaths reviewed in the report involved some level of “interpersonal discord” in personal relationships. 
In about a third of all suicide deaths reviewed in the report, someone else was present in the home, as a witness to the death or as the person to find the person after. 
For all deaths related to substance use, 80% were white, 11% identified as Black/African Americans and 4% were Hispanic/Latinx. 
From 2019 to 2023, most suicide deaths among men involved firearms. Women’s means were much more varied. 

The number of suicides that involved another person being present was surprising, Frey said, and “to us, indicates a need for more increased postvention efforts to provide support for those individuals.” 
Connie Mendel, the chief health strategist and director for the Louisville Metro Department of Public Health and Wellness, said suicide is a “community issue.” 
“It’s going to take all of us working together to solve it as a community,” she said. “I encourage everyone to review the report, look at some of those trends, see if you can see yourself, your family, your coworkers, and … let’s talk about it. We have to talk about this as a community.” 



How to help stop suicide:
Geneva Robinson, director of the Crisis and Information Center for Seven Counties Services, said people who are suicidal could express hopelessness, experience drastic behavioral changes (such as an extrovert suddenly withdrawing) and disruptions of eating and sleeping patterns. 
“Suicide really is a public health issue, and it’s a public health issue that impacts all of us, whether we realize it or not,” Robinson said. “There’s just so many lives that are lost in our community to suicide. There’s also so many things that each and every one of us can do in order to make a positive impact and reduce (suicide).” 
Kentuckians can help end suicide by talking about it, which is a way to reduce the stigma around it, Robinson said.

“We want people to be able to be straightforward and honest in asking that question: ‘Are you thinking about suicide? I’m concerned about you,’” Robinson said. “Sometimes the reason that we don’t ask that question and deal with it directly is because we’re afraid someone’s going to say, ‘Yes, I have been thinking about that,’ and we’re not really sure how to fix that or what to do about it.” 
But, people don’t have to know how to “fix” the issue or have therapist credentials to help, Robinson said. Referring friends to the 988 Suicide Prevention Lifeline is a good place to start, she said. 
The 988 system, launched by the federal government in 2022,  is a national network of more than 200 crisis centers that field calls, texts and chats. Since its inception, Kentuckians made over 261,000 calls, chats, and texts to 988, a Cabinet for Health and Family spokeswoman said. Of these communications, 128,000 were routed to Kentucky’s crisis centers.  
Frey, the professor and researcher, added: “If you’re feeling hopeless or you’re feeling hopeless on behalf of a loved one, please know that there are people out there that care.”

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)A glacier-caused flood in Alaska’s capital city on Monday was weaker than forecasted, according to measurements taken by the National Weather Service and U.S. Geological Survey.
The flood on Juneau’s Mendenhall River topped out at 9.6 feet at 7:30 p.m. Monday evening. No significant damage was reported.
Forecasters had been expecting a flood of between 11 and 12 feet to reach its full height early Tuesday morning.
The Mendenhall River’s normal level is between 3 and 4 feet. 
Since 2011, Juneau’s Mendenhall River has experienced regular glacial outburst floods each summer and fall as Suicide Basin, an ice-locked lake, fills with rain and meltwater, overtopping an ice dam.
Last year, a flood damaged hundreds of homes in the Mendenhall Valley. Over the winter, city officials constructed a semipermanent levee of HESCO barriers along the river to protect homes, and a record-setting 16.65-foot flood this summer was mostly held at bay.
After that event, city officials reinforced the levee and stationed additional de-watering pumps. 
More work is expected before next summer, when further floods are expected.
Colder weather has already begun to arrive in Juneau’s nearby mountains, reducing the rate of glacial melt and limiting the odds of another major flood this year.

Kennedy Jr., is expected to vote to delay the hepatitis B shot for newborns. (Photo by Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)A key federal vaccine advisory panel whose members were recently replaced by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to vote to recommend delaying until age 4 the hepatitis B vaccine that’s currently given to newborns, according to two former senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials.
“There is going to likely be a discussion about hepatitis B vaccine, very specifically trying to dislodge the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and to push it later in life,” said Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “Apparently this is a priority of the secretary’s.”
The vote is expected to take place during the next meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, scheduled for Sept. 18-19.
For more than 30 years, the first of three shots of hepatitis B vaccine has been recommended for infants shortly after birth. In that time, the potentially fatal disease has been virtually eradicated among American children. Pediatricians warn that waiting four years for the vaccine opens the door to more children contracting the virus.
“Age 4 makes zero sense,” pediatrician Eric Ball said. “We recommend a universal approach to prevent those cases where a test might be incorrect or a mother might have unknowingly contracted hepatitis. It’s really the best way to keep our entire population healthy.”

In addition to the hepatitis B vaccine, the panel will also discuss and vote on recommendations for the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine and covid-19 vaccines. Pediatricians worry changes to the schedules of these vaccines will limit access for many families, leaving them vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases.
Typically, ACIP would undertake an analysis of the data before recommending a change to vaccine guidelines. As of the end of August, this process had not begun for the hepatitis B vaccines, Daskalakis and another former official said.
“This is an atypical situation. There’s been no work group to discuss it,” Daskalakis said.
The second former senior official spoke to NPR and KFF Health News on the condition of anonymity.
In response to questions from KFF Health News, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon wrote, “ACIP exists to ensure that vaccine policy is guided by the best available evidence and open scientific deliberation. Any updates to recommendations will be made transparently with gold standard science.”
The draft agenda for the upcoming ACIP meeting was released to the public less than a week before it is scheduled to begin.
At the last ACIP meeting, in June, Martin Kulldorff, the chair and one of seven new members handpicked by Kennedy, questioned the need to vaccinate every newborn, citing only two of the many ways the virus can spread. Kulldorff is a former Harvard Medical School professor who became known for opposing some public health measures during the pandemic.
“Unless the mother is hepatitis B positive, an argument could be made to delay the vaccine for this infection, which is primarily spread by sexual activity and intravenous drug use,” he said.
The virus spreads via direct exposure to an infected bodily fluid like blood or semen. The disease has no cure and can lead to serious conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer later in life. The CDC advisory panel may maintain the recommendation to inoculate newborns whose mothers have hepatitis B or are considered at high risk of the disease, the former officials said.
Protection from birth
In 1991, federal health officials determined it was advisable for newborns to receive their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth, which blocks the virus from taking hold if transmitted during delivery. While parents may opt out of the shots, many day care centers and school districts require proof of hepatitis B vaccination for enrollment.
The prospect of ACIP’s altering the recommendation has left some people living with the virus deeply unsettled.
“I am goddamn frustrated,” said Wendy Lo, who has lived with the liver disease, likely since birth. Years of navigating the psychological, monetary, medical, and social aspects of chronic hepatitis B has touched almost every aspect of her life.
“I would not want anyone to have to experience that if it can be prevented,” she said. Lo learned she had the disease due to a routine screening to study abroad in college.
Lo credits the vaccines with protecting her close family members from infection.
“I shared with my partner, ‘If you get vaccinated, we can be together,’” she said. He got the vaccine, which protects him from infection, “so I’m grateful for that,” she said.
The CDC estimates half of people with hepatitis B do not know they are infected. It can range from an acute, mild infection to a chronic infection, often with few to no symptoms. Most people with chronic hepatitis B were born outside of the U.S., and Asians and Pacific Islanders followed by Black people have the highest rates of newly reported chronic infections.
When her children were born, Lo was adamant that they receive the newborn dose, a decision she says prevented them from contracting the virus.

The earlier an infection occurs, the worse the consequences, according to the CDC. When contracted in infancy or early childhood, hepatitis B is far more likely to become a chronic infection, silently damaging the liver over decades.
Those who become chronic carriers can also unknowingly spread the virus to others and face an increased risk of long-term complications including cirrhosis and liver cancer, which may not become evident until much later in life.
“Now I’m in my 50s, one of my big concerns is liver cancer. The vaccine is safe and effective, it’s lifesaving, and it protects you against cancer. How many vaccines do that?” Lo said.
30 years of universal vaccination
Treatments like the antivirals Lo now takes weren’t available until the 1990s. Decades of the virus’s replicating unchecked damaged her liver. Every six months she gets scared of what her blood tests may reveal.
After a vaccine was approved in the 1980s, public health officials initially focused vaccination efforts on people thought to be at highest risk of infection.
“I, and every other doctor, had been trained in medical school to think of hepatitis B as an infection you acquired as an adult. It was the pimps, the prostitutes, the prisoners, and the health care practitioners who got hepatitis B infection. But we’ve learned so much more,” said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and a former voting member of ACIP.
As hepatitis B rates remained stubbornly high in the 1980s, scientists realized an entire vulnerable group was missing from the vaccination regime — newborns. The virus is often transmitted from an infected mother to baby in late pregnancy or during birth.
“We may soon hear, ‘Let’s just do a blood test on all pregnant women.’ We tried that. That doesn’t work perfectly either,” Schaffner said.
Some doctors didn’t test, he said, and some pregnant women falsely tested negative while others acquired hepatitis B after they had been tested earlier in their pregnancies.
In 1991, Schaffner was a liaison representative to ACIP when it voted to advise universal vaccination for hepatitis B before an infant leaves the hospital.
“We want no babies infected. Therefore, we’ll just vaccinate every mom and every baby at birth. Problem solved. It has been brilliantly successful in virtually eliminating hepatitis B in children,” he said.
In 1990, there were 3.03 cases of hepatitis B per 100,000 people 19 years old or under in the U.S., according to the CDC.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Since the federal recommendation to vaccinate all infants, cases have dramatically decreased. CDC data shows that in 2022 the rate among those 19 or under was less than 0.1 per 100,000.
While hepatitis B is often associated with high-risk behaviors such as injection drug use or having multiple sexual partners, health experts note that it is possible for the virus to be transmitted in ordinary situations too, including among young children.
The virus can survive for up to seven days outside the body. During that time, even microscopic traces of infected blood on a school desk or playground equipment can pose a risk. If the virus comes into contact with an open wound or the mucous membranes of the eyes, an infection can occur. This means that unvaccinated children not considered at high risk can still be exposed in everyday environments.
Future access uncertain
If the CDC significantly alters its recommendation, health insurers would no longer be required to cover the cost of the shots. That could leave parents to pay out-of-pocket for a vaccine that has long been provided at no charge. Children who get immunizations through the federal Vaccines for Children program would lose free access to the shot as soon as any new ACIP recommendations get approved by the acting CDC director.
The two former CDC officials said that plans were underway to push back the official recommendation for the vaccine as of August, when they both left the agency, but may have changed.
Schaffner is still an alternate liaison member of ACIP, and hopes to express his support for universal newborn vaccination at the next meeting.
“The liaisons have now been excluded from the vaccine work groups. They are still permitted to attend the full meetings,” he said.
Schaffner is worried about the next generation of babies and the doctors who care for them.
“We’ll see cases of hepatitis B once again occur. We’ll see transmission into the next generation,” he said, “and the next generation of people who wear white coats will have to deal with hepatitis B, when we could have cut it off at the pass.”

Gretchen Whitmer addresses the 2025 state budget impasse and the damage of federal tariffs on the state's economy at Heritage Hall in Lansing, Mich. Sept. 16, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceGov. Gretchen Whitmer on Tuesday shifted her  tone on the ongoing budget impasse in Michigan, noting in a speech that she stands with state Senate Democrats and many of their priorities and would not sign the House’s spending proposal  as presented.
Whitmer used the speech to address her budget timeline concerns and economic uncertainty created by federal foreign tariffs.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX The new commentary from Whitmer on the state’s pending budget crisis was a departure  from the play-it-down-the-middle approach that she’s taken throughout most of the cycle. Michigan has divided government, with competing priorities from the Democratic-led Senate and the Republican-controlled House. For the most part, she’s let them hash those out, but now she’s playing harder with the House.
The governor had earlier signaled that she found some alignment with the House on road funding – a key sticking point in the negotiations – and had been putting pressure on her Democratic colleagues to get a roads plan going so budget negotiations can begin.
With just two weeks until the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, Whitmer on said it was the Legislature’s responsibility to meet and negotiate a budget, and that it was well past time for those conversations to happen.
“We must work together to get certainty here in Michigan and to get the budget done,” Whitmer said. “While we can’t control the global tariff war, what we can do is make life a little easier for Michiganders and reduce that uncertainty.”
Failing to get the budget negotiated and signed before a government shutdown only adds to the worries of everyday Michigan residents, Whitmer added. Take roads, for example. The governor said she came into office with a goal of making roads more reliable, maintenance more predictable, and with construction efforts that have fixed millions of miles of roads and bridges. 
But Whitmer’s bonding plan for roads is expiring.
Every state in the nation has some form of a budget in place — except Pennsylvania and Michigan

“It’s really about people,” Whitmer said, giving examples of road workers she’s interacted with throughout the years as governor. “If we don’t invest in roads … [they’ll] have to find another job in another state that does. Our roads will get worse, and when we finally do put money into our roads, it’ll cost a lot more and we will have lost all that critical expertise.”
Whitmer also urged lawmakers to pass education funding soon, considering schools across the state were already operating without state dollars and are fearful they’ll miss their first state payment because the Legislature is at a stand still.
Schools have long been warning of the consequences of operating without a state budget declaring how much money they’ll receive in the coming state fiscal year, which has included layoffs and dipping into vital reserves.
Whitmer touted her accomplishments with the previous 2022-23 Democratic trifecta in the House and Senate, which closed the state’s education funding gaps, fed all 1.4 million kids with free breakfast and lunch, and tripled the number of literacy coaches in classrooms. All that had a positive net effect on teachers, Whitmer said, because those efforts also helped address the teacher shortage.
“All this progress is at stake. At the same time, we still face a literacy crisis. … Unacceptable. Now is not the time to go backwards,” she said.
While the House Republican budget does have cuts to statewide law enforcement, and have found fault with how the Department of State Police has been operating over the last decade, the GOP in control of the lower chamber are investing in a local public safety fund to help bolster law enforcement in the communities they serve.
Whitmer said it was imperative that the state fund public safety and ensure that first responders have the resources they need to deliver instant care and help reduce crime.
Whitmer noted that she introduced her budget seven months ago. The Senate passed its education and full government spending plan four months ago. Whitmer said Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) has always passed her budgets on time.
But despite that effort, the statutory deadline of having a budget deal by July 1 passed without a deal two months ago. The House only passed its budget plan three weeks ago – with some credit for passing an education budget about a month before their late August proposal.
Whitmer, touching on the House plan, said it was not one that she would sign, as proposed.
She said that the Senate can deliver on its important objectives to protect Medicaid in the face of federal defunding, support for moms and babies, and food for school children.










All this progress is at stake. At the same time, we still face a literacy crisis. … Unacceptable. Now is not the time to go backwards.


The House could have its cake and eat it too with trimmed spending, a plan to fix roads and increased fiscal transparency.
But none of that will be possible if the two sides don’t start meeting in the middle to find a solution to the impasse.
“We should be proud that no matter how dysfunctional Congress and Washington D.C. gets, regardless of what party is in charge, the state of Michigan has produced balanced budgets and gotten them done on time,” Whitmer said. “That has been the general rule here, regardless of who’s in power. It’s a stark reminder as we look at the next 14 days of what’s happening in Washington and what we need to do here in our city, in this town.”
Whitmer, in another nod to Brinks, said she and her team are ready to go, and hoped Michigan can continue to be a model of sound budgeting.
Senate and House leaders respond 
Following her address, Brinks told members of the media that she and Whitmer are aligned in their priorities and pushed blame to the House for stalling at the negotiating table.
Brinks was asked yet again about how often she was speaking to House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township). Brinks said, with many rounds of conversations, there were moments where the two parties felt like they were making progress, only to have that progress smashed the next day.
“When it comes to actually putting pen to paper or putting some details on those conversations and getting down to the nuts and bolts of what needs to happen to get a budget done, suddenly the progress seems to disappear,” Brinks said. “So today, I think it’s been it’s good to hear the governor’s commitment, and we stand together, committed to getting the budget done and one that meets the needs and goals of all three parties here, not just the Legislature.”
Brinks said they can work out all differences if each side is a willing partner, but she feels the House, at present, is not. She chalked that up to delays and obstruction solely coming from the Republicans, without giving details.
In a statement to Michigan Advance, Hall said the state must eliminate what the House has labeled waste, fraud and abuse in government.
“House Republicans identified billions of dollars in waste, including thousands of phantom employees in our state departments and hundreds of grants for things like puppet art theaters and barbershop quartets,” Hall said. “Our state has been funding that nonsense while our local roads and bridges continue to fall apart. It’s not right. Democrats say there is zero waste in the state’s $80 billion budget, but that’s not true.”
Hall said his caucus “proved you can fix the roads with just the waste, fraud and abuse in government if you make it a real priority, but Democrats can’t even put a roads plan on the table.”
“Now that Gov. Whitmer is back from her travels and we can work through this, I think she and I can strike a deal,” Hall added. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Brinks was asked if roads should be taken off the table to get a deal done, but she said that was not part of the calculus.
“I think there’s a way to meet the governor’s goal of getting roads done,” Brinks said, before noting that it was not the Senate’s number one priority, despite its significance in the process.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P9165180-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-16 14:56:54.815982

Jeff Landry said plans for a Hyundai Steel plant in Donaldsonville are proceeding as expected, even after an immigration enforcement raid on a Hyundai battery plant in Georgia. (Photo by Wes Muller/Illuminator)In a defiant tone, Gov. Jeff Landry said nothing has changed about Hyundai Motor Group’s plans to open a massive steel plant in Donaldsonville, even after an immigration raid on the South Korean company’s facility in Georgia sparked outrage back home. 
“I would think that whatever they did that they weren’t supposed to do, I’m sure they are not going to do it here in Louisiana,” Landry said Tuesday at an economic development conference. 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents threw the United States relationship with trade partner South Korea into turmoil when they conducted a raid Sept. 4 at a Hyundai battery plant in Ellabell, Georgia. 
Federal officials detained more than 300 South Koreans working at the plant. After the immigration sweep, U.S. officials released a video showing detained South Koreans shackled in chains. Some complained they were kept in unsanitary conditions while in custody. 

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung warned this week that South Korean companies might be reluctant to invest further in the United States following the Georgia raid, the Associated Press reported. The South Korean government also plans to investigate whether American officials committed human rights violations against its citizens. 
U.S. officials have said some of the South Koreans detained were working at the Georgia plant illegally. 

South Korean officials criticized the U.S. visa process, particularly a cap on skilled worker visas, which makes it difficult for South Korean companies to operate in the United States, according to The Washington Post. 
In Baton Rouge, Landry refused to answer a reporter’s question Tuesday about whether foreign nationals would work on the steel plant project in South Louisiana. 
“I mean, it’s a pretty trick question, I mean, it’s a pretty big project,” the governor responded. 

“I don’t expect anybody illegally to be working on the project,” Landry added. 
President Donald Trump struck a more conciliatory tone Sunday in a Truth Social post that addressed fallout from the Georgia raid. He welcomed foreign companies to bring foreign workers into the U.S., at least on a temporary basis.  
“I don’t want to frighten off or disincentivize Investment into America by outside Countries or Companies,” Trump wrote. “We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at their own ‘game,’ sometimes into the not too distant future!” 
In an interview Tuesday, Louisiana Economic Development Secretary Susan Bourgeois said she expects South Korean nationals will work at the Donaldsonville site. But their positions will not count toward the more 1,300 jobs Hyundai Steel has committed to creating in Louisiana as part of its project, she said. 

“Could there be foreign nationals here? I assume there could be,” Bourgeois said. “But absolutely, Hyundai Steel is committed to using Louisiana labor on that project.”

Bourgeois said her team met with Hyundai Steel officials shortly after the Georgia raid to talk about logistics and progress on the Donaldsonville project. At that time, no concerns were raised about the immigration sweep having an impact on the company’s Louisiana plans, she said. 

 “They have not taken their foot off the gas pedal,” she said.

An appellate court decision Tuesday is making a path for those records (Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent).The Missouri Attorney General’s Office is allowed to access patient health information as part of its investigation into the Washington University Transgender Center, an appeals court ruled Tuesday.
The Missouri Eastern District Court of Appeals decision, written by Judge Phillip Hess, reverses a ruling last year by a St. Louis judge that allowed the health center to withhold patient information protected by the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA. 
But Tuesday’s ruling does not end the fight for these otherwise confidential records nor will it open the floodgates for the attorney general to have untethered access to records. Instead, the circuit court must step in to tailor the requests and minimize the amount of protected health information that is ultimately shared.
Among the records requested in a February 2023 civil investigative demand was a desire for “all electronic health records of (the center’s) clients” and a list of all the Transgender Center’s patients.
“This court is very mindful of the breadth and depth of the attorney general’s requests to examine 1,165 minor patients’ most personal medical information,” Hess wrote. “Thus, the circuit court is empowered to modify the (civil investigative demands) as it deems appropriate under state and federal law.”
The decision touches on a notion that private information may already be in the attorney general’s hands. When the center received the initial requests for information, it provided “remote, read-only access to its electronic medical records system” alongside lists of patient information, prescriptions and billing data.
“The center abruptly changed its position, which prompted the attorney general to insist on receiving unredacted medical records with their metadata included,” Hess wrote.
The case is one of a handful of legal fights stemming from former Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s use of the state’s consumer protection law to probe into adolescent gender-affirming care through the state’s consumer protection law. Bailey began looking into the prescription of cross-sex hormones and puberty blockers to minors in early 2023, after a former case worker for the Transgender Center claimed in an affidavit that children were rushed into care.
Catherine Hanaway talks to reporters on Aug. 19 after being announced as the state’s next attorney general (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).
Attorney General Catherine Hanaway took Bailey’s place Sept. 8, when he stepped down to become the co-deputy director of the FBI. Hanaway told The Independent that her leadership of the office is “going to be a different style,” but it is unclear if she will continue pursuing the investigations of gender-affirming-care providers.
The attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
A mainstay of gender-affirming-care providers’ arguments against the civil investigative demands is that the attorney general is attempting to look into medical malpractice, which is outside the office’s jurisdiction. This point is left unanswered in Tuesday’s ruling, with Hess writing that it could be adjudicated in future legal battles if the attorney general files a claim against the center.
The court’s decision, Hess wrote, only applies to pre-claim investigative authority. And although the ruling did not shut down the probe for patient records, some of the attorney general’s claims asserting broad authority were rejected.
The office claimed in its appeal, written by former Solicitor General Josh Divine, that the attorney general’s office counts as a “health oversight agency,” in which HIPAA allows providers to share protected health information.
But because the investigation is looking into consumer fraud through the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act, it is not a matter of health oversight, the court determined.
Divine also wrote that civil investigative demands should be considered “orders” from an “administrative tribunal,” which is another occasion in which HIPAA allows disclosure. But these demands are not “independently enforceable orders,” Hess wrote.
The battle will return to St. Louis Circuit Court, where a judge must sort out whether de-identified records will suffice for the investigation.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-16 18:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,CT announces ban on ICE arrests in state courthouses,Andrew Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/16/ice-arrests-ct-courthouses/,"Immigration officers will be prohibited from making arrests, wearing masks in state courthouses. How rules will be enforced is unclear.","Connecticut officials announced a new rule on Tuesday that seeks to ban federal agents from making immigration-related arrests inside the state’s courthouses. But the state leaders acknowledged there will be little to no way to enforce that policy if officials with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement continue apprehending people at the state properties.
Raheem Mullins, Chief Justice of the Connecticut Supreme Court, announced the new policy at a press conference on Tuesday where he was joined by Gov. Ned Lamont and Rep. Steve Stafstrom, D-Bridgeport, co-chair of the legislature’s Judiciary Committee.
The issuance of the new policy is a response to the aggressive immigration enforcement tactics that have been employed by President Donald Trump’s administration and several high-profile arrests that were made by federal immigration officials inside Connecticut courthouses, including an instance at Stamford Superior Court where masked agents broke a bathroom door in order to take two men into custody.
More than 20 Democratic state senators cited that episode in a letter they sent to Mullins earlier this month, and they implored the Chief Justice to take steps to prevent ICE agents from using the public spaces inside courthouses to make arrests.
Mullins, who leads the state’s judicial branch as the chief justice, said the new policy was not arrived at “haphazardly.” 
“Judges, staff, litigants, members of the public — they all must be able to conduct their business in our courthouses without fear of disruption,” Mullins said. “The due administration of justice requires that courthouse security be protected.”
The written policy, which went into effect Tuesday, specifically prohibits any arrest from taking place “inside the public areas of a courthouse,” unless the officers have a “judicial warrant.”
That’s an important distinction because most ICE arrests are made based on an administrative warrant, which doesn’t have the same legal force as a warrant issued by a judge.
At the same time, the new policy seeks to ban federal ICE agents from wearing masks inside Connecticut courthouses, unless the mask is “medically necessary.” 
Lamont, who is in his second term as governor, called the new judicial policy a “modest step” and said he hopes it can withstand potential court challenges.
Mullins, who was confirmed as chief justice at the beginning of this year, said he was hopeful ICE would honor the court’s policy. But Mullins and Stafstrom both recognized that court employees and the judicial marshals, who maintain security at Connecticut’s courts, would be unable to stop federal agents from conducting arrests if they forced the issue.
“Court employees are not to interfere or assist,” Mullins said. “So that is the guidance that they get.” 
“I think we need to be realistic,” Stafstrom added. “What we are enacting here is a policy change. It is a policy that says that we would appreciate if ICE would honor our request for them to conduct their activities — their lawful activities that they are charged to do under federal law — outside the presence of the courthouse.”
Stafstrom, a Bridgeport Democrat who was first elected to the legislature in 2015, said the new policy is necessary in order to keep Connecticut’s courts accessible to people. 
He pointed out that people need to access the courts for more than just criminal cases, and he said some people including victims and witnesses of crimes could become hesitant to visit courthouses if masked ICE agents continue to apprehend people inside the state properties. 
“Justice should not depend on one’s immigration status,” Stafstrom said. “If you are a victim of a crime, if you are someone who believes you’ve been taken advantage of by an unscrupulous creditor, if you believe you are someone who is wrongly being evicted from their house, if you are someone who seeks a divorce from an abusive spouse, you should be able to enter a courthouse in this state free of fear that when you try to achieve justice an masked, unmarked individual is going to grab you and pull you out of the courthouse.” 
In a statement, Stephen Harding, Connecticut’s Senate Minority Leader, did not take issue specifically with the new policy implemented by the courts. But he used Tuesday’s press conference to criticize Connecticut’s Democratic majority for being too soft on crime and undocumented immigration. 
Harding, R-Brookfield, specifically criticized the state’s Trust Act, which has been amended in recent years to prohibit police, correctional officers and other state employees from turning over people to ICE unless they’ve been convicted of more serious crimes in the state.
“The Judicial Branch made this decision in consultation with ICE in an attempt to ensure the safety and security of courthouses and those that visit them,” Harding said. “That’s their right to do, but this action highlights multiple glaring issues here in Connecticut.” 
Maintaining order and open access to the courts is something that federal judges in Connecticut are also worried about as the Trump administration continues to ramp up immigration arrests nationwide. 
In August, Michael Shea, the chief judge for the U.S. District Court of Connecticut, issued an order limiting where and when ICE agents could make arrests inside the three federal courthouses in the state.
Connecticut is not the first state that has sought to regulate ICE activity in local courthouses, either through new rules or legislation. 
Court officials in Oregon and New Jersey previously issued directives and orders seeking to limit ICE arrests in state courthouses during Trump’s first term in 2019.
Meanwhile, other Democratic-led states like Colorado and New York have also passed laws seeking to ban ICE arrests in state courthouses — though Trump’s Justice Department is now challenging some of those laws in federal court.
Stafstrom said Tuesday that the General Assembly should consider enacting similar legislation in Connecticut.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ICE-JUDICIAL-0916-DE-Sony-001-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-16 14:56:54.815982
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-16 18:25:00+00:00,CT Mirror,RFK Jr.’s vaccine panel expected to recommend delaying hepatitis B shot for children,Jackie Fortiér | KFF Health News,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/16/hepatitis-b-vaccine-rfk-panel/,"A federal vaccine advisory panel is expected to vote to recommend delaying until age 4 the hepatitis B vaccine, currently given to newborns.","A key federal vaccine advisory panel whose members were recently replaced by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is expected to vote to recommend delaying until age 4 the hepatitis B vaccine that’s currently given to newborns, according to two former senior Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials.“There is going to likely be a discussion about hepatitis B vaccine, very specifically trying to dislodge the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and to push it later in life,” said Demetre Daskalakis, former director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “Apparently this is a priority of the secretary’s.” The vote is expected to take place during the next meeting of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, scheduled for Sept. 18-19.For more than 30 years, the first of three shots of hepatitis B vaccine has been recommended for infants shortly after birth. In that time, the potentially fatal disease has been virtually eradicated among American children. Pediatricians warn that waiting four years for the vaccine opens the door to more children contracting the virus.“Age 4 makes zero sense,” pediatrician Eric Ball said. “We recommend a universal approach to prevent those cases where a test might be incorrect or a mother might have unknowingly contracted hepatitis. It’s really the best way to keep our entire population healthy.”In addition to the hepatitis B vaccine, the panel will also discuss and vote on recommendations for the combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella vaccine and covid-19 vaccines. Pediatricians worry changes to the schedules of these vaccines will limit access for many families, leaving them vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases.Typically, ACIP would undertake an analysis of the data before recommending a change to vaccine guidelines. As of the end of August, this process had not begun for the hepatitis B vaccines, Daskalakis and another former official said.“This is an atypical situation. There’s been no work group to discuss it,” Daskalakis said.The second former senior official spoke to NPR and KFF Health News on the condition of anonymity.In response to questions from KFF Health News, HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon wrote, “ACIP exists to ensure that vaccine policy is guided by the best available evidence and open scientific deliberation. Any updates to recommendations will be made transparently with gold standard science.”The draft agenda for the upcoming ACIP meeting was released to the public less than a week before it is scheduled to begin.At the last ACIP meeting, in June, Martin Kulldorff, the chair and one of seven new members handpicked by Kennedy, questioned the need to vaccinate every newborn, citing only two of the many ways the virus can spread. Kulldorff is a former Harvard Medical School professor who became known for opposing some public health measures during the pandemic.“Unless the mother is hepatitis B positive, an argument could be made to delay the vaccine for this infection, which is primarily spread by sexual activity and intravenous drug use,” he said.The virus spreads via direct exposure to an infected bodily fluid like blood or semen. The disease has no cure and can lead to serious conditions like cirrhosis and liver cancer later in life. The CDC advisory panel may maintain the recommendation to inoculate newborns whose mothers have hepatitis B or are considered at high risk of the disease, the former officials said.Protection From BirthIn 1991, federal health officials determined it was advisable for newborns to receive their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine within 24 hours of birth, which blocks the virus from taking hold if transmitted during delivery. While parents may opt out of the shots, many day care centers and school districts require proof of hepatitis B vaccination for enrollment.The prospect of ACIP’s altering the recommendation has left some people living with the virus deeply unsettled.“I am goddamn frustrated,” said Wendy Lo, who has lived with the liver disease, likely since birth. Years of navigating the psychological, monetary, medical, and social aspects of chronic hepatitis B has touched almost every aspect of her life.“I would not want anyone to have to experience that if it can be prevented,” she said. Lo learned she had the disease due to a routine screening to study abroad in college.Lo credits the vaccines with protecting her close family members from infection.“I shared with my partner, ‘If you get vaccinated, we can be together,’” she said. He got the vaccine, which protects him from infection, “so I’m grateful for that,” she said.The CDC estimates half of people with hepatitis B do not know they are infected. It can range from an acute, mild infection to a chronic infection, often with few to no symptoms. Most people with chronic hepatitis B were born outside of the U.S., and Asians and Pacific Islanders followed by Black people have the highest rates of newly reported chronic infections.When her children were born, Lo was adamant that they receive the newborn dose, a decision she says prevented them from contracting the virus.The earlier an infection occurs, the worse the consequences, according to the CDC. When contracted in infancy or early childhood, hepatitis B is far more likely to become a chronic infection, silently damaging the liver over decades.Those who become chronic carriers can also unknowingly spread the virus to others and face an increased risk of long-term complications including cirrhosis and liver cancer, which may not become evident until much later in life.“Now I’m in my 50s, one of my big concerns is liver cancer. The vaccine is safe and effective, it’s lifesaving, and it protects you against cancer. How many vaccines do that?” Lo said.Thirty Years of Universal VaccinationTreatments like the antivirals Lo now takes weren’t available until the 1990s. Decades of the virus’s replicating unchecked damaged her liver. Every six months she gets scared of what her blood tests may reveal.After a vaccine was approved in the 1980s, public health officials initially focused vaccination efforts on people thought to be at highest risk of infection.“I, and every other doctor, had been trained in medical school to think of hepatitis B as an infection you acquired as an adult. It was the pimps, the prostitutes, the prisoners, and the health care practitioners who got hepatitis B infection. But we’ve learned so much more,” said William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine and a former voting member of ACIP.As hepatitis B rates remained stubbornly high in the 1980s, scientists realized an entire vulnerable group was missing from the vaccination regime — newborns. The virus is often transmitted from an infected mother to baby in late pregnancy or during birth.“We may soon hear, ‘Let’s just do a blood test on all pregnant women.’ We tried that. That doesn’t work perfectly either,” Schaffner said.Some doctors didn’t test, he said, and some pregnant women falsely tested negative while others acquired hepatitis B after they had been tested earlier in their pregnancies.In 1991, Schaffner was a liaison representative to ACIP when it voted to advise universal vaccination for hepatitis B before an infant leaves the hospital.“We want no babies infected. Therefore, we’ll just vaccinate every mom and every baby at birth. Problem solved. It has been brilliantly successful in virtually eliminating hepatitis B in children,” he said.In 1990, there were 3.03 cases of hepatitis B per 100,000 people 19 years old or under in the U.S., according to the CDC.Since the federal recommendation to vaccinate all infants, cases have dramatically decreased. CDC data shows that in 2022 the rate among those 19 or under was less than 0.1 per 100,000.While hepatitis B is often associated with high-risk behaviors such as injection drug use or having multiple sexual partners, health experts note that it is possible for the virus to be transmitted in ordinary situations too, including among young children.The virus can survive for up to seven days outside the body. During that time, even microscopic traces of infected blood on a school desk or playground equipment can pose a risk. If the virus comes into contact with an open wound or the mucous membranes of the eyes, an infection can occur. This means that unvaccinated children not considered at high risk can still be exposed in everyday environments.Future Access UncertainIf the CDC significantly alters its recommendation, health insurers would no longer be required to cover the cost of the shots. That could leave parents to pay out-of-pocket for a vaccine that has long been provided at no charge. Children who get immunizations through the federal Vaccines for Children program would lose free access to the shot as soon as any new ACIP recommendations get approved by the acting CDC director.The two former CDC officials said that plans were underway to push back the official recommendation for the vaccine as of August, when they both left the agency, but may have changed.Schaffner is still an alternate liaison member of ACIP, and hopes to express his support for universal newborn vaccination at the next meeting.“The liaisons have now been excluded from the vaccine work groups. They are still permitted to attend the full meetings,” he said.Schaffner is worried about the next generation of babies and the doctors who care for them.“We’ll see cases of hepatitis B once again occur. We’ll see transmission into the next generation,” he said, “and the next generation of people who wear white coats will have to deal with hepatitis B, when we could have cut it off at the pass.”We’d like to speak with current and former personnel from the Department of Health and Human Services or its component agencies who believe the public should understand the impact of what’s happening within the federal health bureaucracy.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)In the days since the mass shooting at the Church of Annunciation in Minneapolis, a familiar refrain has echoed across our community: 
Do something. 
It is an honest plea born of grief, fear and anger. 
But too often, “do something” means doing the same things — vigils, task forces, hardened doors, or more drills — while the conditions that enable targeted violence remain unchanged.
If we want different results, we must embrace a different first principle: prevention. Not in the abstract, but in the concrete work of identifying and managing risk before violence occurs. 
That’s what Behavioral Threat Assessment and Management — BTAM — is designed to do.
What research shows
Decades of investigations by the FBI, U.S. Secret Service and independent researchers demonstrate that attackers almost always follow what’s called a pathway to violence. 
Rarely do they just snap. Instead, they progress through stages: grievances that harden; fixation on a person or institution; detailed planning; and acquisition of weapons or means. Along that path, they leak warning behaviors — threats, menacing communications, stalking or drastic changes in mood and function.
The warning signs are there. The problem is that they are noticed in isolation. A teacher sees one behavior. A coach hears a troubling comment. A relative spots an alarming post. Each by itself might not seem urgent. 
But without a structure to connect the dots, opportunities for prevention are lost.
How BTAM works
BTAM creates that structure. A local team — composed of educators, mental health professionals, law enforcement when needed, and community or faith leaders — meets regularly, receives referrals, evaluates behaviors of concern, and develops proportionate interventions.
The aim is not punishment or profiling. It is problem-solving: stabilizing someone in crisis; addressing grievances; reducing access to means; and providing treatment or monitoring. 
In many cases, intervention involves support and services, not arrests. In the smaller number of high-risk cases, teams coordinate layered safety plans and law-enforcement engagement. The consistent focus is on behavior and risk, not identity or ideology.
Why Minnesota should act
Minnesota already has strong schools, health systems and faith communities. We should be building BTAM teams that tie those assets together. 
Here’s what “doing what works” could look like:
– Training and awareness so educators, employers, clergy and frontline staff can spot concerning behaviors and know where to refer them.
– Multidisciplinary teams in schools, workplaces and communities that meet routinely, share a common framework and coordinate across jurisdictions.
– Accessible mental health services to ensure that referrals can result in real help, not just documentation.
– Measurement and transparency through tracking of referrals, interventions and outcomes to build trust and improve performance.
– Practice and rehearsal so teams can act decisively when risk escalates.
Addressing concerns
Some worry that threat assessment could stigmatize people or chill free expression. 
Done poorly, it could. 
Done correctly, it is fair, ethical and transparent. Good teams focus only on observable behaviors, use proportionate responses, respect privacy and audit themselves for bias. They explain their mission clearly: help first, safety always.
Moving forward
Minnesotans will continue to debate firearms policy, criminal statutes and security hardware. 
Those conversations are valid, but they cannot substitute for prevention. Hardened doors and “run, hide, fight” drills may reduce casualties in the moment, but they do not prevent the moment from arriving.
BTAM offers something better: a chance to change the outcome before lives are lost. 
It requires effort, training and coordination — but it works.
We can keep doing something and end up with the same thing, or we can roll up our sleeves and do what actually makes a difference. 
Let’s connect the dots before tragedy connects them for us. Let’s equip the adults closest to the warning signs. Let’s build BTAM teams where Minnesotans learn, worship and work.
The next safer day in Minnesota will not be an accident. It will be the product of communities choosing prevention on purpose — together.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/gunControlRally03-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-16 14:56:54.815982

The New Mexico Ethics Commission is alleging that probation officers with the state’s Correction Department have repeatedly referred probationers to ICE, even after the state Legislature made that practice illegal, resulting in at least two detentions and one deportation.(Photo Courtesy Immigration and Customs Enforcement)New Mexico probation officers repeatedly provided immigration status information to federal immigration authorities, including after the Legislature made such a practice illegal this year, according to a new lawsuit from the state Ethics Commission.
The lawsuit filed Friday and announced Tuesday alleges that the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained three men with the help of state probation officers, who allegedly lured the probationers to state offices under false pretenses. 
Two of them remain in ICE custody, and one was deported to his unspecified home country, according to the lawsuit, causing “hardships to their New Mexican and American family members.” 
Resentment against Albuquerque ‘deliveristas’ may have sparked viral Walmart ICE arrest

The lawsuit names those three men and alleges that the practice of ICE referrals is somewhat common and ongoing since at least 2024. However, it does not estimate how many people have been detained or deported with state probation officers’ help. 
As one piece of evidence, the lawsuit contains a screenshot of a December 2024 email from a state probation officer who typed a probationer’s name and date of birth into the subject line and asks: “Are you able to tell me anything on this guy?” 
It also alleges that probation officers began contacting ICE agents to remove “problem probationers,” which means they “committed serious criminal offenses or … are otherwise difficult to supervise.”
That practice has “more recently extended” to “any individual who certain probation officers suspected of having an unlawful presence in the United States,” according to the lawsuit.
Brittany Roembach, a spokesperson for the Corrections Department, declined to comment on those allegations in an email to Source New Mexico on Tuesday morning. She said the department has not yet been served with the lawsuit, which names Secretary Alisha Tafoya Lucero as the defendant. 
NM advocates call for statewide immigrant data protections amid fear of mass deportation

The three men the lawsuit identifies are Juan Lamas Aguilar, Moises Llaguno and Melvin Escobar-Arauz. 
Aguilar and Llaguno, who are engaged or married with children and have each lived in New Mexico for more than 15 years, allege that ICE agents picked them up July 10 at a probation office in downtown Albuquerque. Both were on probation for driving under the influence. 
Llaguno was deported four days after being detained, according to the lawsuit. 
Escobar-Arauz, who has a wife and young daughter in Pecos, N.M., said that ICE detained him Aug. 18 at the Santa Fe probation office. He alleges that ICE also detained other New Mexico probationers who showed up that day, but he does not specify how many. 
Escobar-Arauz was sentenced to three years probation in June 2025 after pleading guilty to three counts of battery upon a peace officer, according to the lawsuit. 
In all three cases, the detainees accuse their probation officers of requiring them to show up to the probation officers under “false pretenses,” including to provide a urine sample or complete paperwork. 
Escobar-Arauz and Aguilar are both being held at an ICE detention center in El Paso, according to the lawsuit. Aguilar is from Mexico, and Escobar-Arauz is from Guatemala. 
NM immigration, civil rights groups back enhanced digital privacy protections

The lawsuit seeks a judge’s signoff on the commission moving forward with a separate legal action against the Corrections Department alleging that the probation officers’ behavior violates  new state law that went into effect July 1. 
The Legislature during the legislative session this year passed the Nondisclosure of Sensitive Personal Information Act, which prohibits state employees from providing immigration or other sensitive personal information to anyone outside of the agency except in limited circumstances. 
The law also empowers the Ethics Commission to file lawsuits if violations of that law occur or or are about to occur. But, before it files the lawsuit, the commission wants a judge to rule that federal statutes do not conflict. 
In a news release about the lawsuit, Ethics Commission director Jeremy Farris said a judicial ruling in the commission’s favor would free up the commission to enforce the state law.
“Seeking a declaratory order at this stage ensures that any future actions by the Commission to enforce NSPIA are fully compliant with both state and federal law,” he said. 
It’s not clear from court filings when a judge might weigh in on the lawsuit.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ICE-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-16 14:56:54.815982

(Screenshot)A former U.S. Secret Service agent turned attorney from West Kentucky is joining the field for Kentucky’s U.S. Senate Democratic primary. 
Logan Forsythe announced his bid for the seat Tuesday. In a phone interview with the Kentucky Lantern, he said his time in the Secret Service serving under multiple presidents was “disheartening” to his view on national politics. 
Forsythe, now 36, said growing up he had the idea that there was a “fascination” with whoever the president was as the leader of the free world. As he grew older, he “became disillusioned with the idea that not everyone who wears a suit is a good person or a smart person.”
As an agent, Secret Service members are around presidents, vice presidents, congressional members and their families. On some occasions when Forsythe was in a room with elected officials of both political parties, he found that sometimes they made decisions based on winning elections instead of thinking of the best interests of those who elected them. 
“I don’t want to oversell the amount of times that I was in this situation, but there were many times when both parties’ elected officials would be in a room and I would hear them talking, and more times than not, when they were making decisions … the focus wasn’t on their constituents. It wasn’t on the people who sent them there to represent them and to do what’s in their best interest,” Forsythe said. 
In his launch video, Forsythe discusses injuries from a car wreck that “nearly killed me” and ended his career as a federal agent. His neck and back were broken in the accident. 
Forsythe now is a workers’ rights attorney, often working in rural areas of the state. A Lyon County native now living in Lexington, he told the Lantern that his upbringing in poverty shaped much of his worldview today. He is the youngest of four children in a single-mother household. Government programs like Medicaid and food stamps were essential to the wellbeing of his family, he said. 
“I want to dispel this notion that people who rely on these programs and who need them, they’re only in their situation because of their lack of effort,” Forsythe said. “Because I don’t know what else my mother could have done growing up that she wasn’t already doing. If anything, it was too much effort for what she was getting out of it.”
He is critical of a recent GOP megabill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, for its cuts to veterans services, food assistance programs and Medicaid. Nationwide, many Democrats have vocally opposed the legislation, often a key issue of party candidates’ platforms ahead of midterm elections. 
Forsythe also told the Lantern that if elected, he wants to focus on legislation that would make living costs more affordable, increase access to health care and support public education. 
Forsythe said he’s a candidate that can overcome Democrats’ disconnection with rural voters. He may have worked outside of Kentucky but “I am still from Lyon County.” 
“I have family out there, and if I ignore them, they will call me,” he said. “So, I can’t just ignore them or not go to family reunions. I’m going to be out there anyway, regardless of this campaign.” 
Another Democrat has long declared her run for the open U.S. Senate seat — Kentucky House Minority Floor Leader Rep. Pamela Stevenson, of Louisville. In 2023, she was the Democratic nominee for attorney general but lost to Republican Russell Coleman.
Republican candidates have been in a heated primary. The top candidates — Congressman Andy Barr, former Attorney General Daniel Cameron and businessman Nate Morris — have campaigned for GOP votes throughout the summer. Last month, they appeared on stage at the annual Fancy Farm Picnic in West Kentucky to trade jabs in front of a crowd of supporters and detractors. 
The seat is currently held by longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, who earlier this year announced he is not seeking reelection.

That includes elections for local, state and federal offices. 
The U.S. Constitution grants states the authority to conduct federal elections, and Congress sets certain minimum standards. Here in Washington, our Legislature has determined that vote-at-home is the official method of conducting elections — and that’s not just the law, it’s a system that works.
Vote-at-home in Washington didn’t happen overnight. It evolved in direct response to growing voter demand. Years ago, when absentee voting required a specific reason, voters steadily requested more flexibility. Our Legislature responded — first by expanding absentee access, then by allowing counties to convert to vote-at-home elections where it made sense in the early 2000s. In 2011, Washington became one of the first states in the nation to adopt vote-at-home as the statewide standard — a move built on decades of experience, careful planning, and voter trust.
Washington’s early and thoughtful implementation of vote-at-home helped pave the way for other states. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many states began using widespread mailed ballots for the first time. While some of those states are still refining their procedures, Washington’s policies, infrastructure, and checks and balances have been in place for years — offering a tested model for secure, accurate, and efficient election administration.
Vote-at-home works because it reflects the way people live. Voters can take their time, read through ballot measures and voter pamphlets, and return their ballots from home—or in person — when it’s convenient for them.
Ballots can be returned in person and into secure storage via official drop boxes located throughout your county, or through the United States Postal Service. In addition, voters can sign up at VoteWA.gov to receive text notifications tracking their ballot’s journey — from issuance to acceptance.
It is well-documented that voter turnout is higher in vote-at-home states. Participation is easier and more deliberate, especially for those with demanding jobs, caregiving duties, limited mobility, or long travel distances to the nearest polling place. If Washington were to return to in-person-only voting, the very people who most benefit from expanded access would be the first to lose it.
We often hear from voters who wish results could be finalized on election night. We understand that desire — but elections are large, complex operations. In our field, there’s a well-known principle: you can have two of the following — fast, accurate, or affordable — but not all three at once.
If speed were the top priority, we would need to dramatically expand staffing, technology, and overnight operations. Returning to polling-place voting would multiply costs even further. Staffing dozens of polling sites (or hundreds in larger counties), renting or preparing facilities, purchasing equipment, training workers, and especially providing oversight to ensure those duties are performed without error or fraud—all of it would be enormously expensive. And for what gain? Not greater accuracy. Not better security. Just more cost, more complexity, and less access.
Washington has made a different choice — we prioritize accuracy and fiscal responsibility. Vote-at-home allows us to serve all voters while using public funds efficiently and transparently. We believe that the taxpayers in our counties expect their dollars to be spent wisely — not on duplicating systems or reversing a model that already works.
Vote-at-home is also a system that is secure. Every ballot is tracked. Every envelope requires a voter signature, which is verified against the voter registration file before the ballot is processed. And every election — without exception — is reconciled to account for every single envelope and ballot. Counties must report how many ballots were issued, how many were returned, how many were accepted or rejected, and why. This reconciliation process is fundamental to trust, and it is performed in every election in every jurisdiction.
We are proud of the work our offices do — and proud of our dedicated elections staff, whose professionalism, attention to detail, and commitment to transparency are at the heart of every successful election. The accuracy, integrity, and reliability of our vote-at-home system would not be possible without their expertise and care.
As election administrators, we are committed to upholding the law — no matter how it changes. That’s our duty, and we take it seriously. But we also believe that changing or eliminating Washington’s vote-at-home model is not necessary, not efficient, and not more secure. It would impose significant cost, reduce accessibility, and dismantle a system that has earned the trust of millions of Washington voters.
Vote-at-home is not just the law in Washington — it’s a well-established and secure practice. It reflects the lessons we’ve learned over decades of service. And it reflects the will of the voters we serve.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)LYNDON — Retired District Judge Merlin Wheeler during a hearing Monday admonished the state’s public defense agency for allowing “pretty, petty” infighting to disrupt a capital murder case.
Wheeler expressed concerns about inherent conflicts of interest within the Kansas State Board of Indigents’ Defense Services, as the public defense agency is known, and relieved the agency attorneys who were representing Kraig Kahler from having any further involvement in the case.
The judge installed Jason Belveal, of Holton, and Barbara Costa, of Colorado, as Kahler’s new attorneys.
Monday’s hearing followed a Kansas Reflector report on turmoil that erupted within BIDS under the direction of acting director Brandon Barrett. There were allegations of retaliation and interference, the firing of a decorated attorney by voicemail, ongoing personnel investigations, and an effort to unionize.
Much of the drama stemmed from disputes between Barrett and attorneys in the Capital Habeas Office, which handles post-conviction capital murder cases at BIDS. Alisha Mehdi and Rebecca Halff, two first-year attorneys in the office, were assigned to represent Kahler, who was sentenced to death for killing his wife, two daughters and grandmother-in-law in 2009 in Burlingame.
Mehdi was critical of her employer in a July 24 court filing that said BIDS had neglected to hire anyone qualified to handle the Kahler case. Barrett told the court Monday that he moved quickly to remedy the problem by extending a contract to Belveal, a more experienced attorney, to take over the case. But Barrett didn’t tell his own employees he was replacing them.
Belveal said Monday he didn’t realize his Aug. 15 entry into the court record would be controversial. Belveal said he thought “the ladies” would be grateful for his help.
Barrett didn’t directly answer a question from Wheeler about why he didn’t call Mehdi and Halff to tell them they were off the case.
Mehdi filed an Aug. 29 emergency motion in which she asked the court to stop her boss from interfering in the case. Mehdi, along with outside legal observers, pointed to a state law that prohibits the BIDS administrative office from interfering in cases. But Wheeler sided with Barrett’s explanation that assigning counsel to a case doesn’t amount to interference.
In a back and forth with the judge, Mehdi said it was “very dangerous precedent” to allow a BIDS director to reassign counsel that had been critical of the agency.
“I think you’re misinterpreting the power of your office,” Wheeler warned her.
The judge also was critical of Mehdi’s accusation of unethical conduct by Oklahoma attorney Mark Henricksen, who submitted a false court filing that said he met with Kahler and that Kahler wanted him to take over the case. Henricksen then filed an affidavit with the court that blamed his paralegal and an old template for the mistake.
On Monday, Henricksen told Wheeler he should have been more careful.
“I’m guilty of poor proofreading,” Henricksen said.
Wheeler said it sounded like Henricksen “got caught in the crossfire” between Mehdi and Barrett. Wheeler told Mehdi she should do more investigating before “throwing accusations” around in court so she could achieve her goal of staying on the case. Mehdi asserted that she was preparing to file a formal complaint about Henricksen with the Kansas attorney disciplinary office.
Kris Ailslieger, deputy solicitor general at the Kansas Attorney General’s Office, complained that multiple capital murder cases have been delayed by turnover at BIDS, frustrating him and victims’ families.
“I don’t know what’s going on in the Capital Habeas Office, but it appears dysfunctional to me,” Ailslieger said.
Because Kahler’s conviction and death sentence have already been upheld on appeal, the case is at the stage in which specialized attorneys are supposed to examine constitutional issues, like whether Kahler previously received effective assistance of counsel.
Wheeler questioned how one office within BIDS could have the freedom to claim a sister office had been incompetent, especially in light of Mehdi’s allegations that Barrett was interfering with the office. Wheeler rejected assurances from Barrett that there was no inherent conflict of interest in the arrangement.
The concern, as Wheeler pointed out, is that a future attorney could point to the current mess and argue that Kahler’s right to quality legal representation wasn’t met.
“I choose not to invite future litigation,” Wheeler said.
Instead, he said he would “do like King Solomon” and appoint Costa, who the Capital Habeas Office had identified as a potential lead attorney, as well as Belveal, who had been picked by Barrett, to represent Kahler. Wheeler ordered Mehdi and Halff to turn over their case files.
Monday’s hearing was held by video call, which Kansas Reflector was not allowed to join. Wheeler allowed the Reflector to listen, but not watch, the hearing from a room at the Osage County District Court in Lyndon. Retired public defender Ron Wurtz was the only other individual to attend the listening session.
Wheeler scheduled the hearing to start at the unusual time of 1:59 p.m., following a dispute with the Kansas Department of Corrections about whether 2 p.m. was too late in the day to start a hearing involving an inmate.
Wheeler started by disclosing he had “a little trouble” in scheduling the hearing because the department had attempted to dictate the timing. Wheeler tasked Ailslieger with delivering a message to the department: If there were any future attempts to try to dictate the timing of a hearing, the judge would order the corrections secretary to explain why he thinks he has authority over the court.
David Thompson, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections, didn’t answer a question about the department’s role in the timing of Monday’s hearing but said in a statement that the department “makes every effort to accommodate the court’s schedule.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/P9051349-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-16 13:57:24.968882

Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia MercuryAmtrak trains arrived and departed Tuesday morning at Richmond’s Main Street Station as state and local lawmakers announced pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly will construct a $5 billion manufacturing facility in Virginia that is slated to bring hundreds of jobs to the region and cement the state’s place in America’s pharmaceutical supply chain. 
“Virginia has infrastructure, transportation networks, utilities, a digital economy to support us, and all those things are just vital to a complex operation like the one we’re setting up here,” Eli Lilly CEO Dave Ricks said. 
Anchored in Goochland County’s West Creek Business Park, the manufacturing plant is expected to create 1,800 construction jobs in the short term and about 650 full-time jobs once it opens. That’s about $5 billion in investment into Virginia’s economy, Ricks and Gov. Glenn Youngkin shared when they took to a makeshift stage in the train station. 
“We chose Virginia because we have learned we have reliable partners here and great people who turn commitments into results,” Ricks said. 
He added that since the company began fielding interest this past February, it received over 400 proposals from 46 states before it picked Virginia and Goochland County as the winner. 
The plant is expected to focus specifically on medicines for cancers and autoimmune diseases. 
Surrounded by red signage — the color of Lilly’s logos and Youngkin’s political affiliation as a Republican —  the men celebrated Virginia’s continued growth as a pharmaceutical hub.

Youngkin gave a shout out to various state delegates whose work in the legislature have helped make Virginia attractive to pharmaceutical companies, including  Tom Garret, R-Goochland, David Owen, R-Henrico and Rodney WIllet, D-Henrico. Goochland’s board of supervisors members were in attendance to celebrate as well. 
During President Joe Biden’s administration, federal funding was invested in Virginia to help spur pharmaceutical manufacturing south of Richmond around Prince George County. Youngkin has since announced other pharmaceutical investments in Virginia like AstraZeneca’s planned manufacturing facility in the state, consumer health company Haleon’s upgrades to its Richmond location and the establishment of an internship partnership with Virginia Commonwealth University and other schools.

While Ricks noted that some out-of-state hires could be made once the Lilly plant is up and running, Youngkin emphasized that Virginia’s higher education institutions have pharmaceutical and life science degrees that offer a localized talent pipeline in the state. 
“We get to collectively say that ‘made in America’ means ‘made in Virginia,’” Youngkin said. 
While the full set-up of the site could take a couple of years, Ricks said, initial permitting and preparing the site will be underway within the next few weeks.

Roger Wicker. 
Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi who leads the Senate Armed Services Committee, told Mississippi Today in an interview that the inspector general’s report is complete. 
“I understand the report is complete, it’s under review and we should get it soon,” Wicker said.
The report looking into Hegseth’s messages and participation in the chat follows a joint letter from Wicker and U.S. Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, asking the Pentagon’s watchdog to investigate the Signal conversation.
Former national security adviser Mike Waltz set up the message in March to coordinate the Trump administration’s plans for strikes against the Houthis and accidentally invited Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, to the chat. 
Signal is a free messaging app that allows users to communicate with strong end-to-end encryption to make conversations more secure. But security experts have warned that electronic devices using Signal could still be hacked by foreign adversaries. 
The chat between the Cabinet and national security officials described launch times of U.S. fighter jets, enemy targets, and munitions that would typically be classified as secret. 
The Department of Defense declined to comment for this story, but Hegseth has repeatedly said that he did not share classified information in the chat.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/14101258/AP25014556392758.jpg,,,2025-09-16 13:57:24.968882

(Marshall University photo)Marshall University President Brad Smith and his wife, Alys Smith, have donated $50 million to a university program designed to eliminate student debt.
The university has set a goal of ensuring all students can graduate debt-free by Marshall’s bicentennial in 2037.
The Smith’s gift is the largest bestowed to the university, and is the largest personal contribution made by a sitting university president to their own institution.
“We are honored to support Marshall University and the Marshall For All program with this gift,” the Smiths said in a news release Tuesday. 
“Our ‘why’ is simple: to level the playing field in West Virginia and Appalachia. We hope this gift ensures that every student with the dream of an advanced degree has the opportunity and support to achieve it — while also showing what’s possible for the future of higher education in our region and beyond,” the pair said. 
The Marshall For All program, launched in 2023, allows students to combine scholarships, grants, work opportunities and family contributions to earn their bachelor’s degree without the need for student loans. The goal is for students to graduate with little to no debt.
The average federal student loan debt is $39,075 per borrower, according to the Office of Federal Student Aid. 
There are nearly 400 Marshall For All: Debt-Free students. Of those in the program, 69% are the first in their families to attend college, just as Brad Smith and his brothers were.
“It is with tremendous gratitude that we share Brad and Alys’ transformative gift in support of Marshall For All,” said Nico Karagosian, president and CEO of the Marshall University Foundation. “The Smiths are visionary partners who believe deeply in the power of accessible and affordable education for students across West Virginia and Appalachia.”
Karagosian continued, “Their generosity propels us closer to our goal of eradicating student debt by 2037, Marshall’s 200th anniversary, while setting a new standard in higher education.”
The Smiths’ lifetime giving to Marshall now surpasses $90 million.
Brad Smith grew up in Kenova and earned a bachelor’s degree from Marshall. He also earned a master’s degree in management from Aquinas College. He has served as president of Marshall since 2021.
Before returning to West Virginia to lead his alma mater, he served as CEO of Intuit, the Silicon Valley-based software company, from 2008-2019. 
Alys Smith is an Ohio native and attorney. She previously worked for the Ohio Attorney General and several private firms. She currently works as a guardian ad litem representing foster kids in abuse and neglect cases.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez and 21 other states’ attorneys general on Monday lent their support to District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb’s lawsuit challenging President Donald Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops to the nation’s capital.
Schwalb on Sept. 4 sued the Trump administration, arguing the deployment amounts to a military occupation that violates the district’s right to self-rule.
On Monday, the states’ top prosecutors argued in a “friend of the court” brief that without the District of Columbia’s elected leaders’ consent, the troop deployment is “unlawful, unconstitutional, and undemocratic.”
They are asking the District Court for the District of Columbia to issue a preliminary injunction and “make clear that the Constitution prohibits the use of soldiers as local law enforcement.”
The attorneys general argue the deployment infringes on the police powers reserved to states and localities; federal troops should not displace local police officers; and states need their national guards to respond to natural disasters and security at high-profile events.
The attorneys general wrote that the early June troop deployment to California, which has been repeatedly extended, “serves as a warning of the harm caused by a continuous military presence in a state” as the “militarized presence” of National Guard troops “harms the economy by stoking fear and causing the public to stay home, fail to report for work, and avoid areas where the military is deployed.” Troops’ presence also heightened “tensions in communities,” the brief notes, and diverted troops from “vital state functions, such as fighting wildfires.” 
“The idea of sending military personnel into American cities to patrol our streets and police our residents goes against everything this country stands for,” Torrez said in a statement. “These federal deployments of armed troops — who have no official police powers — violate our Constitution and create needless fear in our communities.”
A news release from Torrez’s office noted that while troop deployment began in California and Washington, D.C., President Donald Trump “has made clear that this is the beginning — not the end — of the military occupation of American cities.”
On Monday, Trump deployed National Guard troops to Memphis, he said, to address crime.
The other state attorneys general who filed the brief include California, Maryland, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.

You can read more about the section here.

I grew up in Calcutta, now Kolkata, a large city in India. Then, there were parts of Kolkata that smelled of raw sewage. When I came to the United States, I thought I had left that odor behind. And so I had — until I moved with my family to Jackson.
During the first 20-odd years we lived in Jackson, there was always somewhere in my neighborhood I could smell sewage. This indicated there was a leak, even though I couldn’t see it.
Sewage leaks are a health hazard. Contamination of drinking water with sewage can lead to a number of diseases. Further, the kind of mosquitoes that prefer to breed in sewage-contaminated water carry West Nile disease and encephalitis.
Unfixed sewage and water leaks can undermine nearby infrastructure, such as roads and buildings, thereby increasing the ultimate cost of repairs.

Ranjan Batra
When the water and sewage systems were taken over by JXN Water in 2023, there were two sewage leaks near my house. JXN Water has repaired both of them.
For the first time since I moved to Jackson a quarter century ago, I have well-founded confidence that the quality of the water in Jackson is being adequately controlled, and the sewage disposed of properly. This is because these systems are being handled by JXN Water, which was created three years ago expressly to oversee repair and improvement of the city’s water infrastructure.
Less than a year after its creation, JXN Water also was given the job of repairing the failing sewer system, which over the previous three years had leaked 111 million gallons of untreated wastewater into the environment, and discharged 4.5 billion gallons of untreated or under-treated sewage into the Pearl River.
Since JXN Water took control there has been tremendous progress in providing reliable water to the city, and in ensuring that sewage does not leak onto city streets or elsewhere into the environment. However, this progress is now imperiled.
JXN Water is collecting insufficient money from Jackson’s ratepayers to meet operating expenses. JXN Water discovered this financial shortfall only earlier this year. This was not discovered earlier because until the end of 2024 JXN Water had not controlled the sewage and water systems for long enough to properly evaluate the cost of running them.
The federal government did give Jackson between $650 million and $800 million to fix its water woes, but most of this money came with strict conditions: it was to be used for repairing the water system and for projects that brought Jackson’s drinking water supply into compliance with federal standards. Funding the day-to-day operation of the water system was left as the responsibility of the municipality, as it is everywhere else in the country.
Using the federal funds for the sewage system was also excluded. Consequently, JXN Water has to rely on remittances from ratepayers to fund sewage system repairs and operating expenses for both systems.
JXN Water is making every effort to obtain payments for the water it delivers. When JXN Water took control of the water and sewage systems, many ratepayers’ meters were giving erroneous readings.
JXN Water replaced all the meters, but after sending out bills with readings from the new meters, thousands of customers did not submit remittances. After waiting months for payment, JXN Water pursued delinquent accounts and raised the proportion of collections to 70%.
Officials located and resolved over 1,000 unmetered connections and increased monthly revenue about 40%. Unfortunately, their projections indicate that even if they manage to raise collections to 100%, they will not be able to make up their financial shortfall. 
JXN Water is not a for-profit company: all the money it collects goes into running Jackson’s water and sewage systems. JXN Water has requested a rate increase corresponding to the amount that would be needed to fund its operations assuming an unrealistically high collection rate of 100%.
This increase was opposed by former Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba, the outgoing City Council and Jackson’s present Mayor John Horhn, none of whom have the final say on the rate increase. Most of these officials have declared the increase to be unaffordable for the city’s lower income residents.
The final decision on the rate increase rests with U.S. District Judge Henry Wingate, who oversees the repair of the water and sewer systems. He is considering other options such as legislative interventions and empaneling a Water Authority which could authorize a bond to cover JXN Water’s financial shortfall.
However, legislative measures take time, and a bond is a loan which will have to be repaid, presumably by rate increases borne by JXN Water’s customers. Issuing bonds for ongoing expenses is not a sustainable solution.
Jackson has the unsavory distinction of being the only city of its size in the entire country that does not cover its own water and sewer expenses.
For decades, city government has underinvested in these systems by obscuring the true costs of maintaining them. The present arrangement, which demands separating water and sewer expenses from the other finances of the city, makes the lack of financial support clear to the public.
While Judge Wingate works on options, JXN Water continues its work. It has been short of funds since July. It has resorted to not fully paying contractors who work to fix leaks or the engineering firm that runs the water plant, and promising them payment in the future.
Jackson is financing its water and sewage systems on the goodwill of companies with which it does business. It is unclear how long this goodwill will last.
The only sustainable solution proposed so far to funding Jackson’s water and sewer systems is a rate increase.
City government is abdicating its responsibility to provide safe drinking water for all its residents. It must find another mechanism to support those with low income.

Founded in uptown Charlotte in 1857, Queens University currently serves nearly 2,000 students. Elon, founded in 1889 just outside of Burlington, is the larger of the two schools with 6,500 undergraduate students and more than 780 graduate students enrolled.
Elon University President Dr. Connie Ledoux Book said together Queens and Elon become an almost $2 billion asset institution with almost 10,000 college students and a $600 million endowment.
“Together we are much stronger than we are individually,” said Book in a video release announcing the partnership.
“Our ability to impact all of the communities we are in will be second to none,” pledged Jesse Cureton, acting president and CEO for Queens University.
Cureton said the merger with Elon will allow Queens to stay deeply connected to Charlotte’s civic and business community.
One business leader praising the merger is Hugh L. McColl Jr., the former chairman and CEO of Bank of America.
“Having served nearly two decades as a trustee at Queens and now watching my granddaughter pursue her degree at Elon Law in Charlotte, I’ve seen firsthand the impact both institutions have on students,” McColl said in a press release. “By uniting their strengths, Elon and Queens are expanding opportunity, preserving legacy and making a bold investment in Charlotte’s future. This is the kind of forward-looking vision that ensures our city continues to thrive for generations to come.”

Burney Jennings, chair of Elon’s Board of Trustees and the former CEO of Biscuitville, said the move was a natural next step for Elon’s growth.
“Queens is the right partner at the right time,” Jennings said.
The two universities plan to hold citywide listening tours later this fall to hear from students, faculty and staff, as well as alumni. A more developed vision of the merger will be unveiled in early 2026.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Elon-1024x551.jpg,,,2025-09-16 13:57:24.968882

(Photo by Rebecca Olson/Used By Permission)In Alaska, a state famous for abundant salmon and huge, cold-water-loving crab, another type of fish is making a splash: tuna.
Incursion of warm waters into Southeast Alaska coastal areas off Sitka and Baranof Island created a brief tuna jackpot earlier this month for sport fishers.
One of the first of those anglers was Troy Tydingco, who happens to be the Sitka sportfish area management biologist for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game.
He took a day off from work when conditions were just right to search for tuna, a type of fish suited to more southern latitudes: beautiful weather, with calm waters and water temperatures that reach 60 degrees.
About 30 miles offshore, the search was successful. Tydingco and his six companions caught 44 albacore tuna in all. Other fishers followed.
“I think this is probably the first time sport anglers have really successfully targeted them and harvested them out of Sitka,” he said.
Another successful Sitka tuna angler was Adam Olson, operations manager at the Northern Southeast Regional Aquaculture Association.
What makes it fun, he said, is that it is “incredibly unique and unusual.” It is a big change for Sitka, he said. “We’re very salmon-centric here in Southeast Alaska,” he said.

	Olson enjoyed eating the tuna as well as catching it, grilling it with a little salt and pepper. “It was phenomenal,” he said.
Tydingco said there is no precise count for the tuna haul. Based on anecdotal reports, social media posts and general talk around town, he estimates that there were 200 caught out of Sitka.
Anyone with a sportfishing license is allowed to harvest tuna in Alaska, as long as they use legal means. Most anglers use rod-and-reel gear that would typically be used to catch salmon. It is also legal to use a spear gun, which one man employed successfully to get a skipjack tuna in the Sitka harbor.
Commercial opportunity?
The Sitka tuna flurry generated enough interest to prompt the Department of Fish and Game to issue an advisory on Friday laying out the rules for a commercial harvest.
There is no federal fishery for tuna in Alaska, so it is up to the state to regulate catches if they occur, said Rhea Ehresmann, a Sitka-based groundfish project leader for the Department of Fish and Game.
Though no one may have tried it yet, commercial tuna fishing is legal in Alaska. There are requirements for permits, gear types and record-keeping. Trolling and jigging gear, which uses hooks to catch fish, is allowable for tuna, but nets are not.
So far, the department has issued a couple of permits to interested fishers, Ehresmann said.
Any commercial catch of tuna – whether deliberate or accidental bycatch during a harvest targeting another species —  is required to be reported to the state. There had been no such reports as of Monday, said Grant Hagerman, a Sitka-based troll management biologist for the Department of Fish and Game.
The Sitka tuna bounty may be new. But the occasional presence of tuna in Alaska waters is not.

	Up to now, Prince of Wales Island, at the far southern tip of Southeast Alaska, has been the site of most of the state’s tuna fishing, Tydingco said.
There are also isolated cases of tuna catches farther north, such as a skipjack tuna fished off Yakutat in 2015.
History indicates that the presence of tuna in Alaska waters is ephemeral. They might linger for a few weeks if waters are warm enough, then swim south.
Excitement over tuna in Alaska and rumors of their appearances date back to the 1920s, according to a 1949 report by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. There was a Ketchikan-based commercial harvest in 1948, though that tuna appears to have been caught off British Columbia’s Queen Charlotte Island, according to the report.
Whether tuna fishing will become a trend in Alaska is yet to be determined.
Tydingco said this year’s successes are likely to encourage more fishers to look for tuna, but that people should not count on having tuna-friendly conditions every year.
“That warm water temperature doesn’t even always make it up this far,” he said.
There are signs that Alaska will be more hospitable to tuna in the future, due to warming waters caused by climate change and other factors.
While sea surface temperatures have increased in almost all of the world’s marine areas, temperatures in the North Pacific Ocean are rising faster, according to National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists. That includes the Gulf of Alaska, which has had recent marine heat waves.

Tuna are normally found along the U.S. West Coast but occasionally stray into Alaska waters if tempertures are high enough. Sport anglers catch them with gear similar to that used to hook salmon.

Charles Riley (center) speaks during a Sept. 16, 2025 news conference in Washington D.C. in which New Mexico Pueblo leaders and congressional delegation members urged protections for Chaco Canyon National Historical Park.New Mexico Pueblo leaders joined members of the state’s congressional delegation in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday to reiterate opposition to oil and gas development near Chaco Culture National Historical Park. 
The set of archeological sites built by Ancient Pueblo cultures a millennia ago in New Mexico’s northwest corner holds spiritual and cultural value for New Mexico’s 20 Pueblos. The site also lies in the midst of the San Juan Basin, one of the busiest gas-producing areas in the United States.
In May, the U.S. Bureau of Land Management sent a letter to a few leaders of New Mexico Pueblos, writing that the agency was considering revoking a Biden-era ban on drilling within 10 miles of Chaco. The possible revocation comes as the Trump Administration considers mining in currently protected lands at national monuments considered sacred to tribal nations, including Bears Ears in Utah and Baaj Nwaavjo I’tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon.
“This is your nation’s capital; Chaco Canyon is our nation’s capital,” said Santo Domingo Pueblo Lt. Gov. Raymond Aguilar Jr., who was joined by leadership from the Pueblos of Santa Ana, Picuris, Cochiti, Zia, Tesuque, Acoma, Santo Domingo and Laguna in a news conference with U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich, along with U.S. Reps. Teresa Leger Fernández and Melanie Stansbury, all Democrats, outside of the U.S. Capitol.

This is your nation's capital; Chaco Canyon is our nation's capital


– Santo Domingo Pueblo Lt. Gov. Raymond Aguilar Jr.,


Jerome Lucero, a former Zia Puebo governor, said the lands and stories about Chaco Canyon amount to “living history” that must be protected. 
“We’re fighting for our children and the ones that are still to come, that’s why we’re standing here fighting, because that is our history,” Lucero said.
In April, members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation re-introduced federal legislation to make permanent the ban on development. But a competing Republican-backed bill and the Trump Administration’s efforts to unwind the order threaten that progress, the delegation said in a June letter. 
Stansbury said economic development and other arguments fall flat when considering the area’s spiritual importance.
“Can you imagine allowing oil and gas drilling in the heart of a church? This place is holy. It must be protected,” Stansbury said. “It is a place where practice, where culture, where religion continues today, and that is what is at stake.”
Heinrich again called upon Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to personally visit the site.
“Come out, see this with your own eyes,” Heinrich said. “Walk these grounds, meet with the people whose identities are so intricately connected to this place before you make a decision about its future.”
Leger Fernández said that removing the protections would roll back years of negotiations and careful policy.
“This 10-mile buffer did not come [together] magically,” Leger Fernández said. “It was negotiated over years of consultation, with the Navajo Nation leadership, with Pueblo leadership, with archeologists and with the federal government,” she said.
Pueblo leaders said the protection of Chaco is not for the present, but for further generations.
“We come as a united front to show that all Pueblo leaders are behind us and that we can work as one,” Pueblo of Acoma Gov. Charles Riley said. “We hope and pray that time goes on, not for ourselves, not for our kids, not for our grandkids, but for those future generations of our people, that they too, can be afforded that sacred place.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-16-at-10.06.34 AM-1024x581.png,,,2025-09-16 12:57:33.570822
,DC,2025-09-16 16:37:39+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Government shutdown looms Oct. 1 as Congress struggles with stopgap spending plan,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/government-shutdown-looms-oct-1-congress-struggles-stopgap-spending-plan,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Republican leaders released a seven-week stopgap government funding bill Tuesday that’s intended to avoid a shutdown when the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1. But GOP leaders opted not to negotiate the legislation with Democrats, who may be needed to approve the bill in the House and will be required to get past the Senate’s 60-vote legislative filibuster. Democrats for weeks have called on Republicans to address what they view as critical health care issues, including the expiration of expanded Affordable Care Act tax credits at the end of the calendar year and the effects of the GOP’s “big, beautiful” law on Medicaid recipients.Speaker Mike Johnson said during a press conference shortly before the bill was released that he views the ACA tax credits as “a December policy issue, not a September funding issue,” even though open enrollment begins in November. “They don't expire until the end of the year and so we have until the end of December to figure all that out,” Johnson said. “But I can tell you that there's real concern. I have concerns. Republicans have concerns about those policies. “If you look at how much they’ve been abused, in my estimation, in some ways. There’s no income cap on it. People who make $600,000 a year get a government subsidy for their health care. I don’t think that’s going to be a popular measure when people understand how that works. There’s a relatively small number of people that are affected by it. But that policy has real problems.”The tax credits are used by people who purchase their own health care coverage through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.Schumer: Republicans ‘want to shut things down’Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said during a floor speech before the bill was publicly released that GOP leaders shouldn’t expect Democrats to help them advance any legislation they didn’t negotiate in a bipartisan way. “They can try and play the blame game, but their actions tell a different story. Their actions show clearly they want to shut things down because they don't want to negotiate with Democrats,” Schumer said. “And it's more than that. It means Republicans don't want to help the American people with the crisis they've created raising people's costs, particularly their health care costs.”Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said the stopgap spending bill, which would keep the government running through Nov. 21, is needed to give lawmakers more time to work out final, bipartisan versions of the dozen full-year government funding bills. “The goal here should be to fund the government the way it was intended to be funded — through the normal appropriations process,” Thune said. Security for members of CongressThe 91-page stopgap spending bill also includes $30 million in additional funds to bolster safety and security for members of Congress following an increasingly violent year that included the killing of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk, the murder and attempted murder of Democratic state lawmakers in Minnesota as well as some of their family members and arson at the Democratic Pennsylvania governor’s mansion. Members of Congress, their staff and their families are subject to thousands of threats each year, according to data from the U.S. Capitol Police. Johnson told reporters shortly after his press conference that he views the member security funding as a start and that there will be “more to come” in the full-year Legislative Branch funding bill.Johnson said he expects the House will vote on the stopgap bill before Friday, when both chambers of Congress are set to leave on a week-long break for the Rosh Hashanah holiday week. Lawmakers aren’t expected to return to Capitol Hill until Sept. 29, with just hours to avoid a partial government shutdown if they cannot approve a stopgap bill in the days ahead.The legislation includes an additional $30 million for the U.S. Marshals Service, which is responsible for the safety of federal judges and courthouses, as well as $28 million “for the protection of the Supreme Court Justices.”",,,,2025-09-16 12:57:33.570822

The NIH, which funded the project, canceled it in April. (Photo courtesy of Lingjun Li)Lauren Fields was less than four months into a research project funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) when she got an email message from her program officer at the federal agency.
A doctoral candidate in chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Fields has been studying the biochemistry involved in the feeding process of  a common crab species. She and her faculty supervisor believe the project can shed new light on problems such as diabetes and obesity in human beings.
The research project started in early January 2025. But the April NIH message told Fields the funding was being cut off. It didn’t explain why.
“It just said changes to NIH/HSS policies and priorities,” Fields says. NIH operates under the umbrella of the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
Fields contacted her program officer on April 9. “I tried to kind of probe further with my program officer and I didn’t get any further than that,” she says.
She and her project supervisor have a working hypothesis, however. Fields’ project was funded under an NIH program to ensure that more researchers come from backgrounds that have been historically under-represented and underserved. She won the award as a native of Appalachia and a first-generation college student. 
This past spring, that program was quietly shelved after an executive order from President Donald Trump on his first day in office put an end to all federal programs involving diversity, equity and inclusion.
Trump’s order called such efforts “radical and wasteful.” But Fields’ supervisor, UW Professor Lingjun Li, says measures to broaden the field of researchers can help ensure higher quality and more useful research findings.
“We believe that different, diverse backgrounds can actually bring unique and different perspectives to make our research enterprise better and stronger,” says Li. Li is on the faculty at the UW School of Pharmacy as well as at the Chemistry Department in the UW-Madison School of Letters and Science.
Feeding crabs to understand human biochemistry
Fields’ project examines the feeding behavior and process in the Jonah Crab, widespread in the coastal waters of North America. She wants to know how neuropeptides — molecules that send signals through the nervous system —  prompt them to start and stop feeding.
“Crabs actually have one of the most well characterized systems to understand feeding behavior in the animal kingdom,” Fields says. That’s why UW has been making use of the species in its research.
Fields says research such as hers is directly relevant for human conditions that relate to eating — “anorexia, obesity, diabetes — conditions like that.”
For example, the medication semaglutide, which includes the high-profile brand Ozempic and is used for diabetes control and to curb obesity, is understood to work by mimicking the neuropeptides involved in the human feeding process.
Thanks to similarities between the neurotransmitters in crabs and the neurotransmitters in mammals, researchers can use what they learn “from our humble crabs to understand feeding behavior in higher order organisms,” she says — including people.
The project as it was designed also made it possible for Fields to track the entire research process instead of it being spread out through several different labs. That’s not always possible, she says.
“So I do feed the crabs,” Fields says. “I do dissect the crabs and prepare the samples from the tissue and all the way through.”
She records mass spectrometer readings that produce relevant information about the neuropeptides at the center of her research, then analyzes the data at the end to make sense of the whole feeding process.
A personal connection
Fields feels a personal connection to the research because of where she grew up. “Appalachia has historically higher rates of diabetes and heart disease, also mental health disorders, and it’s also been kind of really impacted by the opioid epidemic,” she says. “These are things that I grew up with, that’s a very real part of my everyday experience.”
And that background “is something that I keep in the back of my head,” Fields says. “Even on a hard day, it tells me what I’m working towards is helping the people back home overcome these types of things and have new alternative solutions that are maybe more affordable.”
Fields’ project was funded through an NIH fellowship program known as F-31,  directed at pre-Ph.D. researchers, and a specific category within that program set aside as diversity awards.
According to a now-expired NIH description, the F31 Diversity awards were made “to enhance the diversity of the health-related research workforce by supporting the research training of predoctoral students from diverse backgrounds including those from groups that are underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, or clinical research workforce.”
In her own research field, examining Alzheimer’s disease, Li says there’s “abundant evidence”  that the condition affects different ethnic groups differently — both in the outcomes it produces and in the biomarkers that are used to track the progression of the illness in a patient.
“The intention is to really help to address some systematic inequities in biomedical research,” Li says.
A more diverse research workforce can elevate the importance of considering a more diverse group of patients, helping researchers “really get a full understanding of the disease,” she says. “And there’s a lot of talk about precision medicine, personalized medicine and certain types of treatment that will be more effective to certain populations than others.”
Fields says that to qualify for the diversity research grant, “you have to jump through several hoops to really illustrate to them that you are somebody that has faced challenges that would warrant the diversity fellowship.”
But the academic qualifications are no less rigorous than what the regular F-31 grants require, she adds. Fields first applied in December 2023 and went through the process of refining the application before it was finally approved. The funding officially began in January 2025.  
“You have to be in the very strict, top percentage of the applications that were submitted to even get funded,” Fields says. The sudden decision to cut her project short leaves “a message that has been kind of hard to swallow.”
A short-term reprieve
Fields did get a short-term consolation: While the project was canceled in April, her funding for the current calendar year remained intact through December. But she was also told that the funds “can be terminated even earlier, which fortunately has not happened,” she says.
She has been able to continue the project, but she’s also had to accelerate it considerably.
“It’s now, OK, we need to hurry up and do the research with the time that we’re allotted,” Fields says — even as she has to watch over her shoulder in case the money is cut off sooner. “You have to move as fast as you can, or as efficiently as you can, because you don’t know when the rug is going to be pulled out from under you.”
The prospect of other funding to make up for the loss is unlikely.
“That was a conversation that we’ve had several times along the way,” says Fields. “When I found out that it was terminated [NIH officials] said, ‘Oh we would love to help you apply for other opportunities,’” she recalls.
Considering how much time elapsed between her original application and the grant’s arrival, however, “it’s a little tricky,” Fields adds. “I think they were really just trying to be supportive, but at the same time, not super practical.”
Private funding seems an unlikely prospect, Fields and Li say, with competition escalating while federal options are being curtailed.
“Research funding in general is a lot more difficult to get,” says Li. “It’s pretty hard to find replacement funding right away.”
In the meantime, Fields’ next step is to seek a post-doctoral fellowship — a task made more challenging because of widespread academic hiring freezes prompted in the wake of federal research funding cancellations.
She still has her eye on a career in academia, where she hopes to pursue research on personalized medicine for people in Appalachia.
Li says Fields is far from alone in her experience. Some colleagues across the country who were awarded fellowships through the diversity program saw their awards canceled “either right before or just a couple of months after when they started,” Li says, and their projects have ended before they even started.
“There are quite a few people. A range of research groups and programs are being affected,” Li says. “This could have even a longer-term impact on our country’s biomedical research.”

This area, like others NM Wild identified, has “wilderness characteristics” that might be ignored if conservation is de-emphasized relative to extraction under the proposed rule’s rescission. (Photo courtesy BLM)A prominent New Mexico environmental advocacy group has identified wild areas comprising more than 210 square miles across the state that will lose an important defense if a 2024 federal land use rule is rescinded.
The Department of Interior late last week announced in the Federal Register that it would seek to undo the “Public Land Rule,” formally known as the Conservation and Landscape Health Rule, which Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a news release stands in the way of oil and gas development, along with other extractive uses of federal public land. 
The Bureau of Land Management last April finalized the rule, which provided guidance for ensuring conservation of public lands received due consideration along with mining, timber, grazing, recreation or other uses. It also allowed the BLM to issue leases specifically for conservation, though none has been issued yet, said Sally Paez, a staff attorney for New Mexico Wild, in an interview Monday with Source New Mexico.
She said the rule only reiterated and provided guidance for a 1976 law called the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, which provides the BLM with a framework for balancing multiple public land uses. The rule lets the agency protect “intact, functioning landscapes” along with emphasizing landscape health through the use of science, data and Indigenous knowledge.
Public comment on USDA plan to repeal ‘roadless’ rule opens Friday

The rule being rescinded could have implications for all 13.5 million acres of BLM land in New Mexico, particularly those that are not currently designated for oil and gas extraction or other economic uses and those that don’t have existing wilderness protections, Paez said. 
The nonprofit, with the help of a “citizen inventory” done by volunteers, has identified more than a dozen areas comprising 134,600 acres that her office said have “wilderness characteristics,” but no protections as such. Those characteristics include being bigger than 5,000 acres with “opportunities for solitude” or recreation. 


Without the Public Lands Rule, New Mexico Wild won’t be able to argue that those areas across the state, which she said are popular with hikers and other recreators, should be protected. 
“Those are really the areas that for us, I think, we’re most worried about because under the Public Land rule, we had an argument for those,” she said. “‘This is an intact landscape.’”
The public can comment on the proposed rule rescission until Nov. 10. 
In addition to the “citizen inventory” areas NM Wild identified, Paez pointed out a handful of other places popular with hikers on BLM lands that might benefit from the Public Lands Rule if it is allowed to stay on the books. Those areas include the Caja Del Rio near Santa Fe; San Lorenzo Canyon south of Albuquerque; Quebradas Mountains in Socorro; the Florida Mountains near Deming; and Montezuma Crest near Placitas. 
By the #s: Nearly a quarter of the Gila is protected as ‘roadless.’ Those protections could be nixed

And the Pecos River Watershed could benefit from the restoration leases enabled by the rule, she said, which could offset the impacts of intensive oil and gas extraction in the Permian Basis by restoring riparian and aquatic habitat.
“That’s the type of project that I could definitely see being really good,” she said. 
Paez said the BLM’s effort to rescind the Public Lands Rule is comparable to the Forest Service undoing the Roadless Rule, which nixes protections against timber harvesting in designated wild forest areas. Public comments for that proposal are being accepted through Friday. 
“It’s all kind of this broad pattern of a policy shift towards short term gain and extraction and corporate interests, and out of public values and shared resources,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/52663977775_909548a87d_4k-1024x499.jpg,,,2025-09-16 12:57:33.570822

The Ocean State’s largest public research campus is one of multiple sites awarded NIH grants to set freshman and sophomores on the pathway to STEM fields via the ESTEEMED program. But President Donald Trump’s administration’s new priorities for federal funds have put URI’s program on a seesaw.
On March 21, the feds notified URI in a letter that the ESTEEMED grant had been terminated.
“This award no longer effectuates agency priorities,” the letter reads. “Research programs based primarily on artificial and non-scientific categories, including amorphous equity objectives, are antithetical to the scientific inquiry, do nothing to expand our knowledge of living systems, provide low returns on investment, and ultimately do not enhance health, lengthen life, or reduce illness.”
It continues: “Worse, so-called diversity, equity, and inclusion (‘DEI’) studies are often used to support unlawful discrimination on the basis of race and other protected characteristics, which harms the health of Americans.”
URI appealed the NIH termination in April and was turned down June 12. Then, to Meenach’s surprise, the grant was reinstated on July 1. Shortly after, Meenach said she received some unusual and “very strong” advice from her NIH program manager, a longtime civil servant Meenach described as being “very careful about what she says.” 
The manager advised, and NIH ultimately approved, for URI to pay full stipends for the fall semester for the 12 students currently enrolled, shielding them from a possible mid-semester disruption in their studies. 
“We don’t normally do that,” Meenach said of the lump sum’s approval. “We normally pay them monthly.”
When first awarded, URI’s grant was set to provide $1.15 million over four years. Enrolled students get stipends of $10,000 as freshmen and $12,000 in their sophomore year. 
Students’ housing and food costs are covered for a five-week development course in the summer before their freshman year. Throughout the academic year, they receive one-on-one mentoring, meet weekly and study with their peers, and participate in workshops. 
Crucial to the program is research-based coursework — optional as a freshman, but required as a sophomore — which culminates in a full-time summer research session before junior year. Students must be full-time, maintain at least a 3.0 GPA, and participate in all the required program offerings to keep their awards. The funding is intended to allow students to focus on their research and avoid the need for a job off-campus and away from the lab.
Hamzeh Tanbakji, a junior pursuing a degree in mechanical engineering, was working in a microsystems lab on a drug delivery project that uses microscopic needles when he learned about the grant termination.  
“It made zero sense for me as to why they terminated it,” Tanbakji said. “Honestly, it didn’t really apply to ESTEEMED. They’re saying something with DEI, but ESTEEMED didn’t just support DEI students, it supported everybody.”
Eligible students are those who “identify as being from an underrepresented group or from a disadvantaged background,” according to a URI flyer for the program. The NIH website currently lists a definition of “underrepresented group” as “people from disadvantaged backgrounds, and underrepresented racial and ethnic groups such as blacks or African Americans, Hispanics or Latinos, American Indians or Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiians and other Pacific Islanders.”
The cancellation of the ESTEEMED grant was part of a nationwide purge that ceased approximately $783 million worth of funding for research under three February executive orders from President Donald Trump. Their aim was to eliminate federal spending on programs involving DEI, “gender ideology,” or COVID-related studies.   
“It did cut my research a little short, at least the funding,” said Tanbakji, a graduate of Cranston West High School, who grew up with a strong interest in cars, robotics, and hands-on engineering due in part to a childhood love of the TV show “How It’s Made.” “I was really upset over the cut because it played a big role in my college experience, my research experience, my academics, finances, everything.”
Even with the funding issues, Tanbakji called his ESTEEMED program experience “10 out of 10” and said he will “forever be proud to call myself an esteemed scholar.”
“If I didn’t have the program, I would say I probably would have never pursued research, probably would have never been as professionally developed as I am now,” Tanbakji added.
Possibility of federal shutdown
Meenach said her federal liaison could not tell her much else on the rationale behind the haste, beyond an implication that something might happen after the federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1.
So far, Congress has not passed any spending bills covering the full year. A stopgap could temporarily resolve the issue, but without any short-term budgeting solution, a government shutdown could occur. Funding streams and federal agency operations — including those of NIH — could be interrupted, with delays trickling down to grantees.
When asked about URI’s grant specifically, a late Friday afternoon email signed by the NIH Press Team said the agency “does not discuss grant deliberations related to individual recipient institutions, awards, or supported investigators, whether or not such deliberations are underway or have occurred.”
“We remain committed to the advancement of policies that maximize the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar and ensure proper oversight of this funding,” the email reads. “Moving forward, NIH will continue to focus on supporting meritorious and important biomedical research, while at the same time ensuring NIH’s portfolio aligns with agency priorities.”
The NIH Press Team added that the agency’s director, Jay Bhattacharya, has repeatedly emphasized “the national need for and our agency’s commitment to supporting career continuity for early career researchers,” and cited remarks made at a Senate Appropriations hearing and on the director’s podcast.
To her knowledge, Meenach said, URI’s ESTEEMED program was the first in the nation to be canceled this year. A document shared by NIH which lists terminated grants includes nine ESTEEMED programs, with terminations starting April 17. The URI program is not listed. 
The March letter incensed Meenach, who called the language “offensive.”
“Yes, it’s a diversity program, you can certainly call it that,” Meenach said. “But you know, you can’t convince me that providing students an opportunity that they wouldn’t otherwise have harmed the health of Americans.”
At least two of the five ESTEEMED students in the program’s first cohort in 2023 “will probably go on to graduate school, and they didn’t even know what that was before starting the program,” Meenach said.

“I said it was racism,” Meenach recalled telling her students. “I don’t think I was being crazy for saying that, but you know, our sophomores in particular were really upset just because they were finishing the program and they knew firsthand … [the] impact it had had on them.”
URI’s ESTEEMED grant runs from May 1 to April 30 each year. Future shocks to the program could see the loss of its full-time coordinator, two graduate student assistants, and an undergraduate assistant, Meenach said.
“If this gets terminated again, I might be taking a leave of absence for my mental health,” Meenach said.
Meenach said she’s “very worried” about such an outcome. NIH’s approval of the semester-long payments arrived before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 for a partial stay on a June ruling by Massachusetts Senior Judge William Young, a Ronald Reagan appointee, in favor of the American Public Health Association in its lawsuit to reinstate funding for numerous plaintiffs seeking to have their NIH grants restored.
The Supreme Court’s Aug. 21 decision gives plaintiffs two options for contesting terminated grants. The first is that underlying grantmaking policies regarding DEI can still be challenged in federal district court. That’s partially why the Massachusetts case is still chugging along, with its next hearing scheduled for Thursday. 
But the second kind of challenge seeking to restore frozen or canceled funds must be tried in the Court of Federal Claims, the Supreme Court decided. That could narrow the possibility of a financial victory, even if researchers’ cases win on merits in district courts, as Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote in her opinion. 
The ruling, Jackson argued, “neuters judicial review of grant terminations by sending plaintiffs on a likely futile, multivenue quest for complete relief.” 
Per the NIH’s email response: “NIH has issued amended Notices of Award for nearly all of the grants listed in the June 2025 Massachusetts court judgment. NIH will be reimbursing allowable costs as required by the judgment while the judgment is in effect.”

Delays and uncertainties
For Meenach, the program’s future beyond this semester is uncertain. She finds it unlikely URI could fund the entirety — about $20,000 a student across the program’s two years — on its own. Meenach said she’s “not optimistic about next year.” 
URI is overall heavily reliant on federal funding for its research activities. The school received about $131 million in federal research funding in 2024, which comprised the lion’s share of its total $161 million in research funding. 
Even research activity unable to fall under the DEI label has been impacted at URI, according to Bongsup Cho, who runs the statewide research incubator based at URI, the Rhode Island IDeA Network of Biomedical Research Excellence (RI-INBRE). The recipient of a multiyear NIH grant worth $4.1 million this fiscal year alone, RI-INBRE allocates and divides its spoils among research projects at universities across the state. The research unit is also one of the sites that hosts ESTEEMED students’ summer research.
Cho said in a recent phone interview that while awards typically go out in May, this year’s money did not emerge until early September. That monthslong delay sent research timelines helter-skelter and generated unease among researchers, Cho said.
“For me, I’m running a large capacity building program,” Cho said. “This is really tough, having uncertainty and the big delay in funding…We’re doing what we can, but this may not be sustainable if this goes on for another three years.”
With ESTEEMED, Meenach said she’s prepared for a few outcomes. If changes do land in October, the school could reapply and revise its application for a grant to keep the pipeline relatively intact. If the termination comes back, then she imagines the school will have to step in and bridge support. 
“They terminated us in mid-March, and everybody else got to finish,” Meenach said. “If we had just been allowed to finish out all these grants and then let NIH figure out what the new direction was going to be like, we could have at least recovered faster. And I think we’re just not going to recover for a really, really long time.”
Meenach also runs the Particle Engineering Laboratory in URI’s College of Engineering, which designs particle-based drug-delivery systems, especially for pulmonary diseases. For her, the stakes of a helping hand in STEM education are not abstract. 
A first-generation college student from rural Kentucky who grew up in a town of 186 people, Meenach applied to a summer research program as an undergraduate not for any particular love for research — she said she just needed a job. But research won her heart after she completed a National Science Foundation graduate fellowship and an NIH postdoctoral fellowship later.
“I know firsthand the impact of these training programs — they’re literally transformational,” she said. “I would not be a faculty member if I hadn’t done these programs.”

(Photo by Evan Houk/Maine Morning Star)Gov. Janet Mills denounced a proposal from Central Maine Power that could increase electricity rates for customers by more than $1.4 billion.
In July, the private utility company informed the Public Utilities Commission that it intended to file a new five-year rate plan that included reliability and resiliency investments, as well as improvements to customer experience. The plan, which was officially submitted Tuesday, is projected to increase the company’s revenue by more than $430 million. 
“I recognize that investing in our grid to improve reliability is important, but this request is massive and unacceptable,” Mills said, adding that it “blatantly ignores the economic reality that Maine people face every day,” especially rural residents, seniors on fixed incomes and small businesses. 
Energy prices are complex. Here’s what Maine lawmakers can and have done to lower them

Maine Public Advocate Heather Sanborn also expressed concern over the scale of the proposal and how it will affect the pockets of ratepayers. The PUC will review the case over the next several months before deciding whether to go forward with it. If approved, the plan would increase rates starting in October 2026.
Based on numbers from CMP, the average customer could ultimately see their power bill increase by $36 a month or more than $400 per year.
“This is an enormous increase,” Sanborn said. “At a time when many families are already struggling to afford their bills, CMP’s proposal asks Mainers to pay even more.”
The average CMP residential customer paid roughly $155 in August, up from $140 this time last year. Customers in Versant’s Bangor Hydro District saw their bills go up just over $20 this past year, from $148 to $169, while the average Versant Maine Public District consumer saw their bill increase from about $144 to $162.
Furthermore, Mills said the proposal undermines legislation that she signed in 2022, which requires utility companies to file a 10-year plan to determine what upgrades will be needed to improve grid reliability and resilience while taking into account the state’s climate policy goals and cost-effectiveness for ratepayers.

CMP has said that the plan is designed to build a “smarter, stronger, more resilient grid,” so it can better serve customers by reducing associated costs from potential storms and supporting a switch to clean energy. 
Greater attention has been paid to grid resilience after the state faced several unprecedented winter storms in 2023 and 2024 that incurred significant costs to ratepayers. In the storms’ wake, Mills established the Infrastructure Rebuilding and Resilience Commission to find ways to shore up the state’s energy systems against future severe storms. The commission’s final report came out in May 2025, highlighting the need to improve the grid, especially as the state moves toward greater electrification of transportation and home heating and cooling systems. 
“What is clear from this filing is that CMP is only willing to make the necessary investments in the grid if given a disproportionate and exorbitant return on their investment, at the expense of Maine people,” said Seth Berry, executive director of Our Power and former chair of the Legislature’s Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee.
As the public advocate, Sanborn will represent ratepayers throughout the Public Utility Commission’s review of CMP’s proposal, but she is also urging the public to provide feedback at two public hearings the commission is hosting. 
The first public hearing is scheduled for 6 p.m. on Oct. 14 at the Hilton Garden Inn in Freeport. The second one is scheduled for 6 p.m. on Oct. 15 at the PUC office — 26 Katherine Dr. in Hallowell. 
Mills also said she directed the Governor’s Energy Office to oppose the request through the PUC’s review process. 
“We need to ensure electricity distribution costs don’t spiral out of control, especially as our state encourages people to electrify their homes and vehicles to meet climate goals,” Sanborn added. “Affordability must remain front and center.”
The Office of the Public Advocate has an explanation of PUC case filings on its website and guidance on how to get involved.

(Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — A University of Kansas law professor says President Donald Trump’s tariffs against more than 100 countries violate international trade law and harm the United States by undercutting its economy, military alliances and global political influence.
Raj Bhala, the KU law school’s first distinguished professor, said Trump’s second term was highlighted by an attempt to draw overseas industries and jobs to the United States under a strategy built on populist distrust of foreign sources of trade. He said the administration’s approach equated to “xenophobic autarky,” which referred to moving a country toward economic self-sufficiency and limited trade because of hostility against foreign people or goods.
“Trade law is being destroyed through a series of ‘America First’ unilateral trade measures, which violate international and, in some cases, U.S. law,” he said. “Preserving trade law is important because destroying legal rules and diplomatic norms hurts the U.S. by eroding its economy and political soft power and its hard power military alliances.”
Bhala, who has been on the KU law faculty since 2003, made a case for the xenophobic autarky designation Monday during a campus lecture and in a pair of 100-page articles published by University of Texas International Law Journal.
“So, 200 pages to chronicle and critique 200 days of the greatest upheaval in international trade law in nearly 80 years since the end of the second world war,” he said.
Diplomatically, he said, the way in which the Trump administration levied tariffs during the period “shattered all norms of decorum and dignity … of how we’ve traditionally behaved towards foreign countries.”
He said the administration’s handling of trade was “maximalist — leave nothing on the table.”
“Empathy, even with least-developed countries like Laos, let alone advanced ones like Canada, is weakness. That’s the thesis,” Bhala said.
 
‘Devilish’ trade war
In the 100 days from January to April, the U.S. adopted tariffs against Canadian, Mexican and Chinese merchandise under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, under the explanation they were tied to fentanyl and immigration trafficking. The U.S. issued reciprocity tariffs of at least 10% under IEEPA. In addition, industry-specific tariffs of more than 25% were implemented under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.
From April to August, Trump shot through trade rules and norms to raise the U.S.’s Most Favored Nation tariff rate to its highest level since the Great Depression. It surged from 2.3% to 15.2%, which Bhala said broke the 1947 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
Bhala said even if the U.S. Supreme Court found against Trump in a pending challenge to his tariff agenda, the president could sustain extraordinary tariffs by executive order or by convincing Congress to change federal law.
“These tariff regimes have turned an arguably just trade war against China into a devilish global trade war,” Bhala said. “We do not live in an era of change, but rather in a changed era. The change in eras is from free trade or at least managed trade to protectionism. That change of eras is from leadership to bullying.”
Bhala said to look no further than De Soto for evidence of how the trade war could impact Kansas.
In July, Panasonic began producing electric vehicle batteries at a plant built after the state of Kansas dangled hundreds of millions of dollars in incentives to attract 4,000 jobs. About that same time, the U.S. Department of Commerce hit China with a special import tax on goods.
The sanction was in response to China selling graphite, a component in batteries, at prices below home market prices. The duty could add $1,000 to the price of an EV battery made in De Soto, he said, and the consumer cost of those batteries would rise.
“What about those De Soto factory workers who might suffer a job loss or diminution of income because electric vehicles are less competitive in the market?” he said.
 
Futile or fabulous?
Bhala said the United States was fracturing its credibility as a reliable global trading partner. Steady trading partners such as Canada responded by leaning into new business alliances with other countries, he said. The process provided an incentive for India to focus more on trade with China and Russia, he said.
He said the Trump administration’s reasoning for setting fire to international trade law ranged from the need to enhance national security, shrink the federal budget deficit, reduce trade deficits, fight trade agreement cheaters and protest foreign court decisions. There are reasonable arguments against each of those explanations, he said.
“Because xenophobic autarky is futile,” Bhala said, “it is a goal that cannot and should not be achieved.”
Members of the Kansas congressional delegation have debated Trump’s manipulation of markets with tariff barriers.
The result of trade negotiations gives U.S. businesses, including farmers, better access to overseas markets and would help onshore manufacturing within the domestic economy, said U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kansas.
“The success of President Trump’s strategic application of tariffs cannot be overstated,” Marshall said last month. “By securing these trade deals, we’re reestablishing American national security, economic prosperity and our standing internationally.”
U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, also a Kansas Republican, raised objections in April by sponsoring legislation that would create a sunset provision in federal law that would expire a president’s  tariff orders after 60 days unless Congress passed a joint resolution to approve them. Moran, who has advocated for free and open trade, also said unilateral tariffs were harmful to the state’s farmers and aerospace manufacturers.
In the presentation at KU, Bhala described his analysis as nonpartisan and contended that he didn’t assess trade policy based on the platform of political parties or disposition of political leaders.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Raj-Bhala-ku-law-and-tariffs-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-16 11:58:33.695325

For teachers, parents and students,  the first day of the fall semester was an ordinary August day in central Mississippi. Hot, humid and long. 
For administrators, it was the end of a probation that started over half of a century ago.
After 55 years, the Department of Justice lifted Copiah County School District’s desegregation order. The district had integrated to the agency’s satisfaction and can now forgo regular audits that check for inequity.
However, across the county, parents along a racial divide still see existing inequalities: better facilities and programs in mostly white Wesson and older buildings and few offerings in Crystal Springs, which is majority-Black.
Sixteen years after the U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark Brown v. Board of Education declared segregated schools were unconstitutional, Mississippi was compelled by a subsequent court decision to dismantle its dual school system beginning in 1970. Some districts like Copiah County faced specific desegregation orders based on their level of compliance.
“The goal was to ensure that school districts were meeting their obligations,” said Shaheena Simons, who up until April worked for the Civil Rights Division in the Department of Justice. “That meant that the DOJ would ask questions and would review information and would sometimes go out on site and talk to people. The goal was to ensure that the school district was treating students fairly.”

In 1970, Copiah County School District joined over 200 others across the South under school  desegregation orders: 33 in Mississippi,  53 in Alabama, 49 in Georgia, 44 in Louisiana, 28 in South Carolina, 27 in North Carolina and 35 in Virginia. Now, 29 districts remain under that order in Mississippi, 30 in Georgia, 12 in Louisiana, and 39 in Alabama. The other Southern states have fewer than five districts remaining. 
More than 50 school districts were released from DOJ desegregation orders during Donald Trump’s first presidential term, more than during the two terms of Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush and the single term of George H.W. Bush. President Ronald Reagan released just under 150 school districts from orders, more than any other president.
In July, Copiah County School District Superintendent Rickey Clopton submitted paperwork through the board attorney after communication from the Department of Justice that the new administration intended to clear desegregation orders with a greater sense of urgency than past administrations. He didn’t expect to hear back so soon. The turnaround was a week.
“We’re just fortunate that someone in the Department of Justice has taken the initiative to try to settle some of these things and get us out of the past and move into the future,” Clopton told Mississippi Today.
The court order came down on the first day of school – and was news to longtime administrators and local activists. One central office employee found out from a press release, while an assistant superintendent got the news from a 20-second evening news clip. The local NAACP chapter president didn’t know until Mississippi Today informed him.
District officials hadn’t visited a courtroom, stood before a judge or escorted DOJ officials around Copiah County’s  four public schools in over a decade. Instead, assistant superintendents would traditionally go classroom to classroom to count students and staff by race and the school attorney would write up a report. Facilities and extracurricular offerings at each school were compared. So were yearbook spreads. The documents were slipped into an envelope and sent to a federal judge and emailed every March and October. 
The cycle would repeat until the court was pleased.
“ We were trying to justify what we were doing, but it had been very difficult for someone sitting in an office in Washington, D.C., to understand. It was the most frustrating part of the job that we totally understood and totally wanted to comply with but could not,” said Martha Traxler, longtime assistant superintendent with the district. She noted the challenges in particular of recruiting enough Black teachers.
Whether the school district made adequate progress was regular chatter in barber shops and on front porches for decades. Whether in a cafe in Crystal Springs or outside the Stop N Wash in Wesson or sipping on a tea on the patio of Stark’s Restaurant in Hazlehurst, you’re likely to hear a different story with characters depicted as negligent or stretched thin, malicious or doing the best they could with what they’ve got.
But in each telling of the county’s crawl towards progress, some details remain true, some statistics are irrefutable and some comparisons speak for themselves.
The county schools
Copiah County is mostly rural with lush farmland, three quaint towns and one county school district and a separate city school district in Hazelhurst. The county district has a K-12 school to the south in Wesson, which is 73.7 percent white with a student body over 78% white. It also has a high school, middle school and elementary school to the north in Crystal Springs, which is over 65% Black with a student body nearly 80% Black.
Wesson Attendance Center, established in 1960 with a new high school campus built in 1978, has all three schools on one expansive stretch of green bordered by trees. The campus boasts impressive facilities, including a separate baseball and softball field and  an indoor basketball court with maple floors.
Until 1978, Wesson students attended high school on the campus of Copiah-Lincoln Community College, whose football field Wesson students still practice and play on.

Crystal Springs High School, built in 1928, stands on the same few acres of land as Crystal Springs Elementary School. The campus has a football field with a track as well as a baseball field. The high school is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A past district administrator, two former teachers, one current teacher and three current students cited their concerns about aging and unclean facilities in interviews with Mississippi Today.
Crystal Springs Middle School is housed in the old Black high school, the William H. Holtzclaw School, which was built in 1958. Now, 67 years later, the campus remains seven  single-story brick buildings partly connected by breezeways and bordered by chain link. It’s apparent that the school was built as cheaply as possible, said former superintendent Dale Sullivan. The ceiling supports are a fraction of the size they should be. 
It’s also the worst performing school in the district. For the last four years, the school, which had a 2023-24 enrollment of 368 students, has received a “D” on the state accountability system. 
On average, while the district spends $179 more per pupil at Crystal Springs’ schools than Wesson’s, Crystal Springs teaches 383 more students.
August 1970
Jimmy Buchanan, who is Black, still remembers the day he became principal of Crystal Springs High School, one of the first integrated high schools in the county. He was recruited at age 28 from the Hotzclaw School for Black students.
“I just assumed that that’s just the way it was. Everything had always been separate that way and they just kept it like it was,” he told Mississippi Today.
School was set to open the following week when the desegregation order came down. Superintendent George Myers delayed school for a week. He called a reluctant Buchanan into his office and offered him the principal position at Crystal Springs. Buchanan was content at Hotzclaw and didn’t want the position but was told he had no choice  because there would be no Hotzclaw in a week’s time.
In the days leading up to the first day of school, he was up past midnight working on rearranging schedules for students. 
“It was different,” he said. “Because you had whites and Blacks that (had) never been together. And you had white teachers that never taught Black students.”
By the first day of school, enrollment at Crystal Springs High School was 66% Black, the middle school was 71% Black and the elementary school 81% Black. Many white families enrolled their children in Copiah Academy, which had recently expanded after merging with a segregation academy in Crystal Springs in April. Construction on a larger private school was underway.
Buchanan was undermined both by white parents who felt he was favoring Black students because of his race and by Black parents who felt he was favoring white students because of the racial make-up of the district office. They thought he was a token.

For the first semester at least, there were no assemblies. It took enough time and energy for district employees to manage new schedules and bus routes. Black and white students had to be equally represented in each class. Band and football were first reintroduced with an integrated roster.
“The idea was that the less contact these kids had with each other initially until they got used to doing what they were doing, the better. ‘Cause there was always some smart little kid that said something that he shouldn’t,” said Sullivan, who served as superintendent from 1973 to 2001.
The school board attorney went from school to school meeting with parents about “what’s fixing to happen.”
For the first few decades after the order, the district made do with a lot of “co-’s” – a white student body president and a Black student body president, a white homecoming queen and a Black homecoming queen. Even for superlatives like ‘best dressed” and “most likely to succeed” there was Black and white representation.
It was implemented not because of friction but because of what might happen should tensions arise, said Sullivan.
“I would say integration was as smooth as it could have been,” Buchanan said. “It got as integrated as you’re going to get. … At least here.”
Sullivan remembers how some white families were committing fraud to be zoned into Wesson schools, which remained primarily white, because of “housing patterns.” They would move campers to land owned by friends and family in Wesson in time for school registration.
Greg Brock, who was a high school senior then and wrote columns for the local paper, remembers no fights on campus but plenty of tantrums in town. His dad’s auto body shop was boycotted by locals who disapproved of his columns urging people to accept change. He remembers a racist rant from a customer.
In a column at the time for the city newspaper, he wrote “How is school? … What has happened? … How do we like the teacher? … Will it work? These questions and many more permeate the minds of interested persons as the school year of 1970-71 progresses.”
August 2005
In August 2005, the county schools were declared integrated except for staff and teacher assignments. The court order came down during another weeklong school delay with this one brought by Hurricane Katrina.
The storm knocked out power for many residents in Copiah County and destroyed homes. Some students enrolled in schools in neighboring states.
When school resumed, “I don’t think the numbers changed as much as it was more or less accepted among the races that: ‘Hey, Black teachers are not as bad as we thought. They can teach. They’re really knowledgeable. Hey, white teachers, they do care. And they are human beings, too,’” Buchanan said. 
The challenge for assistant superintendent Traxler who took on the role of assistant superintendent in 2003 was to find enough Black teachers for predominantly white Wesson. The court order demanded that the ratio of Black and white students in each school reflect the ratio of Black and white teachers at the school.
Traxler traveled to job fairs, visited local high schools and colleges, set up booths at conventions and approved faculty transfers – but the percentages didn’t seem to budge. 
Until her retirement in 2016, Traxler experienced a worsening teacher shortage, which made the job of satisfying the DOJ orders more difficult. She struggled to find more than a single qualified math and science teacher at conventions in her later years on the job. 
“It was impossible what they asked of us. Even if we transferred teachers over. They mostly didn’t want to commute further. They would’ve chosen another district,” Traxler said.
In the district’s most recent status report for the Department of Justice and the courts, percentages of white and Black teachers at the four schools remained stagnant. District officials were seeing no change. The percentage of Black teachers at Wesson’s schools hovered around 10%.
“The only thing we had left is to balance out the professional staff of our schools without transferring them out from all sides of the county,” said Superintendent Clopton. “It was unrealistic because of the patterns of where people lived and patterns of where people want to work.”
September 2025: Crystal Springs

Crystal Springs High School senior Marissa Marsaw remembers the first time she played Wesson High School in volleyball. She slung her duffel bag on a spare chair and marvelled at the locker room for guest teams. It had clean floors without rat poop and roaches, an entire working restroom, and new-looking lockers. 
She couldn’t believe she was in the same school district. 
Only 22 miles down Highway 51 from her native Crystal Springs, she encountered a very different city and school. A school where students could partake in a robotics team and a Beta club. She had grown accustomed to fundraising for the softball team by selling M&M’s and other candies to cover fees and equipment. Wesson had its own stadium.
Marissa Marsaw said  it disturbed her and her mother to learn that Wesson and Crystal Springs hold high school graduations on the same day – and that board members, split along lines of race and geography, didn’t attend the others.

Three current Crystal Springs students expressed concerns about dirty locker rooms and a lack of class trips and extracurriculars like robotics. 
“The district gives to who they want to give to,” Crystal Springs senior Alivia Newell said. “I don’t think they want us to be a better school.”
They acknowledge community members are more comfortable voicing concerns online but not in person. It doesn’t help that the Copiah County School District holds board meetings at 3 p.m. on a weekday when most parents and teachers are still at work and students are just getting out of class.
Marsaw and her friends gather at Book Street Cafe in downtown Crystal Springs some days after school. They interact with classmates from not just the local high school.
Greg Brock, the proprietor and a former New York Times and Washington Post editor, bought the cafe last year after moving home. He had gotten his start as a student journalist at the city paper and covered integration and its aftermath.
Mid-to-late afternoon on a weekday, his cafe boasts a lively clientele that pretty much represents the diversity of the city. Teens pull books from the shelves and sip on colorful refreshments and frappes.
It’s meaningful for Brock who believes the death of the city came with white flight.
“They wrote that school off,” he said of the Crystal Springs schools. “That’s the day this town started dying. When whites started abandoning it.”
September 2025: Wesson
Across the county, in Wesson, locals had been congregating at Wash N Stop for years. From the outside, it resembles an ordinary gas station convenience store with a regular crowd of commuters and townies. It’s the most active parking lot in town.
To many in Wesson, Larry Ashley is best known as the proprietor of the convenience store that serves mouth-watering fried chicken and potato wedges. Ashley also builds homes with the help of his son.
Ashley, who has lived in Wesson most of his life, switched to Hazlehurst City School District from Wesson his junior year but was recruited to join Copiah Academy’s football team his senior year. He went on to attend Copiah-Lincoln Community College and graduate from Mississippi State University. 
“I think Crystal Springs has all the same things that Wesson has school-wise,” Ashley said. “But they’re starting a hundred-yard dash with 10 kids that have to run an extra 10 yards to get to the finish line. So what does a teacher have to do? A teacher has to lower her standards.”
For mom Barbie Stroud,who is white and new to Wesson, the decision to home school while her family lived in Crystal Springs was easy.
“The schools are just not the same,” she said.
She feared school fights that she heard about in Crystal Springs and Hazlehurst would endanger her child’s wellbeing. She didn’t want her child around purported gangs in those communities.
At Crystal Springs High School, nearly 44% of the student population was suspended in 2023-2024 with 45 violent incidents reported. Less than 10% of Wesson Attendance Center students were suspended the same year with 12 violent incidents.
One has double the chance of becoming a victim of violent crime in Crystal Springs than in Wesson, though a majority of crimes reported are property crimes.
Wesson is a town where, in the words of one resident, “the most common crime is speeding tickets and residents keep each other accountable on Facebook.” Public school teaching posts are hardly vacant because a majority of teachers are from the community.
“I wouldn’t drop my kid by himself at a football game there on a Friday night,” Stroud said of Crystal Springs.
Crystal Springs has  some extracurriculars that Stroud wants for her child, such as JROTC and more vocational classes.
Blake Allen, a Wesson graduate and musician, said the problem is that the accountability system used by Mississippi public schools incentivizes teachers to raise the bottom 25 more than work with the middle 50 or top 25. He feels his kid wouldn’t get the same attention in a Crystal Springs classroom where many more students are starting off with less knowledge.
He also said Wesson’s facilities seem nicer.
“There’s probably more favoritism towards Wesson,” Allen acknowledged.
A ‘cultural difference’
When asked whether the schools in Crystal Springs and Wesson are similar in quality, Copiah County residents and stakeholders held up statistics, rattled off anecdotes and shared photos of leaking roofs. 
Among Crystal Springs students, 34% on average enroll in college and 31% take an advanced placement course in high school. Among Wesson students, 77.6% enroll in college and 63% take an advanced placement course.
Wesson is an “A” school. Crystal Springs High School is a “B” school.

Kenneth Thrasher, who is Black, remembers a tense conversation with administrators in the central office about a transfer for his high-achieving daughter from Wesson to Crystal Springs. They wanted him to keep her there. 
But he felt a “cultural difference” at Wesson. He was getting messages from a teacher he felt didn’t have experience teaching enough Black students. The teacher scrutinized his daughter’s knack for dancing when popular music was played in class. He also didn’t like that she was a minority in the classroom.
The decision to return her to Crystal Springs Elementary wasn’t hard. 
“I had seen the last Confederate flag fly in the line-up at parent pick-up,” he told Mississippi Today.
Asked whether the Copiah County School District successfully integrated to the extent there isn’t a noticeable Black school and white school, a majority of the more than a dozen local residents surveyed by Mississippi Today said no.
Crystal Springs has the Black schools in the district and Wesson the white ones, they said.
“We are all prejudiced,” Ashley said. “Because if I walk into a football game, you got families, mama, daddy, Black, white, Mexican, whatever, sitting in the middle section. And in another section you’ve got Black looking thugs, dreadlocks, all this stuff. I ain’t saying they’re bad people. You got white tattooed out all over their faces and all this thug looking white guys over here. And I’ve got my 9- and 10-year-old daughter with me. Where am I going to sit? I’m going to choose the family section in the middle. Is that prejudice? Maybe so, but I’m still going to choose it.”
Mississippi Today also asked stakeholders whether moving a certain percentage of Black teachers to Wesson changed the dynamic in the county between the races and community schools.
A majority of school officials said it would be hard to say.
“A part of me felt that I didn’t achieve the goal that I set out to achieve, which was to get everyone to love our school as much as I did,” said former assistant superintendent Traxler. “I’d like to say I can’t change hearts. Only God can do that.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/15164124/IMG_2917.jpg,,,2025-09-16 10:56:29.117398

(File photo by Robin Bravender/States Newsroom)Lawmakers in South Carolina have set a hearing for Senate Bill 323, the most extreme abortion ban our state has ever faced and among the harshest in the nation.
This bill doesn’t just ban abortion; it criminalizes doctors, patients, families, and even neighbors who share information or offer support.
It is an unprecedented attack on health care, free speech, and the basic freedoms we have relied on for generations.
Unlike most legislation, S.323 is moving outside the regular session. On Wednesday, Oct. 1 at 9:30 a.m. in the Gressette Building on Statehouse grounds, South Carolinians could have their only chance to testify in person. If the public is not heard at this stage, the bill could advance in the Senate without meaningful input from the very people it harms.
Here’s what the bill would do:

Ban medication abortions and even the manufacture or possession of drugs that induce an abortion.
Remove exceptions for rape, incest, and fatal fetal anomaly.
Repeal current protections that prevent prosecution of pregnant people, exposing patients themselves to criminal penalties.
Impose felony charges of up to 30 years and permanent license revocation on physicians and providers.
Criminalize helping someone travel out of state for abortion care.
Gag doctors, advocates, and even friends from sharing information on how to obtain an abortion, including online.
Allow family members to sue doctors, helpers, or anyone who aids or abets abortion, treating them like organized criminals.

In real terms, this means that if a frightened teenager turns to her aunt, teacher, or friend’s parent for help getting out-of-state care, those adults could be criminalized.
A 10-year-old raped by a family member would be forced to carry and give birth to her rapist’s child.
A woman experiencing pregnancy complications could find her doctors delaying or denying care out of fear of prosecution.
The cruelty of this bill cannot be overstated. It creates a web of surveillance, punishment, and fear that will ensnare families, friends, doctors, and communities.
This is not who we are. South Carolinians deserve compassion, health care, and freedom — not punishment, censorship, and cruelty.
Abortion is health care. Contraception is health care. In vitro fertilization is health care. Miscarriage management is health care.
These are private, personal decisions that belong to families and patients, not politicians.
At the Women’s Rights & Empowerment Network, we know that bans do not stop abortion; they only make it less safe.
What bans like S.323 do succeed in is silencing women, targeting families, and criminalizing entire communities.
Sharing your story — whether it’s about abortion, contraception, miscarriage, or fertility care — helps lawmakers see the real lives affected by these decisions.
The fight for freedom and dignity in South Carolina has never been more urgent.
We must defend the rights, health, and futures of all our families. The potential consequences of the bill are devastating, and the stakes are too high.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/abortion-supco-bravender-1024x768-1.jpg,,,2025-09-16 10:56:29.117398

Delaware State Parks may see changes to entrance, annual, and lifetime pass fees for the first time in a decade, as the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) weighs options to sustain operations under rising costs and record visitation.
Park fees have remained unchanged since 2015, despite expenses funded by user fees increasing by 127%.
 According to DNREC, the state park system is currently 65% self-funded through visitor fees that support daily operations, maintenance, lifeguards, restrooms, public safety, and programming.
Record Visitation and Economic Impact
In 2024, Delaware’s 17 state parks, along with its marina and accredited zoo, attracted 7.4 million visitors, generating $822 million in economic activity for tourism and local businesses. Since 2015, trips to Delaware State Parks have increased 35%, adding nearly 2 million more visitors.
According to a Rockport Analytics report:

Parks contributed $64 million to the state’s tax base, supporting the equivalent of 3,500 public school teachers or 900 students annually.

Parks supported 10,700 jobs through concessionaires, business partners, professional services, and finance and insurance.

For every dollar spent in the parks, 74 cents remained in Delaware’s economy.


Despite the strong economic impact, the state faced challenges over the summer. Coastal parks, including Cape Henlopen, Gordons Pond, Deauville Beach, Delaware Seashore, and Fenwick Island, had to close 94 times after reaching capacity.

“The user fees collected at Delaware State Parks help make our facilities and programs the best, earning our state the National Recreation and Park Association’s Gold Medal recognition for being the best managed state park system in the country two times in the last 10 years,” said Matthew Ritter, director of the DNREC Division of Parks and Recreation. 
“Unfortunately, our efforts to broaden revenue opportunities, find creative ways to reduce expenses and capitalize on the significant contributions by our Friends groups and volunteers are no longer enough to keep pace with the growth in expenditures.”
Public Open Houses Scheduled
DNREC will host three open houses to present proposed fee changes and gather public feedback:

Tuesday, Sept. 30, 5:30 – 7 p.m. – Blue Ball Barn, Alapocas Run State Park, 1914 W Park Dr., Wilmington, Del.

Wednesday, Oct. 1, 5:30 – 7 p.m. – Officers Club, Cape Henlopen State Park, 15099 Cape Henlopen Drive, Lewes, Del.

Thursday, Oct. 2, 5:30 – 7 p.m. – Killens Pond Nature Center, Killens Pond State Park, 5025 Killens Pond Road, Felton, Del.


Attendees will be able to review visitation, staffing cost, and revenue data, ask staff questions, and provide input. No formal presentation will be given; however, the public will be encouraged to complete a survey on the proposal after attending or reviewing the materials online, starting September 30.

(Photo by Peter Griffith/NASA)The state of Alaska is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to decide whether rural Alaskans should continue to get preferential fishing rights on most rivers and lakes within federal parks, preserves and reserves.
On Monday, the Alaska Department of Law asked the Supreme Court to reconsider a ruling from a three-judge panel from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the state’s existing two-tiered subsistence fishing system last month. 
State attorneys have argued unsuccessfully since 2021 that federal law, as interpreted by recent rulings from the Supreme Court, means the state, not the federal government, has the power to regulate fishing in navigable waters on federal land.
A federal law, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, requires that rural Alaskans be given preferential treatment when hunting and fishing are regulated in Alaska. Simultaneously, the Alaska Constitution forbids that kind of preference.
For decades, the result has been a two-tiered system under which the federal government regulates hunting and fishing on federal land and water, and the state regulates it everywhere else.
Under the state framework, someone from Anchorage would have the same fishing rights on the Kuskokwim River as someone who lives a mile away. Under the current system, the local resident gets priority in parts of the river within federal land.
In 2021, a regulatory dispute on the Kuskokwim River during a salmon shortage resulted in the federal government filing a lawsuit against the state. The Alaska Federation of Natives, Association of Village Council Presidents and other Native groups from across the state joined the lawsuit on the side of the federal government. 
In 2024, a U.S. District Court judge in Alaska ruled in favor of the federal government, but the state appealed that decision. Last month, three judges from the 9th Circuit again ruled in favor of the federal government. Rather than appeal the issue to the full 9th Circuit, the state is going directly to the Supreme Court.
The state’s filing on Monday was formally known as a “cert petition,” which asks the court to take up the case.
The court takes only about 1% of the cases it receives, though the acceptance rate is higher (about 5%) if the large number of cases involving prisoners representing themselves in court are excluded.
In a written statement announcing the filing, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy and Attorney General designee Stephen Cox said the state believes that federal law gives Alaska control of its navigable waters when it comes to fishing.
“Alaska is asking the Supreme Court to hold fast to the text, because fidelity to the law as written is the foundation of the rule of law,” Cox said in his statement.
Doug Vincent-Lang, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, said he believes the 9th Circuit decision “deepens a fractured system that undermines conservation, creates confusion, and threatens equitable access for all Alaskans. Salmon don’t recognize federal and state boundaries — our management shouldn’t either. We remain committed to sustainable management and will continue fighting for a system that works for every Alaskan. The Court should decide this case and reverse the Ninth Circuit.”
Attorneys representing Alaska Native groups said on Monday that they expected an appeal to the Supreme Court, even if they didn’t know the exact timing.
Nathaniel Amdur-Clark, who has represented the Kuskokwim River Intertribal Fish Commission in the lawsuit to date, said by text message on Monday that his clients “are disappointed, but not surprised, to see the state’s cert petition. It is just a continuation of the state’s push to undermine subsistence protections for Alaska Natives and rural Alaskans.”
The Supreme Court does not have a set timeline for considering the state’s petition, which will be taken up in a closed-door judicial conference after both sides of the argument file written briefs on the issue.

WILMINGTON – After weeks of uncertainty for riders, SEPTA restored bus, train, and rail service across the region on Saturday, September 14. 
While Wilmington commuters once again have access to full service, the agency says its funding challenges are far from resolved.
RELATED STORY: No more trains to Philly? DART responds to SEPTA cutbacks
In a message to riders, Scott A. Sauer, General Manager of SEPTA, acknowledged the strain of the past several weeks.
“With schedules changing back and forth, and new lists of routes running or not running, there has been more than a little uncertainty making it harder for our customers and employees alike to get through the day,” Sauer wrote.
Service Restored, But Transition May Be Uneven
Sauer emphasized that Wilmington buses and Regional Rail were included in the restored service.
“This Sunday, Sept. 14, we will begin restoring service across our Bus, Metro and Regional Rail systems,” the agency said. “This is a big undertaking, and I know there will still be some confusion as we make the transition.”
He admitted that sudden schedule shifts over the past month created challenges.
RELATED STORY: Recent SEPTA cuts would shut down Wilmington/Newark line amid massive budget crisis
“Over the past month, we’ve changed schedules three times already, sometimes with only a few days’ notice,” Sauer said. 
He asked passengers to remain patient as stability returns.
Fare Increase to Help Close Budget Gap
The service restoration also came with a systemwide fare increase. Bus and Metro rides rose from $2.50 to $2.90.
“This change has been part of our long-standing plan to close SEPTA’s budget gap. It is not new, but it is necessary,” Sauer said.
Funding Crisis Remains
Despite service being back on track, Sauer cautioned that a permanent solution is still needed.
“While we are restoring full service, I want to be clear that we still don’t have a long-term solution to the funding crisis that’s at the heart of it all,” he wrote.
For now, SEPTA has been permitted to shift funds originally intended for infrastructure and equipment upgrades.
Sauer closed his statement by thanking riders for their support.
“In the meantime, thank you for sticking with us during this challenging time. Your patience and support mean a lot as we work to restore the reliable, stable service our riders deserve.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/37810022704_5bbae87305_c-e1758029153705.jpg,,,2025-09-16 10:02:02.046968

Tim Walz and First Lady Gwen Walz read to a class of preschoolers during a visit to Pine Bend Elementary School in Inver Grove Heights for a meeting of the Children's Cabinet Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2025. (Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Gov. Tim Walz typically treats the Minnesota State Fair like his personal Super Bowl — trying new foods (this year the Uncrustaburger), touting one of his favorite rides (the Ye Old Mill) and making the rounds at TV and radio station booths for softball interviews.
Walz’s State Fair interviews this year centered around one question: Will you run for reelection? The governor was coy and reserved. He said he was taking his time assessing what was best for Minnesotans. Also, he said, the June death of his friend and close governing ally Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman weighed on him and delayed his reelection announcement.
“This one about broke me,” Walz told WCCO at the fair on Aug. 24, referring to Hortman’s death.
Nine days later, Walz was speaking in front of Deerwood Elementary School in Eagan. This time, he seemed more determined and animated, promising he was going to make Minnesota safer for children by pushing for gun control measures like a ban on so-called assault weapons.
What happened in those nine days? Yet another crisis that Walz had to manage, this time the killing of two children and wounding of 21 others in the Church of the Annunciation mass shooting.
The second-term DFL governor announced Tuesday that he’ll seek a third term, launching a campaign that will require him to convince Minnesotans that he’s been a steadying hand in the face of the multiple crises that have enveloped the state in recent years, including a once-in-a-century pandemic, civil unrest after the police murder of George Floyd, emerging fiscal instability and shocking political violence.
“We’re not done yet. And that’s why I’m running for reelection. I want to make Minnesota a place where everyone has a chance to succeed — in every corner of the state,” Walz said in his campaign launch video.

Another crisis has been state government’s own making: A wave of fraud in public programs is sure to be a centerpiece of the Republican campaign against him.
He’ll also need to persuade skeptical Minnesotans that he has a vision for another four years — a June KSTP poll found that just 43% of Minnesotans surveyed say Walz should run for a third term even though he remains broadly popular. The last time Minnesota voters were faced with a governor seeking a third term, they rejected Iron Range Democrat Gov. Rudy Perpich in 1990.
West metro Republican Rep. Kristin Robbins, 2022 GOP nominee for governor Scott Jensen and Kendall Qualls, an army veteran and health care executive, are challenging Walz. If they can raise money and blanket the media, they’ll have plenty to work with to attack Walz’s nearly eight years in office, from flagging school test scores to fraud-riddled public programs.
“Minnesotans cannot afford four more years of higher taxes, failing schools, unsafe streets, fraud and policies that undermine fairness for women and girls,” said Minnesota Republican Party Chair Alex Plechash in a statement. “… Minnesota families are worse off under his leadership. It’s time for new leadership and a fresh direction. Minnesota deserves better.”
Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan, who is leaving Walz’s side to run for U.S. Senate, said Walz has a strong record to run on — Minnesotans make better wages and live healthier, longer lives than other Midwesterners — and an energetic personality that’s repeatedly won over Minnesotans.
“He’s an incredible effective campaigner, and I think once he’s on the road, he’s unstoppable,” said Flanagan, who added that “of course” she’ll endorse him. 
Running in a midterm election during President Donald Trump’s second term, Walz also has an ace: He can sell himself as a Democratic bulwark against an increasingly hostile federal government led by a president Minnesotans have rejected three times.
“Minnesotans trust that Tim Walz is ready to stand up for them, for their liberties and their constitutional rights and defend them from an authoritarian in the White House. People are going to look to Tim Walz for that leadership,” said DFL Chair Richard Carlbom, who’s worked for Walz off-and-on since 2007.
A tenure defined by crises
The governor was elected in 2018, campaigning under the slogan “One Minnesota.” Walz represented a purple district in Congress for more than a decade and when first elected he was seen as a centrist bridge-builder.
But he’s become a champion of progressive policies — in 2022 with Walz at the top of the ticket, Democrats swept control of state government and passed one of the most significant progressive agendas in the nation’s recent history with just a single-seat Senate majority. Walz’s signature is on laws providing all students with free lunch, legalizing marijuana, codifying abortion rights, providing drivers licenses for undocumented immigrants, creating a paid leave program, mandating paid sick leave, restoring voting rights to people after they serve prison sentences, protecting warehouse and meat processing workers, creating a free college program for working class families and requiring universal background checks for gun purchases, among many others.

Republicans were aghast, both by his policies and also his management of several crises.
Like many Democratic governors in 2020, Walz put in place a stay-at-home order at the beginning of the pandemic, and later an indoor mask mandate and restrictions on schools and churches at the urging of public health authorities and institutions like the Mayo Clinic.
He required state workers to be vaccinated before they could return to the workplace.
The pandemic decisions were polarizing and at times faced legal challenges. By the time the worst of the pandemic was over, Minnesota had lower COVID-19 death rates than most other states.
The aftermath of the police murder of George Floyd in 2020 presented another political and governing challenge. The widespread destruction of the riots, which followed decades of police abuses, created a lasting liability for him.
In 2018, Walz, alongside Flanagan, won 21 of 87 counties. In 2022, Walz won 13. 
“‘One Minnesota’ means working together across lines of difference to get good work done for people,” Flanagan said, acknowledging that the country is more divided now than when the duo was first elected.
“We are in a time when people feel incredibly divided, which means this requires us to lean in even more, to listen to folks, to hear their concerns and take action whenever and wherever we can. And I think that is what Gov. Walz’s reelection will be grounded in,” Flanagan said.
One year ago, Walz was thrust into the national spotlight after Vice President Kamala Harris picked him as her running mate. Harris had hoped that Walz’s rural background, Midwest demeanor and military, teaching and coaching resume would win over working-class voters.

Republicans and the national press during the accelerated campaign scrutinized Walz’s past and propensity to misspeak — what he called “knucklehead” misstatements.
After a resounding defeat on the national stage, Walz returned to a different Minnesota, one with a divided Legislature after Republicans won seats for shared control of the Minnesota House. The state was also facing a long-term deficit.
Walz spent weeks negotiating with legislative leaders of both parties to come to a two-year budget agreement, requiring him to acquiesce to the GOP’s top demand: Eliminate state-funded health insurance for undocumented adults. The progressive Democratic base was outraged.
Just days after the Legislature passed the two-year budget, a man shot and killed Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark in their Brooklyn Park home and shot Democratic Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette. Walz oversaw the two-day manhunt to apprehend the shooter of his friend. Hortman’s assassination gave Walz pause about whether he wanted to continue to serve as governor.
This summer was bookended by tragedies after a shooter opened fire outside of Church of Annunciation last month. Walz again headed the response to the mass shooting and is now pushing lawmakers to return for a special session to get Republicans on the record regarding gun control.

Walz’s vision for the next four years
In 2023, Walz began the historic legislative session under the DFL trifecta by saying that Minnesota was going to become “the best state in the country to raise a family.”
That year, the governor shepherded legislation that he frequently brags about to this day: the school meals program and a child tax credit that could slash childhood poverty by 33%.
But Walz’s lengthy record may fade into the background in the face of the second Trump earthquake and the administration’s aggressive incursions into state policies.
Attorney General Keith Ellison, who has sued the Trump administration some 30 times so far, said that Walz is the right person to stand up to Trump.
“(Walz) has been a real asset in my opinion, and he’s been a great partner,” Ellison said. “The governor’s office and the AG’s office historically have not always worked well together, but me and Gov. Walz work seamlessly, and I’m glad to keep him as a partner.”
Paradoxically, Trump is both a challenge but also a political gift to Walz — an easy foil.
Voters will go to the polls next year with Trump top of mind, said Jeff Blodgett, who was chief strategist for Sens. Paul Wellstone and Al Franken.
“This is going to be a much bigger election about how our state is faring in the midst of Donald Trump’s presidency,” Blodgett said. “It will be a contrast between Trump’s style and Tim Walz’s style and the fact that he’s ushered the state through many, many crises and come out on the other side stronger and better — I think that will only help him.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NN250910_0436-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-16 10:02:02.046968

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has vocally pushed a fight against chronic health issues like obesity and heart disease.
Yet, because of federal cuts, most county health departments will shut down nutrition programs focused on teaching low-income families how to stretch their food stamp dollars and cook healthier food.
As Kristen Hwang reports, Kern County eliminated a program teaching residents how to lead healthier lives through nutrition and fitness classes, citing the loss of $12.5 million in federal public health funding.
Kern has the highest rate of diabetes-related deaths in the state. More than 3 out of every 4 adults there are overweight or obese, according to state data.

Selena Peña, who worked on Kern’s nutrition program: “Our health should be a priority. We should want to combat the things that make us unhealthy: Diseases, tobacco, unhealthy foods. It’s discouraging when the government doesn’t want to care for the health of the public.”

Across the state, county health and human services departments have made significant reductions to basic health programs in response to cuts and freezes from Trump initiatives such as DOGE and the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill. 
For example:

Long Beach has lost nearly $4 million in federal grants with the largest cut affecting its HIV and sexually transmitted infection prevention program.


Orange County closed its clinics for children, emergency dental and family planning to deal with $13.7 million in cuts over the next two years. In October, the county will lose an additional $4 million to combat obesity and food insecurity.


LA County, which operates four public hospitals, mostly for Medicaid patients, projects it will have a $1.85 billion annual deficit by 2028, largely due to Medicaid cuts.

Experts worry the impacts will be long-lasting.
Arthur Reingold, professor of epidemiology at UC Berkeley: These policies “will reverberate for the rest of this administration if not well beyond that.

Lawmakers try to bring accountability to homeowners insurance system

The FAIR Plan is under the microscope right now as complaints mount about its denial of smoke claims related to the January fires in LA. And lawmakers are trying to find ways to reform it 
The state Department of Insurance filed legal action against the plan, which is mandated by law to sell policies to homeowners who can’t get them from other insurance companies, accusing it of denying more than 200 smoke-damage claims and violating hundreds of consumer-protection laws.
Levi Sumagaysay and Nadia Lathan report that state lawmakers approved three bills aimed at improving the FAIR Plan, including one that would add the state’s two top lawmakers to its governing committee (although they wouldn’t be voting members, dulling the potential for change a bit). 
Some important context from Levi and Nadia: 
The FAIR Plan, which is an alliance of insurers that do business in the state, has grown to more than 610,000 policies as of June, a 154% increase since September 2021. It has become one of the largest insurers in California as other insurance companies have canceled or stopped issuing new policies here, citing growing wildfire risk.

California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: California’s high poverty rate is a civic embarrassment. Legislative leaders promised to tackle the high cost of living this session. Did they do enough?
With the politics around gas taking center stage at the end of the legislative session, we have two different views on affordability: 

Deborah Sivas, a Stanford University environmental lawyer, says that, as the state produces less oil, there is less need for in-state refining. “That transition presents an opportunity,” she writes. “Many refineries sit on valuable land that could be repurposed for more sustainable uses.”  


Michael Mische, a USC business professor, says the agreement between Newsom and legislative leaders to increase in-state oil drilling is a good start but also a piecemeal approach to a larger problem. He offers a variety of ideas to potentially increase fuel and price security for Californians.

Joe Lombardo announcing announcing his reelection campaign at Rancho High School in Las Vegas Monday. (Photo: Dana Gentry/Nevada Current).Gov. Joe Lombardo returned to his alma mater, Rancho High School, to announce what he called “probably the worst kept secret” — his bid for reelection in 2026. “Nevadans didn’t send me to Carson City to play politics. You hired me to get shit done.”
The governor said the stakes in the upcoming election “couldn’t be higher or the risks any larger. If Democrats take back power in Carson City, you know what will happen?” Lombardo asked the crowd. “Higher taxes. Fewer jobs. Boys in girls sports.”
Lombardo’s reelection effort could get a boost next year from a popular voter ID measure that will be on the ballot in 2026 for the second time. 
“More than 73% of voters supported it in 2024,” he noted Monday, adding that Democratic lawmakers had a chance to approve the measure in 2023, but refused to give it a hearing. 
Former Lt. Gov. Mark Hutchison, a key advisor who introduced Lombardo, boasted that during Lombardo’s first legislative session, the governor vetoed a record 75 bills, only to top the feat this year by vetoing 87 measures passed by lawmakers. 
The vetoed bills “made Nevada less safe. They grew government, raised taxes or misused your hard-earned tax dollars,” the governor said. “160 vetoes are nothing to celebrate, because what that means is bad government. I won’t hesitate for a second to say no again, though, or to be the last line of defense between you and irresponsible politicians.” 
Two Democrats, Attorney General Aaron Ford and Washoe County Commission Chairperson Alexis Hill, intend to compete in the Democratic primary race for governor. 
Ford promises ‘you matter’ state government if elected to top spot 

The crowd at Lombardo’s kick-off included Republicans, Democrats, and dozens of Laborers’ Union 872 members in orange hats and t-shirts, prompting Lombardo to dispel the notion that unions only support Democrats. 
Union member Jerry Gibson said in an interview that he supports Lombardo because he’s “getting work. I gotta keep the bills paid in order to live here.” But Gibson acknowledged growth is taking a toll on the quality of life in Southern Nevada. “I don’t think it’s a good thing. We’re going to run out of water sooner or later. We’ve got to get it from somewhere.”
Lombardo stressed he is achieving what voters elected him to do, such as providing school choice and expanding charter schools. Additionally, low-performing “one and two star schools” have improved their performance by 11%, he said.  
“Accountability is always the key. Throughout my history in education, law enforcement, and as your governor, our constituents continually say we have to hold the schools (to) more accountability,” he said. “Less money, more accountability.” 
Hill promises tax reform, end to ‘billionaire giveaways’ in gubernatorial campaign announcement 

But the governor, thus far, has fallen short on two promises central to his last campaign – making housing more affordable and lowering the unemployment rate. 
Stuck with the highest jobless rate of any state for the last year, Lombardo has pursued an anti-worker agenda, critics contend, including a veto of legislation that would have required paid family and medical leave for employees of some private companies.
“Nevada has long prided itself on maintaining a business-friendly environment,” Lombardo said in his veto message of a bill that would have required businesses with more than 50 employees to provide 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. Current law requires 8 weeks of PFML leave, but only for state employees.
In two legislative sessions and in public appearances, Lombardo has eschewed bills supporters described as worker-friendly policies, such as prevailing wage, a provision initially exempted from his housing bill. And he’s laid the blame for the state’s jobless rate on its residents.
Lombardo’s economic development bill contained a rare pro-worker initiative that would have provided transferable tax credits to help finance a new or expanding child care facility for up to five years. It went nowhere in Carson City.
“Our unemployment rate is unacceptable, and so is the high number of vacant jobs waiting for the right applicant,” Lombardo acknowledged. “That is why we will continue to invest in workforce training and cutting-edge solutions to help match our workforce with continued private investment.”
When Lombardo became governor in January 2023, the median price of a single family home in Clark County was $425,000. In August it was $480,000. The median price of a home sold in Reno last month was $549,000, up from $510,000 when Lombardo took office. Rent at both ends of the state is also up from when Lombardo became governor.  
In his first gubernatorial campaign, Lombardo, a free-market enthusiast, rejected proposals such as rent stabilization and inclusionary zoning. Instead, he said he’d “provide incentives and defer payments on land” to generate more affordable housing.
Lombardo said Monday he is troubled that Nevadans are struggling to buy homes. But his policies often appear at odds with his goals, say observers. This year, he enlisted a Republican lawmaker to kill a measure that would have capped corporate ownership of residential housing, and his housing act, supported by Democrats and some Republicans, creates subsidies for market-level homes but includes no mandates for badly needed low-income units. 
Nevada has 14 units for every 100 extremely-low income residents, the lowest level in the nation. 
Lombardo asserted Monday that he’s streamlined regulation to get homes built and is “working directly with President (Donald) Trump to release more federal land for attainable housing.”
It was the only mention of Trump in the governor’s speech.   
Lombardo, during his second campaign, is expected to walk a perilous tightrope – maintaining enough proximity to Trump, who won Nevada last year by 3.1%, to avoid criticism from the president and MAGA, while warding off any disdain from other Republicans and Democrats.  
Lombardo has at times been a reluctant soldier in Trump’s army. 
He was one of seven Republican governors who did not sign on to a letter praising Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, which is expected to eliminate Medicaid for as many as 125,000 Nevadans, cut funding for SNAP benefits, and increase energy prices.
Tourism, which fuels Nevada’s economy, is in a slump – partially because of the effects of Trump’s tariffs, especially on international visitation. “We are not immune to global economic downturn or changing job markets,” Lombardo said Monday.  
During the 2022 campaign, Lombardo refused to call Trump a great president.
“I wouldn’t use that adjective. I wouldn’t say great,” Lombardo said during a 2022 debate with then-Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat. “I’d say he was a sound president.”
The same day, Lombardo’s campaign capitulated in a news release. “By all measures, Donald J. Trump was a great president and his accomplishments are some of the most impactful in American history.”
When Trump, shortly after his 2024 victory, threatened to use National Guard troops to assist with mass deportations, Lombardo’s position evolved from silence to indecision to commitment in a matter of days. 
In recent months, the governor has agreed to Trump’s call to deploy troops to assist with deportations. Lombardo asserts the Guard is performing administrative functions.

Gavin Newsom has hundreds of bills to sign or veto before the Oct. 12 deadline, on everything from oil drilling to immigration raids and antisemitism in schools.","The fate of hundreds of bills recently approved by the Legislature now rests with Gov. Gavin Newsom. He has one month to sign or veto any measures passed in the final days before the session ended Sept. 13.
As his attention turns ever more toward national politics, how might Newsom’s approach change this year?  What bill signings will he highlight to the public or bury in a late-night news dump? Could he veto more proposals as he tries to distance himself from contentious liberal policies and chart a more moderate image?
Last year, Newsom vetoed about 18% of nearly 1,000 bills passed in the final days (and nearly 16% of all 1,200 bills passed by the Legislature in 2024). That was already higher than his historical average.
Typically, the governor gives a few reasons for vetoing bills: He deems them bad policy or redundant or calculates that their potential cost threatens to worsen the state’s budget situation. But he also blocks bills because they’re controversial or opposed by powerful special interests. 
While the Legislature can override vetoes, it takes a two-thirds vote in both the Assembly and Senate, which rarely happens. Governors can also allow bills to become law without their signature, but that doesn’t occur very often, either.

WHAT THE BILLS WOULD DO
Assembly Bill 1207 by Assemblymember Jacqui Irwin, a Democrat from Thousand Oaks, and SB 840 by Sen. Monique Limón, a Democrat from Santa Barbara, respectively reauthorize the state’s landmark cap-and-trade climate program and provide a blueprint for how lawmakers should spend the billions of dollars it generates.
Cap and trade, renamed “cap and invest,” is California’s way of putting a price tag on greenhouse gas emissions — those responsible for climate change. The state sets a strict cap on those emissions and hands out a limited supply of permits. Companies that cut their pollution enough can sell excess permits, creating a market incentive to address climate change.
The reauthorization makes slight changes to how the California Air Resources Board distributes free “allowances” — or pollution permits — to various types of greenhouse gas emitters. But the bill leaves most potential future policy changes up to the air board.
Meanwhile, the funding bill reshapes how some of the money raised from businesses is spent, notably guaranteeing $1 billion a year for California’s troubled high-speed rail project and $1 billion a year for lawmakers to assign through the budget. 
WHO SUPPORTS IT
Gov. Gavin Newsom, Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas and Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire negotiated the deal in the final days of the state’s legislative session. The reauthorization was supported by a host of mainstream environmental groups, including the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council, construction trade unions and notable climate activists, including billionaire San Francisco Tom Steyer and former Gov. Jerry Brown.
WHO IS OPPOSED
The California Chamber of Commerce led the opposition, while the oil industry’s main trade group, after initially resisting reauthorization, shifted to a neutral stance. On the other side, environmental justice advocates stayed firmly opposed, arguing the program propped up oil and gas at the expense of vulnerable communities near refineries and other polluting industries.
WHY IT MATTERS
Cap and trade is considered one of California’s most important tools for pricing carbon and generating billions for climate programs. Extending it gives industry certainty and secures funding at a time of budget shortfalls and federal rollbacks under the Trump administration. But it also highlights divisions between climate advocates, industry, and communities living near pollution.

										Expand oil drilling in Kern County

By Alexei Koseff
WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO
Drill, baby, drill! Senate Bill 237 by state Sen. Tim Grayson, an Orinda Democrat, could get oil pumping again in California by granting blanket approval for environmental reviews of Kern County wells — a strategy to sidestep litigation that has long been sought by local producers. But the measure would also create new standards for restarting idle pipelines that could block a controversial offshore drilling project in Santa Barbara County. Other provisions would allow the governor to suspend California’s summer gasoline blend, a specially formulated fuel to reduce air pollution, to protect consumers against price spikes and to direct state regulators to study the feasibility of developing a Western regional gas formulation.
WHO SUPPORTS IT
The oil industry has been pleading for years for relief from California’s strict environmental rules, which it blames for driving up gasoline prices in the state to among the highest in the country. At the top of its wish list was unleashing domestic production, a cheaper way to meet demand than importing crude oil from foreign countries. With at least two of California’s last remaining fuel refineries now closing sooner than expected, potentially raising costs at the pump even further, Gov. Gavin Newsom and other Democrats who previously saw the oil industry as a political enemy were suddenly willing to come to the negotiating table.
WHO IS OPPOSED
Environmental groups feel betrayed. California has been a leader in climate action for decades, fast-tracking a transition to clean energy that phases out a reliance on fossil fuels. Opponents see this deal as a major step backward and an industry giveaway. They argue that oil companies falsely linked the refinery closures to drilling, creating urgency for the state to adopt a policy that will pad their profits without actually reducing gasoline prices.
WHY IT MATTERSAffordability was the buzzword this legislative session, and nowhere is the cost of living more immediately visible to Californians than in the rise and fall of gasoline prices. Unthinkable even a few years ago, this olive branch to the oil industry was Newsom’s bid to stave off a politically toxic surge in what drivers pay at the pump. It could also mark a significant turning point in California’s relationship with an industry that had become a favorite political boogeyman for Democrats. Oil refiners are likely to seek further changes next year to avoid a doom spiral in the market.

										Create a Western energy market

By Alejandro Lazo
WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO
AB 825 by Assemblymember Cottie Petrie-Norris, would open the door for California to join a Western regional energy market, aiming to save customers money by allowing electricity to flow more freely across state lines and steadying the grid when power is needed most, like during a heat wave.
The bill repeals an older process for turning California’s grid operator into a regional body and replaces it with a new framework developed through years of talks among Western power companies, system operators, regulators and others.
The law would open the door to a shared electricity market across Western states while aiming to have each state retain control of its own energy policies and planning. An expanded market could include climate-aligned states such as Oregon and Washington but potentially also coal-burning states such as Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico. 
WHO SUPPORTS IT
California often wastes solar power on mild spring and fall days when production outpaces demand, and that’s one of the biggest reasons environmental groups including the Environmental Defense Fund and Natural Resources Defense Council back this measure. They said a regional market would allow the state to sell  surplus solar to its neighbors and tap renewable energy from other states.
Those big environmental groups are joined by major utilities and industry players — including Google and Microsoft, eager to power new AI data centers — as well as the statewide electrical workers’ union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.WHO IS OPPOSED
The Utility Reform Network opposes the bill after key safeguards it negotiated were stripped from the final plan. TURN advocates for ratepayers, but said the bigger danger from the plan is California ceding control of its renewable energy agenda to a federal government that is openly hostile to clean energy — a risk the group said outweighs any potential savings. TURN is joined in opposition by other consumer and environmental groups.
WHY IT MATTERS
California spent decades greening its grid: ditching coal, slashing fossil fuels and building the world’s second-largest battery fleet to store solar power after dark. This bill would take a major step toward linking that system to other parts of the country, reshaping how clean and fossil power move across the West.

										Add $18 billion to California wildfire recovery fund

By Jeanne Kuang
WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO
Senate Bill 254 by Sens. Josh Becker, Cottie Petrie-Norris and Aisha Wahab would boost the state’s wildfire liability fund, which is paid for by the big three utility companies’ shareholders and customers. The fund, which pays victims of wildfires caused by utility infrastructure, is running low from claims stemming from this January’s Eaton Fire. The $18 billion boost over 10 years would be split equally between shareholders and ratepayers, who contribute to the fund through a charge on their bills. The bill also includes new regulations on the three investor-owned utilities, preventing utilities from profiting from $6 billion worth of wildfire-proofing work (such as moving power lines underground). It would also set up a program for the state to help publicly finance the cost of building new transmission lines, a significant factor in energy bills, and fast-track some permitting for solar and other clean energy projects. 
WHO SUPPORTS IT
The bill is part of a package of climate and energy policies negotiated between legislative leaders, who wanted to try to curb utilities rates, and Gov. Gavin Newsom, who wanted to replenish the wildfire fund. It’s backed by mainstream environmental groups such as the Natural Resources Defense Council and consumer advocates such as The Utility Reform Network. The California Chamber of Commerce, initially opposed, has since gotten on board after the bill was amended to include the wildfire fund.
WHO IS OPPOSED
A group representing some past wildfire survivors says the measure doesn’t go far enough for them, arguing the wildfire fund has benefitted utilities and their shareholders at the expense of homeowners and residents who struggle with the legal process to get paid. Some electricity users’ advocates also are frustrated consumers would have to continue paying into the fund.
WHY IT MATTERS
In the grand energy policy bargain of California leaders trying all at once to maintain climate goals, keep energy flowing reliably and drive down costs, SB 254 represents the latter portion of those efforts. While other parts of the deal boost oil drilling or expand energy markets, this bill contains the more progressive of this year’s energy proposals that reflect Democrats’ desire to lower prices by regulating utilities.

										Allow more housing near transit					





Share by Email

By Ben Christopher
WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO
Housing developers would be allowed to build apartment buildings up to seven stories within a walkable half-mile of many major train, light-rail, subway and high-frequency rapid bus stations — even if local zoning restrictions would otherwise ban such dense development. Authored by San Francisco Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener, Senate Bill 79 would also let public transit agencies build apartments on their own land. Developers would be required to set aside a small share of the new units they build under the law for low-income renters. The bill would only apply in counties with significant passenger rail systems in place — that is, big coastal metro areas. 
WHO SUPPORTS IT
People who want to see the state build a lot more housing and those who want to boost the ridership numbers and financial sustainability of California’s public transit systems lined up behind the bill. The coalition includes “Yes In My Backyard” activists, many construction worker unions, business groups and transit rider advocates. Supporters say building apartment buildings near public transit hubs will both address the state’s chronic shortage of lower-cost housing and encourage more residents to take the train or bus — a win for transit systems, traffic and the climate. 
WHO IS OPPOSED
Plenty of local governments are opposed because they don’t want the state bigfooting their authority over what gets built where. Many neighborhood groups and homeowners associations don’t like it either, as it threatens to foist new development and density on their communities. A handful of advocates for low-income Californians are also opposed, arguing that the bill does not go far enough in mandating that the new units be restricted for low earners.
WHY IT MATTERS
For nearly a decade now a growing cohort of California lawmakers have been writing bills aimed at making it easier to build more homes to tackle the state’s dearth of affordable housing. SB 79 would represent one of the largest state-directed densification efforts to date. It’s also a bill that, in one form or another, Wiener has been trying and failing to get passed since the beginning of his legislative career.

WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO
Senate Bill 53 by Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat from San Francisco, requires AI makers to test AI models for their ability to enable things like cybersecurity crimes or biological weapons attacks and would give developers and the public a way to report AI that poses a catastrophic risk. Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a previous version of the bill last year. A report ordered by Newsom released in June calls for rules to protect whistleblowers and transparency in the model development process to balance innovation with guardrails.
The bill defines catastrophic risk as an AI model that demonstrates the ability to cause the death or injury of 50 or more people, or more than $1 billion in damage or loss of property. Only companies that make $500 million or more annually must comply with the law. 
WHO SUPPORTS IT
The bill is supported by organizations like Tech Oversight California, independent state oversight group Little Hoover Commission, the Service Employees International Union and several groups concerned that AI can go rogue and harm people.
“While we believe that frontier AI safety is best addressed at the federal level instead of a patchwork of state regulations, powerful AI advancements won’t wait for consensus in Washington,” said Anthropic, a business founded by former OpenAI employees.
It’s unclear if the final version will win the governor’s support, but co-sponsor Encode told CalMatters that the governor’s office helped shape final amendments to the bill.
WHO IS OPPOSED
Business groups like the Chamber of Commerce and TechNet oppose the legislation, along with OpenAI, which argue instead for a national policy set by lawmakers in Washington D.C.
WHY IT MATTERS
This bill gives the public and people inside companies developing AI an easy way to alert authorities if the tech shows an ability to cause great harm. The legislation states that “timely reporting of critical safety incidents to the government is essential to ensure that public authorities are promptly informed of ongoing and emerging risks to public safety.”
AI researchers have called for whistleblower protections before, because of concerns about how AI can amplify existing inequality and with the hypothetical ways the tech may harm people in the future.
The legislation would also require companies to publish details about how they evaluate models for catastrophic risk on their websites, and establishes CalCompute, a public cloud that must focus on developing AI for the public good.

By Khari Johnson
WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO
Landlords, grocery stores, and tech platforms like Amazon, Airbnb and Instacart can use algorithms to rip you off in a variety of ways. To prevent businesses from charging customers higher costs and make life more affordable, Assembly Bill 325 would prohibit tech platforms from requiring independent businesses to use their pricing recommendations. Among half a dozen bills introduced this year to address the problem, it’s the only bill that made it to the governor’s desk. Key examples cited by author Cecilia Aguilar-Curry, a Davis Democrat, include Realpage, which sets the cost of apartment rentals, and Cendyn, a tool used by hotels to set prices, though a case against Las Vegas hotels for using that tool was recently thrown out.
WHO SUPPORTS IT
Lawmakers and supporters of the bill say algorithms eliminate fair market competition. In the past, businesses or competitors would go into a room and collude to increase the cost for a particular good, but today they can just use an algorithm, said Sen. Melissa Hurtado, a Democrat from Bakersfield, author of another algorithmic pricing bill that failed. Whether done by people in a room or with digital tools, price-fixing is wrong, said Aguilar-Curry, who has said she believes the algorithms play an important role in California’s affordability crisis. Attorney General Rob Bonta, prominent unions, and the Consumer Federation of California are among supporters of AB 325.
WHO IS OPPOSED
Groups representing apartment landlords, hospitals, hotels, restaurants, retailers, and tech industry groups oppose this legislation. The California Chamber of Commerce maintains that AB 325 will drive up costs.

										Regulate AI chatbots

WHAT THE BILLS WOULD DO
Senate Bill 243 by Democratic Sens. Josh Becker  of Menlo Park and Steve Padilla of Chula Vista would require tech companies that create artificial intelligence chatbots, like ChatGPT, to clearly inform users that the bot is not human, and to create a protocol to help users experiencing suicidal ideation. The bill would also task companies with instituting “reasonable measures” to prevent minors from interacting with sexually explicit material while using the bots. 
Assembly Bill 1064 by San Ramon Democratic Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan, the Leading Ethical AI Development (LEAD) for Kids Act, would outlaw the use of companion chatbots for children entirely unless the bot “is not foreseeably capable” of harming a child, such as by encouraging self-harm or drug use. 
WHO SUPPORTS THEM
Initially, several tech watchdog and child safety groups, including the American Association of Pediatrics, supported SB 243. But many withdrew their support, saying last-minute changes hopelessly watered it down. Some moved their support to the broader AB 1064. Groups including Common Sense Media and Tech Oversight California are now supporting that legislation, while the Computer and Communications Industry Association trade group says SB 243 would at least not create “an overbroad ban on AI products” like AB 1064.
WHO OPPOSES THEM
The CCIA initially testified against SB 243, arguing it was overly broad and would stifle innovation. It altered its position after the last-minute changes. On the other side of the debate, while groups like Common Sense Media supported earlier versions of SB 243, they have since dropped that support to back the other measure. 
WHY IT MATTERS
The bills come as lawmakers face immense pressure to rein in tech chatbots following several high-profile tragedies. News reports nationwide have shown how AI-powered chatbots have fed users’ delusions, sometimes leading to real-world violence.Some recent scandals have also drawn attention specifically to children’s relationships to chatbots. In August, the New York Times reported on the case of 16-year-old Adam Raine, who spoke to ChatGPT about suicide before ending his life. Watchdog groups have accused ChatGPT of giving other harmful information to teens as well. Meta, Facebook’s parent company, also faced criticism recently after leaked internal documents obtained by Reuters showed the company allowed its AI chatbots to have “romantic or sensual” conversations with children.

										Allow Uber and Lyft drivers to unionize

WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO
By Levi Sumagaysay
AB 1340 by Assemblymember Buffy Wicks, a Democrat from Oakland, would allow ride-hailing drivers to unionize. Uber and Lyft consider drivers independent contractors, and this bill would make California the second state in the nation to give drivers the right to bargain with the companies. On the Assembly floor right before the bill was approved, Wicks said gig workers lobbied elected officials “so that they can have a seat at the table to fight for paid leave, to fight for higher pay, to fight for safety and all the other things that they deserve.” 
WHO SUPPORTS IT
The Service Employees International Union sponsored the legislation, but at least one other drivers group and labor experts say that last-minute amendments made to the bill would make it tough for any other union but the SEIU to be chosen to represent drivers. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom, Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas in late August announced a deal tying the unionization legislation to SB 371, an industry-sponsored bill that would lower insurance coverage requirements for ride-hailing. 
WHO IS OPPOSED
The ride-hailing industry dropped its opposition after the deal tying it to their insurance legislation. But Uber called the deal a “compromise,” and Lyft has not explicitly supported the unionization bill. 
Rideshare Drivers United, a Los Angeles-based drivers group that has organized drivers for years, supported the bill at first. But the group’s president, Nicole Moore, said she was “outraged” when she realized the amendments essentially guarantee her group wouldn’t qualify to represent drivers because of its lack of experience in negotiating bargaining agreements.
Republican lawmakers spoke against the bill as it made its way through the Legislature, saying it goes against the spirit of Proposition 22, an industry-backed ballot proposition that became law and enshrined app-based gig workers’ independent contractor status.
WHY IT MATTERS
If the state’s about 800,000 ride-hailing drivers vote to form a union, it would give them the ability to bring longstanding complaints about wages, benefits, deactivations and other issues to the bargaining table. The bill also includes requirements for Uber and Lyft to disclose more information about drivers and rides, data that experts say would increase transparency around the ride-hailing industry.

By Cayla Mihalovich 
WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO
Senate Bill 627, authored by Democratic Sens. Jesse Arreguín, Sasha Pérez, Aisha Wahab and Scott Weiner would widely prohibit law enforcement officers from wearing face masks while conducting their duties. The “No Secret Police Act” would apply to all federal, state and local law enforcement — or anyone who works on their behalf – while operating in California. Officers who violate the law would face an infraction or misdemeanor.  The legislation does not apply to certain types of face coverings, such as face shields, and exempts certain officers, such as those who are undercover. By July 2026, the bill would require all law enforcement agencies to publish a face covering policy. 
WHO SUPPORTS IT
The bill has more than two dozen Democratic co-authors and widespread support from nonprofit organizations, including the ACLU, Indivisible and Drug Policy Alliance. Its sponsor, the nonprofit organization Prosecutors Alliance Action, argues that the legislation would create more transparency and trust in law enforcement, and safeguard against bad actors impersonating the police. Without visible identification, the group contends that masked and anonymous federal agents create dangerous conditions for the public and law enforcement. 
WHO IS OPPOSED
Senate Republicans and California law enforcement advocacy groups, including the California Police Chiefs Association, the California State Sheriffs Association and the California Association of Highway Patrolmen oppose the legislation. The powerful umbrella labor organization that lobbies on behalf of police unions, the Peace Officers Research Association of California, argues that the proposal is “misguided, unnecessary, and counterproductive” because California has no jurisdiction over federal agents and has already established accountability measures around officer identification. 
WHY IT MATTERS
Law enforcement officers, particularly federal agents, have concealed their identities during immigration raids across California and the country. Lawmakers argue that extreme masking sows fear, confusion and violence that harms public safety. The proposed law aims to put an end to the practice. “When law enforcement officers hide their identities, it destroys community trust,” said Weiner, of San Francisco, at a legislative hearing in August.

										Allow undocumented parents to name a caregiver

By Jeanne Kuang
WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO
AB 495, authored by Arleta Democratic Assemblymember Celeste Rodriguez, is intended to allow undocumented parents to establish a caregiver for their children if they’re detained by immigration agents or deported. It does that primarily with a long-existing form called the caregiver’s authorization affidavit, which allows an adult relative caring for a child who isn’t their parent, such as a sibling, grandparent or aunt or uncle, to temporarily make decisions such as enrollling the child in school or making medical decisions. The bill would allow a wider range of relatives to sign the form and serve as caregivers, including any adult “who is related to the child by blood, adoption, or affinity within the fifth-degree of kinship.” Parents could also designate a guardian for their children in family court. 
WHO SUPPORTS IT
The bill is backed by immigrants’ rights groups and children’s legal advocates who say families should be able to prepare in case parents are unavailable, such as in the case of a deportation. They argue immigrant families might not have many blood relatives nearby but often rely on extended family members and community networks who could step in if a parent is arrested, rather than having the child be put in foster care.
WHO IS OPPOSED
Republican lawmakers and a group of religious and conservative activists fiercely opposed the legislation, arguing it could allow strangers and predators to declare they are caregivers using the easily accessible authorization form. 
WHY IT MATTERS
It’s one of several measures Democrats advanced this year in response to the immigration raids directed by the Trump administration that have roiled California communities. But because it deals with child protection issues, it also energized a deeply active portion of the religious right, who turned out to protest it at the Capitol and have in some cases made false claims that the legislation would allow strangers to take custody of children. Attacks from the right on such issues have often put Democrats in a defensive position. In 2023, activists successfully urged Gov. Gavin Newsom to veto a bill that requires family court judges to consider a parent’s support of children’s gender transition in custody disputes.

WHAT THE BILLS WOULD DO
California lawmakers passed several immigration bills this year responding to widespread immigration sweeps. Senate Bill 805 would require that officers identify themselves while conducting their duties and SB 81 would prohibit immigration enforcement from entering a health care facility without a judicial warrant or court order. Other bills, such as SB 98, aim to protect students from immigration enforcement on campus. That legislation comes on top of a bill to block law enforcement from wearing face masks and allow undocumented parents to designate a caregiver for their children if they’re detained.
WHO SUPPORTS THEM
Democratic lawmakers this year supported a flurry of bills aimed to protect vulnerable communities from immigration enforcement and limit officers’ presence in sensitive places, such as hospitals and schools. The bills, shaped in response to the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, were widely supported by nonprofit organizations, industry groups and immigrant rights advocates. 
WHO IS OPPOSED
Republican lawmakers opposed the bills, criticizing the Democratic efforts as an overreaction and voicing concern over the state’s role in federal actions such as immigration enforcement. California police organizations opposed the legislation, arguing that it is misdirected and puts their safety at risk. Opponents also questioned how the laws would be enforced, claiming that California does not have authority to challenge federal law enforcement mandates. 
WHY IT MATTERS
California is home to more immigrants and more immigrants living in the country illegally than any other state. Democratic lawmakers argue that these policies are important to protect public safety as well as immigrants’ constitutional rights during what the Trump administration has promised will be the largest deportation campaign in U.S. history.

										Roll back the cannabis excise tax

By Alexei Koseff
WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO
California increased its excise tax on cannabis substantially in July, to 19% from 15%. AB 564 by Assemblymember Matt Haney, a San Francisco Democrat, would undo that increase and freeze the cannabis excise tax — a levy imposed by the state before sales taxes are applied — at 15% through the end of June 2028.
WHO SUPPORTS IT
The weed industry has sounded the alarm for years about a failing legal system in California, beset by overproduction, resistant local governments, plummeting prices and high taxes. Growers, dispensary owners and consumer advocates rallied unsuccessfully this spring for a budget deal to avert the excise tax increase, which they argue could push price-sensitive customers back into the illicit market and deal a fatal blow to many businesses already operating with slim margins. Now they hope that Newsom, who previously pledged to sign a proposal halting the tax increase, will reverse it.
WHO IS OPPOSED
Cannabis tax revenues pay for child care slots, environmental cleanup, substance abuse education and impaired driving prevention efforts. Increasing the excise tax is projected to yield about $180 million annually. Loath to lose that financial boost, especially as California faces a growing budget deficit, nonprofits that receive grants from the money have led the charge against AB 564. They accuse supporters of putting industry profits above children’s health and the environment.
WHY IT MATTERSSince voters legalized recreational weed in 2016, California has struggled to bring its market out of the shadows. The state Department of Cannabis Control estimates that legal sales still comprise less than 40% of consumption in California, and tax revenue has declined recently. The industry blames state and local excise and sales taxes that can raise prices by a third. Cannabis companies contend that tax relief would help stabilize their business and grow legal sales — and, by extension, tax revenue — in the long run. But opponents point out that the industry made the exact same case three years ago, when Newsom and lawmakers cut a similar deal.

WHAT THE BILLS WOULD DO
San Diego Democratic Sen. Akilah Weber Pierson authored two key reparations bills in response to recommendations made by the Reparations Task Force. Senate Bill 518 would establish the Bureau for Descendants of American Slavery under California’s Civil Rights Department. The new state agency would create divisions including genealogy, property reclamation and education, to provide infrastructure for implementing reparative policies. The bill is a second shot at a previous attempt by former Democratic Sen. Steven Bradford to establish a new state agency. Her other legislation, SB 437, would allocate up to $6 million for the California State University system to develop a methodology for verifying descendants of enslaved people who wish to access benefits. 
WHO SUPPORTS THEM
Members of the task force support SB 518, along with nonprofit organizations including the Equal Justice Society, which argues the legislation is a step toward addressing the ongoing harms of descendents of U.S. chattel slavery. SB 437 is supported by the California Reparations Task Force and various nonprofits, including Equality California, which maintains that a genealogical verification process will ensure an equitable distribution of benefits. Weber Pierson said the bills will ensure nobody is excluded from the reparative justice process. 
WHO IS OPPOSED
Groups that want to see California move more swiftly toward implementing recommendations from the Reparations Task Force oppose the legislation. The grassroots organization Lineage Equity Advancement Project argues that the legislation would delay the implementation of reparative policies and payout of benefits. The group also argued that lawmakers failed to incorporate any input from community voices who have long advocated for reparations and reparative justice. “California doesn’t need more research into whether it should act. It needs to act,” said Chris Lodgson, an advocate with the Coalition for a Just and Equitable California
WHY IT MATTERS
In the wake of George Floyd’s murder, California established the nation’s first reparations task force to study and propose ways to provide reparative justice for Black descendents of enslaved people. The California Legislative Black Caucus last year introduced a 14-bill reparations package based on recommendations from the task force, but two key bills were quashed late in the legislative process, creating a wedge between reparations advocates and lawmakers. This year, the caucus returned with 16 “Road to Repair” priority bills, including SB 437 and SB 518.

WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO
Assembly Bill 1178, by Assemblymember Blanca Pacheco, a Downey Democrat, would make it harder for the public to access police misconduct records. Already, state law allows agencies to redact those records if disclosing them would put the officer in danger. Under this proposed law, when deciding whether to redact, judges must also consider if the officer is working undercover and should remain anonymous because of their duties. 
WHO SUPPORTS IT
District attorneys and law enforcement groups, such as the California Police Chiefs Association and the powerful California Peace Officers Association, argue the measure is necessary to protect undercover agents from being “needlessly” named in public records, which they say could threaten the officers’ safety. 
WHO IS OPPOSED
Transparency advocates and good government groups such as the First Amendment Coalition and the American Civil Liberties Union in California, argue that carveouts in existing state law already shield the personal information of at-risk officers from disclosure. Opponents deem the measure unnecessary and argue that the legislation would allow agencies to withhold crucial information about an officer simply because of their role.
WHY IT MATTERS
The bill would roll back public access to police misconduct records just years after California lawmakers expanded it. In 2018 and 2021, California adopted laws that required the disclosure of police records about use of force, sexual assault and other misconducts. Those laws enabled UC Berkeley and Stanford University to create an online searchable database of misconduct documents from nearly 700 law enforcement agencies statewide. While the bill does not restrict the release of those records, it would give judges more reasons to redact information about undercover officers from those records.

WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO
Assembly Bill 1264 by Assemblymember Jesse Gabriel, a Democrat from Encino, would ban schools from serving harmful “ultraprocessed foods” to students. The measure would task the California Department of Public Health with identifying food or beverages to eliminate that contain high amounts of saturated fat, sodium and sugar. It also identifies for elimination additives like food coloring or flavor enhancers. 
The measure focuses on ingredients where research shows they are associated with cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity and behavioral issues among other health harms. Schools would have to fully phase out these ingredients by July 2032.
WHO SUPPORTS IT
The legislation garnered broad bipartisan support from state lawmakers, including co-author and Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher, a farmer from Chico, and the legislative progressive caucus. The measure passed the Senate unanimously and made it out of the Assembly with one vote against.
“Democrats and Republicans are joining forces to prioritize the health and safety of our children,” Gabriel said in a statement.
The Environmental Working Group and Consumer Reports co-sponsored the measure, whose supporters also include a coalition of children’s health and medical organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Diabetes Association. These groups say that “ultraprocessed foods” are linked to serious health risks.
WHO IS OPPOSED
Industry groups like the Consumer Brands Association, California Grocers Association and California Farm Bureau remain opposed, despite significant amendments made to address industry concerns over the definition and regulation of “ultraprocessed foods.” Some opponents have argued that the legislation was “well-intentioned but impractical.” They contend that the definition is still too broad and could result in harmless ingredients that have nutritional value from being unintentionally banned, including canned fruits or vegetables.
Assemblymember Carl DeMaio, a Republican from San Diego, voted against the measure.
WHY IT MATTERS
California Republican support for nutrition regulations predates the Trump administration’s “Make America Healthy Again” campaign. This legislation builds upon prior laws passed by Gabriel that ban certain food dyes from school meals and specified additives from grocery store sales. Those bills, which have at times been derided by Republicans nationally as examples of government overreach, have generally enjoyed some bipartisan support from state lawmakers.

WHAT THE BILL WOULD DO
Assembly Bill 715 by Assemblymembers Rick Chavez Zbur and Dawn Addis, Democrats from Los Angeles and San Luis Obispo, respectively, would create a state Office for Civil Rights with an antisemitism prevention coordinator and create new processes to root out discriminatory learning materials in schools. The coordinator would develop and provide antisemitism education to teachers and school boards recommend other proposals to combat antisemitism.The proposed law seeks to extinguish antisemitism in classrooms, though the definition of that concept has been the source of heated rhetoric that isn’t reconciled in the bill. A previous version defined antisemitism, including the “denigration” of believers of Zionism. Now the legislation’s focus on addressing antisemitism is limited to legislative declarations that have less legal teeth. Members of the public would be able to file anonymous complaints about alleged bias in school learning materials.
WHO SUPPORTS IT
The bill was sponsored by a coalition of Jewish cultural, political and social outreach groups called Jewish Public Affairs Committee of California and was a priority for the California Legislative Jewish Caucus. No members in either chamber officially opposed it, though 14 lawmakers didn’t vote. The Simon Wiesenthal Center and Museums of Tolerance also backs the measure. “Jewish students across our state are being harassed, bullied, and intimidated simply because of who they are,” said Zbur at a legislative hearing in September. He noted instances of anti-semitic slurs and swastikas spray-painted on a Manhattan Beach school playground and San Francisco teachers being given “materials that justified Hamas’s October 7th attack.”
WHO IS OPPOSED
College student associations, faculty union groups, the main K-12 teachers unions and groups representing the interests of Arab and Muslim Californians and some progressive Jewish groups oppose it. California Teachers Association lobbyist Seth Bramble testified that it would codify into law “subjective standards for instruction under the term ‘factually accurate,’” and “would give advocates on multiple sides of controversial issues a new legal tool to disrupt instruction and to threaten educators.”
WHY IT MATTERS
The rhetoric in schools following the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas and Israel’s subsequent military response has brought to a boil long-simmering frustrations about how to talk about Israel and Palestine. The bill’s earlier language defining antisemitism disturbed many progressives, who viewed it as simpatico with President Donald Trump’s efforts to liken anti-Zionism to antisemitism. Some coalitions of Jewish scholars say criticizing Israel is not inherently antisemitic, but many other Jews cite evidence of widespread Jewish intolerance in rhetoric and action.

Guest Commentary written by

California’s demand for gasoline has fallen steadily over the last two decades as state consumers shift to cleaner electric and hybrid vehicles.  
What’s giving some state policymakers heartburn is the fact that falling demand for gasoline means declining demand for in-state petroleum refining. In response, some California refineries have begun consolidating, converting or closing. 
Though this is good news for nearby communities burdened by refinery pollution, state officials worry refining capacity could fall faster than gasoline consumption, driving up pump prices as short-term demand exceeds supply. 
The oil industry has stoked this fear and proposed a dangerous solution: Exempt all new oil and gas drilling from the California Environmental Quality Act, colloquially known as CEQA (pronounced see-kwah). The industry aggressively pushed state legislation for that. What legislators passed last week, Senate Bill 237, didn’t go that far but aims to make it easier to expand drilling in oil-rich Kern County.
Still, the same issues arise from this exemption. Fast-tracking new oil drilling permits will do nothing to affect pump prices.
California has been extracting crude oil for 150 years. By the start of the 20th century, it was the leading oil-producing state in the nation. Helping that boom were natural gas deposits, which create pressure in oil reservoirs that allows crude to flow to the surface. California’s early oil derricks sometimes caused explosive gushers that sprayed oil high into the air, prompting a wave of local regulation.
The days of gushers are gone. With natural gas stores largely depleted, California oil fields now contain mostly heavy crude oil, often tucked into folded geology and difficult to extract. Today’s drillers typically inject steam or hot water to lower the oil’s viscosity and increase its flow. That is energy-intensive and expensive, so drilling in California isn’t as cost competitive as Texas or North Dakota.
These fundamental economics — not environmental laws — largely dictate the level of in-state crude oil production. California already imports most of the crude oil feeding its refineries. Refinery operators understand this and are making decisions based on long-term business projections. 
As the state produces less oil, there is less need for in-state refining. That transition presents an opportunity. Many refineries sit on valuable land that could be repurposed for more sustainable uses.  
Legislation that exempts new oil drilling from environmental quality standards won’t magically change this reality. In fact, current projections by the U.S. Energy Information Administration suggest global oil prices will fall over the next year or two, perhaps to levels that will make most California production uncompetitive. Global market prices are the likely reason many new wells the state approved in recent years haven’t been drilled.   
Gutting environmental regulations would disenfranchise communities trying to protect themselves from potential risks associated with oil production, such as toxic air pollution, water and soil contamination and drilling rig explosions. 
If state officials want to smooth California’s transition from transportation fuel, they should look for solutions such as facilitating port improvements to accommodate increases in oil imports. And state lawmakers must remain vigilant about price gouging as the market consolidates to fewer players.
CEQA requires California’s oil regulators to study, disclose and mitigate potential effects of drilling. Contrary to the industry’s narrative, CEQA is neither the cause of falling gasoline demand nor the solution to price spikes. 
We should celebrate the clean energy path California is blazing, not hastily eviscerate one of its bedrock environmental laws.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/030424-Carbon-Capture-LV_26.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-16 08:56:27.147074

Miller,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/09/california-redistricting-prop50-shakeup/,"California congressional wannabes aren’t waiting for Prop. 50 to start campaigning in the newly drawn districts. Candidates are evaluating which seats they stand the greatest chance of winning in. For Republican challengers, the eight-week delay is far more consequential.","In summary
California congressional wannabes aren’t waiting for Prop. 50 to start campaigning in the newly drawn districts. Candidates are evaluating which seats they stand the greatest chance of winning in. For Republican challengers, the eight-week delay is far more consequential. 


Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to redraw California’s congressional map has kicked off a game of musical chairs as candidates evaluate which districts they’ll run in and see new possibilities to jump into districts that were previously not competitive. 
Some have already announced plans to switch districts if voters approve the new maps in November.
“Chaos breeds opportunity in politics, and that’s what we’re experiencing right now,” said Katie Merrill, a veteran Democratic political strategist and campaign consultant. “It’s basically opening more doors than it’s closing.”
Voters in November will be asked to approve Newsom’s proposal to toss out the congressional maps drawn four years ago by California’s independent citizens redistricting commission and temporarily adopt partisan maps that gerrymander districts to favor Democrats. Newsom’s pitch came in response to President Donald Trump’s demand that Republican states redraw their maps to solidify House Republicans’ precarious majority in 2026. If the GOP loses the House, Trump would face considerable roadblocks to his agenda and also subject his administration to Democratic scrutiny — and potentially impeachment. 
Marni von Wilpert, a Democratic San Diego city councilmember who flipped the city’s most conservative district blue in 2020, is diving headfirst through one of those newly opened doors. The 42-year-old former congressional staffer for the House labor committee recently announced she would challenge Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, an 11-term incumbent, in the new proposed 48th District. 
“When the lines were redrawn, it did open up a valuable opportunity,” von Wilpert told CalMatters. She said that a younger LGBTQ Democrat like her stood a much stronger chance of toppling Issa under the proposed maps, which add more registered Democrats to the voter pool.
Several Democratic congressional hopefuls and at least one Republican have signaled that they too would switch districts should voters adopt the new maps. Democrats Brandon Riker, Anuj Dixit and Abel Chavez, who all filed to run against longtime incumbent Republican Rep. Ken Calvert, have announced they’ll switch to run against Issa if voters approve the maps in November. 
Dixit, a voting rights attorney, declared on social media that he would fight to pass Newsom’s redistricting plan and challenge Issa. 
Riker, an entrepreneur who previously ran for lieutenant governor of Vermont in 2016, chose less overtly pro-Prop. 50 language and instead committed to running in whichever district contained his home base of Palm Springs.  
“Both Calvert and Issa are voting against California families and dodging their constituents,” Riker said in a statement. “No matter where the boundaries fall, I got in this race to represent my community in Palm Springs,” he added. “If we don’t put a stop to Trump’s madness, Californians will suffer.”
Riker said he would continue campaigning actively in both districts until voters settled the maps in November. Chavez, a former teacher and now president of his local school board in Nuevo, similarly defended his decision to switch districts as a choice to represent his home community and refrained from any pro-Prop. 50 language in his social media announcement. 
Even Republican Kevin Lincoln is eyeing a district swap should voters approve the new maps. 
Lincoln, the former mayor of Stockton, has already launched a rematch campaign against Democratic incumbent Rep. Josh Harder, to whom he lost in 2024. But if voters embrace the new maps, Lincoln has indicated he might instead challenge the more vulnerable Democratic Rep. Adam Gray, whose district under the new maps is gerrymandered to capture part of Stockton’s downtown core. 
Prop. 50 delay is a boon to Democrats
Rather than wait for a final verdict on Prop. 50, candidates are forging ahead with voter engagement and fundraising as best they can, even without a guarantee that the new maps will prevail. That’s the correct strategy for Democrats, said Merrill, the Democratic strategist, given that there will be plenty of time for fundraising and endorsement gathering after Nov. 4. 
“Everybody should jump out there and start the race,” Merrill said. “They have to sort of stake their ground so they freeze other candidates from jumping in. They send signals to the endorsing groups and donors about what they’re intending to do.”

The fight for Prop. 50  which is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars that might otherwise flow toward individual candidates — could actually benefit Democrats even though it delays their ability to fundraise and gather endorsements. 
Merrill noted that House Majority PAC, a super PAC aligned with House Democratic leadership, has already contributed $5 million to the Yes on Prop. 50 campaign. But, Merrill noted, if the group can get five new Democratic seats out of California, that investment pales in comparison to what would otherwise have been multimillion-dollar fights in each of the state’s previously competitive districts.
“For them, it’s the most efficient use of money you can think of,” Merrill said of the super PAC 
But for Republican challengers, who will face an even steeper battle if voters approve the redrawn maps, the expensive Prop. 50 fight risks siphoning crucial funds that would otherwise go to candidates.
“We need money today, not tomorrow, because money begets money, and momentum begets momentum,” said Sam Oh, a Republican campaign consultant who works with Lincoln’s campaign as well as with incumbent Republican Rep. Young Kim. 
In 2020 and 2022, Oh helped Kim and former Republican Rep. Michelle Steel oust incumbent Democrats in two Orange County swing seats. The new proposed maps shift far more Democrats into those districts to shore up support for vulnerable incumbent Reps. Dave Min and Derek Tran, who defeated Steel in 2024 to flip the seat blue. 
If they want competitive races next November, Oh said, Republican donors should give to candidates directly in addition to supporting the anti-Prop. 50 campaign.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091423_Darrell-Issa_REUTERS_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-16 08:56:27.147074

Jeremy Dean, D-Springfield, speaks in February on the Missouri House floor. (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications)A Democratic legislator from Springfield faces a Missouri House ethics investigation because of an obscene text message sent to a Republican colleague during debate over the new congressional district map.
State Rep. Jeremy Dean of Springfield sent the text message on Sept. 4 to Republican state Rep. Cecelie Williams of Dittmer. Dean and other Democrats were engaged in a sit-in on the House floor and Williams was serving on the House Elections Committee as it debated a bill altering the state’s eight congressional districts.
The message included a description of an oral sex act with the president and questioned how Republicans could talk while engaged in it.
House Minority Leader Ashley Aune, a Democrat from Kansas City, said she removed  Dean from his committee assignments after learning about the text. 
“What Jeremy sent was wrong,” Aune said.
The text also inspired an ethics complaint against Dean. The House Ethics Committee, which conducts all its business confidentially until it has finished an investigation, met Sept. 10 to begin inquiries into two complaints.
Dean and Williams are freshman lawmakers, both winning their first terms in November.
Williams confirmed she received the obscene message but declined an interview, citing the ethics committee’s confidentiality rules.
“It was unwanted and unappreciated,” Williams said of the text. “I feel that the message has absolutely no place in the Missouri legislature or any other workplace at all. And so that’s really all that I can say.”
State Rep. Cecelie Williams, R-Dittmer, speaks in February during Missouri House debate (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).
Dean declined a request for an interview. In a text, he also cited confidentiality of ethics investigations and said he is worried about his personal safety.
“Because of ongoing safety concerns stemming from death threats directed at me, I cannot provide a detailed comment on the allegations,” Dean said. “It is disheartening that some of my colleagues across the aisle have chosen to disregard these laws, though unfortunately, it aligns with their recent pattern of behavior.” 
The text message to Williams became public when a screenshot of it was shared on social media by former Republican state Rep. Adam Schwadron. The post inspired outrage and vitriol towards Dean.
“Typical behavior from a degenerate homo,” Aaron Dorr, a longtime gun-rights activist and lobbyist for the Missouri Firearms Coalition, wrote on social media in response to the screenshot. “America needs to make sodomy and trans behavior sinful and disgusting again.” 
Dean has apologized to Williams, Aune said.
“I am disappointed that this text was even sent and take it very seriously,” Aune said. “I would argue it was probably not even the worst thing sent between members that day.”
If Republicans try to make an example of Dean, Aune said, members of her caucus will respond.
“One of the things I shared with the speaker was that if this rises to the level of a big deal,” Aune said, “then I’ve got news for him and his caucus, because my caucus has receipts, too.”

Guest Commentary written by

Time matters, and California is running out of it. Lawmakers in Sacramento must act to address the state’s fuel and affordability crises.
Since 2001, California gas prices have increased 162%. Today, we pay about 43% more than the national average, and that figure would likely be far higher if not for record-high domestic oil production. 
That tailwind unfortunately won’t last. While crude oil prices have fallen 19% since January, California costs and taxes have increased, now accounting for approximately 26% of the retail price of gasoline. And with the highest state excise tax per gallon in the nation, California makes several times more than a typical retailer for the same gallon of gas sold.
Platitudes and rhetoric aside, the truth is California is staring at a near-term gasoline shortfall, driven largely by the pending closure of two refineries, the highest operating costs in the nation and decades of falling in-state production. What these fuel supply challenges have not resulted in is a gigantic drop in demand. This has and will continue to lead to a greater dependence on foreign fuel, greater emissions, increased exposure to global volatility, and ultimately an increase in the price Californians pay for the fuel that powers the world’s fourth-largest economy.
We face a choice: On one side, the status quo assumes California’s economy can run without petroleum any time soon. On the other is a growing recognition that affordable energy is essential to economic stability and national security.
After spending years demonizing the oil and gas industry and accusing California’s refiners of ripping off consumers, Gov. Gavin Newsom now admits that “We are all the beneficiaries of oil and gas,” under severe pressure to avert a full-blown energy crisis. At the tail end of the legislative session last week, legislators and the governor reached an agreement to increase in-state crude oil production.
If we care about our climate goals, we must also care about where our gasoline comes from. In 1982, California imported around 6% of its oil needs from foreign sources; today, the Golden State imports around 64% from various petrostates. Shipping finished fuel thousands of miles can mean crude sourced from regimes with higher emissions and weaker oversight than California.
That’s more pollution, less transparency, less leverage for the U.S. — and yes, higher prices at the pump. 
None of this is necessary, and most of this is self-created. California has one of the most underused oil reserves in the nation and some the most advanced technologies, best-trained workforces and safest producers in the world. The Newsom administration’s recent moves to ease the bureaucratic red tape and permitting challenges that have forced us to import two-thirds of all our crude quietly admits as much. 
We should use the resources we have today while we continue to build the clean energy system of tomorrow. 
We also need to dial back the regulatory cost stack. On July 1, the state raised the gas excise tax and updated the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, the state’s greenhouse gas reduction program. Layer on infrastructure costs, amortization, new storage mandates, refinery retrofits for changing crude blends and the lagging effects of the LCFS credit. If we care about affordability, let’s price it honestly and show the math.
Finally, equity must be both fiscally and morally sound. California’s gas tax — roughly 61 cents per gallon — pays for the roads we all use. Meanwhile, EV drivers don’t pay the tax but still use the same infrastructure. As EV adoption grows, the revenue gap widens. In a state that prides itself on equity, a fair solution is to stop subsidizing EV owners on the shoulders of other drivers and adopt a more equitable mileage-based road fee for EVs that accounts for miles driven and vehicle weight, which better reflects road wear.
Newsom’s long-overdue acknowledgement of a pending gasoline and price crisis — together with the Legislature’s last-minute actions — are a start but also a piecemeal approach to addressing a critical problem. 
As a next step, the Legislature should consider the repeal of regulations limiting production and pipeline use in more counties, assess the powers of agency bureaucrats who force higher prices on the backs of Californians, and a new regulatory strategy that will provide a more hospitable business environment for refiners and producers.
That ultimately means greater fuel and price security for California consumers.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/09292023_Gas-Prices-Los-Angeles_AH_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-16 08:56:27.147074

The post Report highlights persistent cha[...]","DESPITE “FRAGILE PROGRESS,” the Commonwealth’s early child care system continues to suffer from a workforce problem, according to a new analysis published by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation (MTF). 
The report makes several policy recommendations and highlights that the state is losing out on billions in tax revenue due to low earnings and lost wages, a lack of employee benefits, and subsequently high turnover. 
“Massachusetts loses close to $3 billion each year due to inadequate child care, a loss that ripples across families, employers, and the economy,” MTF policy researcher and report author Victoria Bergeron said. “But it isn’t just about dollars; it’s about supporting educators who nurture our kids while sustaining thousands of small businesses through targeted investments and thoughtful policymaking.” 
The Commonwealth Cares for Children (C3) grant program has allowed child care providers across the state to raise wages since the pandemic. The average center-based teacher salary increased from about $39,000 in 2021 to over $47,000 in 2024. However, the report shows that there is still a significant salary gap between the early education and K-12 sectors. The average salary for a K-12 teacher in 2024 was just over $92,000, and center-based educators earn nearly $5,000 less than starting K–12 teachers annually. 
Among family child care program owners and assistants, just over 40 percent receive paid time off, around 25 percent receive paid sick leave, around five percent receive discounted child care, and less than 8 percent receive dental insurance and retirements benefits. Just 4 percent of assistants receive health insurance compared to 15 percent of owners.  
A much higher share of center-based directors and teachers receive these employer-sponsored benefits, but the report shows that only around 40 percent receive dental insurance, retirement benefits, and discounted child care. 
With a lack of paid leave and access to discounted child care, the report notes that many employees are suffering lost earnings due to missing work or reducing their hours to make up for child care gaps.  
Turnover rates are high, with nearly 40 percent of assistant educators exiting their roles each year, straining program capacity and limiting access to child care statewide. Although the overall early childhood educator turnover rate has decreased since 2022 from 32 percent to 26 percent, it still meets the US Health and Human Services’ definition of “high turnover” set at 20 percent or above. 
Recent data presented by the Data Advisory Commission on Early Education and Care shows that 70 percent of infants, 43 percent of toddlers, and around 5 percent of preschoolers in Massachusetts live in an access desert. The state defines this as areas where for every three children there is only one child care slot, though there are some areas where the ratio is greater than ten children to one slot.  
“Though the state doesn’t have direct control over the compensation of early educators, the state should continue to use C3 as a tool to incentivize efforts to expand salaries and benefits for the ECE workforce,” the report says.  
Career advancement opportunities for early childhood educators remain limited, which also contributes to high turnover rates. The report points to a Department of Early Education and Care (EEC) draft of a new credentialing system that would shift the focus away from participation in higher education courses, which are often difficult for early educators to access, to a two-pathway system.  
The new system would allow educators to choose a higher education pathway or professional development pathway focused on apprenticeships, on-the-job training, and mentorship. New credentials and certification levels would be offered by EEC, allowing educators to reach leadership roles outside of the classroom as they advance in their careers. Higher career levels would receive higher pay.  
Since the pandemic, the state has significantly increased its investments in the early childhood education sector. Between 2020 and 2025, total funding for EEC has grown by $858 million, or 125 percent. Gov. Maura Healey’s “Gateway to Pre-K” agenda is set to provide universal preschool access – at low or no cost – to every 4-year-old in the state’s 26 Gateway Cities by 2026.  
In addition to continued funding for C3 and Child Care Financial Assistance (CCFA) programs, the report recommends further support for an EEC pilot program that provides priority access to CCFA for income-eligible staff working in a licensed early education program. The program addresses educators’ child care needs and creates “a positive incentive for educators to work and remain in the field,” the report states.

The process, Utah Clean Energy says, has the potential to save Utahns millions, or even billions of dollars in future energy costs.
“The question isn’t if Utah invests in new energy resources, we know we need to bring on new energy. The real question is how much those investments will cost,” Sarah Wright, CEO of Utah Clean Energy said in a statement. “This is a once in a decade opportunity to procure zero-fuel-cost renewable projects at record low prices.”

According to the filing, with the passage of the federal spending package, there’s a tight window for PacifiCorp to develop new energy resources with federal tax credits, which would result in substantial cost savings for state ratepayers.
Utah Clean Energy analysts calculated that PacifiCorp’s preferred resource portfolio could save ratepayers 56.8% for solar resources and 55.7% for wind over 25 or 30 years, the estimated lifetime of the assets, if it takes advantage of tax credits. 
“In dollars, this amounts to over $150 million of savings for every 100 MW of solar built and over $210 million of savings for every 100 MW of wind built,” the request reads.
The spending package, in addition to new U.S. Treasury Department guidance for clean energy projects eligible for the tax incentives, have created new restrictions and shorter timelines for projects pursuing tax credits. But, developers can still access clean energy production tax credits.

PacifiCorp’s preferred portfolio would have “3181 MW of tax-advantaged solar and 2641 MW of tax-advantaged wind that will reach commercial operation by the early 2030s,” the filing says. The company is planning to start a procurement process in the next four years to reach that deadline. 
But, those plans were made before the updated federal legislation, so if the company wants to capture the tax credits, it needs to push the accelerator. 
“This is a rare opportunity to invest in needed new energy resources while harnessing homegrown resources that are by far the most cost effective right now,” Wright said in a statement. “These ultra-affordable resources will contribute to Governor Cox’s Operation Gigawatt goal of doubling energy generation over the next 10 years while ensuring Utahns have reliable, affordable clean energy for decades to come.” 
The commission opened a request for comment on Utah Clean Energy’s filing that closes on Friday.

Once a cornerstone of rural health care in the region and the first community cancer center in the state, the hospital shuttered in March 2022 after a series of management failures under Noble Health and its successor, Platinum Health. For the thousands who relied on it, the closure didn’t just change where they went for care, it changed the very rhythm of their lives.
This same story has played out in rural counties throughout Missouri and the Midwest. Twenty-one hospitals have closed in Missouri in the past 10 years, many in rural areas. Residents now must drive long distances for care, or make the decision that it’s just not worth traveling — until the pain is too great or the symptoms too strong to ignore.
No one knows that better than Joseph Corrado.
Corrado spent more than 40 years operating at Audrain. Now, he spends his time on the road, driving to Columbia three days a week and to Jefferson City another two. His 2016 Cadillac Escalade, once a means of local commuting, has traveled more than 6,000 miles this year alone.
“Well, I mean, as a surgeon, it’s very, very difficult to not have a hospital,” Corrado said. “I can’t, you know, do your operation in the garage.”
Corrado used to roll out of bed and get to the operating room in three minutes, often beating the ambulance there.
Before the closure, patients could see him in his Mexico office on Monday, and be on an operating table by Tuesday. Today, everything is more complicated and farther away.
But what was lost wasn’t just convenience, it was trust, built across generations. Corrado said most of his patients didn’t want to go elsewhere for care. They preferred seeing someone they knew, someone local.
After more than four decades in Mexico, he had developed a bond not just with individuals, but with entire families, treating grandparents, parents and their children. His medical charts, he noted, are “42 years thick.”
That kind of relationship made health care personal, Corrado said. “I can’t go to Walmart without my patients coming up to me in aisle five and telling me, ‘Oh doctor, look at my incision.’”
 ‘A five-minute appointment takes half a day’

Rural areas of the state have higher poverty rates and older demographics, and about one in four rural Missourians rely on Medicaid. With fewer patients using private insurance, it has become harder for rural hospitals to offset losses.
The unemployment rate has also grown in many rural areas with hospital closures, as these towns lose a major contributor to the local economy.
For Elizabeth Berry, 72, and Randy Dickson, 63, not having a hospital means more than not having a place to get the care they need. There is another layer of difficulty when it comes to actually getting to the closest hospital, which, for most in the Mexico area, is about 40 miles away in Columbia.
“You pretty much know, if you have an emergency, you are in serious trouble,” Dickson said. “It’s a bad situation. And when you do get down there, it’s so crowded that you can’t get in. You have people who are being treated in the waiting area.”
These struggles impact everyone in the area and the impact is greatest on people who are older, can’t drive or have health issues and are on their own.
“The only way I can get there is in an ambulance, and I can’t afford it,” Dickson said. “So if I have an emergency, I just have to hope I don’t die before I get there.”
Berry’s husband died after years of battling kidney failure and heart issues. She is still struggling to pay off the debt that came with his medical bills, which were exacerbated by the lack of local care.
“He had to be airlifted a number of times or had to take an ambulance because of his issues, and I am still dealing with the bills that are coming in for transportation,” Berry said.
Patients sometimes live with injuries and illnesses for long stretches of time before seeking medical attention. Due to the high cost of emergency medical transportation, some people, when injured, wait to heal instead of immediately seeing a doctor.
This has created a layer of caution for a lot of people in Mexico, knowing “they are only going to a hospital if it is ‘life or death,’ ” Dickson said, adding “if we had an emergency room with some good doctors, that would be so much better.”
Angela and Steve Teeter travel weekly to Cape Girardeau for Steve to receive radiation and chemotherapy. He was diagnosed in early January with Stage 3B lung cancer, the disease having spread to his lymph nodes. On May 13, a spot was found on his brain, indicating the cancer had spread and leading to a Stage 4 diagnosis. The Teeters will need to drive an additional 3½ hours to St. Louis so he can receive radiation treatment.
Angela walked through what a typical appointment looks like for Steve.
“He’s doing chemo now, and he goes weekly for the treatments every Friday, and they’re usually anywhere from, I would say, on a short day, probably five hours, and then on a long day, probably like seven hours,” Angela said.
“Once we go in, we do a blood draw, then we wait, and then we see the doctor, and then we wait, and then we start the infusion. In a month and a half, we will (go) back and forth about 30 times. It’s three hours there and back. So, you know, a five-minute appointment takes half a day.”
With no nearby hospital, his initial diagnosis was delayed. “There was a lot of sickness going around, you know, flu and stuff like that. And so he went to the doctor, and they gave him antibiotics and a steroid, and then it kept on,” she said.
“He kept coughing. And so he went back to the doctor a month or so later, and they did the same thing,” she said. But the coughing persisted, and she eventually brought him to urgent care to get an X-ray.
“And then they found the tumor,” she said, “and sent him to the emergency room.”
By the completion of Steve’s weekly chemotherapy in June, the Teeters will have traveled an estimated distance of 13,400 miles.
 ‘Padlocks on the doors’

In Audrain County, the hospital’s decline began quietly in early 2020, after Noble Health acquired it. Under their tenure, and later that of Platinum Health, chaos seeped into every corner of the operation. Vendors weren’t paid. Employee health insurance was dropped, without notice. Scores of lawsuits mounted.
“I’ll never forget the day they put the padlocks on the doors and said we’re closed,” Corrado, the surgeon, said. “What do you mean we’re closed?”
Now, emergency care in Mexico often starts with a race against time. Patients are stabilized by the local ambulance district and rushed to the nearest available emergency room, typically in Columbia. There they may face hourslong wait times.
A potential path forward has emerged. In October 2024, Mexico city officials signed a letter of intent with Boone Health, entering exclusive talks to bring a critical access hospital back to town. The proposed three-year plan outlines a Medicare-certified facility with emergency services and outpatient care. But for now, it’s just that — a plan.
Meanwhile, health care advocates warn that the impact of a rural hospital closure goes far beyond emergency care. Heidi Lucas, executive director of the Missouri Rural Health Association, said the collapse of one service affects the entire system.
“In rural health, really in health care altogether, it’s very much a continuum of care,” Lucas said. “If you’re not addressing one section of it, it affects other portions. And you kind of have to look at all of them to move the needle in health care access.”
Lucas and others point to the fragile financial state of rural hospitals. COVID-era relief funds gave many a temporary cushion, but that money has long since dried up. One rural CEO told her he was “making about $0.36 for every dollar I spend.”
Community Health Specialist Jennifer Eldridge of the University of Missouri extension program said the grant programs that once propped up rural health initiatives are vanishing too.
“I’m sad about their future,” she said. “They do depend on a lot of the grants … that I’m guessing may not exist anymore.”
Eldridge recently attended a public health conference where some scheduled presenters never arrived. “They’d already lost their jobs,” she said.
For farming communities especially, preventive care is becoming harder and harder to access.
“You don’t really get a day off unless it rains,” Eldridge said. “And it’s hard to predict rain a month out.”
Some residents, she added, simply don’t want to go. “I’ve been sitting with my extension council and they’ve told me they know people who would rather stay on their farm and die than drive to the city for health care.”
For Corrado, the distance is not just a commute, it’s a constant reminder of what his town lost.
“We had an excellent medical center,” he said. “We got all kinds of accolades and recognition and that’s all gone.”
As the community waits to see if Boone Health’s proposal will materialize, Corrado keeps driving. The miles pile up. The surgeries continue. And the absence of a hospital in Mexico remains a wound that hasn’t healed.

(Getty Images)The Fairhope Public Library’s handling of children’s materials will once again be a point of discussion for the Alabama Public Library Service board.
The board of Fairhope library received permission to address APLS at its meeting on Thursday for longer than the two minutes usually given to speakers to update APLS board members on reviewing books that face challenges.  The dispute has led APLS to suspend state funding and supporters of the library to raise money to replace it.
“I have not finished writing everything I plan to say but basically will outline the fact that we have followed the procedure that we presented and got approved,” said Randal Wright, chair of the Board of Trustees of the Fairhope Public Library, in an interview on Monday.

Board members of the Fairhope library have completed their review of the 14 challenged books from several people. The board decided to reshelve several materials in the collection and left most of the controversial materials in the section for teenagers where they had been originally.
“We just found that these books were not sexually explicit,” Wright said.  “Every member of the board read about five of the books, and each book was read by two different people.”
Wright said after an APLS meeting in July that board members of the Fairhope Library reshelved five books after they reviewed 13 or the 14 books that were challenged.
The Fairhope Library had been embroiled in controversy for the past several months after the APLS board voted to approve a motion from Amy Minton, one the APLS board members, at the March meeting to suspend funding for the library. Several people spoke out against the library during a public comment period, alleging that the library was not adhering to the updated administrative code that board members approved in May 2024.
Board members also approved a second motion made by Minton at the March meeting to remove Nancy Pack, the former director of APLS.
The updated rules required libraries to establish policies to restrict access to materials that “deemed inappropriate for children or youth.” The policies must state a plan regarding where books will be placed or where they will be relocated if they are believed to be inappropriate for minors.
Libraries must also obtain approval in advance for displaying such library materials meant for minors, and minors are required to obtain permission from their parents before borrowing materials assigned to the children section. The rules also said the policies created by libraries must prohibit the purchase of inappropriate materials.
The Fairhope Public Library submitted its updated policies to APLS, which members believed had been approved.
However, some parents who visited the Fairhope Public Library continued to speak at APLS board meetings and read passages from books they said they found in sections dedicated to minors, which violated the updated administrative code.
That then prompted Minton’s request to suspend state funding for the Fairhope library.
Despite the vote, patrons of the Fairhope Public Library and city leaders continue to express support for the library and have rallied to assist it.
APLS board chair John Wahl told media in an interview after the meeting in March that the board voted to suspend the funding for Fairhope library because it refused to look at the books at all or address concerns from parents.
Fairhope library has lost $21,000, roughly half of the money it receives from the state annually, but a GoFundMe account raised enough to offset the amount that the library lost for the year.
However, Wright said it will be difficult to continuously raise the funds that library is slated to lose should the APLS board vote to terminate its funding for an extended period.
“It will hurt,” Wright said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Library-books.jpeg,,,2025-09-16 08:56:27.147074
,California,2025-09-16 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s sky-high living costs afford it the nation’s highest poverty label — again,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/09/california-living-costs-highest-poverty/,"California ties Louisiana for the highest share of poor people. Lawmakers say they just passed bills that will lower housing, electricity and gasoline costs.","Last year’s presidential election underscored, particularly to Democrats, that the costs of living were a major factor in the outcome.
Inflation had increased sharply during Joe Biden’s presidency, and voters’ angst about rising prices worked against Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign to succeed him in the White House.
Not surprisingly, therefore, when the California Legislature opened its 2025 session, its dominant Democrats declared that they would focus on taming the state’s notoriously high costs for housing, fuel, utilities and other necessities of modern life.
The session ended last week and as it did, by happenstance, the Census Bureau reported that California once again has the nation’s highest “supplemental” rate of poverty when its living costs are included in calculations over a three-year period.
California’s rate, 17.7%, means that nearly 7 million of its residents are impoverished, 5 percentage points higher than the national rate and tied with Louisiana. The lowest rate is 6.7% in Maine.
California’s rate is also 2.3 percentage points higher than it was in the Census Bureau’s previous three-year calculation, implying that its living costs vis-à-vis incomes had increased markedly.
The situation is even gloomier in a report last month from the Public Policy Institute of California and the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality.
Using methodology similar to that of the Census Bureau, they calculate that 16.9% of Californians were poverty-stricken in 2023 and another 17.9% were near-poor. That translates into 13.2 million Californians struggling to put roofs over their heads, food on the tables, fuel in their cars and electric power in their appliances and light fixtures.
Los Angeles County, which has about 25% of the state’s population, has the highest poverty rate of any county, 19.9%. Poverty in the Central Coast region is nearly as high at 19.3%, while Sacramento has the state’s lowest rate, 13%.
Another data point about poverty in California is found in the newly enacted state budget. It declares that 14.9 million Californians are enrolled in Medi-Cal, the state’s health care program for the poor.
So, one might wonder, did the Legislature’s 2025 session deliver on promises to reduce the costs of living?
Legislative leaders claim some success.
“We went big,” Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, said in a summary of the session’s work. “We produced results. We delivered historic progress — on housing, on energy, on climate, on health care, and on human rights. And that progress is something every one of us can be proud of.
“And while our work is not finished fixing California’s housing system, this year marked a turning point in California’s housing story,” Rivas continued. “And today, we also advanced the most significant energy package in years. We passed measures that will deliver real relief for families on their electricity bills. We took action to stabilize gas supplies, to prevent price shocks — while keeping health and environmental protections in place.”
By easing what had been a crackdown on gasoline refiners and sanctioning more oil production, legislators and Gov. Gavin Newsom say they are avoiding a gasoline supply crisis that could send costs soaring as the state shifts to a zero-emission economy. Two refineries have already announced closure plans, and Chevron has dropped hints that it could abandon its Richmond refinery.
By integrating California’s electric power grid with those of other Western states, the elected officials say, shortages of electric power will be mitigated.
By reducing impediments to housing development, they say, higher levels of construction will moderate increases in rents and home prices.
Whether any of these legislative efforts actually lower or at least stabilize Californians’ living costs won’t be known for months, or even years. Meanwhile, California’s high poverty rate will continue to be a civic embarrassment.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/111524_Anatomy-Of-A-Sweep-JK_CM_02.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-16 08:56:27.147074

Under the Oaks Charter School, set to open in August 2026, will  service Pre-K through eighth grade students. Under the Oaks currently operates as an enrichment center that offers childcare for Pre-K students and an after school care program. Evelyn Hambrick, the school’s executive director, said in an interview Monday the goal is to replace the current facility with the charter school.
The school would have used the extension to go before a federal judge to ensure diversity within the school and compliance with the decades-long desegregation case involving Huntsville City Schools.

The commission did not give a reason for the denial of the extension. A message seeking comment was left with the commission on Monday.
Hambrick said the extension would have been used to give the judge time to make a ruling.
“The extension was only really for the judge. The funding part finally got nailed down, and it was just dealing with the judge and going before them with the findings we had after we did our research of the surrounding schools to see where we would be pulling our students from,” she said.
Hambrick said she is unsure what not having the extension means for the school.
Hambrick told the commission Monday that Under the Oaks would have a “50/50 split” of white and Black students. She said the school is also looking to cater to the Hispanic community, which would help Huntsville City Schools remain in compliance with the desegregation order.
“A lot of [Hispanic families] were found in Triana, Alabama on the other side of Decatur, so let’s say we did get the extension and we were able to get the charter application approved, we would bring a bus to Triana to make sure that the families we are able to accommodate, that we can bring them to our school.

The Mississippi appeal could have significant repercussions nationwide and for the federal law that stems from the Civil Rights era. If the nation’s highest court rules in Fitch’s favor, it would mean civil rights groups could no longer bring a suit on behalf of citizens.
“This direct appeal presents an important legal question that has divided the courts of appeals: whether private parties may sue to enforce section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,” Fitch’s office writes. “The answer is no.” 
The AG’s office declined to comment on why it filed the appeal, which stems from a lawsuit brought by the Mississippi branch of the NAACP over the state’s legislative districts. The litigation resulted in a federal three-judge panel ruling last year that Mississippi’s legislative districts diluted Black-voting strength in three areas of the state.    
The panel, comprised of all George W. Bush-appointed judges, ordered lawmakers to redraw its districts to give Black voters in three areas of the state a fairer shot at electing candidates of their choice. Special elections for these races are currently ongoing, with the general election scheduled to happen in November. 
Ari Savitzky is a senior attorney with the ACLU voting rights project, and he is one of the attorneys who represented the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. He told Mississippi Today that the plaintiffs will oppose the state’s request. 
“What the Mississippi defendants and the GOP are asking is to overturn 60 years of law and history,” Savitzky said. 
The appeal procedure for redistricting cases is different from normal lawsuits. A member of the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals sat on the initial three-judge panel, so the state’s appeal will not go to the appellate circuit court. 
Instead, the appeal goes directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, where it must address it in some capacity. The court can ask for additional briefings, oral argument or summarily dismiss it outright. 
If the court does rule in Mississippi’s favor, it would mean only the Department of Justice, under the control of a presidential administration, could sue to enforce the Voting Rights Act. 
Mississippi’s appeal follows a similar case pending before the court. 
Several appellate circuits, including the 5th Circuit, have ruled that private citizens do have a right to sue under the federal act. But the 8th Circuit in 2023 and 2025 said that only the government, not voters and other private parties, can sue to enforce the provision, meaning circuits have been split on the issue.
The Supreme Court paused the 8th Circuit’s ruling in July, but it may agree to hear an appeal in the coming months since three members of the court — Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch — dissented.
U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson, Mississippi’s lone Democrat in Washington and someone who has used the courts to enforce civil rights laws, decried the state’s attempt to gut part of the federal law. 
“I’ve been elected all of my adult life, and in every instance, it was through legislation in the Voting Rights Act that created that opportunity,” Thompson told Mississippi Today. “To now try to deny citizens their day in court is the complete opposite of the intent of the Voting Rights Act.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/31114854/3X0A0139.jpg,,,2025-09-16 08:56:27.147074

The orange staining in the hole is the result of years of leaking oil waste from the tanks and equipment that once sat here. (All photos by Jerry Redfern.)Dave Fosdeck crested a dirt berm on the Hogback, a ridge of hills west of Farmington, New Mexico, when the scent hit him. “Whoa! It stinks!” he yelped. It was June, and he was there with two others to look at the cleanup operations around a battery of massive oil tanks that sat abandoned for years in this rolling, high-desert corner of New Mexico.









The berm surrounds a hole where a semi-buried tank the size of a backyard swimming pool once sat, collecting and leaking waste sludge from surrounding oil wells. Nearby is an even bigger but much newer hole where a cleanup crew had removed contaminated soil. The void wasn’t fully excavated but already was big enough to drop a small house in. The pit’s sides were stained orange and an even stronger petroleum smell rose from it.


This story originally appeared in Capital & Main.


For years, a separator, a semi-trailer-sized machine that split valuable oil from wastewater and other contaminants, sat here. And for years, that separator leaked those toxic compounds onto the ground, where they soaked in, leading to the orange, contaminated soil and foul air.
The two holes, the stink and a few massive piles of dirt were about all that remained of a facility — known as a tank battery — that treated oil from 30 nearby wells for decades. In addition to the separator and sludge pit, the site was home to seven cylindrical green tanks the size of small grain silos, a decades-old tanker truck with flat tires, several plastic barrels and dozens of ruptured, unlabeled, cube-shaped tanks leaking mystery chemicals. That’s mostly gone now, except for the white and yellow chemical staining on the ground where those cubical tanks leaked.
“I can’t believe they didn’t dig that all out,” Fosdeck said.
For a few years, all of this belonged to Chuza Oil, which went bust in 2018, leaving the wells, tank battery and other equipment to bake in the high desert sun. In 2022, Fosdeck, Mike Eisenfeld of the San Juan Citizens Alliance and local rancher Don Schreiber identified the remote site covered in abandoned wells and leaking equipment and began nagging federal and state officials to do something about it.

A view of the Chuza tank battery in 2023. It had been abandoned for years at this point and several unmarked plastic containers were clearly leaking.
This spot in the Hogback exemplifies a worrying, expensive trend in New Mexico’s changing oilfield remediation landscape, where well operators declare bankruptcy and abandon highly contaminated and dilapidated facilities for state and federal agencies to clean up. It’s a national trend that sweeps from the country’s first oilfields in Pennsylvania to the California coast.

Currently, New Mexico pays contractors as much as $165,000 to plug an old oil well, according to the Oil Conservation Division, the state’s primary oil and gas regulator. That’s $65,000 more than the Division reported paying just three years ago. A recent report by the state’s Legislative Finance Committee warns that New Mexico could be on the hook for up to $1.6 billion in cleanup costs in coming years from bankrupt oil and gas companies and rising plugging costs. (The report also gave the Oil Conservation Division a tongue lashing over “inconsistent cost control” in its oilfield remediation contracts.)
And while the report does talk about cleaning up tank batteries — and describes three very expensive examples — it doesn’t mention how many more may be lurking in the state’s oilfields, or what they could cost the state in the future.
Well plugging involves pulling old equipment out of the ground and scraping and flushing the wellbore before sealing it. So when a contractor arrives on site, often, “Nobody knows what they’re dealing with because it’s subsurface,” said Jason Sandel, the president of Aztec Well Servicing. Pipes rust. Pipes break. Wells might be shallower or deeper than recorded. After the pipe comes out, the contractor injects a series of cement plugs underground to keep oil, gas and other contaminants from migrating to water-bearing formations.
A tank battery has none of that, so at first glance cleaning one up looks like the easier task. But that’s not necessarily the case. The Chuza Oil tank battery site covers only about half an acre, and according to the Oil Conservation Division, the cleanup operation is on track to cost more than $650,000, much of that incurred because it was necessary to dig out and truck away the contaminated soil where the separator leaked at the remote location.
In mid-June, the cleanup clearly wasn’t finished. Orange barrier netting flapped in the wind around the pits, and the orange staining and gassy reek indicated more contaminated soil awaited removal. (Sidney Hill, public information officer for the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, said that work stopped in May due to the end of the state’s 2025 fiscal year and resumed in July with the new fiscal year.)
Fosdeck, Eisenfeld and Schreiber have spent years tracking and highlighting problems in the oilfields around Farmington. Fosdeck, on his own, follows the paper trails of abandoned wells and other fossil fuel ventures. Schreiber and Eisenfeld rattle the cages of state and federal government officials to get oil, gas and coal sites cleaned up.
“This whole part of the equation — the cleanup part — has been neglected,” Eisenfeld said. That’s one of many reasons why he thinks digging for oil, gas and coal shouldn’t be done in the first place.

Mike Eisenfeld, the energy and climate program manager at the San Juan Citizens Alliance, checks out a piece of abandoned equipment in the remains of the Chuza oilfield in June.
Randy Pacheco retired recently from a company that plugs and cleans up old well sites like Chuza’s, and before that he was dean of the School of Energy at San Juan College in Farmington, the state’s oilfield trade school. He visited the Hogback field with Fosdeck, Eisenfeld and Schreiber before the cleanup began. It wasn’t the worst thing he had ever seen, but, still, it was a mess.

“I think there’s people who have big aspirations to make a lot of money in the oil and gas industry and they end up purchasing these assets and then they don’t know what to do,” he said.
Even so, the site confounded him. “How would you get yourself in this kind of a mess?” he wondered about the abandoned equipment and dilapidated tank battery he saw. “Who’s selling them those dreams?”
*   *   *
Sometimes the dream sells itself.
Bobby Goldstein is best known for producing Cheaters, a COPS-style reality TV show of hidden cameras, secret lovers, slapped faces and shattered dreams.
“I’ve got a thousand episodes that run wild all over the world, every day, all day,” Goldstein said. Those episodes made him wealthy. In July, over a long, free-wheeling phone call, Goldstein explained in his smooth Texas patter how he, a Dallas lawyer and TV impresario, followed a dream to become an oil man and how that venture completely collapsed.
“I’ll never forget all this s—,” he said.
In 2010, Goldstein persuaded a couple of acquaintances to go into the oil business with him. They formed Chuza Oil — the name behind the Hogback mess — and, for a little less than $3 million, they bought Parowan Oil, a small company with some old wells and a tank battery near Farmington.
“[I] grew up around a bunch of rich brats whose families were big oil people,” he said. “They made the earth shake and I always thought, ‘Man, I wish I had some sense to do that.’ That opportunity came about, and I went on it.”
He continued, “I never was an oil man. I was a speculator, and for a minute there I looked real smart. … You see, I bought the land cheap, [and] oil rose and rose and rose.”
Goldstein said Chuza spent about $2 million redeveloping the oilfield infrastructure. “We made a vast improvement to the field so that it would be more efficient and more likely to be operational. So, over time, most all of those wells were working … I even moved to Santa Fe where I could be closer,” he said. “S—, I bought a jet so I could fly out there direct in an hour and a half and be on that field. I was out there a lot.”
What happened next set the stage for the collapse of Chuza Oil and what became of the Hogback Field.
Goldstein said the company spent millions drilling two fracked wells, which involved ramming huge amounts of water, sand and chemicals into long, horizontal branches of a main wellbore to fracture the surrounding rock and loosen oil and gas trapped within.
Those wells produced for two months, but the oil was laden with paraffin. The naturally occurring, waxy hydrocarbon can slowly clog wells, in much the same way that cholesterol blocks arteries. In addition, the fracking loosened paraffin in Chuza’s other wells, fouling them as well, Goldstein said.
Then, a financial catastrophe: “The son of a bitch [partner] that was supposed to pay for the wells left us a $3 million unpaid bill with various creditors,” Goldstein said. “So not only did we have a fiscal issue going on, but we also had production issues and the company wound up into a Chapter 11,” he said.
“If everybody had listened to me on that field, we’d probably already sold it for $200 or $300 million. But people that have a little money think they know something, especially when they inherited it and never worked for it,” Goldstein said. “Those are the worst kind of idiots to have to deal with.”
After spending around $15 million to buy and expand the operation, Goldstein said Chuza Oil collapsed into years of bankruptcy litigation, foreclosure, 30 abandoned, paraffin-clogged wells and one messy tank battery.
“It was my Tom Sawyer experience,” Goldstein said. “I did something that I never had any background in, training for, education. And it was just a Wild West venture capital gamble.”
And if he made a show about the experience? “I would call it ‘Pricks and Jackasses Gone Wild,’” he said.
As for his former oilfield in New Mexico, Goldstein said, “I don’t really know what’s going on.” He was unaware that the wells had been plugged and the tank battery removed. In part, that’s because he’s no longer responsible.
One reason to set up a corporation is to protect its principals from fiscal fallout should the company fail. And in that, Chuza Oil succeeded: Bankruptcy protected Goldstein and the other partners from paying for the cleanup.
Chuza’s assets were on Navajo tribal trust land, managed by the U.S. government for the benefit of the tribe. The Bureau of Land Management managed those operations, making it responsible for the overall cleanup that began late last year.

Fosdeck, left, and Schreiber talk while standing next to an abandoned Chuza oil well west of Farmington, New Mexico, in 2023. The site is on tribal trust land and the warning sign is written in Navajo.
Federal regulations give the Bureau the ability to go after earlier but still extant owners to clean up well sites abandoned by recent owners. In this case, Chuza Oil was the last in a string of owners stretching back to the 1940s for some of the oldest wells. In the end, a Bureau spokesperson said Marathon Petroleum, BP America, Woodside Energy/BHP and Enerdyne plugged 23 Chuza wells they sold years ago. BLM asked the New Mexico Oil Conservation Division to plug five wells and deal with the tank battery — none of which had extant previous owners. The Bureau plugged the remaining two wells. The cost of the cleanup bypassed Goldstein and the bankrupt Chuza Oil entirely.

Goldstein wasn’t too wistful about his wells getting torn out and smoothed over. “I’m sure the Navajo are glad that all that s—’s gone. I don’t think they ever liked all that going on there and it’s a beautiful piece of land. It was really nice to be out there,” he said.
“Special experience for me,” he concluded.
*   *   *
The cleanup of Chuza Oil’s wells and tanks represents a nominal victory after years of work by Fosdeck, Eisenfeld, Schreiber and others to expunge the legacy of neglect from the northwest corner of the state. But the victory is small.
According to Oil Conservation Division numbers from the beginning of September, New Mexico has 70,000 oil and gas wells and 6,717 registered tank batteries. About 100 new wells are drilled each month. Eventually, all of those will have to be plugged, and the land returned to something resembling its natural state.
The Legislative Finance Committee report notes that over the past 20 years, operators themselves plugged 95% of nonproducing wells in New Mexico, as the law requires. The remaining 5% were declared orphaned wells and plugged by the Oil Conservation Division.
The report says there are around 700 orphan wells awaiting state plugging with another 3,400 inactive or low-producing wells that could be added to the list in the near future. Extrapolating forward, the report suggests New Mexico could be on the hook for up to $1.6 billion in cleanup costs over the coming years as more small companies declare bankruptcy before fulfilling their obligations to plug their wells and remove equipment.
New Mexico’s Oil and Gas Reclamation Fund — filled by a fraction of a tax paid by oil and gas producers — covers the costs of implementing the Oil and Gas Act, which defines how the industry can operate in the state. The fund also pays for plugging and reclamation costs of abandoned wells and facilities. Earlier this year, the fund had $66 million, its highest balance ever. The state has kept that much in the fund by paying for plugging operations with $55.5 million in recent federal grants, as well as forfeited financial assurances that well owners are required to carry but rarely cover the actual costs of cleanup. The Finance Committee report says that the state is eligible for another $111 million from the feds.
All told, it’s a long way from $1.6 billion.
“That is why the Reclamation Fund is not a substitute for adequate bonding and financial assurance from operators,” state Rep. Matthew McQueen (D – Galisteo) said. He thinks that the report’s $1.6 billion estimate is “scary enough,” but could be low. He said the report seems to expect a stable future for an industry with a notorious boom-and-bust cycle. “In a significant downturn, the State’s liability could skyrocket rapidly” as weak companies fold and abandon wells, he said.
Smaller companies are often the first to feel economic shocks, and the state has a lot of smaller oil and gas producers. In 2024, 326 companies reported producing 740 million barrels of oil to New Mexico’s Oil Conservation Division. Just 25 companies produced 92% of that total. The numbers are similar for natural gas production.

Fosdeck holds a methane detector as it lights up from a leak at an abandoned Chuza oil well in 2023. Schreiber shields the detector from the wind with his hat.

In the last legislative session, McQueen proposed a bill that would have kept well owners on the hook for remediation costs into the future if they sell wells to owners that go bankrupt — similar to what the federal government does. “It would cause the industry to self-police and make sure that any future operators had the wherewithal to properly remediate well sites,” he said. It didn’t pass.
McQueen also proposed legislation to weed out potential buyers without the money or know-how to run an oil production business, as well as so-called bad actors with histories of negligence or bankruptcy. That, too, didn’t pass.
The Finance Committee report recommends several procedural and definition changes, as well as creating a law allowing the Oil Conservation Division to disallow well sales if “the purchaser is unlikely to be able to fulfill its asset retirement obligations” — much like McQueen proposed. It also called for increasing the required financial assurances paid by oilfield operators for cleanup costs on low-producing wells, which are more likely to be orphaned.
However, the Chuza Oil assets wouldn’t have been subject to these proposed laws, because the wells and tank battery were on federal land not subject to state jurisdiction, despite the fact that the state ended up paying for the cleanup.
Ben Shelton, deputy cabinet secretary of the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department — the mothership to the Oil Conservation Division — said, “The report got a lot right, including identifying a need for [the Division] to be able to scrutinize transfers more closely in order to reduce the likely incidences of orphaned wells.”
Shelton said that the Division didn’t have an estimate for either the number of orphaned tank batteries or their average cleanup costs, but the oilfield cleanups of a trio of tank batteries were some of the most expensive the state paid for in the last couple of years, at $623,000, $5.1 million and $7.6 million. The estimated $650,000 Chuza Oil tank battery cleanup will eventually join the list.
As of publication, that months-long process wasn’t finished. And in the end, the cleanup around the Chuza Oil tank battery, while expensive and time-consuming, isn’t necessarily uncommon, according to Sandel at Aztec Well Servicing, which is cleaning up the site.
“There were many more yards of contaminated soil than expected. … But I don’t think that’s abnormal,” Sandel said. “I wouldn’t characterize it as outside the bounds at all.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/A-Chuza_2025_0609_02-scaled-1-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-09-16 07:56:13.877666

Mike Braun addresses reporters on Monday, Aug. 18, 2025, at the Indiana Statehouse. (Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Gov. Mike Braun suggested Monday that Indiana lawmakers could return for a special session in November to redraw congressional boundaries — his clearest signal yet in support of mid-cycle redistricting.
Speaking on Fort Wayne’s WOWO radio, Braun said the state is “in the process where we will evolve in that direction,” and continued to emphasize — as he has in recent weeks — that he wants Hoosier legislative leaders to take the lead on the issue.
“I want it to be where it wasn’t forced upon our legislature, have our leaders talk to their own caucus members,” Braun said. “Some have already changed their point of view when they look at what good comes from it.
“You’re going to find that, probably, the legislators will come around to it,” he continued. “I’m going to give them time. I think eventually we’ll get there.”
Possible ‘consequences’
He pointed to Ohio and Florida as examples. Ohio is already preparing for a map redraw, while Florida’s Supreme Court recently upheld a GOP-favored congressional map.
Braun also tied Indiana’s timeline to national GOP politics. 
“If we try to drag our feet as a state on it, probably, we’ll have consequences of not working with the Trump administration as tightly as we should,” Braun said.
Vice President JD Vance visited the Indiana Statehouse in early August to meet with GOP leaders about redistricting, and later that month, a group of Republican lawmakers traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet with Vance and other federal officials about the same issue. 










You’re going to find that, probably, the legislators will come around to it.


– Gov. Mike Braun


Some Hoosier legislators said those conversations played a role in their decision to change their stance.
Trump is pushing GOP-led states like Indiana to redraw maps ahead of the 2026 midterm elections to ensure a Republican majority in the U.S. House for the rest of his second term. Redistricting is typically only done after the decennial census.
The Republican governor raised the possibility of lawmakers returning before the end of the year. 
“We’ll have to do that either at the very beginning of the next (legislative) session we have in ‘26, or probably more ideally sometime in November,” he said in the radio interview. The next regularly scheduled legislative session, for 2026, begins in January.
Waiting until 2026 would be complicated by the filing period for congressional primaries starting in January.
The governor is the only one empowered to call a special session. A two-week special session in Indiana in 2022 cost about $240,000.
Lawmakers still divided, leadership quiet
Braun’s comments come amid ongoing deliberations among Indiana’s Republican supermajorities. GOP senators held a closed-door caucus last week to discuss redistricting, but did not comment publicly afterward. House Republicans also caucused virtually on Friday and have met previously in person. 
Legislative leadership has largely remained silent on the issue.  
Still, some rank-and-file lawmakers have started to shift. Among them, Seymour Rep. Jim Lucas recently flipped from opposing to supporting a map redraw, saying he went from a “hard no to a hell yes.”
Others — like Sen. Spencer Deery, of West Lafayette — said as recently as last week that they remain against making changes before the next census.
Outside the Statehouse, opposition is also mounting. A coalition of advocacy groups delivered nearly 9,000 signatures last week urging lawmakers not to pursue early redistricting.
Braun on Monday specifically dismissed Democratic criticisms of the idea, pointing to the state’s maps from two decades ago. 
“I think more and more legislators are understanding that the real gerrymandering — you ought to look at the map that the Dems did from the year 2000, where they were in charge of the new jurisdictions,” he said. “That looked like the tentacles of an octopus, would be the best way to describe it. So you’re going to find, I think, that … (Democrats) are raising most of the chorus against it — because they cannot gerrymander any further.”

Effective wildfire prevention starts by funding and staffing key agencies and investing in proven fire-mitigation techniques like home hardening and science-based forest management. The Fix our Forests Act does neither.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Patrick Parenteau, David L. Deen, Peter Des Meules and Andrew D. Cliburn: How not to fix our forests.","This commentary is by Patric Parenteau, of Thetford Center; David L. Deen, of Westminster; Peter DesMeules, of Norwich; and Andrew D. Cliburn, of Norwich. Parenteau is a professor of law emeritus and senior fellow for climate action at the Vermont Law and Graduate School and the former commissioner of the Vermont Department of Environmental Conservation.

DesMeueles is a lawyer and a partner at DesMeules, Olmstead & Ostler, a law firm that provides legal services in the state and federal courts in Vermont and New Hampshire. Cliburn is a lawyer at DesMeules, Olmstead & Ostler.


Vermonters recently received some unsolicited advice from Brooklyn on how to manage our forests in the wake of an increasing number of wildfires driven by climate disruption. 
James Campbell, the author of the commentary, “How the ‘Fix Our Forests Act’ protects Vermont’s future,” urges Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., who sits on the Senate Agriculture Committee that oversees the U.S. Forest Service to support S.1462, dubbed the “Fix Our Forests Act.” But the commentary paints a misleading picture of what the Fix Our Forests Act does and how it would facilitate President Donald Trump’s executive order mandating increased logging on the National Forests.  
First, the Fix Our Forests Act exempts a new ill-defined class of “hazardous fuels management activities” (think clearcut logging) from the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act. 
The National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act has become the scapegoat for unnecessary delays in forest management — but the data shows that the vast majority of projects are processed quickly using existing legal authorities. In fact, budget cuts and staff layoffs like the ones orchestrated by the Department of Government Efficiency and Trump are primarily responsible for whatever delays there may be. 
The Fix Our Forests Act also exempts forest management plans from the consultation requirements of the Endangered Species Act when new information indicates that they pose a threat to threatened or endangered species  
Second, the Fix our Forests Act limits the opportunities for affected communities to participate in decisions with significant impacts on their quality of life. The National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act is a principal mechanism for the public to be informed about proposed changes in forest management and weigh in with comments and suggestions. 
The National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act ensures that decisions are scientifically informed and based on public input for better stewardship of natural resources. We have seen this repeatedly in the management of our beloved Green Mountain National Forest. 
Third, the Fix our Forests Act places new obstacles to gaining judicial review of questionable decisions by an administration that has shown utter contempt for the rule of law. The Fix our Forests Act limits the time to seek judicial review to 120 days after the date of publication of a notice in the Federal Register that the agency intends to carry out a management project. More alarmingly, it allows forest management projects to proceed even when a court finds that they violate federal law.    
Finally, the Fix our Forests Act paves the way for increasing road density and removing large old trees that are fire resistant. Older trees also store a disproportionately high amount of carbon, helping to mitigate the effects of climate change. Road density has been linked with an increase in human-caused wildfires. In plain terms: More roads mean more wildfires. 
Effective wildfire prevention starts by funding and staffing key agencies and investing in proven fire-mitigation techniques like home hardening and science-based forest management. The Fix our Forests Act does neither.
We all want healthy forests and clear summer skies. But the Fix our Forests Act is a false promise that will cut the public out of most forest management decisions and curtail judicial oversight at a time when accountability of government officials is more important than ever. We are counting on Welch to do the right thing and oppose this ill-conceived “fix.”

Washington’s top K-12 official is asking lawmakers to bankroll a statewide push in 2026 to bring artificial intelligence tools and training into classrooms.
Superintendent of Public Instruction Chris Reykdal told TVW’s “Inside Olympia“ that he will request about $10 million in the upcoming supplemental budget for a statewide pilot program to purchase AI tutoring tools — beginning with math — and fund teacher training. 
He also urged legislators to protect education from cuts, make structural changes to the tax code, and act boldly rather than leaving local districts to fend for themselves.
“If you’re not willing to make those changes, don’t take it out on kids,” Reykdal said.
The funding push comes as new Smarter Balanced Assessment results show gradual improvement but highlight persistent inequities. State test scores have ticked upward, and student progress rates between grades are now mirroring pre-pandemic trends. 
Still, higher-poverty communities are not improving as quickly as more affluent peers. About 57% of eighth graders met foundational math progress benchmarks — better than most states, Reykdal noted, but still leaving four in 10 students short of university-ready standards by 10th grade.
Reykdal cautioned against reading too much into a single exam, emphasizing that Washington consistently ranks near the top among peer states. He argued that overall college-going rates among public school students show they are more prepared than the test suggests. 
“Don’t grade the workload — grade the thinking,” he said.
Artificial intelligence, Reykdal said, has moved beyond the margins and into the mainstream of daily teaching and learning: “AI is in the middle of everything, because students are making it in a big way. Teachers are doing it. We’re doing it in our everyday lives.” 
OSPI has issued human-centered AI guidance and directed districts to update technology policies, clarifying how AI can be used responsibly and what constitutes academic dishonesty. Reykdal warned against long-term contracts with unproven vendors but said larger platforms with stronger privacy practices will likely endure. He framed AI as a tool for expanding customized learning and preparing students for the labor market, while acknowledging the need to teach ethical use.
Reykdal pressed lawmakers to think more like executives, anticipating global competition rather than waiting for perfect solutions. “If you wait until it’s perfect, it will be a decade from now, and the inequalities will be massive,” he said. 
With test scores climbing slowly and AI transforming classrooms, Reykdal said the Legislature’s next steps will be decisive in shaping whether Washington narrows achievement gaps — or lets them widen.

“The perceived medicinal value creates an increased demand for the species and their body parts, which threaten the long-term survivability of a population by overharvesting,” said Fish and Wildlife Police Captain Brad Rhoden. “Beyond being illegal, it’s highly concerning to unethically waste black bears, or any wildlife for that matter, for nothing more than a few body parts being sold on the black market.” 
The sentencing reflects a collaborative effort between Fish and Wildlife officers and the Environmental Protection Division of the Washington State Attorney General’s Office to combat unlawful wildlife trafficking within Washington state, Fish and Wildlife said Monday in a news release. 
Li was first cited for unlawful possession of wildlife in 2020 after Fish and Wildlife officers responded to a Skagit County Health Department report of possible health code violations at Li’s restaurant, identified in court documents as the Fortune Mandarin, in Mount Vernon. 
The health department had received multiple reports of deceased local wildfowl outside of Li’s restaurant. Fish and Wildlife officers confirmed Fortune Mandarin wasn’t selling the wildfowl and issued her a citation. 
When more complaints about dead wildfowl at the Fortune Mandarin were filed with the health department in late 2021, Fish and Wildlife started the investigation that ultimately led to Li’s arrest. 
Charges were filed in Skagit County Superior Court on Jan. 15, 2025. Trial was scheduled to begin Sept. 29, but was canceled when Li entered her guilty plea.

Gov. Geoff Duncan speaks on stage during the third day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on August 21, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois. Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesFormer Republican Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan is running for Georgia governor as a Democrat.
Duncan announced his campaign Tuesday with a video targeting President Donald Trump.
“Georgians deserve leaders with the courage to take on Donald Trump and do what’s right,” Duncan said in the video. “As Georgia’s first Democratic governor in 28 years, I will stand up to Trump and his ‘yes’ men in our state while bringing down the costs of child care, health care, and housing so every Georgia family is in the best position possible. That’s what Georgia deserves.”
Duncan pledged to “make Georgia the frontline of democracy and a backstop against extremism.”
A former state representative and professional baseball player, Duncan served one term as lieutenant governor, declining to run for re-election in 2022 after vocally criticizing Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
In 2021, Duncan authored a book called GOP 2.0 outlining his vision for a post-Trump Republican Party, and after his time in office, he became a fixture on cable news shows as an anti-Trump Republican. He was considered as a presidential candidate for the centrist No Labels party in 2024.
Last year, he campaigned on behalf of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, including at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where he blasted the modern Republican Party as “a cult worshiping a felonist.” Before that, he had endorsed former President Joe Biden for another term.
In January, the Georgia Republican Party passed a resolution seeking to bar Duncan from calling himself a Republican and banishing him from party events, saying that his support for Harris and opposition to Trump and other GOP candidates meant he had “forfeited any claim to being even a nominal ‘Republican.’”
In his announcement video, Duncan called attacks from Trump a “badge of honor.”
“I’ve never wavered in taking on Trump,” he said. “So Georgia Republicans threw me out of their party. I was leaving anyway.”
Duncan officially announced his new affiliation last month.
Duncan joins a field of Democrats with a longer history with the party, including former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, state Sen. Jason Esteves of Atlanta and former DeKalb County CEO Michael Thurmond.
The winner of the May Democratic primary will face off against the top finisher in the GOP field led by Duncan’s successor, Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, a major Trump ally, and Attorney General Chris Carr, who has sought to align himself with the wing of the Georgia Republican Party represented by Gov. Brian Kemp, supporting Trump’s policies while trying to keep a distance from the president’s more controversial behaviors.
A Jones-Duncan match-up would represent a true political grudge match. Duncan stripped then-state Sen. Burt Jones of his committee chairmanship following Trump’s 2020 loss and Jones’ role in supporting Trump’s baseless claims of election fraud.

Gov’s call for utility bill tax pause faces key skeptics,Leslie Bonilla Muñiz,,,,,https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/2025/09/16/indiana-lt-govs-call-for-utility-bill-tax-pause-faces-key-skeptics/,"Even as utility rates rise, the push for a moratorium faces a difficult path through the General Assembly.","Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith addresses a property tax rally at the Indiana Statehouse on March 17, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana’s second-highest official has thrown his weight behind calls for a sales tax moratorium on utility services — but, even as rates rise, the idea faces a difficult path through the General Assembly.
“People are shouting about this issue more than any other issue right now, as I travel the state,” Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith told the Capital Chronicle. “… These utility bills, they’re just going through the roof.”
The state’s five investor-owned utilities all charge more than last year — most by double-digit percentages — for the average residential customer using 1,000 kilowatt hours monthly, per an annual regulator survey.
Duke Energy Indiana customers using that amount of energy were paying monthly bills of $156 on July 1, about 20% higher than that day last year. AES Indiana ratepayers owed $158, a 12% year-over-year increase, while Indiana Michigan Power’s households owed $160, just 3% higher.
Braun names next top utility customer advocate, tees up regulator overhaul

CenterPoint Energy customers paid significantly more: $221, a 25% hike. And Northern Indiana Public Service Co. ratepayers were charged the most — $234 — with the highest increase since last year: 27%.
The point-in-time survey, conducted by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, doesn’t capture every change. It also doesn’t include the taxes.
Easing up on that, Beckwith said, “would at least give some relief.”
“Now, I don’t think it’s going to fix the problem, but it’s a start,” he added.
Key legislative leaders oppose nixing the sales tax on utility services, however, and past attempts have failed to gain traction at the Statehouse.
Taxes on your service
Indiana imposes a 7% sales tax on the sale of electricity, gas, water and steam by public utilities. It’s the same levy applied to most other taxable transactions, according to the Department of Revenue.
There’s no publicly available data on how much revenue that generates. But about 99.8% of all sales tax earnings — including for utility services — go to the state’s General Fund, spokesman Gus Pearcy said.
There’s some precedent for reducing the tax burden on utility bills.
Hoosier lawmakers repealed the utility receipts tax and complementary utility services use tax in 2022. One was a “quasi-income” tax on a utility’s gross receipts and the other was an excise tax on retail consumption.

“The costs of these taxes were often passed along to consumers,” Pearcy said. “The intent of repealing the (taxes) was to lessen the burden on taxpayers and to help Indiana’s competitiveness from a business standpoint.”
But repeated efforts to exempt utility services from the sales tax, mostly led by Democratic lawmakers, have died without committee hearings.
Hoosiers are still talking about it. That’s what prompted Beckwith to take to X last month and proclaim his support, he said.
“It’s time for Indiana to step up and give our people a break,” he wrote. “I’m calling for a moratorium on STATE TAXES for utility bills until rates return to reasonable levels. Our families deserve relief, not more financial burden. When times are tough, government should lighten the load.”
In the past, then-Gov. Frank O’Bannon suspended collection of the sales tax on gasoline when prices soared in 2000.
Leaders reject
Now, Beckwith’s working on “building a coalition.”
He described floating the idea by lawmakers he trusts, many of whom have been “very receptive.” He hopes to push them into taking the proposal higher, like to a committee chair.

“It doesn’t need to come from the lieutenant governor,” Beckwith said. “It really needs to come from, I think, their fellow House members or their fellow senators. … They’re going to have more sway in the battle inside their caucus than I will.”
And he’ll bring the bully pulpit.
“I’ve got a really big platform that I can use. And I’ll just echo what the people have been telling me,” Beckwith said. “… We’re going to continue to put public pressure on our state officials to get it done.”
The General Assembly’s fiscal leaders, however, are wary.
“Once you start down that path, I can think of a whole lot of things we should not be doing sales tax on,” Rep. Jeff Thompson, who leads the House’s Appropriations Committee, said at a recent tax panel. “And this list is getting longer, as I sit here, and longer and longer. And we’re going from $100 million to $1 billion to — it just grows and grows.”
“Where do you draw that line? That’s the ongoing discussion,” added Thompson, R-Lizton. “Any one (exemption) isolated? Well, maybe not all bad. But … it’s a dangerous path.”

Sen. Travis Holdman, who chairs the Senate’s Tax and Fiscal Policy Committee, was more blunt.
“I just dismiss the discussion to be honest with you,” said Holdman, R-Markle. “… It’s just not doable.”
Ratepayer advocates, however, back the idea.
“That is a reasonable proposal to provide some relief to customers while we figure out the broader picture,” said Kerwin Olson, executive director for the Citizen Action Coalition.
But even then, “it’s a temporary Band-Aid,” he cautioned. “And so, let’s hope that … they spend some time looking at the other root causes and hopefully provide some more meaningful, long-term solutions.”

Kelda Roys calls attention to the issue of child care funding during a June press conference alongside her Democratic colleagues. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Democratic state Sen. Kelda Roys of Madison said she will fight back against “extremists” as she launched her campaign for governor Monday morning. 
Roys, 46, is now the fourth candidate to enter the open Democratic primary. She joins Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley as well as Mukwonogo beer vendor Ryan Strnad.
“I’ve been protecting our freedoms when others didn’t even see the threat coming. That’s leadership. See the problem. Build the coalition, deliver results,” Roys said in her campaign announcement ad. “I’ve done it while raising five kids and running a small business, because when something matters, we find a way.” 
Roys gave two reasons for why she is running for governor in an interview with the Wisconsin Examiner. 
“I’m running because Wisconsin needs a governor who’s going to stand up to what the Republican regime is doing and protect Wisconsinites from the harms that they are causing us,” Roys said. “And also because this is a time of incredible opportunity for Wisconsin, and we need a governor who knows how to get things done, how to deliver meaningful change for families across the state.” 
Promising to push back on the Trump administration, Roys said that means that “as people are losing their health care coverage because of the federal budget, as farmers don’t have the workforce to help harvest their crops, as small businesses are struggling with the high cost and uncertainty caused by Trump’s policies, I’m going to do everything in my power to help Wisconsinites thrive.”
Roys said the Democratic Party is struggling with low approval ratings because people aren’t seeing Democrats do enough to combat Trump.
“When I talk to folks all around the state, it’s because people are angry that Democrats don’t seem to be meeting this moment and ringing the alarm bells the way that we need to be right now,” Roys said. 
Roys was elected to the Senate in 2020 and has served as one of four Democrats on the Joint Finance Committee, which is responsible for writing the state’s biennial budget, since 2023. Prior to this, she served two terms in the state Assembly, including one under former Gov. Jim Doyle and one under former Gov. Scott Walker. 
Roys said her experience in the Legislature would help inform the way she would lead as governor. 
“Much to my chagrin, when you look at the governors who have been effective at cementing their legacies into the law, it’s the governors that have come from the Legislature,” Roys said. “Tommy Thompson and Scott Walker are really the top examples that we have, because they understood how to work with the Legislature.” 
Roys said the makeup of the state Legislature will not change her determination to get things done, though she is “bullish” in her belief that the state Senate will flip Democratic in 2026 and possibly the state Assembly, too. 
“My feeling is that you’re never going to get anything done alone. You always are going to need a team, and the job of the governor is to build that so that you can make durable change, and I will continue to maintain a strong relationship with Republican and Democratic legislators,” Roys said. “As governor, I’m going to be always looking for opportunities to partner with the Legislature, to reach across the aisle, because this is a purple state.” 
Roys said her history shows her ability to advance her priorities, even in a Republican Legislature, and that is what sets her apart from other Democratic candidates in the race.
One accomplishment, she noted, was her experience as a law student working with the Wisconsin Innocence Project to help pass Act 60, a criminal justice reform law aimed at helping prevent wrongful convictions, in a Legislature dominated by Republicans. Roys also noted the when she was executive director of NARAL Wisconsin, she advocated for the passage of the Compassionate Care for Rape Victims Act, which requires Wisconsin hospital emergency rooms to provide medically accurate oral and written information regarding emergency contraception to victims of sexual assault and to dispense emergency contraception upon request. 
Roys has been an outspoken advocate for reproductive rights during her service in the Legislature as well, calling for the repeal of the 1849 criminal law that ended abortion services in the state for a year and a half after Roe v. Wade was overturned, and the loosening of other abortion restrictions in the state.
Roys, who voted against the recent state budget, said she did so in part because of the lack of education funding. As governor, she said she would want to improve public education and ensure that “we’re not perpetually forcing our schools to go to their neighbors and ask them to raise their own property taxes just to keep the lights on and keep teachers in the classroom.”
Beyond funding, Roys laid out a couple of priorities for schools on her campaign website, including “using evidence-based learning, keeping smartphones out of the classroom, retaining high standards, engaging parents and community members as stakeholders and ensuring high quality professional development for educators.” 
This is Roys’ second time running. She came in third in the Democratic primary in 2018, when Evers was first elected, behind Mahlon Mitchell, president of the Professional Fire Fighters of Wisconsin. 
Wisconsin’s gubernatorial primaries are about 11 months away, scheduled for August 2026.  
The Republican primary is still taking shape as well. Whitefish Bay manufacturer Bill Berrien and Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann have officially entered the race. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany has said he will make a decision about entering the race by the end of the month. 
Berrien said in a statement about Roys’ campaign launch that Wisconsinites were not going to “elect a career politician who views the governor’s mansion as another stepping stone in her career” and that voters had already rejected her “extreme, far-left policies and Medicare for All Agenda.”
“As governor, I’ll create prosperity for all through work because it doesn’t matter who the Democrats nominate, I will beat them,” Berrien said. 
Roys said she hadn’t seen Berrien’s full statement, but it sounded “laughable.”
“I’ve actually spent more of my career in the private sector than in the public, but I still have way more experience than any of the Republicans thinking of running for governor,” Roys said.
In the six-year gap between her service in the Assembly and Senate, Roys founded Open Homes, an online real estate service, in 2013, as a way to “lower fees and make it easier for people to buy and sell their homes,” according to her campaign announcement. She first got her real estate license at 19 when she lived in New York City to help pay for college, according to the business website.
As for Berrien’s charge that she is “extreme,” Roys says, “there is no place for violence or violent rhetoric in our politics, but you have to look no further than the President that these Republicans support, who has unleashed an incredible amount of violent rhetoric that is meant to scare and intimidate Americans who disagree with him, and it’s not just his words, but it’s his actions.”
Roys noted Trump’s pardons of January 6th insurrectionists. 
“I don’t know what you can call those pardons, if not a permission slip for violence,” Roys said. “I don’t want to hear one word from Republican candidates about extremism, until they denounce their own president and his contributions to the terrible situation that this country is in.”
Roys said the biggest challenge that Democrats face in competing statewide in 2026 is a group of “very, very well funded billionaires and right wing extremists that gerrymandered our state and have been trying to buy elections here for a generation.” She said she would work to combat that by “building a strong statewide grassroots campaign of people from across the political spectrum who want to see Wisconsin actually solve our problems and move forward again.”

(Getty Images)At the direction of Gov. Mike Braun, a working group met regularly throughout the summer to draft a set of recommendations that would impact thousands of young Hoosiers — but most of the work was done behind closed doors, setting up questions about its compliance with transparency laws.
The working group met to discuss how the state could contain growing Medicaid costs related to Applied Behavior Analysis therapy, which has grown exponentially in Indiana. Parents of autistic children increasingly rely on the therapy, which isn’t without its critics.
Braun established the ABA working group by executive order in February, but its 21 panelists never openly discussed its business before the public. The state believes the group, organized by two cabinet secretaries, doesn’t need to comply with Open Door or video streaming laws.


Indiana Medicaid spending on ABA therapy over time:
2019: $120 million
2020: $102 million
2021: $276 million
2022: $420 million
2023: $639 million
Source: Indiana Capital Chronicle reporting


According to the group’s website, members met six times for closed-door meetings between May and August and hosted five listening sessions that were open to the public. Each is summarized online with attendance and takeaways.
Additionally, 20 of the group’s members signed nondisclosure agreements, which two Democrats criticized in a joint statement last month. According to Marcus Barlow, the deputy chief of staff for the Family and Social Services Administration, those agreements expire following publication of the final report, which is due later this year.
Having nonpublic meetings and NDAs allowed some working group members who are parents to openly discuss their experiences with ABA therapy, he said. State employees in the group, including the one who didn’t sign an NDA, would additionally be prohibited from speaking about individual treatment experiences because of HIPAA, Barlow added.
HIPAA, shorthand for the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, protects an individual’s medical records but only applies to covered entities and business associates, such as health care providers or third-party vendors. As the health care provider for thousands of young Hoosiers utilizing ABA therapy under Medicaid, some state employees would fall under that definition.
If the working group is subject to the state’s Open Door Law, it likely also must comply with the newly enacted streaming requirement.
As of July, governing bodies are expected to livestream their meetings — down to local units of government meeting in their public buildings, with some exceptions. Additionally, meetings must be archived for at least 90 days.
 What about the Open Door Law?

A 2022 edition of the “Handbook on Indiana’s Public Access Laws,” from former Public Access Counselor Luke Britt and former Attorney General Curtis Hill, overviews the 1977 law defining open meetings.
“Generally, all meetings of the governing bodies of public agencies must be open at all times so members of the public may observe and record them,” the handbook notes, though there are exceptions. 
Indiana FSSA increases proposed autism therapy reimbursements — but providers say not enough

State code defines a public agency as, “Any board, commission, department, agency, authority, or other entity, by whatever name designated, exercising a portion of the executive, administrative or legislative power of the state.”
This explicitly includes bodies created by executive order, “except for medical staffs or the committees of any staff.” 
FSSA, in a statement through Barlow, argued the working group didn’t qualify as a public agency, “because it was not created to advise a governing body of a public agency. The Executive Order directs the group to report solely to the Governor, who is not a ‘governing body’ under the statute, which requires ‘two or more individuals.’”
Nor, the statement continued, can the working group be considered a “governing body.” 
While a governing body includes bodies taking official action on public business — which includes receiving information and making recommendations, according to law — FSSA argued that the members don’t qualify.
“Given that the ABA working group is neither a public agency nor a governing body under Indiana law, the Open Door Law does not apply. NDAs are a lawful tool to support candid dialogue and protect sensitive information as the group fulfills its charge,” the statement concluded.
According to the executive order, the group’s written report is due to Braun by Nov. 30, 2025 and must include “three recommendations for meaningful ABA cost containment” with pros and cons of each.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s institutions are refusing to discuss the impacts of the Trump administration’s decision to cut federal research grants for projects with ties to diversity, equity and inclusion. 
While most Oklahoma institutions declined to comment on or confirm specific grant cancellations, a third-party grant tracking project reported several DEI-related grants allocated to fund medical research in the state were canceled following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last month. The nation’s high court, in a 5-4 decision, allowed the Trump administration to cancel hundreds of millions of dollars nationally that were awarded by the National Institutes of Health.
The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center reported losing the biggest share of funding.
In response to an open records request, the university confirmed three grants totaling $840,000 were cancelled as a result of the Supreme Court decision. A spokesperson for OU did not return multiple requests for comment or answer specific questions about the potential impact of the canceled grants. 
One grant for nearly $270,000 was intended to recruit and train “under-represented students” to be competitive for admission to biomedical doctoral programs, according to the NIH grant rePORTER. 
Another for $530,000 had the goal of improving patient immune responses against certain bacteria. The third grant, for $39,000, aimed to improve understanding of chromosome organization in order to better understand how disruptions impact cellular function, according to the records request and the NIH grant rePORTER. 
The Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation saw a grant worth $682,000 canceled, according to Grant Witness, a project tracking the termination of grants of scientific research agencies under the Trump administration. The grant was intended to study a new source of “innate lymphoid cells.” 
A spokesperson for OMRF, an Oklahoma City nonprofit that conducts biomedical research, declined to discuss the status of the grant or say whether any federal research funding had been lost.
Mack Burke, a spokesperson for Oklahoma State University, confirmed none of the institution’s grants were affected by the Supreme Court decision. One project with NIH funding was completed as scheduled, he said. Grant Witness reported NIH granted over $473,000 to OSU for a project to support training of biomedical sciences doctoral students from “diverse backgrounds.” 
A spokesperson for the Cherokee Nation did not return requests for comment confirming any NIH grant cancellations. Grant Witness reported NIH awarded the tribe a $2.9 million NIH grant to improve contact tracing, testing and education for COVID-19 for underserved and vulnerable populations, particularly in rural America and Native populations.

The House Draw Fire, a massive blaze that eliminated much of the region’s best sagebrush habitat in 2024, is one culprit in a downward population trend not seen anywhere else in the state. 
The post As Wyoming sage grouse near their cyclic high, northeastern population tumbles appeared first on WyoFile .","Wildlife ecologist Chris Kirol has spent time of late surveying what used to be some of the last big tracts of sagebrush left in the Powder River Basin. 
The veteran researcher has been looking for native vegetation like sagebrush, and also for the chalk-colored cylindrical droppings that are a telltale sign of where one of the biome’s icons, sage grouse, have been spending their time. On a Friday afternoon survey, Kirol took a call from WyoFile and described the landscape all around him, which had been completely transformed and for the worse. 
“It’s almost completely dominated by cheatgrass and Japanese brome,” Kirol said, noting two noxious, nonnative grasses. 
“I haven’t found a single sage grouse scat,” he added, “which is expected because there’s about five sagebrush left in this quarter-mile area.”

Kirol was walking through a burn scar from the nearly 180,000-acre House Draw Fire. The Johnson County blaze, which ripped through grassland and shrubland in August 2024, eliminated more than 100,000 acres of the “core” sage grouse habitat in the northeast region of Wyoming, where the birds dwell — more than a third of the best habitat in a region where the population was already struggling. There were 20 sage grouse breeding grounds — open areas known as leks — within the House Draw Fire’s perimeter. 
“They were large leks,” Kirol said. “We know from years and years of research that this was one of the areas with the highest density of sage grouse left in northeast Wyoming.” 
In the first year of post-fire monitoring, there were male sage grouse documented displaying at eight of the 20 leks — which is actually the same as during pre-fire surveys in 2024. But the tallies in the burn scar tumbled.
Sage grouse counts in northeast Wyoming, depicted here, have been steadily declining since the turn of the century and are not cycling in tandem with more robust western populations. (Wyoming Game and Fish Department)
“Those leks were down 40%,” Wyoming Game and Fish Department sage grouse/sagebrush biologist Nyssa Whitford told WyoFile. 
“Those birds took a hit, there’s no question about it,” she said. “If you see the House Draw Fire out there on the ground, you can see why it’s down. It burned hot, it burned fast, and in a lot of pockets there’s not much [sagebrush] left.” 
Adverse effects of the House Draw Fire help explain why the counts assessed at the 336 occupied sage grouse leks in northeast Wyoming fell by 10% in 2025 — a year when the naturally cyclic species otherwise did well across the Equality State. 
Near the peak
Hundreds of biologists, wardens and volunteers who fanned out across Wyoming’s sagebrush-steppe counted more than 30,000 male sage grouse strutting on 971 of the state’s known, occupied leks in the spring of 2025. That’s an average of 30.9 birds per active lek, which is a 10% increase over the 2024 counts and nearly a doubling of the population since the last low point in 2021. 
Those swings are natural and part of basic sage grouse biology. Statewide in Wyoming, it takes about 9.6 years on average to complete a cycle, Whitford said.
“If I look back at the past data, I feel like this year is the peak,” Whitford said. “But we won’t know that until next year.”

Lek counts last crested in 2016, when there were 35.6 birds tallied per active lek, according to Game and Fish data. Before that, numbers topped out in 2006 when nearly 42 strutting males were documented on the average lek. If 2025 does go into the record books as the next peak, sage grouse abundance will have fallen nearly 36% since the 2006 peak. 
Whitford pointed out that back in 1999, there was a lower peak: 30.7 birds per lek.
Other metrics suggest the state’s population remains in a long-term decline. The number of occupied leks statewide has fallen about 6.5%, from roughly 1,840 to 1,720, since the 2016 peak, Game and Fish data shows.

Sage grouse depend on a biome — sagebrush-steppe — that is disappearing and degrading at a rate of 1.3 million acres per year in western North America. The continued habitat loss explains why sage grouse numbers have fallen by an average of about 3% per year over the past half-century, according to a 2021 U.S. Geological Survey report. The chicken-sized bird’s persistent struggles have led to petitions calling for Endangered Species Act protections for more than three decades, but voluntary state plans have caused the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to avoid a listing, most recently in 2015. 
Wyoming holds the biggest and best tracts of sage grouse habitat remaining in the world, and it possesses about 38% of the remaining birds. The 2025 lek counts surged by double-digit percentage points in almost the entire state. 
Uniquely struggling
Northeast Wyoming, where counts fell by 10%, was the lone exception. While the House Draw Fire was a factor, the outlier datapoint could also be related to the natural cycle duration, which tends to run shorter in the region, Whitford said. 
(Wyoming Game and Fish Deparment)
The number of northeast Wyoming males observed per active lek, 13, was also less than half the statewide average. Population performance in the area has consistently been the worst in Wyoming.
“Northeast Wyoming has always been at the edge of sage grouse range,” Whitford said. “The habitat is just not like the rest of the state. It tends to run a little drier and tends to convert to grassland very easily.” 
Wyoming’s conservation plan for its northeastern sage grouse, last updated in 2014, details a long-term decline of the habitat and species. The “patch size” of sagebrush cover in the Powder River Basin decreased by more than 63% in a 40-year period, according to the report, falling from 820 acres to fewer than 300. Overall, sagebrush cover in the watershed also declined 6% as a portion of the landscape, from 41% to 35%. 
Leks are being abandoned as the habitat has degraded and disappeared, long-term data show. 
Out of 606 documented leks in the northeast region, only 178 — some 29% — were active during the 2024 breeding season, according to Wyoming’s latest statewide sage grouse report. 
“Average male lek attendance in northeast Wyoming has decreased significantly over time, decreasing by more than half over the last 30 years,” wrote Game and Fish Wildlife Biologist Erika Peckham, who authored the section of the report.

Northeastern Wyoming’s 2024 wildfires, especially the House Draw Fire, are all but guaranteed to exacerbate the declines. Although surveyors detected male sage grouse at 40% of the leks in the House Draw Fire scar during the 2025 lek counts, the large interior leks near where all the sagebrush burned up are likely to disappear completely. 
“Females nest almost exclusively in sagebrush — 99% of the time,” said Kirol, the Sheridan-based sage grouse biologist. “So if the females aren’t showing up anymore … there’s going to be no [population] recruitment to those leks.”

Male grouse might continue to display on their lekking grounds for the rest of their lives, he said, and that might span another five years. But after that, they’ll die out. 
“I expect a lot of the leks in the interior will blink out,” Kirol said. “I hope they don’t, but that’s what has been shown in the past.” 
The smaller a sage grouse population becomes, the more susceptible it is to extirpation. That’s what recently occurred in North Dakota, where biologists counted zero strutting males for the first time in 2025. 
Kirol has serious concerns for the future of northeast Wyoming’s sage grouse. The population, he said, has been in a steady, gradual decline for about two decades. 
“The problem with northeast Wyoming is the birds are just constantly losing habitat, and they’re never gaining anything,” Kirol said. “I’m hopeful that we’ll still have birds here in 50 years, but we’re going to get to a point where, if the numbers get too low, then any natural event might wipe them out.”

When ‘Wyoming’s Doctor’ said the Senate had every reason to take Kennedy at his word, columnist Kerry Drake asks, did we believe him?
The post Barrasso should clean up RFK’s health care disaster he helped create appeared first on WyoFile .","I didn’t really expect Wyoming’s senior U.S. Sen. John Barrasso to save America from Robert F. Kennedy Jr. During his short tenure as U.S. Health and Human Services secretary, Kennedy has recklessly played “whack-a-mole” with the heads of agencies we depend on to keep us alive.

Opinion

No, I always thought Barrasso would use his position as the No. 2 Senate Republican to do what’s best for himself, to keep in the good graces of President Donald Trump. Kennedy is an environmental attorney who has no credentials in medicine, science or administration, but Barrasso managed to usher him through the confirmation process. 
More than 75 Nobel laureates and tens of thousands of physicians urged the Senate to reject Kennedy — probably the most well-known anti-vaxxer in the country — because it would put the public’s health in jeopardy. The arguments used by Barrasso — who likes to be known as “Wyoming’s Doctor” — to prop up his nomination were not the least bit convincing. 
They also gave the senator no cover now that Kennedy’s opponents sense the Trump administration might not put up much of a fight to preserve the secretary’s job as bitter calls for his resignation mount.
It never made any sense to me that Kennedy skated through the confirmation process without needing even to pretend he was credible. But I suppose it helped to have prominent Republicans like Barrasso ushering him through.
“[Kennedy] told the Finance Committee, ‘I support the measles vaccine. I support the polio vaccine,’” Barrasso said the morning of the confirmation vote. “‘I will do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult or discourages people from taking either of those vaccines.’ The Senate has every reason to take him at his word.”
Just not those words. The irresponsible medical theories Kennedy has advanced over the years, before anyone imagined he could parlay a failed independent presidential bid into running HHS? Sure, there’s no reason to doubt he believes all of them.
Here’s a sample: Kennedy falsely links childhood vaccines and the rise of autism, and claims there’s a massive cover-up to hide it from the public. He opposes well-established public health tools like the fluoridation of drinking water, and claims without any credible evidence that antidepressants and mass shootings could be linked.
Kennedy rejects established science that H.I.V. causes AIDS. He’s suggested, again without evidence, that the coronavirus targeted and spared certain ethnic groups. In an August 2020 speech, Kennedy said he was open to the possibility that the COVID-19 pandemic was, in fact, a “plandemic” — an infectious disease outbreak orchestrated by government officials to subdue the populace.
Despite decades of Kennedy’s controversial, often flatly wrong statements on medicine and science, Barrasso said we should all just take his word on everything, and it’ll be fine. Barrasso apparently wasn’t worried that Trump was giving the keys for all U.S. health agencies to an unhinged man, or even about his own culpability as an elected federal official in Wyoming if everything Kennedy did went to hell. 


Which it certainly has. 
Barrasso didn’t criticize Kennedy when he fired Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez, who had been in the job for less than a month, even after three prominent CDC leaders resigned in protest. KFF Health News called it “a major offensive” designed to “seize control of the agency and impose an anti-vaccine, anti-science agenda.”
Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, a physician and chair of the Senate Health Committee, forced Barrasso’s hand when he quickly called for oversight of these “high-profile departures.” It was impossible for Barrasso to pretend nothing was amiss, so he cautiously carved out some time in the Senate Finance Committee to test the waters.
“Sec. Kennedy, in your confirmation hearings, you promised to uphold the highest standards for vaccines,” Barrasso said. “Since then, I’ve grown deeply concerned.”
Let’s be clear: the senator wasn’t exactly a profile in courage for pointing out that vaccines have saved an estimated 154 million lives worldwide over the past 50 years, or saying, “I support vaccines. I’m a doctor. Vaccines work.”
But I bet it was more than most of his Wyoming constituents thought he would do to finally put some distance between himself and an embattled RFK Jr.
If Kennedy does ultimately get the heave-ho, this is a good time for Equality State voters to tell Barrasso they expect him to do more for their access to affordable health care than just go back to babysitting Trump’s next HHS nominee. Kennedy will leave a massive mess to clean up.
Instead of strongly encouraging people to vaccinate their kids during a measles outbreak in Texas, Kennedy downplayed their significance and instead promoted fringe theories about prevention and treatments such as cod liver oil and vitamin A. Do any countries have an anti-health czar? Could we send him there?
How much damage has Kennedy done to vaccine research programs? In August, he announced HHS is terminating awards and contracts with pharmaceutical companies and universities and canceling 22 investment projects worth nearly $500 million. No new mRNA-based projects will be initiated.
“The data show these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu,” Kennedy said. But infectious disease experts said mRNA technology successfully prevents severe disease, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, so getting rid of it would potentially affect our preparedness for future pandemics.
In May, HHS canceled $700 million in funds pledged to pharmacology company Moderna to develop a vaccination for avian flu. The Washington Post said Kennedy was being “at best shortsighted and at worst catastrophic” by willfully rejecting a vaccine that has the potential to save millions of lives.
On my bingo card for the scariest Trump cabinet pick of ‘em all, RFK Jr. has always been front and center. And I had completely forgotten about the news that broke during Kennedy’s aborted presidential campaign last year that he said in a 2012 court deposition that a doctor believed his brain scan abnormality “was caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate a portion of it and then died.” (Thanks for the info, The New York Times! Good to know.)
My point is Barrasso didn’t have to let nature run its course with this most shameful nominee, but I don’t think he wanted Trump to blame him for not getting Kennedy confirmed.
If allegedly paying a minor for sex was enough to put the kibosh to the idea of Rep. Matt Goetz as our attorney general, I think a few well-chosen, closed-door reminders to senators from Barrasso about all the bat-shit crazy conspiracy theories Kennedy has warmly embraced would have spared America’s health care system this recent disaster.
Following Kennedy’s hearing, reporters asked Barrasso if he supports Kennedy. The senator said, “I support the president.”
What else could an honest politician and doctor say?

(Illustration by Onidji/Getty Images)More than 80% of the fines Louisiana collects from drivers come from when they have to reinstate their licenses for lapsed auto insurance coverage, according to a new analysis that suggests state lawmakers might want to reduce those penalties.
The same report from the Louisiana Legislative Auditor said state officials also might think about a higher reinstatement fee for first-time driving while intoxicated offenses.
Auditors evaluated all fees the state Office of Motor Vehicles charges to issue and reinstate licenses and compared them to information available from other states. Louisiana’s OMV is largely self-funded through these fees, which accounted for 92% of its $74.4 million budget in fiscal year 2024.

The cost to issue or renew a driver’s license in Louisiana is comparable to other states, but its maximum reinstatement fee for insurance cancellation is higher than all but one state auditors reviewed. Only Delaware, which has no cap on its insurance reinstatement fee, exceeded the ceiling of $525 in Louisiana, where the minimum fee is $150.
Insurance cancellation fees generated $103.8 million, or 83.2%, of the license reinstatement fees the OMV collected last fiscal year. By comparison, reinstatement fees for DWI offenses generated $354,100 in 2024 – or less than 0.3% of total fees.
“Reinstatement fees for insurance cancellation violations are more expensive than other violations,” the audit report said, “the amount owed increases the longer a lapse in insurance coverage continues, and one lapse in coverage can result in multiple violations.”
Do fees delay license reinstatements?
The auditor’s evaluation included all the reasons Louisiana can suspend or revoke a driver’s license, including for failure to pay child support, pay income taxes, appear in court or maintain vehicle insurance.
As of June 2024, 9.1% of the state’s 2.81 million personal driver’s licenses were suspended and/or revoked. Insurance cancellations were, by far, the top reason why those licenses had been pulled, accounting for nearly 80% of the total. 
Even if a driver fulfills every other obligation to have their license reinstated, it will remain suspended until the OMV fee is paid. 
“The secondary requirement of paying reinstatement fees can therefore become the primary obstacle that delays compliant drivers from regaining an active license,” the audit report said. 
Its research found that 58.1% of drivers’ licenses that were suspended or revoked as of June 2022 were still inactive two years later, meaning more than half of drivers could not resolve their violations. Also, 35.7% of those licenses expired during the two-year period and weren’t renewed by June 2024. 
Unlike other unpaid fees, the OMV sends unremitted insurance reinstatement fees to the state Office of Debt Recovery, a division of the Louisiana Department of Treasury, for collection. The auditor noted that while this is intended to encourage drivers to pay outstanding fees, it also increases the amount they owe to get their license back – and it’s an uncommon practice among the surveyed states.
The Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles had to refer all overdue cancellation fees to the Office of Debt Recovery until last year, when lawmakers voted to limit the practice to insurance reinstatement fees. 
To collect money owed to the state, the Office of Debt Recovery can take it from a driver’s tax refund, garnish their wages or place a levy on their bank account. In addition, the office adds a 15% processing charge to the balance the driver owes.
Drivers paid $11.6 million to the Office of Debt Recovery last fiscal year in addition to the insurance cancellation fees they owed. 
The Louisiana Legislature created a Reinstatement Relief Program for insurance cancellation fees in 2024 to allow drivers to have the amounts they owe lowered based on their income, financial obligations and other factors that limit their ability to pay. The audit suggests state lawmakers might consider expanding the program to cover all reinstatement fees, as well as extending the grace period for all insurance cancellation violations.
Similar programs in Georgia and Ohio waive fees or provide amnesty for drivers who are indigent or rely on public assistance, according to the audit report.

DWI fee comparisons
The auditor also found Louisiana’s first-offense DWI reinstatement fee of $100 is 46.5% lower than the $187 average of the other 28 states from which it was able to obtain comparable data. Louisiana increases its reinstatement rate to $200 for a second DWI and $300 for third and subsequent offenses. 
First DWI offenses accounted for 81.3% of the 2,853 DWI-related license suspensions last fiscal year in Louisiana. Had the state collected the $187 average for its reinstatement fee, the OMV could have potentially collected an additional $202,807, according to the auditor’s calculations.
“The increase could not only raise additional funds for OMV operations, but could also serve as an additional deterrent for committing DWI offenses,” the auditor wrote.
From the group of 28 states evaluated, 23 states charge more than Louisiana for a first-time DWI reinstatement. The range from $45 in Missouri to $680 in Minnesota, which are both flat rates for all DWI offenses.
Louisiana’s fee increases to $200 for a second DWI offense and $300 for third and subsequent occurrences.

More considerations
Another consideration for the legislature would be to revisit which offenses that require a driver’s license suspension, according to the audit report. It cited a 2021 report from the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators that concluded that while suspending licenses for dangerous driving is appropriate, taking the same action for otherwise safe drivers has a negative impact on communities through unemployment, lower wages, fewer hiring choices and higher insurance costs.
The National Council of State Legislatures reported last year that at least 25 states have approved largely bipartisan laws to curb or eliminate driver’s license suspensions and the loss of driving privileges for unpaid fines and fees, the report noted.
The legislative auditor also said the legislature might want to consider using certain economic factors such as inflation to set its OMV fees. Louisiana was one of three states out of 33 studied without a provision in state law that sets a timeline for updating the charges.
Two states base their fees on the Consumer Price Index, while California calls for annual updates, and North Carolina requires revisions every four years. In West Virginia, fees can be adjusted every five years as long as increases don’t exceed 10%. 
Louisiana hasn’t updated its license fees since 2014 when it last increased the insurance cancellation reinstatement fee.

According to the September General Fund Budget Monitor report, revenues through the first two months of fiscal year 2026 have come in $22.6 million, or 2.8%, below the revised forecast issued by the Idaho Division of Financial Management.

Idaho runs on a fiscal year calendar that begins July 1 and ends June 30. That means the 2026 fiscal year began July 1 and ends June 30. 
The revenue shortfall is occurring after the Republican-controlled Idaho Legislature and Gov. Brad Little cut state revenues by more than $450 million during the 2025 legislative session to pay for tax cuts and a new education tax credit that allows families to be reimbursed for education expenses including tuition at private, religious schools.
In response to revenue shortfalls, Little ordered all state agencies and departments other than public schools to cut spending by 3% by the end of the current fiscal year, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported.  
With Little’s 3% budget holdbacks now being calculated, Idaho is projected to end the current fiscal year in June with a $21.8 million budget surplus, according to September’s General Fund Budget Monitor. 
A month ago, before the impact of the 3% budget cuts was included in the calculations, Idaho was projected to end the current fiscal year with a $80 million budget deficit, which would violate the Idaho Constitution. 
 Idaho House minority leader says Idaho’s budget situation is serious

Idaho House Minority Leader Ilana Rubel, D-Boise, said Idaho’s budget situation is a “disaster” that will seriously harm Idaho families, people with disabilities and people living in poverty.

“My phone has been ringing off the hook with warnings coming in at full volume,” Rubel said Monday. “This is a catastrophe for people in the most need.”
Rubel said the Medicaid cuts and other budget holdbacks are hurting seniors living in long-term care facilities as well as children and adults with serious disabilities who rely on state funding to get the help they need to live and work. 
“This is not a disaster on the horizon; this is a disaster right now,” Rubel said. 
 Idaho Legislature’s budget committee co-chairman says it’s too early in the year to panic about state budget

On the other hand, Republicans who control a supermajority in the Idaho Legislature are saying it is not time to panic.
Sen. Scott Grow, R-Eagle, said Idaho’s budget is still in good shape thanks to conservative budgeting employed by the Idaho Legislature and Little. Grow serves as co-chairman of the Idaho Legislature’s powerful Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, which sets all the budgets for every state agency and department.
“The sky is not falling; this is not 2008, 2009 or 2010,” Grow told the Sun on Monday, referencing the Great Recession. “This is a wait and see. Two months do not a year make.”
Grow said the state issues budget forecasts based on best-available information from economists, state officials, legislators and other sources.

Grow said it is too early in the 2026 fiscal year to read too much into the budget situation. He said revenue collections later in the fiscal year, particularly in April and June, are much more important to the overall budget picture than July and August.
Grow also said he supports Little’s actions to cut spending by 3%.
“We support the governor. He’s being conservative and cautious, and we think that is a good decision on his part,” Grow said. 
“Hopefully the governor’s 3% (holdbacks) will do the job, and we will be in good shape and start looking at 2027 in January,” Grow added. The Legislature convenes in January.
Idaho Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff said Monday she remains confident in the health of Idaho’s economy and state budget.
“Idaho’s economy remains strong with positive job growth, low unemployment rates, and overall economic strength,” Wolff said in a written statement. “Idaho is only two months into our fiscal year and while general fund revenues are slightly below forecast, the overall picture remains positive.”
Despite overall revenue shortfalls, Wolff pointed out sales tax collections came in strong, ahead of last year.
“As the governor prepares to submit his executive budget later this year, these steady revenues provide confidence that Idaho can continue to fund key priorities like education, infrastructure, and public safety while keeping taxes low and regulations light,” Wolff said. “Idaho’s strong fiscal management, conservative budgeting, and pro-growth policies ensure the state remains on solid financial ground.”
Grow said Idaho legislators and Little built a projected ending cash balance into the budget to guard against uncertainty. 
Due to revenue shortfalls, that ending cash balance has decreased from an estimated $439.8 million down to an estimated $21.8 million, according to the September General Fund Budget Monitor report. 
 Cost of confirming to federal tax changes still unknown in Idaho

Even though the state’s projections now forecast a year-end surplus instead of an illegal budget deficit, there are still unresolved questions about the state of Idaho’s budget.
The state budget forecasts do not include the cost of conforming to federal tax changes included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed into law July 4. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The GOP megalaw includes numerous tax changes, including no tax on workers’ tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on a borrower’s car loan interest and an expanded deduction for seniors. Each of those tax changes would reduce revenue if adopted by the Idaho Legislature – a decision that won’t be made until after the Idaho Legislature’s 2026 legislative session begins in January.
One outside estimate provided by the nonprofit Tax Foundation indicated it could cost Idaho an additional $167 million to adopt individual tax changes from the GOP-supported megalaw. 
Grow, the Republican JFAC co-chair in Idaho, said it will be up to the Idaho Legislature whether to conform 100% to the tax changes from the megalaw
Meanwhile, Rep. John Gannon, D-Boise, said Idahoans deserve to know the cost of implementing the individual and business tax changes from the federal bill. Gannon cited Colorado Newsline reports showing the Colorado Legislature has called a special session to address shrinking revenue collections.
“It is absolutely essential that Idaho figure out the impact of all of these business tax changes because when you combine it with the lower revenues we are experiencing, it is a very serious problem,” Gannon said Monday afternoon.

Antonio Parkinson, a Memphis Democrat, has tried to put a positive spin on the city getting a deployment of National Guard troops. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee lawmakers representing Shelby County are running into a partisan split over the looming deployment of National Guard troops to Memphis.
Democrats are generally opposing the plan by Gov. Bill Lee and President Donald Trump to send soldiers into the city as part of a “comprehensive mission,” but even some of those legislators are taking different tones. 
Republicans, in contrast, are supporting the move, even though it is short on details.
Trump also announced Monday he will be send more federal agencies into Memphis to focus on crime. Gov. Bill Lee was meeting with him at the White House to work on details.
Sen. Paul Rose, a Covington Republican whose district takes in the northeast block of Shelby County, said Monday he favors the deployment, though he didn’t know how it would be carried out. 
Rose couldn’t address whether putting troops on city streets could desensitize residents to a military presence but said troops on the streets of Israel made him feel safer during a trip there.

He’s hoping it turns out similarly to the deployment of National Guard soldiers to Washington, D.C., where Trump said there is “virtually no crime,” according to news reports.
“I applaud the governor sending them in. For those that maybe don’t get shot or robbed or whatever, they’re going to certainly be thankful that intervention was there,” Rose said.
Rose had no indication of what troops would do in Memphis or how long they might be there, though he added that he would support their presence as long as it takes to quell gang activity in the city.
House Speaker Cameron Sexton said last week troops are needed as part of a “quick strike” force combining federal and state authorities to cut down on crime caused by some 100 gangs.
Washington, D.C. Police reported overall violent crime dipped to 75 incidents from Aug. 12-26 when troops were sent in, compared to 98 from July 28 to Aug, according to a BBC report. 11. Homicides decreased to two from six, robberies fell to 31 from 51 in that period, and assaults with a deadly weapon dropped to 37 from 41.
Conflict between the president and Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser, though, resurfaced again Monday when, after the temporary emergency measure ended, she said local police would no longer take up immigration enforcement.
Trump responded by saying he would declare an emergency and federalize the District of Columbia force again. That came after he said last week that troops would go to Shelby County.
Democratic state Rep. Jesse Chism, chairman of the Tennessee Black Caucus of State Legislators, said he is “very concerned” about the plan to send troops into Memphis.
“I believe we risk undermining the progress our police department is already making. Sending troops into Memphis now could rip the scab off of a wound that is just beginning to heal and only increases the possibility of unintended consequences,” Chism said.
Chism added that elected leaders in Memphis and Shelby County aren’t “happy” about the planned deployment, as Trump said in a social media post. 
Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris criticized the move while Memphis Mayor Paul Young was resigned to the situation.
Gov. Lee to work with Trump administration to deploy National Guard in Memphis

Democratic state Rep. Antonio Parkinson appeared to take a view similar to Young, saying Monday morning on CNN that the arrangement was made between Lee and Trump, without the input of local leaders. Yet he tried to put a positive spin on the matter.
“The thing you have to understand about Memphis is this … no matter what you throw at Memphis, Memphis will make the best of it,” Parkinson said in the interview. “Memphis is known for taking the most sour lemons you can give them and making the best tasting lemonade ever served. That is just who Memphis is.”
Parkinson encouraged Memphis residents to view troops’ presence as a chance to deal with longstanding problems instead of an “occupying force.”
Memphis lawmakers such as Democratic Sens. London Lamar and Raumesh Akbari expressed dismay that troops could be patrolling city streets, saying a police report showed a 15% crime decrease over the past year.
Republican Sen. Brent Taylor of Shelby County and Rep. John Gillespie of Memphis questioned the validity of the crime report and said it should be audited.
Last week, Lee said he wants to speed up the “positive momentum” of the FBI mission, Operation Viper, with other agencies that led to the arrest of hundreds of violent offenders. 
The governor reportedly canceled a Nashville Rotary Club appearance Monday to continue talks with the Trump administration about the Memphis deployment.

(Getty Images)Louisiana is likely to prioritize digitizing medical records and tuition forgiveness for rural health care practitioners in its application for a piece of the new $50 billion federal rural health care fund. 
The Trump administration formally kicked off the application process Monday for its Rural Health Transformation Program. Every state with an accepted proposal will receive at least $100 million per year from federal fiscal year 2026 through 2030. 

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator, currently Mehmet Oz, will have broad discretion to distribute more money — $25 billion over the program’s five-year run — to individual states of their choice. States must submit their plans for Oz’s review by Nov. 5 and are expected to hear about the amount of their awards by Dec. 31. 

Louisiana Department of Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein said he hopes to receive at least $200 million annually, for a total of $1 billion over five years. The state has worked on its application for weeks through meetings of a 60-member rural health task force set up to seek input about where the money should go. 
Public outreach meetings, which the health department is calling “idea raisers,” are also planned for the Monroe and Alexandria areas, Greenstein said in an interview Friday. State officials are also soliciting feedback about uses for the funding through an online form available on its new rural health transformation program website. 
At least some of the money will likely be used to standardize and upgrade medical record systems at Louisiana’s rural hospitals, which also provide primary care services in less populated areas. 

A digital records system that works across facilities would make operations more efficient, and improve the use of lab tests and x-rays, Greenstein said. It would allow for more analysis of health care services and conditions across rural communities, he added. 

The health department also wants to add rural rotations for medical students and create more financial incentives for health care professionals, such as nurses, doctors and dental hygienists, to practice in rural areas, according to Greenstein. 

This includes putting more money into efforts to allow health care practitioners to avoid or pay down student loan debt if they take jobs in rural areas.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

One option might be expanding Louisiana’s Health Care Employment Reinvestment Opportunity (HERO) program, which uses state and private funding for scholarships and student loan forgiveness for health care workers who work in underserved communities, Greenstein said. 
Other state efforts to help new graduates in medical fields pay back their loans if they work in rural areas would also likely get more support, Greenstein said. 

Jeff Reynolds, executive director of the Rural Hospital Association of Louisiana, said his organization’s priorities partially align with what Greenstein has mentioned. Digitizing records as well as recruiting rural health care practitioners are concerns. 

Rural hospitals would also like to see investments in telehealth, mobile health care clinics and transportation for rural patients to bring them to appointments, Reynolds said. 
Congress inserted the $50 billion rural health care fund into Trump’s “big beautiful bill” as a concession to U.S. senators who were troubled by dramatic Medicaid cuts also in the legislation. 

Rural health care providers rely heavily on Medicaid, which provides health insurance to people who are poor or disabled. 

While the $50 billion will offset incoming Medicaid cuts, experts have said it might not be enough to make up for the financial losses rural hospitals expect to see when the program is downsized.

The criteria for drawing down the $50 billion fund is also vague and leaves Oz a lot of latitude over who will get the extra funding. 
That could work to Louisiana’s advantage because the state is run by a Republican governor, Jeff Landry, who is aligned with Trump. Greenstein also worked for Trump at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services during the president’s previous term. 

About a third of Louisiana’s population lives in rural areas and, compared with their urban peers, suffer with more health maladies. They have higher rates of heart disease, obesity and diabetes, plus they are more likely to smoke cigarettes, according to the state health department.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/MedicalPhoto.jpeg,,,2025-09-16 06:56:11.600137

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Department of Public Instruction has released the first of a series of updated textbooks on the five Native nations that share land with North Dakota.
The book — titled “Journey to Understanding” — provides a brief introduction to the tribes’ history and culture. It’s the first time a new edition of the work has been released in more than two decades.
The textbook will soon be distributed to schools across the state, though a digital version is already available to download for free on the University of North Dakota’s Scholarly Commons website.
“Journey to Understanding” was first published in 2002 as cultural training material for social workers at the North Dakota Department of Human Services. The agency hired the Bismarck-based Native American Training Institute to write it to help its employees better understand the state’s Native communities.
Now, the Department of Public Instruction is promoting it as an educational resource for K-12 classrooms. 
The agency will also soon release updated versions of four tribe-specific textbooks on the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation, Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and Spirit Lake Nation. Like “Journey to Understanding,” new editions of the books haven’t been published in more than 20 years.
The five books have long been considered leading sources for information on the tribes, and are referenced in K-12, college and professional settings, according to the Department of Public Instruction.
A first-ever textbook on the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate is also in the works.
The series is a collaborative effort between the state, the tribes, Native culture organizations and higher education institutions. The tribes and tribal colleges had full editorial oversight of the books’ content.
In addition to publishing all six books online, thousands of copies will be printed and distributed to schools across North Dakota.

“Journey to Understanding” is an ideal resource for anyone looking for a primer on the tribes, said Cheryl Ann Kary, executive director of Sacred Pipe Resource Center and the textbook’s author.
It covers topics including tribes’ status as sovereign nations, treaties and federal policies like the General Allotment Act, which reduced Native land ownership by distributing collectively owned tribal land to individual Native citizens. 
The book also details some of the spiritual beliefs, values and traditions common to many tribes.
Kary, a citizen of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, said many North Dakotans could benefit from resources like “Journey to Understanding”. Many state leaders try to tackle complicated issues involving the tribes despite lacking basic knowledge about their communities, she noted. Kary compared this to trying to read poetry without first learning the alphabet.
“There’s so much just fundamental, foundational knowledge you have to know first before you can even talk about these complex issues,” she said.
While most of the content in the first and second edition of “Journey to Understanding” is the same, the latter version includes some new content as well. For example, it includes more information on the federal Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, a federal law that protects tribes’ right to keep Native children in their communities, Kary said.
It also includes information on the North Dakota Native American Essential Understandings project, a collection of resources developed by tribal elders and educators to help K-12 North Dakotans learn about Native traditions.

The Department of Public Instruction expects to release the other five books in the series over the next several months.
It’s partnering with United Tribes Technical College and Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate Publishing to print the textbooks. Each K-12 school across the state will receive free copies of the books, with middle and high schools getting at least 25 sets of the series. Eventually, members of the public will be able to purchase their own copies.

Sashay Schettler, the Department of Public Instruction’s assistant director of Indian and multicultural education, said making the books available both online and in print will make it easier than ever for young North Dakotans to learn about the tribes.
“Honestly, it makes my heart happy,” Schettler, a citizen of the MHA Nation, said.
She noted the books can be a resource that helps schools comply with a state law adopted in 2021 requiring K-12 schools in North Dakota to teach Native American history.
The textbooks are the culmination of several decades of work by hundreds of people, according to a reflection on the revision process by state employees included at the end of “Journey to Understanding”.
The first editions of the books on the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, the MHA Nation, Spirit Lake Nation and Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa were spearheaded by Cheryl Kulas, former director of Native education at the Department of Public Instruction and an Oglala tribal citizen.
The agency hopes to facilitate revisions of the books every few years going forward, staff indicate in the reflection.

(Photo by Liz Cartwright)Refugees, workers and others who have come to Idaho from other countries are at increased risk of detention and deportation, even if they came to the U.S. through legal means of entry. 
ICE raids and the too frequent reports of individuals being deported signals a dangerous situation for many individuals living in the U.S. These individuals have come to the U.S. through legal immigration programs that may now be expired, or they may have arrived here without authorization. Sometimes they arrived as young children.  
This approach to immigration control is fueled by 1) federal quota mandates for immigration arrests, 2) depriving refugees of their protected rights and 3) by a rapidly expanding system of detention that involves all of us, even down to the county levels in places like Idaho and Wyoming. 
Federal judge blocks Noem from ending temporary protections for Venezuelans, Haitians

The U.S. is increasingly taking away Temporary Protected Status (TPS). If refugees lose their Temporary Protected Status they lose their work permits, medical care, and their right to be in the U.S. Many of these individuals are waiting for immigration hearings, and they are trying to do the right thing. 
As of July 2025, the backlog of immigration hearings is approximately 3.4 million cases. Once the individual cannot legally work, they are vulnerable to being arrested if they continue working. Without income and without the ability to return to their home countries, they are trapped in a perilous situation. 
Other refugees (from dangerous situations and from economic hardship) have been living and working in the U.S. without legal status for months or years; employers conveniently look the other way in some industries, like dairy, that have difficult to fill labor needs. Students and other types of visa holders are in similar situations; overstaying of student visas is very common.  
There are incentives now, put in place by an increasingly aggressive federal administration, to arrest these individuals and to deport them.
Along with strong federal mandates to fill the rapidly expanding state and federal ICE detention facilities, the pool of vulnerable individuals is concomitantly increasing. Millions of people are at risk of being deported back to many countries.
Individuals who are taken into custody by ICE are shuffled through multiple detention centers across the U.S. before being released and deported to their countries of origin or sent to third country detention centers. 
Small prisons and jails in the rural West have established agreements with ICE to house these detainees as they await their fates. Local jails in our communities are being used to house detainees; these jails are often in remote, rural areas of the Western U.S. 
These jails, like the one mentioned in the recent WyoFile article about the Natrona County jail in Casper, Wyoming, where Cuban immigrants were housed, lack sufficient space and psychological care services. Detainees who are being constantly moved between facilities are at high risk for depression and suicide.
Idaho State Police partners with ICE to deport inmates without authorization to be in U.S.

This is the Jail Enforcement Model, a contract which allows local jurisdictions to house detainees in some of the beds in their jails. Idaho has one jail, in Coeur d’Alene, listed that have 287 (g) contracts with ICE. Jails in Mountain Home and Rigby also house immigration detainees. 
Sheriff’s offices in Bingham, Bonneville, Gooding, Kootenai, Owyhee and Power counties have Warrant Officer contracts with ICE. The Idaho State Police, through Jerome County, has a Task Force Model contract with ICE. 
These agreements fund this work. They expand ICE’s surveillance and detention activities through involving local prison facilities and law enforcement personal in arresting and detaining individuals on immigration charges as part of their routine job descriptions. 
Idaho, like its neighboring state of Wyoming, is involved in the movement of individuals between incarceration facilities. Individuals are arrested in one state and quickly moved to a second or third prison. They are moved from large prisons to small prisons across the U.S. Detainees lose contact with their families, they are stressed, and they are in a dangerous situation. This is an inhumane way to treat individuals who have come to this country as refugees. 
Data on these immigration detainees show that 70% of them have no criminal records. These are not “the worst of the worst.” These are individuals who are struggling to survive in the U.S. after they have endured immense expense, danger and personal trauma to get away from their countries of origin. Many of these individuals have lived for years in the U.S., and many are married with children who are U.S. citizens. 
Each situation has a unique constellation of threats that have made people desperate to leave their homes; it is always an agonizing choice. Returning can be incredibly dangerous, like the warzone Ukrainians fled, or it can be an economically decimated, hollowed out country, like Cuba, or it can be both dangerous and economically destroyed like Haiti, Venezuela and Afghanistan.  
The implementation of our nation’s immigration laws is being used to create a climate of fear for many immigrants, refugees, asylum seekers and their families and friends. All these individuals deserve to be treated with respect and given access to safety and due process during these difficult times. This process is increasingly militarizing the U.S., with implications for all of us.

Alex Wilson/Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia)After funding doubts, the state’s Family Treatment Courts received a $1 million grant to continue over the next year. But long-term funding is still in question as the courts will need a financial investment from lawmakers in the successful judicial program.
West Virginia’s 14 specialized Family Treatment Courts support parents in overcoming substance use disorders while working toward safe reunification of their children. They operate in 19 counties and have graduated 309 participants so far, with 437 children reunified with their families.
The state’s Supreme Court of Appeals announced Sept. 11 that it was awarded up to $1,162,038 through the Public Defender Services’ Impacting Child Abuse and Neglect grant program to operate the Family Treatment Courts. The grant funds are sourced through federal participation under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, which supports legal services in child welfare cases.
Chief Justice William R. “Bill” Wooton
“I want to thank the Public Defender Services, including Executive Director Dana Eddy, for their willingness to step up and provide funding for our Family Treatment Courts for the coming year,” said Chief Justice William R. “Bill” Wooton. “These funds will ensure our Family Treatment Courts’ mission of providing safe home environments to our state’s most vulnerable children continues without interruption.
The voluntary Family Treatment Court Program offers 24/7 intensive case management, parenting services, housing referral assistance and more for a period of typically nine months with continued support.
In the past, these courts had been funded through federal grants and opioid lawsuit settlement funds administered by the West Virginia Office of Drug Control Policy.
The Supreme Court included additional funding for the treatment courts as part of its Fiscal Year 2026 budget request, but lawmakers did not allocate budget increases to the judicial branch for the current fiscal year.
In August, the Supreme Court announced it had secured $280,000 in State Opioid Response grant funding for the courts that could support the program through Sept. 30.
While the recent $1 million grant will support the court for the next year, a Supreme Court news release said the courts system “will continue to pursue more sustainable funding options for the program, including seeking funding for Family Treatment Courts in next year’s budget request from the Legislature.”
Justice C. Haley Bunn
“We are committed to working with lawmakers as they craft next year’s budget bill to include funding for Family Treatment Courts,” said Justice C. Haley Bunn, who will serve as chief justice during 2026. “As we share more about the positive outcomes from this program, our hope is that lawmakers understand the need to provide stable funding for it. We remain committed to working with legislators in the upcoming session to support this critical program.”
Family Treatment Courts each cost around $85,000-$100,000 per year to operate.
Lawmakers allocated $900,000 for the programs in their FY 2026 budget. 
Former U.S. Attorney for Southern West Virginia Will Thompson started the first Family Treatment Court in Boone County when he was a circuit judge. The program is one of the most efficient programs in government, he said, by helping people more quickly resolve child welfare cases that have overwhelmed the state’s foster system and courts. 
Judges volunteer to preside over Family Treatment Courts, so most of the money is used to pay a coordinator position, Thompson said. 
“The costs are incredibly low compared to the goods they deliver,” he said. 
The Family Treatment Court often moves child welfare cases along faster, leading to quicker permanency for children in the foster care system. A child in the program spends 10.8 months in foster care compared to the state’s average of 18.8 months.
Justice Thomas H. Ewing
According to the state Supreme Court of Appeals, West Virginia has saved $7 million in foster care or kinship subsidy payments through Family Treatment Courts.
“You have people who suffer from an addiction and happen to parents, they’re not trying to beat the system, they’re trying to get their kids back.” Thompson said. 
“When you see families reunited. It’s just an incredible feeling. And it’s not just for the parents … It’s the fact that you see that the kids are able to get their moms and dads back,” he added.
Justice Tom Ewing, who presided over the Fayette County Family Treatment Court program, said he said first hand who the program changes lives.
“We need to provide certainty and stability for our Family Treatment Court participants and employees,” he said. It is a worthwhile investment for our state and I hope we can find the long-term resources that will help these courts succeed to their full potential.”

(Photo: Karen Pulfer Focht for Tennessee Lookout)This is not about crime. This is about control.
The proposed deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis is not a response to public safety. It’s a political stunt engineered by a twice-impeached, multi-indicted president exploiting Black suffering and white fear to reclaim political relevance. 
It’s a charade rooted in fearmongering, cloaked in the rhetoric of “law and order,” but animated by the same authoritarian impulse that called troops to Lafayette Square in Washington, DC and cages to the border for immigrants. And Memphis, yet again, finds itself on the night shift of American injustice.
Let’s be clear: according to reports from the Memphis Police Department, violent crime in Memphis is at a 25-year low. That should be headline news. Instead, we’re being sold a spectacle — military trucks rumbling through Black neighborhoods, uniforms in place of understanding and surveillance in place of safety.
This isn’t public protection. It’s political theater.
Manufactured misfortune and misleading metrics
This deployment is not isolated. It’s part of a broader pattern where President Donald Trump and his allies target majority-Black cities, especially those with Black or Democratic mayors, as staging grounds for his white nationalist theatrics. He’s not sending the National Guard to predominantly white towns with drug epidemics or mass shootings. He’s not showing up where far right groups like Proud Boys and Oath Keepers are organizing. No! He’s only sending troops into the heart of Southern Black communities, where governors like Tennessee’s Bill Lee are all too eager to oblige.
This is a makeshift Confederate army, operating under the guise of public safety, weaponized against the very people it claims to protect.
And when the statistics show that crime was already decreasing before the National Guard landed, Trump will no doubt claim victory for what he didn’t cause. He will take credit for what was already happening. And many will believe him, because authoritarianism always rewrites the facts before it rewrites the laws.
Beware the blowback
Some Memphians, even some Black ones, are applauding the National Guard’s presence. I understand the fatigue. I understand the trauma. But I caution us not to confuse fatigue with clarity, or trauma with truth.
When Latino voters supported Trump in 2024, many assumed his deportation policies would only target “others” — those without papers, those from different countries. But immigration crackdowns don’t ask for green cards before the cuffs come out. Similarly, when some white voters supported anti-DEI policies thinking only Black communities would be impacted, they learned quickly that cruelty rarely stops at the color line.
West Tenn. town approves CoreCivic to run immigration detention facility after chaotic meeting

Memphians who think this military presence will only criminalize “the worst of us” need only look at the ICE detention center in nearby Mason, built on a former prison site and now holding undocumented immigrants caught in the dragnet of “tough on crime” posturing. According to NBC News, 40% of the 2,300 people arrested by the National Guard in D.C. were undocumented immigrants. This isn’t speculation—it’s precedent.
Hypocrisy in high places
What’s most galling is the hypocrisy of state lawmakers cheering this intervention. The same officials who’ve refused federal aid for healthcare, blocked Medicaid expansion, and lamented “Big Brother” when it suited their politics are now welcoming federal boots on our blocks. They’ve done nothing to stem the flood of guns in Tennessee, passed no meaningful policy to support youth or mental health services, but now demand military muscle as a cure-all?
This is intellectually dishonest at best and unserious at worst.
And those of us who dare to call it out are accused of being anti-police or unpatriotic. But I love Memphis enough to tell it the truth: You cannot incarcerate your way to safety. You cannot militarize your way to peace. You cannot criminalize your children and expect your community to thrive.
We’ve been here before
In my sermon this past Sunday, I reminded my congregation that some of the most liberating work has always been done during the night shift. My mother — Claudia Mae Fisher — worked the literal night shift for decades on a bridge in Michigan. And in the spiritual and political sense, we are on the night shift right now. Just like Jesus encountering the man born blind in John 9, we are being asked who is to blame. But I contend the better question is: What is God trying to reveal through this misfortune?
As I said in that sermon, we are not called to applaud political stunts or submit to scare tactics. We are called to do the work of liberation—day or night, with or without military presence.
We are not blind. We see what’s happening.
A call to action
Now is the time to demand clarity and accountability from our mayors, our state legislators, our governor, and those in the White House. We must push back against political spectacle with principled resistance. The presence of the National Guard is not protection. It’s provocation. It is an occupation of our streets and a betrayal of our dignity.
We deserve policies, not performances.
We demand investments, not intimidation.
We are not pawns in a political war. We are people, and we deserve to be treated as such.
Let this be our charge on the night shift: to shine light, speak truth, and refuse to be silent in the face of spectacle.

Patrick Morrisey speaks at a news conference Sept. 8, 2025, announcing the state received 2,500 donated signs reading “In God We Trust” for schools. (Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)Last week, Gov. Patrick Morrisey held a news conference to show off some religious posters donated by a cell phone provider to place into West Virginia classrooms.
During this year’s legislative session, a law was passed that requires all public schools — including public charter schools — public colleges and universities to display a “durable poster or framed copy of the United States motto, ‘In God We Trust.’”
These posters were donated by Patriot Mobile, which describes itself as “America’s only Christian conservative wireless provider.” If you, like me, wonder what that even means, according to an email I received, a portion of the company’s proceeds “goes to organizations fighting for First Amendment rights, Second Amendment rights, the sanctity of life, and supporting military veterans and first responders.”
Quenton King wrote a commentary about how this is letting right-wing organizations into our public schools, and how the company has taken over multiple school boards in Texas.
Yes, “In God We Trust” is the United States’ motto, but lawmakers are pushing this because of the mention of God.
Sen. Mike Azinger, R-Wood, who sponsored the bill for three years until its passage, said he wanted “to give honor to God for this bill. … If America stays with that motto in our hearts and West Virginia stays with that motto in our hearts, we’ll be OK.”
Republicans are using this law as an excuse to blur the line between church and state. But not for all churches, just the Christian church. 
Why is the state trying to force one religion on everyone? After all, about 31% of West Virginians are religiously unaffiliated, and 3% identify as Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, Hindu or other world religions. 
Republicans often say that things started to go downhill in the U.S. when “we took God out of schools,” They are referring to a 1962 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that found school-sponsored prayer violated the First Amendment Establishment Clause, which says the government cannot establish a religion or favor one religion over another. But as anyone who has taken a final exam or watched a Friday night football game can attest, prayers are often said in our public schools.
And let’s not forget that back in the 19th century when prayer was a regular part of the school day, it led to fighting between Protestant and Catholics over which prayers should be said and which version of the Bible to use. 
When Morrisey signed Senate Bill 280 into law, he said, “We have to ensure that we’re teaching kids about the founding principals of our country — a true and accurate retailing of civics and American life and history.”
In history class, students will learn that “In God We Trust” was not the motto of our founding fathers. It only became the U.S. motto in 1956, replacing E pluribus unum — “Out of many, one” — which was proposed as the country’s motto in 1776, and adopted in 1782. 
President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s administration pushed for the motto change during the Cold War era to further differentiate the United States from the Soviet Union and other communist countries. Evangelist Billy Graham had a lot of influence on his administration at the time.
If parents want their children to learn about religion, there are tons of churches all over the state that they can take them to for services or youth groups.
And if parents want their child to be educated on God every day, then they can homeschool them or send them to a Christian or Catholic school. Isn’t that one of the purposes of the $5,267.38 per-year Hope Scholarship? 
“In God We Trust” signs will do nothing to feed the hungry children in West Virginia, improve low math and reading proficiency or give underpaid teachers a raise. It only feeds the ego of Republicans who want voters to think they’re good Christians without doing the real work of helping the poor and feeding the hungry.

carrying off my shoulders."" (Courtesy photo)I don’t remember a time when police weren’t a presence in my life. One of my earliest memories is sitting in a stroller at Shawnee Park watching folks from the neighborhood play basketball when we heard gunshots. 

The deadline to apply for Jefferson County District Court’s next amnesty docket is Friday, Sept. 19.
Amnesty court, which began in Louisville in 2022, allows individuals who have active bench warrants for low-level offenses to resolve their cases without fear of arrest.
Applicants should  use this form. 
The amnesty docket will be heard Oct. 10, 11 and 13 in District Courtroom 204 at the Louis D. Brandeis Hall of Justice at 600 West Jefferson Street in Louisville.

My momma ran to push me out of the area, and I watched as LMPD rolled up with guns drawn, grabbing anyone they saw. It didn’t look like they were looking for anyone, just tackling the bodies they connected with and taking them down. It was chaotic and scary.
Two of my siblings lost their lives, one to gun violence and the other to the opioid epidemic. The police were around for those life events, too. 
Police stopped me just for walking in the Highlands as a teenager. And there were always police in my school — my entire experience in Jefferson County Public Schools prepared me for getting locked up at Sixth Street. The two institutions, jail and school, to me, mirrored each other. 
It felt certain that I would end up on the run from the law, with warrants following me everywhere I went. I found myself living out of my car, sometimes staying with a friend, and occasionally having the cash to pay for an extended stay hotel. I worked odd jobs, cutting hair and rapping for tips at open mics and talent shows. 
Then, in 2023, I got connected with some community advocates from ChooseWell, and they told me about amnesty court. They didn’t just tell me about it; they made sure I showed up. They sent me reminders and made sure I had transportation. And I was scared to go, but I trusted these advocates and knew they wanted what was best for me. 
When I walked out of court after getting my case redocketed and putting a plan in place to pay the fines I still owed, I felt amazing. It took weight I didn’t even realize I’d been carrying off my shoulders, and it allowed me to be honest and accountable for the other things I needed to do to get my life on the best track for me. 
I didn’t go to amnesty court because I trusted the system — the system is too broken and it’s let me down too many times. I went because I trusted the people who wanted to get me there, who could see what I see now: a future where I never have to worry about court, or jail, again.

(Photo by Julia Tilton/  The Daily Yonder)On a sunny, 85-degree day in August, some 9,300 oysters were loaded into ice-filled containers on southern Maine’s Casco Bay. The boat shuttling them from the warm, shallow waters of Recompense Cove to the marina two miles away hummed quietly. Notably missing: the roar of an engine and the smell of diesel.
Heron, the boat in question, is a 28-foot aluminum vessel that runs on two 100% electric outboards, the motors that hang off of small and medium-sized boats. It’s one of the first commercial workboats in the United States to use electric outboards. The vessel officially splashed into the waters of South Freeport, Maine on July 17, 2025. The moment, though, had been years in the making. It required a coalition of industry-wide partners, a $500,000 U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) grant, and at least that much in matching funds from the operating businesses’ cost share agreement and philanthropic investments through the Rockland, Maine-based Island Institute, the Maine Technology Institute, and others. Altogether, the $1 million private-public investment covers Heron’s $425,000 sticker price and the costs to install two high-capacity shoreside chargers. A portion of these funds also supports data collection and research to assess the viability of electric technology in the greater aquaculture industry.
Willy Leathers is the director of farm operations and owner of Maine Ocean Farms, the mid-size aquaculture business that operates this particular boat. The 10-acre plot he and farm co-founder Eric Oransky tend to on Recompense Cove holds about 3 million oysters. The two farmers are among a growing group of small business owners on the cutting edge of marine innovation along rural and remote parts of Maine’s coast. They’ve been in operation together just shy of a decade, and have seen the aquaculture industry spring up around them in the coves and small islands that make up Casco Bay. Beyond the bay is the wide-open Gulf of Maine, which has been documented as one of the world’s fastest-warming bodies of water. Between 2004-2016, it warmed more quickly than 99% of the global ocean, a trend scientists attribute to climate change caused by humans burning fossil fuels. 
For Leathers and Oransky, there’s a connection between electrifying operations and transitioning away from the fossil fuels that have impacted their home waters. But beyond reducing environmental impact, the farmers say there’s another motivator: being a good neighbor. One feature of replacing traditional gas and diesel-powered outboards is that the electric versions are quieter.
“Our boats are our workplaces,” said Leathers. “We’re out there for eight hours a day, five days a week, so reducing noise and reducing on-site emissions is a goal of not only improving the workplace but also improving our potential impact on the environment around us, whether in an ecological sense or a community sense.”
Staying in the community’s good graces is essential for a business that operates year-round in close quarters with at least a dozen other farms, as well as traditional fisheries and shorefront landowners. 
By the winter, Leathers and his crew expect to load between 10,000 and 15,000 oysters onto Heron each day they harvest. When the temperatures drop, they’ll no longer need containers filled with ice to keep the oysters cool. What the farmers don’t know is how the technology in their new battery-powered boat will fare in these cold, salty conditions. Part of their mission, and the DOE grant agreement, is to find out.
“There’s a great proving ground here, of saying if this technology is going to develop, this is a place where it’s going to be put through its paces,” Leathers said.

A tractor for the sea
A few miles down the coast, Chad Strater cruised up the Cousins River in Yarmouth, Maine on his 26-foot, all-electric workboat. He was headed to the Sea Meadow Marine Foundation, a nonprofit waterfront facility he co-owns and is actively transforming into what he calls an “aquaculture innovation hub.” 
Since its launch last fall, Strater has used his electric boat almost daily for the marine construction work he does with his own business, the Boat Yard, and with partner Shred Electric, a startup that replaces gas generators with batteries to power sea farm equipment. Both the Boat Yard and Shred Electric share space at the Sea Meadow Marine Foundation’s Yarmouth facility. Strater’s boat has one battery-powered outboard that can haul equipment to sea farms and other marine businesses within a 15 mile radius on Casco Bay. Nick Planson, Shred Electric’s CEO and Strater’s business partner, said the two were impressed by the boat’s performance during the winter.
The switch to an electric outboard was born of necessity, Strater said. When using a gas-powered boat, he’d lose fuel from idling and maneuvering the boat around work sites. Now, Strater’s success with the electric boat doubles as a model for others in the marine industry, like sea farmers, who are curious about making a switch. 
“You need the right tools to do the job,” said Strater. “You can’t be out there farming potatoes in a tractor from 1982 and expect to be efficient. So developing tools that make sense for efficiency, for Maine sea farmers, is what we’re doing.”

In this early stage of marine electrification, aquaculture operations, or sea farms, are a logical use case, said Lia Morris, the senior community development officer at the Island Institute’s Center for Marine Economy. That’s because farmers have known variables like range, location, capacity, and schedule that tend not to change. Morris is working with Willy Leathers and Maine Ocean Farms on data collection and analysis as they compare their new boat, Heron, to a control: their existing gas-powered workboat. 
“It’s almost like writing the case studies,” said Morris. “It’s putting the qualitative and quantitative data on paper and presenting the solution so that people can see how they can replicate it. That’s part of our long game in terms of outboards and commercial adoption.”
Still, there are significant hurdles when it comes to scaling up electrification in Maine’s aquaculture industry. Up front, electric boats are anywhere from 20% to 30% more expensive than gas-powered ones. Once they’re in the water, charging is difficult because Maine’s sea farms are spread across a vast and mostly rural area that is largely unequipped with the charging infrastructure this transition will require.  
“It’s the chicken and the egg problem,” Leathers said. “What comes first? You put a charger in and there’s nobody to use it, or you have a bunch of boats waiting to charge, but then nobody wants to invest in the boats because there’s nowhere to charge them.”

Uncharted waters
Like Leathers’ boat Heron, Strater’s boat was funded in part by federal and philanthropic support, including grants from some of the same institutional partners like Island Institute and Maine Technology Institute. About half of the boat’s cost, which comes in around $100,000, was financed with private investment and loans from the Coastal Enterprise Institute, a community development financial institution that helps Maine’s small businesses access lending. 
Strater said the boat’s relatively low cost, about a fourth of the price tag on a boat like Leathers’ Heron, is an important part of the pilot model, since many small business owners can’t foot a several hundred thousand dollar investment up front. He and Planson have worked with the Coastal Enterprise Institute on a marine green loan program to set up additional financing options apart from federal and philanthropic grant structures. It’s part of Planson’s philosophy to “de-risk” electrification for farmers who want to try the new technology without financial strain.
“We’re working towards having all of these solutions be affordable without grant funding,” said Planson. 
For now, that’s an uphill climb. In Maine, it comes at a time when marine businesses are already struggling to overcome rising costs associated with working on a rapidly developing coastline.
In the early 2000s, nonprofit and government entities in Maine identified a growing risk to the state’s “working waterfront,” a term used to describe the network of access points that marine industries, including the state’s $3.2 billion seafood sector, depend on to make a living. A 2006 report commissioned by the Island Institute found that of Maine’s 3,500 miles of coastline, only 20 miles were dedicated working waterfront space. 
The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Association listed climate change, sea level rise, and real estate development as ongoing threats to Maine’s working waterfront in a 2020 report. Of the state’s remaining 20 miles of working waterfront, NOAA wrote that just eight miles are dedicated for public use. The remaining 12 miles are privately owned and thus vulnerable to residential or commercial development. 
Rebecca Rundquist is a board member of the Sea Meadow Marine Foundation, the nonprofit organization focused on protecting Maine’s working waterfront whose marina provides space for Strater and Planson’s electric boat. She said that development along the coast, and in a small town like Yarmouth, affects local food sources and the economy. She sees innovation as a way to “revitalize” communities and generate excitement around the working waterfront at a hyper-local scale.
“Our message is we don’t have a one-size-fits-all. We’re here to show how you work with your community to identify the most important needs with these parcels,” said Runquist.
In Yarmouth, the need revolves around aquaculture and electrification. Both Strater’s boat and Heron, the electric vessel operated by Maine Ocean Farms, will soon have access to a higher capacity level two charging station at the Sea Meadow Marine Foundation along the Cousins River. Once it’s installed, the boats will be able to get a full charge in a matter of hours as opposed to the overnight shift they plug in for now. The funding for the station comes from the Island Institute and the DOE grant that helped build Heron. 
While it’s a start, those involved on Casco Bay recognize there’s more progress to be made on charging infrastructure, particularly as businesses up the rural parts of the coast go electric. Island Institute is preparing to release a Shoreline Charging Infrastructure report later this year detailing specific challenges around grid readiness for marine electrification in Maine.
“It will be a public resource that people can read and digest and ask questions,” Morris said. “Our goal and hope is really to elevate the conversation around electrification and electric propulsion.”

Finding a charge
For now, Strater keeps things simple. At the end of his workday, he docked the boat along the Cousins River and headed toward a Ford charger, the same one he uses to charge his all-electric Ford Lightning truck when it’s parked at the marina. The low-capacity level two charger is mounted on a wooden post a few yards from the shore. Strater grabbed a thick charging cable to run back down toward the water, and  a light blinked green on the charger as he plugged the cable into the all-electric outboard, hovering several feet out of the water. The boat would sit there, slowly charging, for the next eight hours. 
Usually, the down time isn’t a problem for Strater, who puts in eight-hour workdays on the boat and then leaves it overnight to charge. In the instance he does need a quick fill, he can tow the boat over land with his Ford Lightning to a Tesla fast charger off the nearby interstate.
At the front edge of innovation, it’s this kind of creativity that makes Morris excited about the future of electric boat adoption in the region. “Mainers are scrappy and, you know – rural context – people figure out how to make things work,” Morris said.

Incumbent and Republican nominee Jason Miyares has also worked to address fentanyl’s impact in Virginia during his tenure. 
If elected, Jones plans to create a Drug Trafficking Unit within the attorney general’s office to enhance information-sharing, coordination and investigative support for local law enforcement and commonwealth’s attorney’s offices.
Virginia attorney general race questionnaire: Jay Jones

“We know that there are ways to use the justice system to hold people accountable, but we also know that we can’t lock ourselves up to get out of this problem,” Jones said. “So we are trying to add what’s currently missing, and that’s this trafficking unit.”
Jones also sees a route to prevention by partnering with the Virginia Department of Education and local school divisions for education initiatives on counterfeit pills and online sales. 
His prior experience serving on Virginia’s Opioid Abatement Authority gave him more direct insight into how the funds distributed from settlements with pharmaceutical companies get to work, he said. As the state’s top lawyer, he would continue to support efforts for the Authority to support recovery programs. 
To help reduce recidivism, as some people leaving and entering the criminal justice system  struggle with addiction, Jones suggested expanding specialty court programs so that offenders are more likely to be paired with treatment services. 
Also on the criminal justice side of the issue, Jones would support laws that raise penalties for fentanyl-related money laundering and go after social media and payment platforms that facilitate illicit drug transactions. Jones would seek to strengthen partnerships with neighboring states to help continue cracking down on trafficking across state lines. 
He said that North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson’s work in this space is an idea of what more states could be doing — such as the multi-state target of WeChat’s role in fentanyl money laundering. 
A decades-long issue, Jones’ work fighting fentanyl, if elected, would build on some previous efforts by his opponent Miyares.
Virginia lands $16.4M from new opioid settlement with drugmakers

The current attorney general has spearheaded a “One Pill Can Kill” advertisement campaign to alert people of the possibility that counterfeit pills may be deadly. 
He also supported a bipartisan bill that passed this year to allow for a manslaughter charge for dealers if a person’s death can be traced back to their product. 
Miayres’office has also been involved in a number of multi-state settlements with pharmaceutical companies for their role in the national opioid crisis. He or Jones could further help tackle additional settlements or cases in the future. 
The fentanyl crisis can largely be traced to Appalachian areas of states, including Virginia, where Purdue Pharma marketed OxyContin in the 1990s. This led to widespread opioid addiction, which former Roanoke Times reporter Beth Macy chronicled in a book that has since been adapted into the Hulu series “Dopesick.” Purdue reached a $6 billion dollar settlement with several states in early 2022 and other companies have continued to be litigated since. 
Jones noted that solving the decades-spanning problem requires “an all hands on deck approach.”

The game follows educational trends that show technology can help students learn, including in history. 
Investigation Declaration, the game created by iCivics in partnership with Virginia’s Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, combines puzzle and strategy elements to engage students in a learn-as-you-play format. It is available for free in English and Spanish.
Recently, the game received Field Day’s 2025 GEE! Award in the Formal Games category. Judges were impressed by its “style, engagement, and gameplay, and it nailed core principles of great game-based learning — showing how a game can teach deeply while keeping players hooked,” Field Day said in a statement.
The game also allows teachers to track students’ efforts and enter the Civic Star Challenge to win prizes for their students and schools.
“Colonial Williamsburg is always looking for new ways to bring our unique brand of history education to as many students as possible,” said Mia Nagawiecki, senior vice president of education for the foundation located in Williamsburg. “Thanks to our partnership with iCivics, we have extended our reach beyond our physical location and even our significant web presence to reach kids where they are and through a medium that excites them.”
iCivics, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has focused on education games since it was founded by the late Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O’Connor in 2009, after her retirement from the court. 
Investigation Declaration’s learn-as-you-play strategy is similar to that of some hugely popular games such as Roblox and Epic Games’ Fortnite. 
As “Agent 6,” students are transported to an alternate time and space where an international crime conglomerate has hacked the fictional Bureau of Ideas, corrupting every file related to freedom, democracy, and individual rights. Agent 6’s job is to restore the corrupted files while learning how ideas spread throughout Africa, Europe and the Americas in the 100 years following the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 1776.
Agent 6 will also discover how the ideas of natural rights, state sovereignty, and the social contract spread from Colonial Williamsburg, Paris and Philadelphia to Haiti, Liberia and beyond to inspire a wave of declarations of freedom and rights.
“Investigation Declaration moves beyond the norms of classic iCivics gameplay to meet the moment in both gaming and civics instruction,” iCivics CEO Louise Dubé said in a statement. “The goal of iCivics has always been to meet young people where they are to teach them the complicated ideas behind our constitutional democracy. If we’re going to carry out that critical mission, we must continue to evolve.”

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)As President Donald Trump wages an all-out assault on offshore wind projects, state leaders face a dilemma: Do they pull the plug on offshore wind and look for other ways to meet their fast-growing energy needs? Or do they double down on their investments, in hopes of helping the industry rebound after Trump leaves office?
Many states along the East Coast have been counting on offshore wind to provide a large portion of their electricity needs in the decades ahead. They’ve invested billions of dollars in growing the industry and getting projects off the ground.
But offshore wind has a particular vulnerability: The federal government is the landlord.
Nearly all offshore wind projects are more than 3 miles offshore, in ocean waters managed by federal agencies. That gives Trump a much more direct path to blocking such projects than for onshore wind and solar projects on private lands. Already, he has done more to stymie offshore wind than many observers thought was possible, including an order to stop work on a wind farm off Rhode Island that was nearly complete.
“This is one of the few areas where states are not in full control of their own energy destiny,” said New York state Sen. Andrew Gounardes, a Democrat. “This administration is always looking for leverage points to try to squeeze, and this is a vulnerable one for us.”
Blue states hope their clean energy plans withstand collision with Trump

State leaders are not yet backing away from their commitments to offshore wind, saying it still has massive long-term potential. But they acknowledge Trump has shown the industry’s vulnerability to political interference, which could scare away investors and developers.
For now, lawmakers say their offshore wind plans have had a massive setback, one that could threaten grid reliability and drive up energy bills. While some state leaders have filed lawsuits challenging Trump’s orders, some say they may need to start looking to other energy sources if offshore wind stalls out.
Since he took office, Trump has halted leases for new wind projects, canceled $679 million in funding to support manufacturing and ports, ended clean energy tax credits and announced plans to cancel the approval of a Maryland offshore wind project.
Most drastically, Trump last month ordered crews to stop work on Revolution Wind, a project off the coast of Rhode Island that is 80% complete. Industry leaders say the order to abandon a nearly finished project was unprecedented. Dozens of turbines already have been erected, with others staged at a nearby pier. More than 50 workers were taken off their planned two-week shift installing new turbines, the CT Mirror reported. One construction crew with about 20 members was left stranded at sea, unable to work, according to The Wall Street Journal.
“This is very much further than was deemed possible or realistic,” said Sam Salustro, senior vice president of policy and market affairs with Oceantic Network, an industry lobbying group. “The self-destruction is beyond our scope of imagination at the beginning of the year.
A National Renewable Energy Laboratory map illustrates the North Atlantic offshore wind projects in the production pipeline as of August 2024. (Offshore Wind Market Report: 2024 Edition. National Renewable Energy Laboratory.)
It’s a massive amount of power that’s just being held back by the federal government.”
State and industry leaders have filed lawsuits seeking to finish work on the Revolution Wind project, arguing Trump has overstepped his authority.
While five East Coast offshore wind farms are in the construction phase, dozens more projects are still in the planning and permitting stages. States have been counting on those projects to power millions of homes, but those plans have hit a dead end with Trump in the White House. What’s less clear is whether the industry can outlast Trump and bounce back after he leaves office.
“[Trump’s actions] are designed to create so much uncertainty and risk that the industry does not rebound under a different administration,” said Timothy Fox, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners LLC, an independent research firm. “Even if a future administration attempts to revive offshore wind development, developers and financiers are likely to be wary of investing in a sector with long lead times and such demonstrable election risks.”
Trump has long opposed offshore wind, repeating false claims that it harms whales, is unreliable and drives up energy costs. His opposition appeared to originate with the construction of an offshore wind farm near his golf course in Scotland, which he deemed an eyesore.
The White House did not respond to a Stateline interview request.
State plans
For many East Coast states, offshore wind has become a critical piece of their energy plans. With limited areas on land that are suited for large-scale energy development, lawmakers have turned to sea-based projects — which also offer the advantage of strong ocean winds. State leaders say such projects could harness massive amounts of power, which is urgently needed as data centers and artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands.
In total, eight East Coast states have committed to building more than 45 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2040 — enough to power more than 30 million homes.
Some states have invested heavily in overhauling ports, building factories and creating workforce development programs to help the industry get on its feet. Officials say the young industry is already creating thousands of manufacturing jobs and reviving coastal economies.
But now that progress has come to a crashing halt.
The Revolution Wind project in the federal waters off Rhode Island had been expected to provide more than 700 megawatts of electricity starting next year, representing about 2.5% of the power across New England.
The mid- and South Atlantic had more than 25 offshore wind projects in the pipeline a year ago. (Offshore Wind Market Report: 2024 Edition. National Renewable Energy Laboratory.)
Trump’s order to stop work on the Revolution Wind project invoked unspecified “national security interests,” with Interior Secretary Doug Burgum later claiming that undersea drones could escape radar detection by attacking through a wind farm. Offshore wind developers noted that the project already received extensive reviews and approvals from the Department of Defense and other agencies.
Canceling the project could threaten the reliability of the region’s power grid, New England’s grid operator, ISO New England, said in a statement last month.
“I am really concerned that the cancellation or delay of this project could cause a spike in energy market costs and an impact to the reliability of the grid,” Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy & Environmental Protection, told Stateline. “There aren’t just other projects in the works that can be swapped in.”
Dykes said Trump’s order has made investors hesitant to support other energy projects, given Trump’s attempt to halt Revolution Wind even after years of planning, permitting and construction.
The attorneys general in Connecticut and Rhode Island have joined project developers in suing the Trump administration, hoping to force the completion of the project.










The self-destruction is beyond our scope of imagination at the beginning of the year. It's a massive amount of power that's just being held back by the federal government. 


– Sam Salustro, senior vice president of policy and market affairs, Oceantic Network, a wind energy industry group 


Last week, Burgum said his agency would be “taking a deep look” at the five wind farms already under construction, CNBC reported, blaming an “ideologically driven permitting process” that allowed them to move forward. While threatening those projects, he also said the administration is “under discussion” with the governors of Rhode Island and Connecticut about allowing work to continue on Revolution Wind.
Trump’s administration previously issued a stop-work order in April for the Empire Wind 1 offshore project in New York, but relented the following month and allowed construction to proceed. That reversal appeared to follow a deal with Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul to build a gas pipeline in New York, Politico reported.
But Trump’s refusal to issue new permits has halted other pending projects in New York state, said Gounardes, the state senator, making it impossible for the state to reach its target of 9 gigawatts by 2035. Hochul’s recent push for more nuclear power, he said, is likely a pivot to other forms of energy without carbon emissions.
Not giving up
Meanwhile, Trump’s administration has signaled that it will revoke permits for a Maryland project that has not yet started construction. State leaders in Maryland have committed to building 8.5 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2035. With Trump’s delays, that timeline is now out of reach, said Democratic state Del. Lorig Charkoudian, who authored the law setting that target.
For now, she said, state leaders should focus on building transmission infrastructure, enabling offshore wind to connect to the grid quickly if a new administration enables projects to move forward.
“Nobody’s giving up,” Charkoudian said. “Offshore wind is critical to our energy future. There’s still a lot of work for our states to be doing so we’re ahead of the game when we finally get sanity back in Washington.”
R.I. leaders want Revolution Wind stop work order reversed. And they want it now.

Earlier this month, the Democratic governors of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island issued a joint statement praising the industry’s boost to the manufacturing sector and calling on Trump to uphold federal permits that have been issued for offshore wind projects.
But some state leaders are worried about the industry’s viability.
“[Trump’s actions] could be a massive blow,” said Massachusetts state Sen. Jamie Eldridge, a Democrat who has sponsored legislation to support the deployment of offshore wind. “It will be hard to recover from. It won’t just be, ‘Here’s a Democratic president restoring everything.’”
Industry analysts noted that projects can take nearly a decade to complete. Even under a friendly administration, investors and developers may now be hesitant to sink billions of dollars into projects that can be abruptly canceled if the next president doesn’t like them.
Eldridge said Massachusetts is embracing all forms of renewable energy, including solar and hydropower from Canada. If offshore wind is delayed, he said, leaders may need to focus on energy efficiency and reducing power consumption.
Virginia leaders have committed to building 5.2 gigawatts of offshore wind projects by the end of 2034. That goal will be “desperately hard to meet,” said state Sen. Creigh Deeds, a Democrat who chairs the Commerce and Labor Committee.
“If I were an investor, I would certainly be worried about [the future of offshore wind],” he said.
Deeds said it’s too soon to say whether Virginia will need to adjust its energy planning, especially as it deals with an influx of data centers that are driving up electricity demand. He said lawmakers currently are more focused on Trump’s cuts to food stamps and Medicaid.
While some state leaders say their timelines for offshore wind will now be impossible to meet, none have publicly backed away from their long-term goals.
Industry leaders say there’s much that states can be doing now to help the industry rebound after Trump leaves office.
“If we have to wait the next three years, there’s a lot of work that can be done on the state side,” said Alicia Gené Artessa, director of the New York Offshore Wind Alliance, an industry group.
She called on states to continue building transmission infrastructure to coastal areas and investing in workforce development programs for offshore wind.
Salustro, with the Oceantic Network, noted that many Republicans have embraced offshore wind and the jobs it has created. The current battle over offshore wind is largely driven by “one person’s personality,” he said, giving him hope the industry can outlast Trump.
“The basic economics are going to prevail long term,” he said.
Despite their misgivings, many state lawmakers largely share that view.
“It’s too early to pull the plug on the future of offshore wind,” said Gounardes, the New York senator. “The wind is always going to blow no matter who’s president, and we should be poised to take advantage of that so that when the administration changes, we’re not a decade behind.”

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original story.)The Ohio property tax reform group set up by Gov. Mike DeWine is racing toward a Sept. 30 deadline.
At its most recent hearing, members blew through a long list of ideas including targeted tax breaks modeled on the abatements popular for new builds around Ohio and removing obscure — but important — tax credits some contend are ripe for abuse.
Later this week, they’re hoping to coalesce around a proposal limiting property tax increases to inflation. They’re using public school property tax bill Ohio House Bill 186 as a starting point.
The members are also aiming to come up with recommendations related to the vetoed property tax provisions that prompted DeWine to set up the group in the first place.

Speaker’s view
Meanwhile, the state lawmakers responsible for actually doing something with the working group’s recommendations are returning to the state Capitol.
If Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman is any indication, a summer’s absence hasn’t made them any fonder of the governor’s efforts.
“It’s my — (I) would say intention, let me soften that slightly to expectation — to put those issues up for veto override votes in the month of October,” Huffman said at a press conference last week.
Although Huffman has looked skeptically on the working group, he pointed to the same measure, House Bill 186, as legislation that will be getting a lot of attention as lawmakers go forward.
And like some working group members, he explained voters’ seemingly receptive response to outright repealing property taxes at the ballot box has sharpened focus and dulled opposition.
“Many of the members in my caucus have come to me and said there has been a considerable softening among local governments about what’s going on,” Huffman said. “Now, is that because there’s a poll that says 61% – 21% that this would pass? Maybe. Is it because apparently there is big national money behind this thing, or (so) we’re told? Maybe.”
“But I think everybody knows,” he added, “that by Jan. 1, 2027, if we abolish property taxes, it is a whole new world.”
Ohio’s governor, lawmakers, and grassroots organizers are all wrestling over property tax reform

Residential Stability Zones
Property tax abatements are a common tool — and bone of contention — in cities around Ohio.
Dangling several years of low property taxes is a powerful incentive to build new homes. But those homes come with people, and if those people have kids, the local school district sees greater enrollment without additional property tax revenue.
It’s an issue that can be managed if local politicians work with local schools.
But Dublin City Schools Superintendent John Marschhausen, who sits on the working group, explained it doesn’t always work out like that.
State law only requires the school district receive notice; they don’t actually get a say in whether an abatement gets approved.
Still, Franklin County Auditor Michael Stinziano and Edward Stockhausen from Cleveland Neighborhood Progress think abatements offer a familiar model that could be retooled to deliver targeted property tax relief.
The idea, known as Residential Stability Zones, is laid out in Ohio Senate Bill 42.
Eligible homeowners get a partial tax exemption equal to the increase in their home’s assessed value — essentially holding them harmless as their home value rises.
The key, Stockhausen said, is determining who’s eligible.
“Those parameters include geography, age, tenure of home ownership, disability status,” he offered as examples. “Those are all different levers that local governments could use with a residential stability zone to adjust the size, of people, where they live, who might be eligible for this program.”
Stinziano added, “what is hopefully helpful for this group and for the General Assembly, it would avoid the need for any state backfill without undermining critical levy funded services.”
By providing a credit that only covers the tax increase, the thinking goes, schools and other taxing authorities won’t lose money.
And by narrowing eligibility to a specific area and a specific population — for example, seniors, who’ve owned their home for several years, living on less than 80% of the median income — benefits are targeted to those who need them most.
Working group members came across interested, if not completely sold.
Noting the proliferation of abatements and related tax breaks, Co-chairman Bill Seitz argued there needs to be a cap on the number of zones, “because otherwise mischief can occur.”
With a nod to school districts’ frustration over abatements, Warren County Auditor Matt Nolan argued if the program goes forward, the zones should require school board approval.
“You know, it makes it harder, they’re going to have less of them, but I think they’re going to be better,” he said.
Tax credits
Nolan and fellow-auditor Chris Galloway from Lake County, argued strongly for eliminating a pair of credits they say shift the tax burden to regular homeowners.
Ohio gives a 10% credit for real estate that isn’t primarily used for business. That applies to farms as well as single to three-family rental properties. The owner-occupancy credit is only 2.5%.
Nolan and Galloway contend the non-business credit shouldn’t apply to rental properties, and the state should use the savings to increase the owner-occupancy credit.
Nolan admitted the impact in terms of savings for the average homeowner will be small.
“But more importantly, you stop these businesses coming in and buying up our residential property and turning them into businesses,” he said. “American Homes For Rent is less incentivized to come in, which will help stabilize values. So, there’s a small number, but there’s the bigger picture.”
Galloway said in Lake County they’re seeing corporate landlords paying cash well over asking to buy up traditional starter homes.
“I don’t know that any real estate investment firm would say that this (credit) is the whole reason they’re in Ohio, right? But it’s part of the equation,” Galloway said. “They’re getting a credit, and they don’t deserve it.”
Nolan said another problem is apartment complexes, which are not eligible for the credit, organizing as condos, which are.
The units are still rented and still owned by one owner, but the set up allows them to engineer a reduced property tax rate.
Nolan and Galloway also pushed to eliminate a provision allowing tax-free LLC transfers, even when real estate is part of the purchase.
Normally any real estate transfer, like buying a house, is subject to a conveyance fee. But if the seller puts the property into an LLC and then sells the LLC, that fee isn’t triggered.
Galloway described a warehouse that recently sold for more than $9 million in his county. His office previously had it valued at $4.4 million.
“That was $5 million in value that, had they gone the LLC way, like, transferred into an LLC and then bought the LLC, I would have never been aware of,” Galloway explained.
“The taxpayers of Mentor would have been treated extremely unfairly,” he added, “because Bob and Betty Buckeye don’t have a way to escape that conveyance fee.”

(Photo by National Institutes of Health)When Geza Kogler, a former professor at Kennesaw State University, lost his National Institutes of Health grant, he didn’t just lose funding; he lost a program he believed in and, quite possibly, his career in academia.
Kogler recently retired from leading a program aimed at training the next generation of orthotists and researchers who specialize in designing, constructing and fitting medical devices such as braces, splints and supportive footwear. He described a “chilling effect” taking hold across Georgia’s universities after the Trump administration succeeded in cutting $783 million in funding for a wide range of disease research projects that had elements of diversity, equity and inclusion. 
He said professors are increasingly afraid to speak publicly about their work for fear of losing their livelihoods. Kogler said that because policy can change quickly, professors may be hesitant to speak out because they could lose support from their school’s administration.
“Look at the fallout now with this political climate of this past year, how many professors who have spoken out have lost their jobs. Professors are often outspoken. They have strong opinions, and people are losing their jobs over this. What’s the point of making a statement when you’re going to lose your livelihood?” said Kogler, who taught for nearly four decades.
Kogler said he would still be at Kennesaw State if his grant had not been terminated.
“I would say that if that grant was still there, I probably would have stayed,” Kogler said.
Kogler, who applied for and received an NIH Enhancing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math Educational Diversity (ESTEEMED) grant, said the program aimed to train undergraduate students who may receive needs-based financial aid at Kennesaw State in bioengineering, with a focus on orthotics and prosthetics. The program, which included a summer boot camp for the students recruited in high school, was terminated in May, affecting the first cohort of 16 students. Kogler said that losing the grant not only killed his own goals of expanding the Kennesaw State orthotics program, but he also had no idea what those students would do now.
“We’re mentoring them to get excited about research, and then right in the middle of their program, the rug gets pulled out from underneath them. What’s that to say for those kids? It’s a horrible message, and I bet that most of those kids wouldn’t want to go anywhere near academics and research at all,” Kogler said.
The Trump administration, which issued a memo on day one to end “radical and wasteful government DEI programs and preferencing,” has slashed funding for medical and scientific research that has not aligned with the executive orders the administration has issued, which the U.S. Supreme Court greenlit in August.
Grants that appear to be unrelated to DEI or COVID-19 vaccines have also been caught up in the Trump administration’s efforts to restructure research funding on the federal level. A Georgia State University project where researchers were developing a drug to treat Type 2 diabetes and obesity by increasing energy expenditure, which helps control blood sugar and promote weight loss, was terminated after having the words “trans” and “expression” flagged, despite the terms being “gene expression” and “translational therapeutic strategies.” The grant was terminated in April and has not been reinstated.
A recent American Association of University Professors survey revealed that nearly 10% of Georgia faculty respondents reported having a federal contract terminated by the Trump administration. These terminations are often linked to keywords flagged in grant proposals, including terms related to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), such as “disparity” or “discrimination,” and the COVID-19 vaccine.
This has left researchers wary of even applying for new grants, according to the survey. 
Professors are now retreating further into what Amy Sharma, executive director of Science for Georgia, a science advocacy nonprofit, called an “ivory tower,” afraid to talk about what they do. She said the silence is fueled by a fear that any public criticism could prevent their grants from being reinstated. Sharma called this a “downward spiral” where silence leads to less public support for science, which in turn leads to more cuts.
“Now, [scientists are] going to further retreat into their corners and not talk to anyone, and not talk about the values of their research, which is going to turn into some sort of vicious cycle where they’re going to completely not talk about what they do because they just hope they don’t get their research funding cut,” Sharma said.
By targeting certain areas of research, the administration is effectively throwing these critical topics “to the wayside,” said Jules Barbati-Dajches, an analyst for the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a pro-science advocacy organization based in Cambridge, Mass. The consequences are already being felt, Barbati-Dajches said, with halted cancer treatment trials and a stop to research on preventative care and chronic diseases.
“We’re already seeing the impact of those cuts, and it’s hard to look into the future when there’s so much happening right now, but as things start to unfold more, not having research in those areas is going to have an impact on those communities of people. It’s not a matter of if, but a matter of when,” Barbati-Dajches said.
The financial impact of these terminations goes beyond a single researcher. Kogler said these federal grants also fund a university’s infrastructure through “overhead” payments. These funds, which at major research universities can be as high as 45% to 56% of the grant amount, are used to cover the costs of buildings, staff and other operational expenses. A new federal policy capped overhead expenses at around 15%, but it was blocked by a U.S. district judge from taking effect at NIH.
The long-term outlook is a major concern. Sharma said there could be a “lost generation of research,” where the pipeline of new scientists is disrupted and other countries become the leaders in scientific research. Kogler believes it could be “decades” before American academia recovers. He points to the loss of experienced academics, as well as the demoralizing effect on students who see their mentors’ projects terminated and their career paths thrown into question.
“I’m one example, but how many people are there like me? The future is not real good for me to pursue my research. I could go to private industry. I could go back into clinical practice and work in that space, and some of these other faculty will probably be taking other actions too. 
“Who’s going to train the next generation of scientists and engineers in these areas? You need funding to do that, and that is gone,” Kogler said.

Kelly Ayotte nominated Bryan Gould to replace James Bassett on the New Hampshire Supreme Court. (Photo by Dave Cummings/New Hampshire Bulletin)At a pivotal hearing before the Executive Council Friday, New Hampshire Supreme Court judicial nominee Bryan Gould spent significant time laying out the cases from which he would recuse himself.
If confirmed as a Supreme Court justice, the 40-year attorney and director at Cleveland, Waters and Bass in Concord said he would almost certainly step aside from cases involving his former client Casella Waste Systems.
He also said he would very likely step away from cases featuring the New Hampshire Republican Party and the Republican State Committee. He previously served as vice chairman of the state Republican Party and as legal counsel for the Republican State Committee.
But asked how he would rule in a hypothetical challenge to the two landmark Claremont education cases in the 1990s, Gould said it would be inappropriate for him to comment on potential future cases. And he strongly denied a suggestion by Democratic Councilor Karen Liot Hill that Gov. Kelly Ayotte had nominated him in order to swing the court to overturn those education funding decisions.
“I have not committed to anyone … that I would take any particular action in connection with any case” that might come before the court, he said.

Instead, Gould said he generally supports letting Supreme Court precedents stand and added that overturning them would require significant evidence. 
“If, for example, the decision is based on interpretation of the Constitution, anybody advocating for the overruling of that decision has a substantial burden to show that that decision was not actually correctly made at the time,” he said. 
He added: “If someone raises the question whether it was properly decided, there are ways to determine that.”
The more-than-three-hour hearing for Gould Friday came days before the Executive Council is scheduled to vote Wednesday on whether to confirm him as an associate justice of the court. And it underscored some of the stakes facing the state’s high court, especially regarding education funding.  
Gould is Ayotte’s first nominee to the court, and his selection comes after the retirement of Supreme Court Associate Justice James Bassett in August. 
If confirmed, Gould, 66, would have less than four years to serve on the court before he would face the mandatory retirement age of 70. But within those four years, the court will likely face at least one decision over school funding, whose outcome could ripple through the state for decades.
In June, the Supreme Court upheld a superior court decision in Contoocook Valley School District v. New Hampshire that found that New Hampshire was underfunding its public schools in violation of its requirement to provide an “adequate education,” a requirement first established by the Claremont decisions. But the court left it to the Legislature to determine how to respond to its ruling and did not directly order a funding increase. The decision leaves open the possibility of future litigation depending on how the Legislature responds. And another school funding lawsuit, Rand v. New Hampshire, is likely to come before the court in the coming years. 
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court that arrived at its 3-2 decision in June had an unusual makeup: Chief Justice Gordon MacDonald recused himself due to his previous involvement in the case as the former attorney general, and Justice Anna Barbara Hantz Marconi has been absent from the court since being charged with an improper attempt to influence the court. With Bassett’s departure, future decisions by the court could be decided differently.
In his introductory remarks to the council, Gould did not focus on those high-level cases. Instead, he outlined his judicial philosophy, and promised to disentangle any personal views on a topic from any judicial decisions. 
He stressed the importance of the Supreme Court to interpret and enforce the state constitution “as written,” and not to introduce opinions not supported by the intent of the text.
“Judges are not elected,” he said. “While we hope and expect judges will have sound judgments of wisdom, they are no better qualified to make policy judgments than any other citizen.”
Before working for Cleveland, Waters and Bass, Gould served as the special counsel to Republican Gov. Craig Benson as well as a counsel to the Executive Council. In his private practice, he has worked on cases involving insurance claims, hospitals, product liability defense, election law, and environmental law.
Though he has had numerous corporate clients, Gould said his most important clients have been individuals. He spoke about the toll that litigation can take on individual citizens, and the need for lawyers and courts to serve their clients responsibly. 
A graduate of the University of Utah school of law and a member of the conservative Federalist Society, Gould touted his roots in New Hampshire Friday, noting that his family had first settled in the Seacoast area in the 17th century. 
And he noted that he had taken cases on all sides of issues, at times working on behalf of the state and at other times helping to litigate against the state. 
“The only personal conviction I will bring to the court if I am confirmed is that of the responsibility of judges to be faithful to the law just as I am faithful to my clients,” he said. 
Speaking on state Supreme Court precedents, Gould said it is necessary to respect them to further stability in the law. Deciding to overturn precedent “should not be done lightly, and it should only be done if the law requires it,” he said. 
He indicated he supports a more textualist approach to the state constitution and would be less interested in re-interpretation to fit modern society. “Once a judge leaves that language and starts trying to import content without determining the intent, I don’t think that’s a legitimate exercise of judicial power,” he said. 
Gould added the state Supreme Court could lose its legitimacy in the eyes of the public if judges “try to give meaning to constitutional provisions” that might be vague. It is a problem if that practice appears to be political, he said.
And he said he is not in favor of courts issuing headline-grabbing decisions that appear to completely redefine constitutional law, speaking unfavorably of the U.S. Supreme Court.
“I don’t think it’s a good thing for courts to issue blockbuster decisions,” he said. “… The fact that New Hampshire doesn’t really have many of those blockbuster decisions is probably a good thing.”
Gould said he would recuse himself from presiding over any lawsuits brought by Casella Waste Systems, including one involving a proposed landfill near the Forest Lake State Park in Dalton. Gould has represented Casella as an attorney. 
In a lawsuit this year, Granite State Landfill LLC, a subsidiary of Casella Waste Systems, has challenged the Department of Environmental Services’ denial of a permit to allow its landfill proposal to proceed. 
At his hearing, Gould cited the state’s Code of Judicial Conduct, which states that a judge must recuse himself if they have clearly represented a client before them.
“I cannot imagine a scenario, after representing Casella for over 30 years, that I would ever sit on a case in which Casella, or one of its affiliates, was a client,” he said.
He said his past work for the Republican Party was part of his desire to stand up for his political convictions, but said it would not affect his judgment on the court and that he would recuse from any cases. “I just think that is the wrong thing for a judge to do,” he said of the idea of ruling in favor of one’s political positions. “You should not know a judge’s personal opinion.”
He added: “I have a very difficult time seeing circumstances in which I could sit on a case in which the Republican state committee was a party.” 
While Gould said it would be necessary to recuse himself from ruling in cases involving specific people and organizations that he has worked with, he rebuffed the suggestion that he step away from cases that touched on similar issues to his previous legal work. Gould represented plaintiffs in the 2015 case of Guare v. New Hampshire, in which the state Supreme Court affirmed the voting rights of college students in the state. But on Friday, he said that having done so — and having served as legal counsel for Republicans in other election-law-related cases — should not disqualify him from ruling on election law cases more broadly. 
At one point, Liot Hill asked Gould about his appointment by Ayotte in May to the Judicial Selection Commission, an advisory group that makes recommendations for the governor’s judicial nominees. Gould said he had resigned before the commission had recommended him for Supreme Court justice, and said notice of that resignation had failed to be posted on the commission’s website.

It allows the federal government, under the authority of the Clean Air Act, to regulate the greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet and in turn causing climate change.
The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed it almost 20 years ago.
President Donald Trump wants to get rid of it.
And that has unleashed a flood of outrage, along with increasingly coordinated pushback, from groups of scientists, climate experts, legal entities, governments, environmental advocates and individuals.
Connecticut is in the thick of it, with its emissions levels and air quality hanging in the balance.
The endangerment finding was specifically targeted for reconsideration in the conservative government playbook Project 2025. In March, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin announced it was under review, denigrating endangerment as “the Holy Grail of the climate change religion.” And on July 29, EPA announced it wanted endangerment gone.
Repealing the finding “will be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America,” Zeldin said.

“We will not let Trump and Zeldin do this without a fight,” said Connecticut Attorney General William Tong at the time. His office is now one of four on a leadership team, with California, New York and Massachusetts heading up a multistate pushback.
While the proposed repeal is viewed as catastrophic, what really incensed opponents and galvanized large group efforts to fight the administration was a draft climate report by the Department of Energy, conducted in secret, released simultaneously with the EPA announcement and used as justification for the repeal.
The DOE report was compiled by a working group of five known climate skeptics, if not outright deniers, handpicked by Energy Secretary Chris Wright. He has since disbanded the group in a letter that disputes the existence of climate change as “settled science.”
The report was not peer-reviewed, as is the norm with such material. It pulled information from existing research. But many scientists whose work was cited said the report cherry-picked information, then misinterpreted and lied about their findings.
Fury ensued.
Jennifer Marlon, executive director of the Yale Center for Geospatial Solutions and senior research scientist at the School of the Environment, who specializes in wildfires and climate change, is one of those whose work was cited. She said she found out through a network of friends and colleagues.
“’Hey, did you see that your paper is cited in this report that kind of says, oh, wildfires are not a problem?’” Marlon recalls hearing.
“DOE directly misinterpreted my study. They cited me and twisted my findings.”
The DOE report, she said, missed the importance of active suppression of wildfires and what it does to fuel sources. And it minimized, if not ignored, the importance of warming temperatures and changing precipitation rates. It used data known to be inaccurate.
“They omit and minimize the importance of climate change in driving uncontrollable wildfires today,” Moran said.

“I spent multiple years working to compile the data behind the article that they reference. And when you invest so much time and effort in careful scientific research, where you think about every sentence that you’re saying and you provide evidence for every claim that you make, and then you see somebody who knows nothing about wildfires whip out some sentences and make these graphs that misrepresent your data,” she said, “it made me angry and upset and motivated me to put down all my other work and say, ‘OK, I’m gonna respond to this.’”
Marlon joined a group of 85 scientists who provided what has become a massive refutation to the DOE report.
The pushback has come from the grassroots of science, but it’s also been increasingly coordinated because of the sheer volume of outrage.
“It is very unique,” Marlon said. ”It kind of comes out of the blue. It rises very quickly. It demands your full attention right now to respond quickly while you can. The Trump administration moves very, very quickly, and they always are starting fires in multiple places so that people are kind of scattered and trying to figure out, ‘how do we address the chaos that’s unfolding?’”
Science group efforts
It fell to Andrew Dessler, a climate scientist and director of the Texas Center for Extreme Weather at Texas A&M, to figure that out. He asked on social media if people like him and Marlon should have a coordinated response and, if so, who was organizing it.
“People took that to mean I was doing it. And so, ultimately, I agreed to do it,” he said.
The plan became to file a group response for both the DOE report and again with EPA on the proposed endangerment rollback. Coming in at some 460 pages — three times the length of the report — the first filing was made in time for the DOE report comment deadline on Sept. 2, which also drew a total of 59,563 written comments. The comment period for the proposed EPA rule rollback goes until Sept. 22. 
“By coordinating it, we probably got more people to respond, because everyone sees everyone else doing it and a lot of people working together on sections,” said Dessler, who also said he was shocked at how many emails he got from people wanting to participate. “Also, I think it made the response better.”
He acknowledged the uniqueness of his effort.
“Yeah, it’s unique. What the government’s doing is unique. This is basically a show trial for climate science,” he said. “They picked the jury — all people that say CO2 is innocent — and then they wrote a report.”
In the end, he said, the administration will declare victory, and everybody knows that’s what’s going to happen.
“People are offended. People are doing it because they’re mad that these people are making a mockery of science,” he said. “I’ve spent my entire career doing science. I respect science. Science works.”
The comments the group submitted include experts responding to every section of the DOE report.
Among those participating was Robert Kopp, a noted climate scientist at Rutgers University whose research focuses on sea level rise, climate and their economic impacts. He also holds multiple titles on other climate endeavors and has helped author both national and international top climate reports. He co-edited the submission, co-authored the section on sea level changes, and his previous research was cited throughout.
“My first reaction to opening the DOE report was, ‘wow, that was like a time capsule from 25 years ago,’” Kopp said. “It’s the same people making essentially the same arguments for 25 years even as the evidence of climate change becomes clearer and the evidence of the damages climate change is causing become clearer.
“I feel like, as a scientist, I need to address the cherry picking and misrepresentation that DOE is putting out and that EPA is using.”
Kopp points specifically to subject matter he knows best — the claim in the EPA proposed rule that sea level rise has been minimal. It cites the DOE report, though Kopp says the DOE doesn’t even say that. It offers some contradictory minimal analysis in a couple of citings.
“I think they’ve tried to write the proposed rule such that they could give up on the science argument and still convince the Supreme Court of the validity,” he said.
Carrie Jenks, executive director of the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School, agrees.
“Their primary proposal is to undercut the legal authority to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. They’re also proposing to attack the science, but they’re not relying on that. They don’t need to win on the science to undercut the legal authority,” Jenks said.
The goal, she said, seems to be to tie the hands of future administrations to prevent the regulation of greenhouse gases under the current Clean Air Act.
In an emailed statement, an EPA spokesperson appeared to confirm Jenks’ view. 
“EPA’s proposal is legal in nature,” it read. “The Endangerment Finding is the legal prerequisite used by the Obama and Biden Administrations to regulate emissions from new motor vehicles and new motor vehicle engines. Absent this finding, EPA would lack statutory authority under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) to prescribe standards for greenhouse gas emissions. EPA is bound by the laws established by Congress, including under the Clean Air Act. Congress never explicitly gave EPA authority to impose greenhouse gas regulations for cars and trucks.” 
In an unusual move, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine have undertaken what they call a fast-track review of the latest evidence for whether greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health and welfare. At the time of the announcement in early August, Marcia McNutt, president of the National Academy of Sciences, said the review was in direct response to EPA’s proposal to rescind endangerment. The report is slated to be released Wednesday.
“Decades of climate research and data have yielded expanded understanding of how greenhouse gases affect the climate,” McNutt said in a statement at the time. “We are undertaking this fresh examination of the latest climate science in order to provide the most up-to-date assessment to policymakers and the public.”
Economists weigh in
Environmental and climate economists have also joined forces to respond to endangerment and the DOE report. So far there’s at least one group of a dozen. It includes Yale’s Ken Gillingham, senior associate dean of academic affairs. He has environmental and energy economics appointments in the environment and management schools and the economics department. He also served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration.
The group has filed objections to the DOE report, focusing on three chapters with economic assertions. Among its findings are that the economics literature used “is woefully out of date;” that it “employs an array of fallacies” in saying climate damages are small compared with other trends; it accuses the report of using “strawman scenarios and fallacious reasoning” in its cost benefit analysis; and it says the report misrepresents the effect of climate change on agriculture and on secondary issues such has death from heat stress.

Gillingham is mainly focusing on the economic reasoning in the endangerment rollback, along with numbers in the regulatory impact analysis and the proposed rule itself. The group will be filing a new document in time for the Sept. 22 deadline, and Gillingham is also working with a second group of economists that will be filing comment as well.
Gillingham is questioning the EPA’s assertions that the cost of cars will increase, the choices for cars will decrease and old polluting cars will stay on the road longer.
“It’s disingenuous to be worried about increasing car prices when implementing a massive tariff policy that’s raising car prices,” he said. “They’re clearly not worried so much about car prices. They’re just trying to destroy environmental regulations.”
What Gillingham sees at work is influential parties who stand to lose money from a decarbonized economy. 
“It’s inconvenient to have climate policy — to a set of people whose fortunes depend on fossil fuels,” he said. “They are very keen to see a rollback of the endangerment finding and anything that can be done to make it very difficult to regulate greenhouse gases. That’s fundamentally what’s going on.”
Legal pushback
While scientists and economists are coalescing to push back against the double-barreled endangerment rollback, a group of more than two dozen state attorneys general and chief legal officers in several cities are also coming together, as they have frequently in Trump’s second term.
The attorneys general, including Connecticut’s William Tong, have already filed an amicus brief in support of a lawsuit filed by the Environmental Defense Fund and the Union of Concerned Scientists that alleges the U.S. Department of Energy did not follow proper procedures in establishing the group that compiled the DOE report.

The group also filed 85 pages of comments against the report itself — enumerating the volumes of peer-reviewed research the report ignored and a 122-page appendix of state-by-state climate change impacts. Connecticut’s section notes the observed temperature increases, rise in sea levels that exceeds the global average and the region’s increase in climate extremes including storm intensity, rates of precipitation, flooding, heat and drought and the impacts from all of them.
A representative of Tong’s office has already testified during a live comment period on the legality of the Trump administration’s plan to dump endangerment. In the allotted two-and-a-half minutes, the testimony focused on how the proposed repeal denies the scientific reality that climate change is happening; that endangerment can only be changed by Congress, not the EPA; and that the proposal ignores health and other benefits of climate protection.
There were more than 600 live comments over four days of testimony (extended from the originally scheduled two days), that, according to observers, ran about 97% against and 3% in favor.
As of Sept. 15, more than 92,000 written comments were submitted on the endangerment repeal. The AG group filing on that will be a much-expanded version of its DOE comments. 
“We’re pushing back on the junk science, but we’re also going to push back legally, procedurally and substantively legally that this is an illegal approach to rescinding the endangerment finding,” said Matthew Levine, deputy associate Connecticut attorney general and chief of the environment section. “I’ve been working on this stuff for decades, and the science is only continuing to improve and get better with specificity. We feel really confident on the facts and the support for it, and we also feel really confident on the legal issues as well.”
Endangerment in brief
Endangerment goes back to a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court ruling — Massachusetts v. EPA — that paved the way for EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in motor vehicles in addition to the standard pollutants it had been regulating under the iconic Clean Air Act since it came into its modern existence in 1970.
The Act’s language says said that the EPA is required to regulate any air pollutant the administrator finds if the administrator finds they “cause, or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.”
Two years later, the administrator did just that, and greenhouse gases — six of them — have been regulated as pollutants since.
It’s widely assumed the EPA will go ahead with rolling back endangerment. So it’s also widely assumed this matter will wind up back before the U.S. Supreme Court. Three of the four justices who voted against it originally remain on the court: Chief Justice John Roberts, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. None of the five justices who voted for it remain.
The use of the finding has been stretched since the original ruling to justify requiring emissions reductions from power plants and industrial facilities. In a related matter, the EPA proposed a rule on Sept. 12 to discontinue the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program signed into law in 2007 by President George W. Bush. The rule, which began operating a decade ago, required annual reporting of emissions by refineries, factories and other large industrial operations to make the public aware of emissions as a first step towards limiting them.
But the focus of endangerment in the current instance is for motor vehicles. And while the overall issue is wonky to the average person, it has a major impact on their lives, especially here in Connecticut.
Connecticut’s emissions
Connecticut set itself greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals to meet between now and 2050, when overall emissions are supposed to be 80% below 2001 levels. The annual GHG Inventory released by the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection earlier this month shows the state continues to be off-track to meet its goals.
The transportation sector, which constitutes the largest source of those emissions, provided a small bright spot. Its emissions were down 2% in 2023 (the most recent data available) over 2022. Prior to the pandemic, during which emissions dipped dramatically, it had been trending up slightly. But to reach its sector goals, the rate of decrease will need to increase 3.6-fold to meet its next benchmark in 2030.

It is likely the 2023 decrease was driven by greater adoption of electric and more fuel-efficient vehicles, as well as power sector emissions reductions mandated during the Biden administration that would have helped clean up power plants upwind of Connecticut. But the potential rollback of endangerment, along with the Trump administration’s elimination of electric vehicle tax credits and other motor vehicle efficiency measures, including the more restrictive emissions levels some states follow, may send them back up.
“We are concerned that recent actions by the EPA to roll back power plant regulations, vehicle fuel economy standards, and even the Endangerment Finding will remove critical federal tools that contributed to this progress,” said DEEP Commissioner Katie Dykes in a statement that accompanied the report’s release.
DEEP would not make anyone available to discuss the endangerment repeal effort or the DOE report specifically, though Deputy Commissioner for Environmental Quality Emma Cimino did speak during the EPA live testimony on endangerment.
“Greenhouse gas emissions significantly impact human health by contributing to climate change, which in turn leads to various health problems including respiratory illnesses, heat-related illnesses, infectious disease outbreaks, food and water insecurity, and mental health issues,” Connecticut Public Health Commissioner Manisha Juthani said in a statement at the time. “Amid the EPA pulling back on these efforts, Connecticut will hold our values to protect and improve the health and safety of our residents.” 
“If you want to address the contributions of climate change from Connecticut, there’s no way to do it without making rapid and large reductions in gasoline use,” said David Reichmuth, a senior scientist in the clean transportation program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. The EPA’s changes, he said, mean car buyers will have options that are less efficient and with higher emissions. “That‘s going to take us in the wrong direction. In a time where we need to be going as quickly as possible to reduce emissions, we’re going to be actually increasing emissions.”
The Trump administration argues in the endangerment rollback that the higher cost of EVs — now exacerbated by the loss of the EV tax credit coupled with tariffs, which Reichmuth calls disingenuous on the administration’s part — will cause people to hang onto existing dirtier cars for longer. It also claims lower emissions rules by class of vehicle means that any changes in each class will be negligible.
“The idea that the emissions from vehicles don’t matter — it flies in the face of all the of the data we have,” Reichmuth said, calling such arguments “absurd.”
He points out that even if the next administration were to reimpose tough GHG auto emission standards, the cars purchased under more permissive Trump standards could stay on the road for well over a decade. “You’re locking in decades of emissions from those new vehicles,” he said.
Advocates band together
Scientists like Harvard’s Carrie Jenks believe that public input will also be critical to the their cause in this effort.
“I think it’s important for stakeholders to give EPA as much information as they can,” she said. “I think it’s going to be important for EPA to really dig into that, and it’s going to be interesting to see how they do that.”
The Union of Concerned Scientists, like other advocacy groups, is no stranger to group efforts. It has sent out multiple emails requesting individuals file comments on endangerment and contact lawmakers. But Rachel Cleetus, the group’s senior policy director with the climate and energy program, said this one isn’t taking take much effort.
“This report is so egregious that it hasn’t even required a big coordinated effort,” she said. “Within 24 hours, there were scientists on the media, on social media, writing, from the perspective of their expertise, that this was just wrong. So many errors in this report, blatant, complete obfuscation of scientific facts.”
Cleetus was also among the hundreds who gave live testimony on the endangerment repeal effort. She said, as she waited her turn, that what struck her was the ordinary citizens who stepped up, like a woman from Texas on the panel before hers. 
“She spoke so movingly about the impacts of Hurricane Harvey and then the recent floods in Texas and what it has meant for people in her community,” Cleetus said. “It’s heartbreaking, it’s enraging, actually. … This is not just political football. This really affects people’s lives.”
Among other organizing efforts, the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University immediately provided a full explanation of the issue along with templates for comment letters for both individuals and governments.
The Climate Action Campaign, CAC, which is a coalition of major national environmental, environmental justice and public health groups representing about 15 million members across the country, has stepped up.
Executive Director Margie Alt said their tactical approach is both group and individual efforts, but a couple of things are different this time. First, the Trump administration seems more organized than it was in the first administration, and the fossil fuel interests operating within it are exerting more pressure.
“I’d say the other thing that’s different, though, is that people across the country are experiencing climate change every single day,” she said. “We’re just seeing incredible, incredible public response, especially as people are affected by extreme weather, which they understand to be supercharged by the climate crisis.”
She, and many others, accused the Trump administration of making climate denial the official policy of the U.S. 
“I don’t think the public is going to stand for it,” Alt said.
At the Natural Resources Defense Council, Madeline Hankins, the group’s federal climate legal director, said the organization is pulling out all the stops.
Hankins said they knew what rollbacks were coming but not how quickly and widespread. 
“We have required some level of sort of coordination and capacity and trying to figure out, ‘OK, it’s all hands on deck, but who’s going to handle what, and how are we going to address this?’” Hankins said.
Most inspiring, Hankins said, were the tens of thousands of members who have filed comments and that, even at the height of summer, “we’re seeing scientists band together to really rebut this report, and they’re coming out of the woodwork to talk about how their research is being misquoted.”
That may have been what motivated Yale’s Marlon to begin with. But she also sees the contrast with the previous federal climate policies she said were designed to improve people’s health, provide cleaner air, cleaner water, lower the temperatures globally, and to even make money doing it.
“All of these tools and policies were like a road map to a safer, cleaner future,” she said. “Basically what these new efforts are doing are taking that map, tossing it out the window, turning off the headlights in the car, and stepping on the accelerator towards a cliff. It’s really endangering the lives of millions of people.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/alz-indiana-7.29.25.jpeg,,,2025-09-16 05:56:55.150103

(Screenshot courtesy of The Ohio Channel)In the annual State of the Judiciary speech, Ohio Supreme Court Chief Justice Sharon Kennedy pushed for more civics education, committed to eliminating “legal deserts,” and emphasized the importance of an independent judicial branch of government.
“Preservation of judicial independence is founded on public trust,” Kennedy told the Ohio Judicial Conference on Thursday. “That trust grows when we innovate to address the underlying causes of crime, wholly open our courthouses to all, proactively tackle our solemn responsibilities in the administration of justice and build a bright, bold future for the legal profession in Ohio.”
Before she began her prepared remarks, Kennedy asked the conference for “indulgence,” in which she called for a moment of silence for the victims and families on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.
She asked for a second moment of silence in honor of Charlie Kirk, a right-wing political activist who was fatally shot at a college campus event in Utah on Wednesday.
In asking for the moment of silence for Kirk, Kennedy said “as people we come from all different walks of life, from different faiths, from different political views and perspectives, but what binds us together is humanity.”
The chief justice added that “robust debate of differing viewpoints is essential to a free and civil society.”
Quoting former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, she said of exposing “falsehoods and fallacies,” that “the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.”
The Republican chief justice was elected to the seat in November 2022, as only the second woman to serve, succeeding fellow Republican Chief Justice Maureen O’Connor.
She was first elected to the bench in 2012, having worked in Butler County’s court system before that.

The Ohio Supreme Court is the highest court in the state, hearing appeals from lower courts primarily on cases that involve the state constitution, death sentence appeals and appeals from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.
The court has discretion to accept any case it deems “of public or great general interest.”
The court saw multiple cases related to the state’s redistricting battle over the last four years, and stands as the court of jurisdiction if the upcoming congressional redistricting map is legally challenged.
Speaking to the members of the Ohio Judicial Conference, Kennedy credited them for maintaining the judicial independence of the state’s many different courts, from common pleas to municipal courts, and she spotlighted the specialized dockets that focus on topics such as drug addiction and mental health challenges.
“Ohio’s judiciary has long been the beacon of independence and with that independence comes the freedom to innovate,” Kennedy said. “(Specialized dockets) are not just about accountability, they are about healing, second changes and hope.”
The justice system’s independence must rely on impartiality and universal accessibility, according to the chief justice, along with a renewed effort to complete cases in a timely manner.
“When cases languish, justice delayed becomes justice denied,” Kennedy told the conference.
Improving the movement of cases through the system and the access to proper representation must include eliminating “legal deserts.”
In order to do that, the system needs to focus not only on recruiting more attorneys to the field, but also preparing those attorneys. She likened the future of law to residencies and fellowships in the medical field.
“We must be speaking to young people to spark an interest in them to become an attorney,” Kennedy said, while also saying work must be done to “enhance the life cycle of an Ohio attorney.”
Touching further on the importance of public trust in the judiciary, the chief justice said the supreme court is holding its own events to run alongside the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence next year.
That includes exhibits on women in law and displays of foundational documents like the Declaration of Independence and the Ohio Constitution.
The supreme court building is also giving tours after hours, and the justices are holding some oral arguments in off-site locations.
She encouraged attorneys and judges across the state to be involved in educating the public on their branch of government, through organized events or even visits to schools.
“All civic education, no matter how small, how big, is an act to promote and restore trust and it is a giant step forward to preserving judicial independence into the future,” Kennedy said.

(Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was sworn in as the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, many physician organizations have repeatedly expressed concerns that his actions in this role have undermined public health, while also eroding trust in science and causing confusion. 
Although these organizations had previously stopped short of calling for Secretary Kennedy’s resignation, his continued disregard for science and evidence has changed this. Amid the politics, our focus must remain on the foundation of public health. Immunizations save lives. As physicians caring for New Hampshire’s families, we are deeply concerned about tactics that weaken confidence in proven, tested public health recommendations and systems.
Within the past week, many organizations have begun to call for Secretary Kennedy to resign from his position. 
The American College of Physicians, representing more than 162,000 internal medicine physicians, cited a loss of confidence in his leadership in calling for his resignation. The American Academy of Family Physicians, representing more than 128,000 family physicians, pointed to rapidly declining confidence in the Department of Health and Human Services in calling for President Donald Trump to reevaluate Secretary Kennedy’s ability to serve in his current capacity. Earlier this month, a letter signed by more than 20 medical organizations, including the Infectious Disease Society of America, American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology, American Association of Immunologists, and the American Public Health Association also called for Secretary Kennedy to resign. 
During Secretary Kennedy’s tenure, he has established a pattern of blatant disregard for data and evidence, and has allowed dangerous medical misinformation to spread. 
Actions such as attacking reputable peer-reviewed medical journals, dismissing all of the members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, and gutting our public health infrastructure seriously jeopardize Secretary Kennedy’s stated goal of making America healthy. 
By undermining our established ability to monitor the spread of disease, the risk of infectious diseases and foodborne illnesses have increased. Attacks on vaccination practices have not only made it more difficult to access vaccinations, but they have also made it more difficult for both physicians and the public to access evidence-based recommendations. 
Secretary Kennedy’s Department of Health and Human Services continues to target not only evidence-based practices, but the practice of medicine in general.
Indeed, new federal policies have been enacted that aim to change the way medicine is practiced and scientific research is conducted. As an example, last month the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists separated from federal funding due to changes in federal funding laws that roll back diversity, equity, and inclusivity initiatives. In their statement, ACOG noted that separating from federal funding was a reaffirmation of their commitment to continue their work with “reducing preventable maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity within the United States, to ensuring the quality and safety of patient care that will improve population health outcomes.”
Where the American public had once been able to rely on consistent, impartial, and evidence-based recommendations from institutions such as the CDC, Secretary Kennedy’s actions have changed this landscape through continuous partisan and ideological attacks. 
As each state now considers how to proceed within the current public health environment, many other states (including New Hampshire’s neighboring states) have discussed creating their own set of vaccine recommendations. Although New Hampshire has thus far not yet joined these efforts, it is clear that the public health landscape for Granite Staters will be affected by shifting federal policies. 
It is likely Granite Staters’ access to and the cost of evidence-based public health interventions like vaccines will be adversely affected due to federal policies. As a result, preventable illnesses, such as the flu or COVID, could be more likely to affect Granite Staters’ lives and livelihoods. 
As physicians, we know that we must put evidence before ideology to protect the policies that safeguard the health of families in New Hampshire and across the nation. Our message is simple: Immunizations save lives, and public health measures keep all Americans healthy. Scaling back public health measures punishes all Americans — not just those with differing ideologies.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rfktennessee-1024x673.jpg,,,2025-09-16 05:56:55.150103

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)College Republicans and Democrats in Ohio have joined forces in a rare moment of unity after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Leaders say that unity is the start of moving the country forward.
In this era of political divisiveness, you may only expect to see the leaders of the Republicans and Democrats come together to debate.
“What we have now in our political system with a political environment that is so divisive, so nasty,” said Ohio College Republican Federation Chair Gabe Guidarini.
But it’s actually debate and tragedy that brought Guidarini and College Democrats of Ohio President Gavin Steele together.
“We see political violence is on the rise in our country, and that’s terrifying,” Steele said.
Kirk held a debate series, traveling to college campuses. While speaking at Utah Valley University, he was shot and killed. A suspect is in custody.
Guidarini, in his grief, reached out to Steele — who jumped at the opportunity, drafting a joint statement on Kirk’s death.
They read the statement in a joint 30-minute interview:

“The Ohio College Republican Federation and the College Democrats of Ohio stand together to reject political violence in all its forms unequivocally. What happened at Utah Valley University yesterday is unacceptable. Violence undermines the very foundations of our republic and must be rejected by all Americans.
Our thoughts and prayers are with Charlie Kirk’s family and loved ones, the UVU community impacted by this atrocity, and with all Americans who witnessed this happen. Together, we must foster a culture where disagreement never escalates to harm. May our shared commitment to democracy guide us toward a safer and more united America.”

The post, which has garnered hundreds of thousands of views and thousands of likes across platforms, demonstrates the only way, according to both young leaders, that the country can move forward.
“It addressed a serious need in our country right now, which is some sense of unity against political violence,” Guidarini said.
Steele explained that, on the issues of the day, he “vehemently” disagrees with Kirk — but he was using his First Amendment rights, and was willing to have a conversation with the other side.
“If we’re not able to talk, we’re not able to solve the issues that are facing young people or progress into the future,” Steele said.
The students, though, admitted they’d fallen into that political division.
They were asked if they ever thought they would come onto a joint interview advocating for the same topic.
“No,” Guidarini said. “Wednesday was just a wake-up call that we need to put down our disagreements for a time and come together to remind people of what the spirit of democracy in this country is all about.”
Steele nodded as the Republican spoke.
“This is a moment of reflection where we can move forward and hopefully find a better community in the end,” Steele said.
The pair met through the violence.
“Gavin, you’re a patriot, dude,” Guidarini said.
“Gabe, I have nothing but respect,” Steele responded.
But vowed to work to better the state — together — moving forward.

Current and former students are now suing the district. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)Last month, current and former high school students in Lawrence filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that the school district’s use of Gaggle, a self-styled “safety management tool” that enrollees must put on their devices as a prerequisite to attend class, violated the students’ rights to free expression and due process.
Gaggle claims its software helps schools “proactively identify and support struggling students — before it’s too late.” Further, according to the district’s website, although the task of “proactively identifying” problems involves Gaggle scanning “students’ district-issued accounts for harmful content,” the process is not overly invasive in part because the software “cannot and does not monitor personal devices or any personal accounts.”
But the student plaintiffs disagree, claiming that Gaggle has “flagged email communications accessed via personal devices, including messages sent from personal phones through school-issued Gmail accounts.”  Thus, according to the plaintiffs, Gaggle “subject(s) all students to round-the-clock digital surveillance” and “suspicionless searches and seizures of student expression on a scale and scope that no court has ever upheld — and that the Constitution does not permit.”
The outcome of the case will depend largely on whether the district can show that implementing software designed to monitor students the way it did was closely related enough to an important government interest — namely, student safety — to justify Gaggle’s intrusion into the students’ lives.
But with the plaintiffs on the record that they are seeking to “set a national precedent” with this lawsuit, it may be awhile before the legal issues at play are resolved.
In the meantime, it’s worth noting the variety of allegations contained in the lawsuit that the use of Gaggle was nonsensical, and in turn, violated the students’ rights. If those allegations bear out as the case progresses, it will become correspondingly more difficult for the district to show that its use of Gaggle complied with the Constitution.
I was struck by three instances that seemed particularly arbitrary and counter to any notion that Gaggle advances student safety.
First, when student journalists at Lawrence High School began to realize in the spring of 2024 that Gaggle was quarantining some of the work they had prepared for publication in the student newspaper, the Budget, they devised a plan to test the extent of the software’s reach. One of them, former student Natasha Torkzaban, who is one of the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the district, sent an email to the then-faculty advisor for the Budget in which she wrote that she was “worried about her mental health.”
Although the Torkzaban was not in fact worried about her mental state when she wrote that email, the lawsuit alleges that the faculty advisor “never received Torkzaban’s email because, on information and belief, it was flagged and seized by Gaggle and the District pursuant to the surveillance program.”
It will be interesting to learn the district’s explanation for how any important government interest is served by flagging emails about nonexistent mental health issues.
Second, as Kansas Reflector columnist Eric Thomas pointed out, Gaggle intercepted the district’s own response to an open records request for records related to Gaggle that Suzana Kennedy, a former student journalist at LHS and another of the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit, made in the fall of 2024.  As the weeks dragged on without a response from the district, Kennedy learned, as set forth in the lawsuit, that unknown to the district “Gaggle is preventing (Kennedy) from receiving” emails containing records responsive to the KORA “because of the nature of the words in the data (Kennedy) requested.”
In other words, Gaggle swung into action to censor student expression that had no bearing whatsoever on student safety, without the district’s knowledge or express say-so. In so doing, Gaggle prevented public disclosure of crucial information about the system itself for weeks if not months. Rather than promote any important government interest, Gaggle actively thwarted the district itself from timely compliance with state law that would have shed light on the software’s functionality.
Finally, the plaintiffs allege in their complaint that “as recently as April 2025, a student’s email to his parents was seized by Gaggle.”
The subsequent sentence in that document is perhaps its most undeniable: “Neither the District nor the Board have articulated any government interest that would ever be served by seizing and blocking communications between students and their parents.”
The three instances described here may be rather innocuous in comparison to the most explosive allegations in the lawsuit. But they starkly illustrate the district’s commitment to implement Gaggle whether student safety was at risk or not.
That doesn’t make sense.

(Photo by Jane Norman/States Newsroom)When Gov. Mike DeWine decided to send Ohio National Guard members to Washington D.C. to participate in President Trump’s militarized crime crackdown, he took a national issue and made it a state issue. Why he decided to do so is perplexing.
Ohio’s violent crime rate has hovered between three and four times the violent crime rate of D.C. over the past four years. So the idea that resources should be sent from Ohio to Washington to quell violent urban crime is a strange one.
But even if DeWine were to deploy national guard troops in Ohio to quell violent crime, is that the way to do it? 
Research out of Brown University finds military policing is not an effective tool for reducing crime rates. 
At best, this sort of approach is a band-aid: long-term military occupation of cities is not a feasible strategy in a democratic country. At worst, it can be a distraction from solutions that actually could reduce crime rates.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
So what actually could reduce crime rates in Ohio? 
The evidence shows there are strategies that can be used to reduce violent crime.
One is a suite of strategies called “focused deterrence.”
Basically this approach amounts to identifying groups like gangs that are responsible for a large share of violence, calling them in and offering services if people leave the gangs, and delivering swift punishment if further violence takes place.
Meta-analysis of dozens of studies on these techniques show they are effective at reducing crime rates.
Another is “hot-spot policing,” a strategy that concentrates resources towards geographic areas where crime occurs most often.
Cost-benefit analysis by the Washington State Institute for Public Policy shows that deployment of one police officer in a hot spot leads to nearly half a million dollars in net social benefits realized in lower property crime rates. 
This amounts to over $5 in social benefits for every $1 in costs.
Ohio National Guard troops to stay longer in D.C., Gov. DeWine says

A third strategy is more mundane but nonetheless effective: street lighting. 
A randomized controlled trial that placed lighting in New York City housing developments found areas that received lighting saw reductions in index crimes, felony crimes, and to a lesser degree, assault, homicide, and weapons crimes when compared to places that did not receive them. 
Similarly, restoration of vacant lots have been found to lead to reductions in overall crime, gun violence, burglaries, and nuisances.
Another promising program is targeted cognitive behavioral therapy.
Whether this is deployed with at-risk youth in conjunction with summer jobs programs or as a part of correctional programs, cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to reduce propensity to commit crime among people who undergo it. 
By giving people control over their own decision-making, they often opt not to take part in criminal activity.
These are just four approaches that are effective at reducing crime. 
If the governor or federal lawmakers wish to make a dent on crime in major cities, deploying these strategies is the way to do it. 
But I guess these would probably get fewer headlines than what they are doing now.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)When state officials froze enrollment in the child care scholarships program in May, to deal with the overwhelming number of families applying for spaces, they said they hoped to have applications reopened by September.
But as September rolls toward October, the program is still frozen and the Maryland State Department of Education has not been able to say when children might start being accepted again, leaving parents and child care providers in the lurch.
That’s a concern for providers such as Carolina Reyes, director of Arco Iris Bilingual Children’s Center in Prince George’s County. Reyes said Thursday that more than half of the 30 children at the center receive a scholarship. For children in Head Start, that runs from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., the money helps pay for before- and after-school care.
With fewer children — her center has a capacity of 47 children — and a limited budget, Reyes said she has been forced to cut hours for two teacher aides, and her staff will decrease from eight to seven this week when a prekindergarten teacher moves to Charles County.
“Me and my assistant director will have to go back in the classroom,” Reyes said. “I don’t think that I have been in a situation like this … that’s not a pandemic. I am hopeful things will change.”

Reyes and other providers received an update during a town hall Wednesday night from state officials, but they were not able to say when the enrollment freeze would melt away.
“That is something that we are not prepared to determine,” said Sarah Neville-Morgan, assistant state superintendent in the state Department of Education’s Division of Early Childhood.
“We will be working with the governor’s office, Department of Budget and Management and the General Assembly and need to walk through some of the data with all of them and make sure that we’re all in agreement as we look at that surge and the other data,” Neville-Morgan said.
When they froze enrollment in May, state officials said the goal was to lower the number of scholarship from 45,000 to 40,000, but the number of children enrolled has not budged.
While enrollment has been capped, people have been allowed to apply and been put on a waiting list. At least 2,000 people are currently on that list.
There are exceptions based on certain income guidelines and other eligibility requirements, such as families receiving temporary cash assistance (TCA), supplemental security income (SSI) or having a sibling already enrolled in the program.
Enrollment ballooned after the state expanded income eligibility for the program. As a result, spending on child care scholarships rose from $295 million in fiscal 2023 to $414 million the following year, and continued climbing to $539 million in fiscal 2025.
The number of child care providers has also increased, from 2,500 in July 2022 to more than 3,700 in July of this year.
“While our federal dollars have decreased now that we don’t have all of the COVID relief dollars anymore, we are seeing our state not just maintain what they put in, but have grown through significant historic increases,” Neville-Morgan said.
Chris Peusch praised the state for its investments in the child care scholarship program, but said more is needed.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Obviously there’s a need and it’s not enough,” said Peusch, executive director of the Maryland State Child Care Association. “What do we do about it? What do we do this legislative session? What are our innovative solutions to making sure parents can go to work?
“Child care and early childhood [are] connected to the economy. We have to remember that,” Peusch said.
Brittany Thorp, who handles administrative duties for three family-owned child care centers in Montgomery County, said none are full right now. In order to help sustain one of the two Dee Dee’s Place Child Care Center’s in the county, Thorp said parents can enroll their infant children on a part-time schedule.
“We historically have told people to take a full-time schedule, but we just need spots filled,” she said. “It’s an interesting time that we’re in.”
Thorp and Reyes said during this time of year, when school resumes, children will enter kindergarten, decreasing the enrollment of children at some centers that offer kindergarten. But without the child care scholarships for parents to utilize and fill the slots left behind by children who don’t return, there’s a fear that could cause some centers to close their doors.
“Could definitely shut down,” Reyes said. “Families need the child care scholarship not only for their children to receive a high-quality education, but also to work. The scholarship is a benefit that helps everyone.”
Another child care information virtual session is scheduled for Sept. 25.In the meantime, State Superintendent Carey Wright had a message Wednesday night for providers.
“Your feedback is critical to this. It’s critical to our decision making. We want your voice to continue to remain central as we refine these processes,” she said. “Because together, we can strengthen Maryland’s early child care system so that every child has the opportunity to thrive and every provider has the stability and support that they deserve.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Arco-child-care-center-9-12-2025-1024x716.jpg,,,2025-09-16 03:57:13.695333

(Photo by Petty Officer 2nd Class Ryan L. Noel/U.S. Coast Guard)The Trump administration officially asked a judge to vacate a crucial federal permit issued for the wind farm proposed off the coast of Ocean City.
The move was expected, originally signaled by Justice Department attorneys in late August, but Friday’s filing provided more details on the government’s justification for reconsidering the project’s “construction and operations plan” that was approved late in President Joe Biden’s (D) presidency.
In the filing, Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam R.F. Gustafson cited a Jan. 20 directive from President Donald Trump (R) that ordered a review of all federally permitted wind projects, in addition to halting the issuance of new permits.
The government argued it did not adequately consider the impacts of the Ocean City project — to be developed by US Wind — on commercial fisheries and potential search-and-rescue efforts in the area.
The Ocean City filing comes amid a broader assault in wind energy by the Trump administration. Just last week, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said at an energy conference in Italy that, “Under this administration, there is not a future for offshore wind because it is too expensive and not reliable enough.”
US Wind is likely to push back hard to defend its project, which proposes building up to 121 wind turbines about 10 nautical miles from the Ocean City beach, enough to power more than 718,000 homes, according to government documents.
US Wind: Trump has plans to ‘kill outright offshore wind projects’

In a statement Friday, Liz Burdock, CEO of the Oceantic Network, an offshore wind industry group, argued that the federal government is unfairly targeting previously approved projects.
“The unlawful actions by the Trump administration against fully permitted offshore wind projects up and down the East Coast represent one of the largest, economically devastating assaults on U.S. workers, businesses, and energy in decades,” Burdock said. “Revoking a permit on an approved project after years of thorough agency review will raise electricity prices for families, jeopardize private investment, delay economic growth, and weaken our power grid.”
She argued that the US Wind project was already drawing investment to the region even though construction has yet to begin, including by attracting a new steel manufacturing facility to Baltimore County’s Tradepoint Atlantic. The federal government withdrew a $47.4 million grant in August that would have bolstered that facility. US Wind officials said the project would move ahead regardless.
The wind project has drawn support from Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) and Democrats in Annapolis. But it has a passionate opponent in the Town of Ocean City. Town leaders support the Justice Department’s request, according to legal filings.
After Biden’s Interior Department approved US Wind’s construction and operations plan, the town filed suit in the U.S. District Court of Baltimore. Now, the federal government wants to reconsider the approval — and that could render Ocean City’s complaints moot.
“Following remand, BOEM [Bureau of Ocean Energy Management] will issue a new decision with new analysis that may significantly impact, or outright moot, Plaintiffs’ claims,” read Friday’s filing from Justice.
The federal government argued that it has broad authority to reconsider permits it believes were issued in error. Its filing cited cited Trump’s memorandum, issued on his first day in office, ordering the Interior secretary to “conduct a comprehensive review of the ecological, economic, and environmental necessity of terminating or amending any existing wind energy leases, identifying any legal bases for such removal, and submit a report with recommendations to the President.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In a prior filing, US Wind had argued that a remand — before the court has had a chance to consider the merits of the permit and Ocean City’s complaints — would be unwarranted.
“Federal Defendants have abruptly reversed their past defense of their own final decisions approving the Project, abandoning their prior litigation position” on a “vague premise,” read the early September filing from US Wind attorneys.
In addition to remanding the permit back to the agency for reconsideration, the Justice Department asked the judge to vacate the Biden-era permit, rather than leaving it in effect.
Justice Department attorneys argued that a reevaluation of the permit wouldn’t impact US Wind, citing the company’s previous comments that it didn’t intend to begin onshore construction until at least 2026, followed by offshore construction.
They added that the project is still missing a “key local approval” from Delaware’s Sussex County, and that Ocean City has also challenged an air pollution permit issued to the wind farm by the Maryland Department of the Environment.
“Because there would be no construction delay, remand and re-evaluation, standing alone, does not prejudice US Wind,” the Justice Department argued in its filing.
If the old permit is vacated, the department argued that Ocean City’s litigation should be dismissed. But if it remains in effect during the reevaluation, the case should be stayed, DOJ argued.
“Absent a stay, Federal Defendants would be forced to expend limited agency resources on litigating the merits of agency decisions that address the anticipated impacts of construction and operations that are being reconsidered and thus may not ever occur as now envisioned,” read the Friday filing.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/8082891-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-09-16 03:57:13.695333

According to documents filed in Baltimore County Circuit Court, Capt. Astarte Hunt attended classes at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County from January to May 2025. During that time, she was assigned as an officer at Spring Grove Hospital, located in Catonsville near the university.
Prosecutors allege that Hunt, a nine-year veteran of the department who earns $120,140 annually, attended two psychology classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays in the spring semester, during hours that she was supposed to be working. Hunt is accused of falsifying time sheets and claiming she was working when she was attending those classes.
She faces one count of misconduct in office for attending those classes while providing timecards that said she was working the hours she was in class. She is also charged with theft related to the more than $5,100 in pay she received due to falsifying those timecards.
Hunt is also charged with misconduct in office related to allegations of misuse of a state-owned vehicle. Prosecutors said she used a state-owned vehicle to attend classes at the college campus. Additionally, they say she used the vehicle for “personal reasons” on weekends when she was not working.
Prosecutors allege she falsified mileage logs to hide the unauthorized use and make it appear as though it was related to her official duties.
No attorney was listed in online court records for Hunt. She is scheduled for an initial appearance on Oct. 14.

Voting YES is not a simple question of taxes or finances, but more about the health of Wethersfield students.

Ben Baldwin
I am writing to highlight the evidence-based benefits of new school construction – long-term student health, well-being, and success. Environmental factors are a major determinant of health and productivity, and our students are currently subjected to poor environments in the elementary schools. The below data, I hope, will shine light on how voting yes will positively impact our children.
Poor air quality, for example, can be physically detrimental and distracting for students. A UC-Berkeley study found that poor ventilation (1,000ppm increase in indoor CO2) was associated with a 4-5% drop in student attendance due to asthma or sickness. Conversely, research from the California Policy Lab found that students in newly constructed schools attend four more days per year, showing how better buildings keep kids in class. The physical benefits are matched with improved performance. Research shows that students solved arithmetic tasks 13% faster and scored 16% higher when classrooms had better air circulation.


More daylight exposure means a better circadian rhythm and higher cortisol levels, which help toward a more productive student body. In a study of over 20,000 students, those in classrooms with more daylight progressed 20% faster in math, and 26% faster in reading during one school year.
Air quality and lighting are two examples of new construction benefits, but there are plenty more with data to support. Think about acoustics/noise control, thermal comfort (HVAC), mold prevention, and general cleanliness. When it’s all put together, there are statistically significant improvements in student outcomes that go beyond the financial variable. I encourage readers to do independent research on these less-talked-about but critical cornerstones to better education.
The longer the Wethersfield people remain idle on this, the longer the children will not realize all of the benefits that go along with new school construction and renovation. Vote yes on September 16.

That “crazy sense of values” has been mirrored in Donald Trump’s rhetoric, politics, and policies, evident in Trump’s reposting of the following meme: “January 6th will go down in history as the day the government staged a riot to cover up the fact that they certified a fraudulent election.”  
To pretzel this bold faced lie into the shape of the truth, Trump has pardoned convicted, violent criminals, whom he absurdly described as “hostages” and “patriots,” after they had assaulted police, vandalized the Capitol and interfered with the lawful transition of power.  In true Bizarro fashion, Trump also declared the violent and deadly riot as “a day of love.”
This subversion of values reminded me of a Bizarro episode when Superman generously repaired the broken-down homes of the Bizarro people only to be arrested and “convicted for behaving like good, decent folks!” And just as Superman was criminally convicted of repairing people’s broken-down houses, the January 6th Committee members, who attempted to repair the damage done to the People’s House, found themselves under criminal investigation for investigating the Capitol attack.  In the name of law and order, Trump perversely promotes crime and chaos.
In another Bizarro World episode, a mayor appoints a Bizarro detective to investigate a crime “because you are stupider than the entire Bizarro police force put together.”  This ironic qualification for law enforcement leadership seems to correspond well with Trump’s rationale in choosing inexperienced, incompetent, misinformed, and dangerous persons to his administration.
In the ironic name of “merit,” he chose to lead The Department of Health, a vaccine denier and science skeptic; for FBI Director, a conspiracy theorist who wants not only to investigate FBI agents that investigated the January 6th riots but also to shut down the FBI altogether; for Secretary of the Department of Education, a multi-millionaire who never taught a class and wants to privatize public education and to shut down the Department of Education; as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, a businessman that fired federal workers and civil servants who ensure the government continues both to function for the American people and to operate within the law; and as head of “election integrity” at the Department of Homeland Security, a 2020 election denier who spread disinformation to undermine Biden’s legitimate victory. 
In short, Trump’s Bizarro-like idea of meritocracy amounts to a patronage system of blatant incompetency.
In further opposition to reason, fact, and science, Trump considers climate change a hoax, despite the torrent of deadly wildfires, lengthy droughts, increased flooding, frequent tornados, stronger hurricanes, and the highest recorded temperatures in history.  His Bizarro response to climate catastrophes is to “drill baby drill” for more fossil fuels whose burning will only increase the magnitude of these calamities.  Rather than trying to solve the problem, he’s chosen to exacerbate it, by firing EPA employees working to reduce air pollution and to enforce environmental laws. Trump’s response to climate change amounts to Bizarro World firemen spraying  gasoline on burning homes.
As for Trump’s destruction of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion programs, I suppose it makes Bizarro sense to believe that white males, not minorities, are present victims, rather than the long-term benefactors of 250 years of racial and gender discrimination.  By such backward thinking, Trump revoked the Equal Employment Opportunity order signed in 1965 by then-President Lyndon B. Johnson and ordered federal workers to report colleagues seeking to continue DEI programs.  Rather than enforcing equal opportunity under the law, he’ll facilitate further inequality and injustice.
And to ensure our children have a Bizarro education, Trump insists they must be kept ignorant about America’s racist past and its impact on our present society.  Not only does he wish to eliminate The Department of Education, but he wants no federal funds supporting public education that fosters free speech, critical thinking, and accurate history, all of which Trump contrarily calls “radical indoctrination.”  
His campaign to “restore truth and sanity to American History” is to whitewash the historical record with lies of omission.  Complaining the Smithsonian museums focus too much on “how bad slavery was,” the President instead wants to “celebrate American exceptionalism, [and] “remove divisive or partisan narratives.”  Trump’s Bizarro view of American history amounts to jingoistic propaganda devoid of critical facts.
And as for Trump’s vaunted business acumen, like the Bizarro salesman selling bonds “guaranteed to lose money for you,” Trump is slapping tariffs on trading partners and adversaries, guaranteed to increase inflation and cost consumers more money.
Overall Trump’s second term seems nothing short of an attempt not only to rewrite history but to overturn reality.  As an Earthling, I’m finding it truly bizarre.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)MULLEN, Neb. — Former banker Sarah Hardin took a nontraditional path to becoming a teacher in Mullen, beginning in 2007, where she has taught science, math, agriculture and physical education.
On Monday, the Nebraska Department of Education honored the Mullen High School science teacher as the 2026 Nebraska Teacher of the Year.
Hardin told reporters she was “shocked” when she was nominated, “shocked” when she was named one of four finalists and “even more surprised today,” when the Education Department surprised her in her Sandhills classroom with the honor.
“I know there’s some amazing educators, even in our building, and so I’m just really surprised that I’m even in this position right now,” Hardin said Monday.

Hardin’s husband was also in attendance as Nebraska Education Commissioner Brian Maher gifted Hardin a marble apple, a tradition symbolic of the annual honor. 
Maher praised Hardin’s hands-on learning and striving to make learning fun.
“She believes in you, and she has a strong belief in the students in Mullen and the students that she has the honor of teaching,” Maher said.
The other three finalists in addition to Hardin this year were Lori Pflaster of Sandoz Elementary in Lexington, Katie Czerwiec of Beveridge Middle School in Omaha and Keairra Watson of King Elementary in Omaha.
Hardin and her fellow finalists — Pflaster, Czerwiec and Watson — will be honored by the Nebraska State Board of Education at a December reception.
Teaching vision
Hardin is president of her local education association that represents local teachers and a volunteer EMT. A panel of Nebraska educators annually screens and selects a teacher each year to represent Nebraska on the national stage. The honoree participates in a yearlong commitment away from the classroom, representing the Cornhusker State from Washington, D.C. to Nebraska teaching colleges and also attending NASA Space Camp in Huntsville, Alabama.
Hardin also will throw her name in the ring for the National Teacher of the Year honor this fall and will give four updates to the Nebraska State Board of Education in 2026. Board President Elizabeth Tegtmeier of North Platte, whose district includes Mullen, joined Monday’s celebration.
“I believe it is our job as educators to tap into our students’ passions and design lessons that make those subjects relevant and meaningful,” Hardin wrote in her application for the statewide role. “Science education should be active, fun and will empower students of all backgrounds to see themselves as thinkers, creators and problem solvers.”
A nontraditional path
It was about 19 years ago that the Mullen Public Schools superintendent knocked on the Hardin household door one Sunday and said, “Hey, we’re short a science teacher, and we can’t find anybody.”

Hardin, who at the time was a banker, and her husband both have science degrees, and Hardin’s husband who had answered the door informed the superintendent of his wife’s degree.
Hardin said that while she never wanted to be a teacher, she had always liked working with kids and did several community-related projects with children in Mullen.
“I kind of took a leap,” Hardin reflected. She said she took a pay cut but “just decided I missed science, and I’m passionate about science.”
Hardin went through a transition to teaching program through the University of Nebraska at Kearney, a program she said Mullen has benefited from with multiple educators. While she didn’t have any teaching experience, she was handed the keys to her own classroom. 
Other Mullen educators uplifted Hardin, which she said contributed to her success. 
Igniting curiosity
On Monday, Hardin led a class of four seniors to review forms of energy they had previously learned about so they could soon create their own Rube Goldberg machines, a series of simple items that together form a complicated contraption, usually to finish a simple task.
In other Hardin-led lessons, students have dissected owl pellets or built cardboard boats and set them sailing in a nearby pond. She is also leading the development of a geothermal greenhouse for Mullen High to engage with real-world issues.

Hardin said she wants students and teachers to be excited about learning. She said learning must go beyond memorizing facts and formulas and instead spark curiosity, encourage hands-on exploration and connect with students’ experiences and interests.
“My role is to ignite that curiosity, guide discovery and make sure every student sees themselves as capable of deep understanding and innovation,” Hardin wrote in her application.
‘A good person’
The seniors in Hardin’s class Monday said their teacher is very nice and has accomplished her vision with fun projects. Of the four, all but one are taking a trio of courses with Hardin this fall.
“She’s very considerate, not just to the kids in the classroom,” said Sydnee Cheever.
“I see her as a good person,” added Tate Kvanvig.

Hardin is also involved in the STEM club with the local elementary school, which Hardin helped start about 10 years ago after noticing a decline in the amount of time that young students could spend on science and technology and wanting to introduce younger students to science sooner.
Mullen now has large enough classes to support about 50 children at those clubs, with the first meeting of the year hosting about 28. Some students skip youth sports practices to join.
“We’re pretty proud of the fact that they get excited to come do more schoolwork after school,” Hardin said.
Every March, the district also hosts a “STEM family night” to invite K-12 students and families to participate in STEM stations, which Hardin said has students asking year-round, “When is that family thing?”
‘Give her all our best’
Mike Kvanvig, the principal of Mullen High School, said he was really excited to learn Hardin had been selected as a finalist and knew she had a “great shot” for the statewide honor as an “outstanding” member of his staff.
“There’s quality all over the state, and it’s good representation for small schools like this to have somebody get in there,” Kvanvig said.
Mullen has about 500 residents. Mullen High had 45 students during the 2024-25 school year.

Kvanvig said he came to Mullen High about a year or two after Hardin and could tell right away “she just had that factor that made her stand out.” That includes keeping students interested through her lessons and setting high expectations. He added she is probably one of the strictest teachers in his building but earns student respect.
“Great management skills, always striving to get better every year, continuing to go to professional development and always looking for new things for the kids,” Kvanvig said.
Hardin doesn’t wait for issues to fester, he added. She speaks up immediately.
“If anybody ever had a shot at the National Teacher of the Year, I think it’s Sarah Hardin,” Kvanvig said. “We’re going to support her and give her all our best for that, and hopefully we’ll have Nebraska’s first National Teacher of the Year.”
‘Who you teach’
Hardin said among her goals as Nebraska’s representative is to draw public attention to the importance of teacher retention and highlight the importance of understanding community, in and out of the classroom.
“If you don’t know about your kids and try to talk to them about things that are happening, but also be involved in what’s happening in your school community and in the larger community, I think you’re kind of disconnected with them,” Hardin said.
“Even though I might be here a little later than I want to every day, I think that’s a really important piece to take part in to understand who you teach.”

Speaking at a virtual forum focused on Virginians with disabilities, Earle-Sears[...]","Gubernatorial candidates Democrat Abigail Spanberger (left) and Republican Winsome Earle-Sears (right) at separate events in August 2025. (Photos by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia MercuryVirginia Republican gubernatorial hopeful Winsome Earle-Sears downplayed possible cuts to health care caused by President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” Monday evening in a rare face-off with her rival, Democrat Abigail Spanberger, ahead of this fall’s statewide elections.
Speaking at a virtual forum focused on Virginians with disabilities, Earle-Sears said the new law’s negative impacts on patients and hospitals were overstated and argued the state had sufficient reserves to weather any problems.
“We’re not trying to make anyone’s life any harder,”  the former Marine and business owner said. Earle-Sears currently serves as the state’s lieutenant governor. 
Spanberger, a former CIA intelligence officer and Congressional representative, called the bill “catastrophic” and accused the lieutenant governor of ignoring the bill’s impacts in Virginia.
“We can only fix or address or try to mitigate the harms of problems we are willing to admit,” she said.
The forum, hosted by disability advocacy nonprofit Arc of Virginia and other groups, marked the first and possibly only time during the campaign that all six candidates for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general appeared at the same event. Early voting in the races begins Friday.
Democrats hold an edge in most polling of the races, but the contests show tightening margins. A Virginia Commonwealth University poll released last week showed Spanberger with a 9-point lead over Earle-Sears among registered voters, down 3 percentage points since earlier this summer. The September VCU poll found Democrat attorney general nominee Jay Jones leads Republican incumbent Jason Miyares by a 6 percentage point margin, while Democratic lieutenant governor hopeful Ghazala Hashmi holds a 4-point edge over Republican John Reid.
The candidates addressed questions on topics ranging from voting rights to housing in two- minute segments that avoided fireworks or direct conflict.  
Earle-Sears cast doubt on Spanberger’s warnings that the giant reconciliation bill, which Trump signed into law on July 4, would cost Virginia hospitals $26 billion. The lieutenant governor noted that the total came across 14 years —“that’s how they came up with such a large number,” Earle-Sears said. 
The Republican said she would create a new “one stop shop for all things Medicaid,” including adding case workers to help people with disabilities navigate new work requirements required by the federal law.
On the record: Winsome Earle-Sears

“I think the last thing you want to do when you’re trying to find help is to have to go through a lot of hoops,” Earle-Sears said.
But Democrats and many independent analysts, including the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, have said the new law creates myriad rules that will effectively reduce Medicaid enrollment, pointing to recent examples in Georgia and Arkansas. 
The two candidates gave differing answers on whether they would reverse Virginia’s permanent  disenfranchisement of all people convicted of felonies. Virginia is the only state with such a rule that can only be reversed on a case-by-case basis by the governor, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Earle-Sears stopped short of endorsing a proposed state constitutional amendment that would allow people convicted of felonies to vote after serving their prison sentences. 
“I’m looking for second chances,” Earle-Sears said, citing her work as director of a prison ministry and homeless shelter. “But I am not for maybe rapists, pedophiles — certain felonies. I don’t think we’re going to look kindly on that. Now, other felonies for sure we will take a look at.”
Spanberger endorsed Virginia Democrats’ proposed amendment, which the legislature is set to vote on for a second time next year before potentially heading to voters in November 2026.
On the record: Abigail Spanberger

Earle-Sears and Miyares trumpeted their work in office alongside Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who is limited to a single consecutive term by Virginia’s constitution, on initiatives like Right Help Right Now, a bipartisan plan that aims to quickly deploy mental health services to people in crisis. Miyares also took credit for declining crime rates and overdose deaths.
“I’m going to make your safety as a Virginia my top priority because no Virginia should ever be looking over their shoulder in fear,” Miyares said.
Trump’s policies surfaced a number of times, usually at the prompting of the trio of Democrats. Jones said he foresaw a heavier role for Virginia’s attorney general, saying Trump had gutted federal oversight of civil rights, consumer protection and public health.
“Virginia will have to step in where the Trump administration refuses to protect our citizens,” he said.

Hashmi and Jones warned that Trump’s move to shut down the U.S. Department of Education threatened the office’s investigations of allegations of discrimination. Hashmi said she was working with stakeholders from the disability community on legislation that would address the federal changes, although she did not provide details. 
Miyares predicted federal enforcement of the Individuals with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 would be transferred to the U.S. Department of Justice.
“I’m confident there’s still going to be a heavy robust role in the federal government to make sure that Section 504 plans remain robust and protected,” he said.
Other elements of the forum had a less partisan tinge.
Both Reid and Hashmi said they would focus attention on making sure the needs of people with disabilities were front and center in disaster planning. 
“As lieutenant governor, I will not be putting in legislation, but you can count on me to use the gavel and the bully pulpit — something that I’m pretty adept at — to try to draw attention to the issues that you care about,” said Reid, a conservative talk radio host and former TV reporter.
Both gubernatorial hopefuls agreed on the need to create more housing. Spanberger argued in favor of an extension of a pilot eviction prevention program and a bolstering of state affordable housing funds. Earle-Sears said she would work to cut red tape to incentivize development and said the eviction diversion pilot would discourage landlords from renting out homes.
The candidates for attorney general are set to meet in a Oct. 16 debate hosted by the Virginia State Bar. Reid and Hashmi have yet to schedule a debate, with Reid accusing his rival of turning down repeated offers to meet on stage. Spanberger and Earle-Sears will meet again on the debate stage at Norfolk State University on Oct. 9, their only head-to-head match up on the books before Election Day.

Kennedy Jr. and the Trump administration, Gov. Tony Evers signed an executive order Monday that is aimed at protecting access to vaccines in Wisconsin. 
“Vaccines save lives, folks. Spreading fear, distrust, and disinformation about safe and effective vaccines isn’t just reckless, it’s dangerous,” Evers said in a statement. “RFK and the Trump administration are inserting partisan politics into healthcare and the science-based decisions of medical professionals and are putting the health and lives of kids, families, and folks across our state at risk in the process.”
Kennedy in his role as the health secretary has taken aim at vaccines, including the COVID-19 vaccine. This week, a CDC committee with new members appointed by Kennedy who are skeptical of vaccines is expected to consider softening or eliminating some recommendations for the COVID-19 vaccine and some childhood immunizations. 
“Here in Wisconsin, we will continue to follow the science to ensure Wisconsinites have access to the healthcare they need when and where they need it to make their own healthcare decisions that are right for them,” Evers said. 
The order directs the state Department of Health Services to take several steps towards protecting access including monitoring and reviewing immunization recommendations, issuing guidance on the COVID-19 vaccine, determining additional measures that may be necessary to provide clarity and guidance on other routine vaccines.
The Office of the Commissioner of Insurance is also directed under the order to collaborate with health plans to make sure people have accurate, up-to-date information on access to vaccines and to help limit the costs of vaccines and to direct health insurers within their regulatory authority to provide coverage for the COVID-19 vaccine without cost-sharing.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Members of the Iowa DOGE task force shared more details about recommended changes to the Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System and teacher pay at their final meeting Monday before submitting a report to Gov. Kim Reynolds and state lawmakers.
The task force, convened by Reynolds in February via executive order, was given 180 days to provide recommendations as to how Iowa’s state and local governments can be more efficient. The initiative, announced earlier in 2025, is based on the federal government’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which was initially headed by billionaire Elon Musk.
The Monday meeting was the final convening of the task force before they submit recommendations to the governor and state legislators. However, the task force still has two weeks, until Sept. 29, to officially submit its final report.
Emily Schmitt, general counsel for Sukup Manufacturing Co. who is leading the task force, said the business and industry leaders on the task force have taken on a “huge lift” in reviewing governmental entities and crafting recommendations. While she said she understood are some recommendations that many Iowans do not agree with, Schmitt asked for a continued “respectful” dialogue on the proposals.
“We all are here about the same thing, no matter what (side of the) aisle you’re on, no matter what outlet, whether what group you’re with, we all want a strong Iowa,” Schmitt said. “… And we can only do that if we’re all working together, and that work together means to discuss some hard things, too.”
Much of the public pushback came following the August DOGE task force meeting and focused on two recommendations — one suggesting that IPERS, the benefits program for public employees, would move to a defined contribution system for new hires, and another recommending a “pay-for-performance system” that would award teachers based on student achievement.
Terry Lutz, chairman of McClure Engineering Co. and former mayor of Fort Dodge who led the task force’s “return-on-investment” group, apologized at the Monday meeting, “as it seems some of my comments from the last time we met were not clear, and have led to misinterpretation and undue concern from our valued educators and other public sector employees.”
Lutz said there were false claims that the work group was recommending taking IPERS away from current public employees, or that public employee pay or health care benefits would be reduced. He said the task force would “never recommend anything that would jeopardize solvency of our pension benefits” — but did say the work group would recommend looking at some changes to benefits.
He said the updated recommendation is for the state to conduct an ongoing study to “benchmark and optimize the total rewards package for public sector employees.” This study could include an analysis of a defined contribution plan, Lutz said.
If a defined contribution plan — where both the employer and employee contributes to a retirement benefit plan — is deemed viable, Lutz said the task force would recommend “giving employees a choice” as to whether to pursue that option or stay with IPERS.
“We believe giving public employees a choice is better, and can help attract and retain talent,” Lutz said. “We recognize any changes to a compensation model would likely take years to implement, but if it does, that’s okay. Our state’s going to be around for a long time.”
Public sector worker organizations have criticized the suggestion of introducing a defined contribution model, saying this change could jeopardize the sustainability of IPERS, even if some employees are grandfathered into the system.
Lutz also said his comments introducing a “pay-for-performance system” tying schoolteacher and administrator compensation to student performance metrics were misconstrued. He said this suggestion would not cut teacher pay, but instead increase teacher pay by providing up to 10% of base pay through bonuses for teachers that meet certain student achievement benchmarks.
“The goal is straightforward, to increase our students’ achievement and reward those who are making it happen,” Lutz said. “Other states are figuring out how to do this, and it is improving their student outcomes.”
Iowa State Education Association President Joshua Brown said Monday the updated recommendations do not change the issues brought up by critics when the IPERS and “merit pay” proposals were first discussed.
“The Task Force continues to recommend weakening IPERS by reducing future contributions,” Brown said. “IPERS is a proven driver of local economies, with one in 10 Iowans benefiting from their contributions to the system. It is a fair and equitable system that has proven to be a powerful tool for attracting new employees. … We all heard correctly the first time the Task Force announced it would interfere with IPERS and propose another disastrous system for public educators.”
Other recommendations discussed include consolidating and streamlining local government functions, sharing state technology resources with local governments and making it easier for professionals to teach in workforce training programs.
Schmitt thanked members of the task force for their work and said she would compile the recommendations to submit as a final report to Reynolds and legislators by the Sep. 29 deadline. The recommendations will serve as suggestions for state leaders, she said — but will not necessarily become law. She said the next step will be for Iowans to reach out to the governor and their elected officials on the issues.
“It’s up to the elected officials and the governor to take these and put together what they think is right for Iowa and what’s right now,” Schmitt said. “Although we can say that these are the ways that government would operate if it is a business, they might be able to say, like, ‘it might not be now, but maybe in the future.'”
Reynolds thanked Schmitt and other members of the task force a statement Monday for their work, saying the effort will help state government better serve Iowans.
“Private sector businesses often lead innovation, and we can learn from their example,” Reynolds said. “When government adopts a similar mindset, it can better adapt to changing needs.

Kopsky's organization is a member of Protect AR Rights. (Sonny Albarado/Arkansas Advocate)Two Arkansas civic action groups will kick off a town hall tour Tuesday in Little Rock to promote a direct democracy ballot initiative their coalition hopes to put on the 2026 ballot, according to a news release.
The event, to be held at First United Methodist Church of Little Rock at 6 p.m., will feature a panel from the Arkansas Public Policy Panel and Citizens First Congress to answer questions about the ballot measures.
Three other town halls are planned — Fort Smith on Sept. 23, Conway on Oct. 14 and Clinton on Nov. 4.
The coalition is looking to roll back 13 laws targeting Arkansas’ direct democracy process that passed during the 2025 legislative session. The laws generally imposed more requirements on ballot committees trying to put issues to voters at the ballot box.
While proponents of the legislation have said the changes are necessary to safeguard the direct democracy process, Protect AR Rights and other organizations opposed to the laws say they are overly restrictive and interfere with citizens’ rights.
Those news laws have already posed obstacles to those wishing to roll them back — specifically Act 602 of 2025, which prohibits the attorney general from certifying a ballot title if it is above an eighth grade reading level. Protect AR Rights — one of two organizations with approved ballot titles relating to the direct democracy laws — had its title certified in July after two previous rejections.
As opposed to lawmaking by elected officials, the direct democracy process allows Arkansas citizens to propose new laws or constitutional amendments and place them on the ballot for a statewide vote. It also allows citizens to attempt to repeal legislation by the same process. Arkansas is one of 24 states that allow citizen-led initiatives, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Protect AR Rights’ proposed ballot measure would repeal several changes made during the session by explicitly prohibiting Arkansas legislators from amending or repealing a constitutional amendment approved by voters, requiring voters to be notified if their petition signature will be disqualified and given an opportunity to correct any problems, and requiring signatures to be gathered from at least 15 counties instead of 50.
In order for an organization to put its proposed legislation or constitutional amendment to voters, it must have its ballot title certified by the attorney general, who determines whether the title meets the requirements stipulated in the state constitution and state law. Once the title is certified, ballot committees must gather a certain number of signatures in order for the measure to appear on the ballot.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kopsky-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-15 20:56:48.252916

On Monday, the National Weather Service issued a flood warning for Juneau’s Mendenhall Valley after river and lake measurements showed signs of another major release of water from Suicide Basin, an ice-locked lake typically contained by the Mendenhall Glacier.
As of Monday afternoon, the flood was expected to crest between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m. Tuesday morning, just below 12 feet.
If that holds true, it would be less severe than the record inundation that took place in August or the destructive floods that soaked hundreds of homes last year.
Nicole Ferrin, warning coordination meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Juneau said on Monday afternoon, “As of right now, we’re looking at a crest sometime Tuesday morning, between 11 and 12 feet.”
That would be enough to put water into some low-lying homes near the Mendenhall River, but most other nearby homes are protected by temporary flood barriers erected last winter.
The flood in August topped out at a record-breaking 16.65 feet, below the top of the flood barriers.
“In an abundance of caution, we are recommending that folks in the View Drive area evacuate their homes this evening or just spend the night somewhere else again,” said Ryan O’Shaughnessy, the emergency programs manager for the City and Borough of Juneau, referring to the lowest-lying homes near the river. 
“These floods are dynamic. They take a lot of material and change the shape of the river and lake at each event, and our No. 1 priority is always going to be the protection of life and public safety. We really encourage people to not take any chances and folks in that area, please consider spending the night somewhere else,” he said.
The city does not plan to set up an emergency shelter, and it did not send widespread text alerts to all cellphones in the area, as it did in August.
“We do not believe that there is the same risk to life and safety,” O’Shaughnessy said.
This latest flood continues a pattern that has taken place since 2011: A large summer flood is followed by one or more smaller fall floods.
Last year, after the summer flood inundated parts of the Mendenhall Valley, a flood in October crested just below 11 feet.
This month’s flood is “pretty similar” to what happened last year, but recent heavy rain is expected to contribute to higher water.
Forecasters will update their flood predictions late Monday, Ferrin said. A website hosted by the National Weather Service has the latest information.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DSCF7634-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 20:56:48.252916

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — What would have been Oklahoma City’s first public Montessori school is now defunct.
The Oklahoma City Board of Education voted unanimously Monday to rescind its charter contract with Oklahoma Public Montessori Initiative. The rescission is a mutual agreement with the charter school, which failed to complete the necessary steps to open as planned for the 2025-26 academic year.
The Oklahoma City board agreed to authorize the school’s founding contract in November 2023, despite Oklahoma City Public Schools administrators deeming the charter application as “insufficient in a number of areas.”
The charter school would have educated children in pre-K through fourth grade in far northwest Oklahoma City with the Montessori method of education, which is known for student-led, hands-on learning.
The board first considered the possibility of revoking its authorization of the charter school in June when it sent a notice of potential breach of contract. At the time, district staff and school board members expressed alarm at the lack of progress toward opening.
By that time, most of the school’s founding board members had left, according to a district report. The school had not secured a facility, and all of its expenditures were paused on May 2.
After the Oklahoma City board issued its warning, district administrators continued discussions with the school “about what’s best for both entities and what’s best for our students,” said Tony Childers, the district’s general counsel.
“As part of that conversation, the charter school agreed that, really, at this point it’d be best for us to just mutually rescind that agreement,” Childers said. “There wouldn’t be any action necessary in terms of the revocation. We just believed that would be best for the students, for us at this point to cut our ties.”

Nothing in the agreement forbids the school’s founders from reapplying for charter authorization in the future, Childers confirmed.
The head of the charter school’s board, Rico Smith, did not immediately return a request for comment after the rescission vote Monday evening. Bill Hickman, an attorney working with the school, declined to comment.
Although Oklahoma Public Montessori Initiative is no more, other public Montessori programs are opening in the city.
A different Montessori charter school and early childhood center is preparing to open its doors in the 2026-27 academic year. P3 Urban Montessori will enroll 90 students age 3 through kindergarten in the 73111 ZIP code in northeast Oklahoma City.
The Oklahoma City board rejected an application to authorize P3 in the same 2023 meeting that it approved Oklahoma Public Montessori Initiative.

P3’s founders, including Millwood Public Schools Superintendent Cecilia Robinson-Woods and her sister Rosalyn Robinson, later obtained a charter contract with the Statewide Charter School Board.
The Oklahoma City district also started offering Montessori-inspired education this school year. 
After hearing community interest in a Montessori program, Horace Mann Pre-K Center opened two classrooms with that style of instruction, said Stephanie Hinton, the district’s executive director of early childhood. 
Several Montessori private schools operate in the area around Horace Mann, located at Northwest 46th Street and North Western Avenue, and similar programs in Tulsa Public Schools have been popular, she said.
Two teachers at Horace Mann built up the program and completed specialized Montessori training over the summer, along with an assistant principal and the district’s early childhood coordinator, Hinton said.
“I have a feeling it won’t be our only Montessori-inspired program,” she said. “We’re just not quite sure where that expansion is going to lead to just yet.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)The Utah Supreme Court has denied the Legislature’s petition to block a district court judge’s decision that tossed out the state’s 2021 congressional boundaries and ordered a process to draw a new one.
“For the reasons explained below, we deny Legislative Defendants’ petition,” the Utah Supreme Court wrote in a decision issued Monday. 
“Their arguments focus largely on the district court’s remedial process, but they have not appealed from the order putting that process in place,” the order said, adding that instead legislative attorneys challenged 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson’s denial of their motion to pause the court’s injunction that voided the 2021 congressional map. 
“However, their complaints about the remedial process do not demonstrate that the court’s denial of the stay order is legally wrong or that the court otherwise abused its Discretion,” the Utah Supreme Court opinion says. “Without that, they have not shown why they should receive the extraordinary relief they seek here.”
Anti-gerrymandering plaintiffs cite ‘irony’ in Utah lawmakers’ appeal to Utah Supreme Court

Mark Gaber, an attorney with the Campaign Legal Center which is representing the plaintiffs in the anti-gerrymandering lawsuit, celebrated the ruling in a post on X Monday evening. 
“One step closer to a fair congressional map for 2026!” Gaber wrote. 
Better Boundaries’ executive director Elizabeth Rasmussen issued a statement applauding the decision.  
“Further delay would be in direct opposition to the principles of the Utah Constitution. We’re thrilled this process will move forward on the previously agreed-upon timeline, putting fair congressional maps in place by November 10th,” Rasmussen said. “Utahns will now see the standards they voted for put into practice. That means fewer splits of cities and counties, compact and connected districts, preservation of neighborhoods and communities, and a ban on maps designed to give unfair advantage to politicians or parties.”
While Rasmussen acknowledged legislative defendants’ larger appeal is still pending in court, Monday’s “decision keeps the process moving and affirms the principle that voters, not politicians, choose their representatives.”
Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders, House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper and Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, said in a joint statement that “a rushed timeline is not the best approach for determining congressional districts nor for setting public policy.”
“Despite this, the Legislature will move forward to the best of its ability,” Schultz and Adams said. “A committee has been formed, the court’s timeline will be followed and Utahns can provide input on the legislative map at redistricting.utah.gov starting Sept. 25.”
Monday’s decision is the latest development in a complex, yearslong lawsuit that has challenged Utah’s redistricting process. Plaintiffs — the League of Women Voters of Utah, Mormon Women for Ethical Government, and several Salt Lake County voters — have alleged that the state’s current congressional boundaries were blatant gerrymandering after lawmakers unconstitutionally repealed and replaced Better Boundaries’ 2018 ballot initiative that sought to create an independent redistricting commission. 
Last month, Gibson agreed with the latter claim — that the 2021 Utah Legislature violated the Utah Constitution when it passed SB200, a law that turned that independent redistricting commission into an advisory body that lawmakers could ultimately ignore, which is what they did when the GOP-controlled Legislature enacted the 2021 congressional map. 
GOP legislative leaders begrudgingly say they’ll redraw Utah’s congressional map, as court ordered

Gibson ruled that the 2021 map was the result of an unconstitutional process, and ordered it to be “remedied” in time for the 2026 election. 
While the Legislature’s attorneys have continued fighting the ruling in court, Utah’s top Republican legislative leaders have begrudgingly said they will comply with Gibson’s ruling and will convene the Legislature to vote on a new map. 
Meanwhile, both parties in the redistricting lawsuit have agreed on a timeline for the court-ordered process to enact a new map before Nov. 10, which the lieutenant governor’s office has said is the final deadline for a new map so county clerks have time to finalize their voting precincts in time for January, when 2026 candidates can begin filing to run. 
The timeline is as follows, according to court documents: 

Sept. 25: The Utah Legislature will publish its new proposed map. 
Sept. 26 to Oct. 5: Lawmakers will hold a public comment period to take input on the map.
Oct. 6: The Legislature will take a final vote on the map and submit it to the court for consideration. Plaintiffs will also have the same deadline to submit any proposed maps to the judge. 
Oct. 17: The deadline for both parties to file briefs, expert reports, and other materials in support or opposition to map submissions, if necessary. 
Oct. 23 to Oct. 24: The court will hold an evidentiary hearing, if necessary. 
Oct. 28: The deadline for parties to file proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law with the court, if necessary. 
Nov. 10: The latest possible date for the court to select a final map, according to the lieutenant governor’s office. 

Earlier this month, as legislative defendants’ petition made its way through the Utah Supreme Court, Gibson filed an amendment to her previous, Aug. 25 ruling that officially adopted the timeline while also removing the “order” that required the Legislature to “design and enact” a new congressional map in 30 days. 
Utah Supreme Court will consider lawmakers’ appeal against drawing new congressional map

“That ‘order’ failed to recognize the separation of powers between our courts and our legislature and unintentionally failed to respect the Legislature’s authority to determine how to address the Court’s order enjoining H.B. 2004,” Gibson wrote. “This Court overstepped its authority by ordering the Legislature to enact a new congressional plan.”
However, that doesn’t stop the court-ordered process from playing out to draw a new map, which Gibson ruled was the byproduct of an unconstitutional process. While her ruling allows the Legislature to decide whether to submit a map or not, the court still retains jurisdiction over selecting a new map to be used in the 2026 election — whether it’s submitted by lawmakers or by the lawsuit’s plaintiffs. 
Monday’s ruling isn’t the first time the Utah Supreme Court has sided with plaintiffs in the anti-gerrymandering lawsuit. 
Last summer, all five justices on the court issued a unanimous opinion sending the case back to district court, ruling that Gibson had erred when she previously dismissed the claim that the Legislature violated the constitution when it repealed and replaced Better Boundaries’ ballot initiative. That ruling also made clear that the Utah Legislature did not have unfettered power to repeal and replace all types of voter initiatives, but rather must show a “compelling government interest” in order to change “government reform” initiatives.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Planned Parenthood of Montana said it will work with patients who use Medicaid in the state to ensure they can continue to receive health care.
President and CEO Martha Fuller said Monday the organization is focused on keeping its four health centers open despite an estimated reimbursement funding gap of nearly $1 million.
“We are going to have to rely on our communities to step up, and we’ll be focused heavily on fundraising and gaining community support so we can continue to keep those doors open and see those folks,” Fuller said.
The statements from Planned Parenthood of Montana come after a court order last week blocked more than 1.1 million patients from using Medicaid at Planned Parenthood health centers to pay for routine services not related to abortion.
Those centers, including four in Montana, provide care such as family planning, STI testing and treatments, cancer screenings, birth control, breast exams, and other services.
Federal law already blocks Medicaid funding from going toward abortion, albeit with exceptions.
The “big, beautiful” budget bill this year prevented Medicaid funds from covering other care at organizations that provide abortions and receive more than $800,000 in reimbursements in a year — or Planned Parenthood.
Planned Parenthood sued in federal district court in Massachusetts over the provision.
Thursday, a three-judge panel from the U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals overturned a lower court decision to temporarily block that part of the law.
The order means the law can take effect while the case continues.
The brief order did not offer an explanation but said the defendants, the the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, “met their burden to show their entitlement” to stop the previous court decisions.
In a statement, Fuller said the ruling amounts to a decision to “defund” Planned Parenthood as the case plays out.
Planned Parenthood said at least 200 of its health centers are at risk of closure across the country as a result of the order. In Montana, the organization operates in Lewis and Clark, Cascade, Missoula and Yellowstone counties.
In an interview with the Daily Montanan, Fuller said Planned Parenthood of Montana is doing everything it can to keep its health centers open in the state.
“That is our No. 1 priority,” Fuller said.
Fuller said health centers are working with patients to find out if they qualify for discounted services through Title X, a federal family planning grant program, or if there is another Medicaid provider they could see.
“They’re really hard conversations, and they’re happening now every day in our health centers,” Fuller said.
She said Title X does not cover some services, including abortion care or gender-affirming care, for patients who are transgender.
Planned Parenthood of Montana said it has been part of the health care system in Montana for more than 56 years.
Roughly one third of the 10,000 patients who receive care at Planned Parenthood centers in Montana use Medicaid.
Planned Parenthood health centers already have talked with patients who are concerned about the lack of Medicaid coverage for services, Fuller said.
That’s because since the federal bill was signed, Planned Parenthood has seen one day, and then later one week, where it wasn’t able to bill Medicaid as the lawsuit unfolded.
“This time, we’re going to be in this situation for a longer period,” Fuller said.
She said Montana already has vast areas that don’t have access to family planning, abortion care, gender-affirming care, or even primary care services.
But the health centers don’t turn people away, she said, and some have had relationships with providers for five years, sometimes 20 years.
“This fight is not over — we will work with every patient to get them the affordable care they need and continue to push for everyone’s freedom to get high-quality care at the trusted provider of their choice — including at Planned Parenthood health centers,” Fuller said in a statement. “No matter what, personal medical decisions should be between a patient and their provider.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/GettyImages-1312832687.jpg,,,2025-09-15 20:56:48.252916

Lighthiser v. Trump
The Daily Montanan will be following the hearings this week in federal court in Missoula. To catch our stories, subscribe to the Treasure State Update, our weekday newsletter, here.
Read about the lawsuit here, and about Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen’s desire to dismiss it here.


Their victory in Held v. Montana, later upheld by the state Supreme Court, resounded across the country, showing that young people have a stake in the issue of climate change, advocates say. Yet, state policies to address the causes of climate change in Montana — home to large coal, oil, and natural gas deposits — haven’t changed in the wake of the case.
This week, some of those plaintiffs are scheduled to appear in federal court to request that U.S. District Judge Dana Christensen block a series of President Donald Trump’s executive orders on energy issues. They argue the orders violate their Fifth Amendment rights and will cause nearly 200,000 additional deaths over the next 25 years and lead to more heart, respiratory, and other health problems. They are joined by other plaintiffs ages 7 to 24 from California, Florida, Hawaii, and Oregon, and are backed by the climate-focused nonprofit Our Children’s Trust.
“Trump’s fossil fuel orders are a death sentence for my generation,” Eva Lighthiser, a 19-year-old resident of Livingston wrote in the complaint filed on May 29. “I am not suing because I want to, I am suing because I have to. My health, my future and my right to speak the truth are all on the line.”
She added that a warming climate has led to an increase in summer wildfire smoke and contributed to the flooding of the Yellowstone River (a warmer atmosphere holds more precipitation). At the heart of the case, Lighthiser v. Trump, is the claim that young people are being denied their Fifth Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution — life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness — because of the health effects of fossil fuel development and climate change. And they say the Montana Supreme Court’s decision in December to uphold their right to a clean and healthful environment buttresses their claim.

Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen, a Republican, along with 18 other states and Guam, a U.S. territory, have sided with the Trump administration, filing a motion supporting the government’s request to dismiss the case. They argue the plaintiffs do not have standing to file the lawsuit, and that there is no constitutional right to a specific energy policy. “The state of Montana has an interest in this case because it will directly impact the business done in the energy sector within its borders,” Knudsen argued in his motion.
A hearing on the motion to dismiss, as well as the plaintiffs’ call for a stay of the executive orders, is scheduled this week in federal court in Missoula.
Olivia Vesovich, 21, one of the plaintiffs, who is in her senior year at the University of Montana in Missoula, told KFF Health News she struggles with severe spring pollen allergies, which research shows are exacerbated by climate warming and will likely worsen.
“My eyes were swollen shut every single day, every single night,” Vesovich said. “When I wake up in the morning, I couldn’t open my eyes for 10 minutes. It’s not fun at all, and it’s exacerbated by climate change and by the fossil fuel industry.”
She also has exercise-induced asthma as well as feelings of suffocation from the smoke-filled skies during wildfire season — the intensity and frequency of which are magnified by climate change. And Trump’s executive orders are already being implemented and causing harm, Vesovich said.
“We are making an argument that Olivia’s state constitutional right to a safe climate system should also be protected under the federal Fifth Amendment as part of her liberty right,” said Andrea Rodgers, a senior attorney for Our Children’s Trust.
Our Children’s Trust was also behind the climate change case Juliana v. the United States, filed in 2015 by 21 young plaintiffs who argued their rights had been violated. In 2024, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the federal district court to dismiss the case, ruling that the courts were not the appropriate venue for climate policy.
They believe the victory in Held v. Montana gives American youth more standing this time. If they prevail, the result would be more far-reaching than the Montana case, creating a national precedent.

The plaintiffs are asking the court to declare Trump’s three related executive orders — “Unleashing American Energy,” “Declaring a National Energy Emergency,” and “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry” — unconstitutional and to block their implementation. They also claim that Trump has overstepped his authority by attempting to undo laws such as the Clean Air Act. A coalition of 14 states’ attorneys general has also filed a lawsuit against the order that declares an energy emergency.
Trump came into office in January primed to support traditional energy sources and to back off efforts to usher in an era of renewable energy, which he claims are not viable. He has also issued orders rolling back environmental regulations. “We are driving a dagger into the heart of the climate change religion to drive down the cost of living for American families, unleash American energy, bring auto jobs back to the U.S., and more,” Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a March news release.
In July, the EPA proposed repealing its 2009 “endangerment finding” that concluded climate-warming gases “endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations.”
The finding established that greenhouse gases are a pollutant and create adverse effects, such as extreme weather and risks to human health and ecosystems. And it created a foundation to regulate automobiles and the energy sector to address climate change.
Zeldin said that eliminating the rule would save Americans “$1 trillion or more in hidden taxes.”
Unleashing fossil fuels will come with costs, as well. The health effects of a warming world are thoroughly established in scientific literature, said Kristie Ebi, a University of Washington professor of global health and an expert in the health risks of climate variability. Mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, and malaria are spreading, and flooding, droughts, and wildfire, exacerbated by climate change, pose threats. And research has shown an increase in deaths.
“There’s a long list of adverse health outcomes” from a warming world, she said. “The data are clear.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_3666-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-15 19:57:32.605163

State Comptroller Sean Scanlon and Lamont’s chief of staff Matthew Brokman were among those in attendance, as well as UConn Health CEO Andrew Agwunobi and UConn Health Board Chair John Driscoll. 
Rob Blanchard, Lamont’s spokesperson, said in a statement, “Although discussions are ongoing, it’s premature to discuss final bids or plans around those partnerships.” He added that the governor wants to support UConn Health’s academic and research programs, while ensuring its sustainability.
Representatives for UConn Health could not be immediately reached for comment. Leadership with Bristol and Day Kimball Hospitals deferred to UConn Health for comment. A representative for Waterbury Hospital didn’t provide comment in time for publication Monday.
UConn Health Center, which houses UConn’s medical and dental schools as well as John Dempsey Hospital, has been struggling financially for years, though much of that problem involves fringe benefit and wage costs — driven largely by state government and not by the university itself. 
The health center receives about 13% of its funding from the state budget. The bulk of the rest comes from revenue generated by John Dempsey Hospital.
A report released last year, commissioned by the governor and completed by investment banking firm Cain Brothers, found that the health center had too small of a footprint to compete with other academic medical centers in the current market. The health center generated cash flow losses averaging $140 million per year between 2020 and 2023, the consultants wrote.
The report proposed two solutions: either sell John Dempsey Hospital or engage in a partnership with another health system. 
Scanlon said Monday that the potential deal now being considered could bring financial stability to the state health center and benefit the communities surrounding Waterbury, Bristol and Day Kimball Hospitals.
“The potential partnerships that are being explored are about two things: strengthening UConn’s long-term fiscal health and making sure that different communities in Connecticut have access to public health and health care,” Scanlon said. 
Waterbury Hospital is one of three facilities in Connecticut owned by bankrupt hospital operator Prospect Medical Holdings. The formerly private equity-backed Prospect, which also owned hospitals in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and California, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January. 
Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals — Waterbury, Rockville General and Manchester Memorial — have faced longstanding financial and operational problems, including a cyberattack in August 2023. 
“There needed to be a public health solution,” Scanlon said in reference to Waterbury Hospital. “And that is what this is.” (Rockville General and Manchester Memorial aren’t part of the proposed acquisition by UConn Health.)
As part of the proposed deal, the state would not only have to purchase Waterbury Hospital but also the land, buildings and equipment from a real estate investment trust, sources said. Prospect acquired Waterbury Hospital in 2016 and then sold those assets to the REIT in 2018.
Connecticut claims Prospect owes it more than $67 million in health provider taxes, also known as hospital user fees, which hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers must pay to the state every year based on their revenues. It has filed a claim in Prospect’s bankruptcy proceeding to recoup the money. Sources said the tax issue is not part of the proposed hospital deal.
On Monday, House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, confirmed the nature of the discussions and said the state is considering borrowing money — bonding — to pay for the hospitals. The state’s goal, Ritter said, is to prevent the hospitals from being acquired by private equity interests. 
Ritter added that he had “specific concerns” about how the state would pay for the hospitals. “UConn Health is not in a position to be taking on more debt so my question is, ‘Who is going to pay for it?’” Ritter said. 
But he indicated he wasn’t opposed to using bonded funds to make the acquisition. “I think if we feel that it’s important to have strong hospitals and to keep these hospitals from being purchased by another private equity company then it’s fine for the state to bond it,” Ritter said.
Ritter said the other issue is whether the state would have to exceed its constitutional spending cap to make the purchases. He also said that question may need to be put to lawmakers in a special session.
The deal would need to be approved by the University of Connecticut’s Board of Trustees, which holds its next regular meeting on Wednesday. A source said the possible deal will be discussed at that meeting.

(Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM) With a little over two weeks before New Mexico lawmakers will convene in Santa Fe for a special legislative session to respond to anticipated federal spending cuts, Republican leaders are calling on the governor to consult with them on the agenda and consider a host of other issues they’d like to address instead.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham issued a news release earlier this month announcing the Oct. 1 start date of the session along with a few actions the Legislature would likely consider to make up for federal cuts to rural hospitals, Medicaid, food stamps and public broadcasting. It also said she was in “discussions” with the Legislature to address behavioral health and criminal justice issues. 
But Republican leaders in the House and Senate said in a letter Monday that they have not been consulted on any of the specifics about the session, and that Democrats’ fears of federal cuts are unwarranted this early. 
“Republican legislators should be given the same courtesy and opportunity to thoroughly review the fiscal impact and programmatic requirements associated with these proposals,” according to the letter. “This review is particularly necessitated because your public statements have, unfortunately, left the impression that New Mexicans will immediately lose Medicaid and SNAP benefits. Needless to say, nothing could be further from the truth.”

The letter goes on to state changes in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” President Donald Trump signed July 4 are “highly complex” and won’t go into effect for more than a year or longer. 
The letter’s authors said the Legislature should direct more immediate consideration to other issues in the state, including, crime, the state’s child welfare department, medical malpractice reform  and homelessness, according to the letter.
They urged her to issue a proclamation for the session that enables lawmakers to consider all of those topics. 
“The people of New Mexico are convinced these are the real emergencies facing our state and we ask for your leadership in helping provide the Legislature with the opportunity to work in a bipartisan basis to adopt long overdue solutions to these most pressing problems,” according to the letter.  
Jodi McGinnis-Porter, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, told Source New Mexico on Monday afternoon that her office “just got the letter” and so did not have an immediate response.

North Carolina state government continues to operate without a budget for the fiscal year that commenced July 1. Thanks largely to a disagreement between Republican leaders of the House and Senate over whether the state should plow ahead with a series of scheduled tax cuts – even as fiscal analysts warn of big impending budget shortfalls – the state is operating on a makeshift continuation budget that’s leaving a host of core public services inadequately funded.
What’s really behind this stalemate and what are some of the impacts it’s producing for state residents? Recently, as part of a special extended interview, Newsline posed these questions and several others to one of the North Carolina General Assembly’s longest serving and most widely respected members, State Rep. Pricey Harrison of Guilford County. And as Harrison explained, the hard truth is that the budget failure and its myriad impacts are likely the result of the political fears of one very powerful state Senator who faces a Republican primary challenger in 2026.
In part one of our extended conversation with Harrison, we discussed the ongoing failure of Republican legislative leaders to reach agreement on a state budget for the fiscal year, as well as GOP proposals to enact new, significant and worrisome changes to our state’s voting laws prior to the 2026 elections.
In part two of our interview, we turned our attention to an area to which Harrison has long been recognized as one of the General Assembly’s best informed and most impactful voices – environmental protection – and in particular the damage that continues to result from new state and federal laws that hamstring environmental regulators. In addition, we also chatted about the massive and negative impacts that President Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act will have on our state’s social safety net unless state lawmakers step up to fill the huge gaps that will soon be created.

She is shown with Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham during the policy's announcement on Sept. 8, 2025. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)In order to provide free child care to all families in New Mexico, the state will need to amend three rules that govern child care assistance benefits, facility licensing and independent caregivers.
New Mexico’s Early Childhood Education and Care Department will hold an in-person and Zoom hearing on the proposed changes on Oct. 9 and take written public comment through that day as well. The swift rulemaking follows Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s announcement last week that the state will provide universal free child care starting Nov. 1.

The department said in a Sept. 10 announcement that the proposed changes include eliminating income eligibility requirements for all families; making child care hours for families no longer tied to work hours or class schedules; making grandparents raising their grandchildren and CARA families eligible, whether or not they are working or attending school; presumptive eligibility for immediate assistance for three months while families gather the required documentation; and extended eligibility when additional children join households.
The Early Ed Coalition, a group of 15 organizations representing early childhood educators and advocates, on Sept. 10 praised the governor’s announcement of universal child care as a historic win resulting from years of organizing by their member organizations and others.
“By removing income limits and copays, the ECECD is removing a significant barrier for many families in accessing high-quality child care,” the Early Ed Coalition said in a statement. “This, in turn, will enable parents to work, pursue education, or start new careers without the burden of exorbitant child care costs.”
The coalition includes OLÉ NM, Partnership for Community Action, NM Voices for Children, Ngage NM, Save the Children Action Network, CommonSpirit St. Joseph’s Children, NM Asian Family Center, Southwest Women’s Law Center, NM Immigrant Law Center, NM Center on Law and Poverty, El Centro de Igualdad y Derechos, Semilla Action, NM Dream Team, Somos un Pueblo Unido and the Center for Civic Policy.

Other proposed changes include: provider rate increases; requiring providers to participate in the department’s education, training and certification database; requiring providers to comply with all state and federal laws regarding children with disabilities; and no longer requiring registered homes to participate in the federal Child and Adult Care Food Program.
The formal rulemaking notice in English and Spanish, along with copies of the three proposed rules, can be found here.
The Early Ed Coalition statement said while they’re “thrilled” about the progress made, there is more work to be done.
“While there are still barriers to access, particularly for immigrant and refugee families and those in rural and tribal communities, this announcement brings us closer to universality, and we will continue working to ensure that every child and family in New Mexico is supported,” they said.

Regulators are investigating a spill at a different oil well site in Mountrail County, North Dakota. (Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)A pipeline leak in northwest North Dakota has spilled an estimated 20,000 barrels, or 840,000 gallons, of crude oil and produced water onto agricultural land, the Department of Environmental Quality said Monday. 
The spill about 4 miles northwest of Stanley in Mountrail County involved emulsion, a mixture of crude oil and produced water that emerges from a well before they are separated, the department said. Produced water, also known as saltwater or brine, is a waste byproduct of oil production. 
The contamination flowed for 250 yards before it was contained by the construction of a clay berm, according to the incident report. 
It is unknown how long the leak went undetected by Hess Corp., which owns the pipeline. Bill Suess, manager of the Department of Environmental Quality’s spill investigation program, said  the company first became aware of a potential problem Sept. 2 when they “started getting an indication their numbers weren’t right” – 10 days before the spill was discovered and reported.
“They went in and did some tests. The tests came back negative,” said Suess. “And then on the 12th they found the dead vegetation.”
Hess discovered and reported the spill on Friday, according to the incident report. 
The cause of the spill has not been identified beyond “equipment failure” and remains under investigation, according to Suess.
The leak occurred from a 6-inch carbon steel pipeline called a “flow line,” used to transport the oil, natural gas and produced water from a well to a treater unit where the products are  separated. Regulators are still investigating the extent of the spill underground, including possible groundwater impacts, Suess said. 
There is no risk to drinking water, Suess said. The department said no water resources have been impacted at this time. 
“We don’t know yet how deep the impacts go,” said Suess. 
Cleanup is expected to last until at least mid-November, according to the incident report. That’s an “optimistic” estimate from Hess, Suess said. 
“This is a big one,” Suess said. 
A Hess representative said the flow line has been isolated and the surface impact was contained to a field between two oil well pads. Hess notified the Department of Environmental Quality and mobilized a third-party environmental contractor, the representative said.
“Safety and the protection of people and the environment are our top priorities,” the Hess representative said in a statement.

Nevada filed a final Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) proposal to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), the governor’s office announced Monday.
Nevada had been one of the earliest states to file its final plan, a $416 million version of which had won approval from the Biden administration in January. In June, the Trump administration rescinded approval of Nevada’s plan, along the plans from Louisiana and Delaware, which had also received early approval. At the same time, the Trump administration issued new guidance for spending the federal funding, ordering states to focus more on satellite providers and less on fiber optics, and to spend less overall.
The final plan submitted for NTIA approval will “connect every unserved and underserved location in the state using the most effective mix of technologies, including fiber-optic, hybrid-fiber-coax, licensed fixed wireless, and satellite broadband, ensuring no community is left behind,” the statement from the governor’s office said. 
The funding approval request announced Monday follows $275 million in federal funding that had already been approved for earlier phases of the overall effort to get high-speed broadband to Nevadans without access.
Federal funding for all phases of the effort to build out broadband in Nevada was provided by two pieces of landmark Biden-era legislation, the American Rescue Plan Act and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.

FEMA has not issued that notice for the Shelter and Services Program. FEMA programs provide food, shelterGAO wrote in the 22-page report the delay in the Emergency Food and Shelter Program notice of funding opportunity “constitutes an impermissible withholding and a violation of the ICA.”   The Trump administration’s actions regarding the Shelter and Services Program “establish the intent to impermissibly defer or preclude the obligation of budget authority,” according to the report. The Emergency Food and Shelter Program “supplements and expands ongoing work of local nonprofit and governmental social service organizations to provide shelter, food and supportive services to individuals and families who are experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, hunger and/or homelessness,” according to FEMA’s website. The Shelter and Services Program is designed to provide temporary housing to relieve overcrowding in federal immigration facilities. Congressional powersGAO also sought to reinforce the separation of powers laid out in the Constitution in the report, explaining that Congress approves laws and that once the president signs those laws, it’s up to that branch of government to implement them. “This process does not grant the President the authority to pass his own laws or to ignore or amend a law duly enacted by Congress. Instead, the President must ‘faithfully execute’ the law as Congress enacts it,” the GAO report states. “It follows from this that Executive Orders cannot function to repeal or undo legislation.”Senate Appropriations Committee ranking member Patty Murray, D-Wash., wrote in a statement the latest GAO report “is another stark reminder of a fact we have known for months: President Trump is breaking the law in order to prevent communities across the country from receiving resources they have been promised, including critical funding to address homelessness. “The same guy who says he wants to get people off the streets is blocking funding for communities to tackle homelessness.

It’s an interesting fact that while North Carolina’s population continues to steadily increase, enrollment in public schools is trending in the opposite direction. Part of the explanation for this is to be found in demographic shifts, but as Newsline learned in a recent conversation with veteran education policy analyst Kris Nordstrom of the North Carolina Justice Center, there are other factors involved as well – things like the state legislature’s ongoing expansion of private school options and its failure to adequately fund traditional public schools.
Nordstrom has authored a new report on this subject – it’s entitled “Navigating Declining Enrollment: How smarter state policies can help schools thrive” – and in it, he details some of the policy changes that could help slow or reverse the trend, as well as steps state and local officials could take to lessen the negative impacts when they’re forced to close schools.

(Photo by Oliver Bunic/Bloomberg Creative-Getty Images)Summit Carbon Solutions, the company proposing to build more than 1,000 miles of carbon sequestration pipeline through Iowa, announced Monday a community and landownership partnership program and updated commitments.
The partnership focuses on safety precautions, operational transparency and increased benefits to landowners and counties where the pipeline route is slated to be built. 
The letters were sent to county supervisors and county emergency managers Monday, but a Summit representative said they should be sent to all Iowa landowners over the next week and a half. 
“These commitments are more than words on paper—they are a promise to operate safely, openly, and in a way that brings meaningful benefits to the people and places that make this project possible,” the letter, signed by Summit’s new CEO Joe Griffin, said. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The letter outlines seven commitments to landowners and counties, as well as an explanation of how the project adheres to and “often exceeds” federal pipeline safety standards set by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA. 
Safety commitments 
As part of its approach to safety, Summit said it would: establish a constantly staffed control room, maintain an emergency manual, coordinate emergency response plans with local crews, ensure the proper tools and equipment are ready when needed, provide CO2 specific training for responders, ensure immediate notification in the event of an incident and offer a public awareness program at least annually. 
Landowners opposed to the pipeline have noted safety as a primary concern, especially when noting the outcomes of a CO2 pipeline rupture in Satartia, Mississippi several years ago. The Mississippi incident left impacted residents stranded as the excess carbon dioxide in the air immobilized vehicles. 
Additionally, Summit said it would offer annual grants to communities so they can purchase safety and response equipment, and operate a real-time notification system. 
“We’re fully committed to making this project work the right way going forward,” the letter said. “We also realize our significant investment will only be successful if it’s built on genuine partnership, and we know that success depends on working side-by-side with communities and landowners along our route.” 
Emergency response and communication were also part of the seven commitments Summit listed as part of the community partnership program. 
In a bullet labeled “Emergency Response and Preparedness” Summit said it would offer an initial donation of $50,000 to each county emergency management team where the pipeline crosses, plus an additional $1,000 for each mile of pipeline in the county. These funds, which the letter said will be available at least 180 days prior to the start of operations, will help facilitate the training, equipment and notification systems noted previously. 
The second commitment point in the letter concerns public awareness and communications. Here Summit commits to maintaining an updated project website prior to construction and to providing public awareness updates at least annually during construction and operation of the pipeline. 
Commitments to landowners
Summit directed a number of commitments at landowners, who should receive the letters in the mail. 
Some landowners have voiced concerns, and sued, over the surveying process required for Summit to plan its route and assess a property through which the pipeline would travel. In the letter, Summit said it would give landowners at least 72 hours notice, unless there is a different statutory regulation, and offer landowners a one-time $500 payment for project surveys. 
Summit also committed to “avoid the use of eminent domain except as a last resort.” This follows commitments to negotiate in good faith, and to engage in discussions “aimed at reaching mutual agreement.” 
Summit also sent landowners a hotline number they can call in the event they encounter “individuals who do not represent this project with honesty and integrity.”
Landowners can also choose between fair market compensation as either a lump sum, or annual payment, or they can choose a payment option “linked to all financial distributions to Summit’s current owners.” 
“This allows landowners to share in the project’s success in a way similar to investors, but without actually owning part of the company,” the letter explained. 
Regardless of which reimbursement option they choose, landowners with a voluntary easement will receive an annual stakeholder payment at a rate of at least $0.25 per foot of pipeline on their property. The rate will increase as Summit acquires higher percentages of voluntary easements along the project footprint in the state. If 100% of voluntary easements are reached, the stakeholder payment rate will be $0.50 per foot per year. 
“This way, every landowner benefits more when we achieve this milestone together, reflecting our belief that shared commitment should result in shared success,” the letter said. 
Counties along the pipeline route will be eligible for an annual grant of $0.125 per foot of Summit pipeline in the county. These grants go directly to the counties and can be spent on things like emergency response, agriculture and ethanol production, trainings or healthy families and communities. According to the letter, the grants and landowner stakeholder payments will persist annually through the lifetime of the pipeline project. 
The county grant rate will also increase as voluntary easements are reached throughout the county, with a cap at $0.25 per foot if voluntary easements are established for 100% of the path through the county.
Summit also committed to prioritize union and local laborers for project construction and to prequalify contractors based on safety and insurance coverage. 
The letter said it would commit to building “strong, respectful, and lasting relationships” with tribal nations along the route, which also passes through parts of Minnesota, South Dakota and North Dakota. 
According to the company, the community and landowner partnership agreement is rolling out in Iowa first. 
Finally, Summit said it was committed to water stewardship and transparency throughout the project. In this section of the letter, Summit said it commits to “innovative” design and operation of its system to “enhance” water efficiency. 
“We commit to partnering with each ethanol facility to ensure water is sourced, permitted, efficiently used, and discharged responsibly, with a focus on minimization, recycling, and reuse where appropriate,” Summit said in the letter, which was signed by leadership from more than a dozen partnering ethanol plants.

Wyoming’s lone congressperson will serve on a newly formed congressional committee tasked with further investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.  Speaker of the House Mike Johnson appointed U.S. Rep.

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson appointed U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman alongside four other GOP members and three Democrats on Thursday, according to the Congressional record. 
Hageman’s appointment is notable as she defeated Wyoming’s former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney, who broke from the Republican party in voting to impeach President Donald Trump for his role in the insurrection. 
Cheney also served as vice chair of the original Jan. 6 committee, which interviewed over a thousand people, held a series of televised hearings and reviewed over a million documents before publishing an 814-page report in 2022. Her decision to participate in the panel — she ultimately was one of its most high-profile members — angered many Republicans in Wyoming and elsewhere. Trump even traveled to Casper for a rally focused on supporting Hageman in her 2022 race against Cheney.
Ultimately, the committee found enough evidence to convict Trump and recommended several charges to the Department of Justice. A grand jury indicted Trump in 2023, but charges were dismissed in November after Trump won the presidential election. 
Earlier this month, the House voted to officially establish the new committee via a resolution. 
“The resolution authorizes and directs the select subcommittee to conduct a full and complete investigation and study and issue a final report of the events surrounding January 6, 2021,” the resolution states. 
The resolution authorizes its chair, Georgia Republican Rep. Barry Loudermilk, “to receive information available to the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence; to extend certain periods for questioning witnesses; and to use depositions, subpoenas, and interrogatories to collect information.”
Loudermilk told Politico there was “more politics than there was truth” in the original report. House Democrats have argued the new panel is a distraction. 
Maryland Democratic Rep. Jayme Raskin, who served on the original committee, will act as an ex officio member of the new panel.
Raskin said the new committee will provide the opportunity “to examine the constantly growing criminal records of all the hundreds of violent felons, cop-beaters and white nationalists who Donald Trump pardoned and released onto our streets in his first day in office,” in a press release. 
About 140 Capitol Police officers were injured on Jan. 6, making it one of the most violent days for law enforcement in recent American history. A western Wyoming man was convicted in July 2024 of assaulting officers during the Jan. 6 riot.
Hageman, for her part, has downplayed Jan. 6 and sought to relieve Trump of any blame for the attacks. 
Last year, for example, she co-sponsored a resolution “expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that former President Trump did not engage in insurrection or rebellion against, nor give aid or comfort to the enemies of the United States.”
She also signed an amicus brief asking the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse a lower court’s use of a certain statute in deciding the prison sentences for Jan. 6 rioters. 
The committee’s final report must be completed by the end of 2026.

(Photo provided by Washington State Courts)When G. Helen Whitener arrived in this country at age 16 from Trinidad and Tobago, she did so in a wheelchair. 
The right side of Whitener’s body had become paralyzed. She learned it was from a hereditary degenerative back condition that has followed her for the rest of her life.
But with treatment, Whitener, appointed to the Washington state Supreme Court in 2020, hid her disability for years. She felt she already dealt with enough being a Black immigrant woman who was a member of the LGBTQ+ community.
“Just adding that additional one, disability, I knew it would literally prohibit me from being all that I can be,” Whitener said in an interview Friday. 
She would use a cane, but play it off as a minor injury when asked. She only opened up about her condition after joining the Pierce County Superior Court after years as a prosecutor and defense attorney. 
Whitener was assigned to a courtroom with steps, and she stumbled. When she disclosed her disability, she learned only one courtroom was considered accessible.
This experience led Whitener, now 60, to help lead the Supreme Court’s Disability Justice Task Force. The task force’s work recently culminated in a more than 600-page study on conditions for people with disabilities in Washington’s legal system. The report found “widespread physical, programmatic, and cultural barriers that hindered in-person and virtual court engagement.”
Last week, the findings were presented to the Supreme Court in a daylong symposium. 
Chief Justice Debra Stephens noted this was the first study of its kind in the nation. 
“We strive as a judiciary to deliver equal justice, but we can’t deliver anything unless we receive,” Stephens said. “We are here to receive, to listen and learn, because achieving justice starts with better understanding, from the perspective of people who work within our systems,  the barriers that they face.”
To Whitener, the symposium “meant everything to me with my ascension to this court.”
The findings
The task force grew out of conversations between Whitener and Robert Lichtenberg, who has since retired from the state’s Administrative Office of the Courts. 
But as Whitener developed the task force, a long-awaited reconstructive back surgery stemming from her disability put her out of work for months in 2023. Whitener only took up driving again this year. And she now has fitted chairs she can use at the Temple of Justice that allow her to sit for long periods despite her disability.
The task force’s work moves beyond courts complying with federal requirements in the Americans with Disabilities Act. Instead, Whitener said, it’s about “accepting people with disabilities, meeting them where they are at instead of having them to tell us what they need.”
In the study, conducted by KMG Consulting, court employees reported a lack of accessibility training. Court users with disabilities reported wide dissatisfaction for reasons that go beyond physical accessibility. This includes inaccessible paperwork, technological issues and poor treatment from court staff. 
Court staff and administrators also don’t understand their requirements under the state court system’s General Rule 33, which governs access for people with disabilities. And people with disabilities largely don’t know how to request accommodations under the rule. 
Buildings and evacuation routes are often unsafe for people with disabilities, the study found. One example that stuck out to Whitener was a courthouse where an emergency exit is a fire escape with an air conditioner in front of it.
Recommendations from the Florida-based consulting group include recurring implicit bias training for judges, a consistent request process for accommodations and a pilot program to provide navigators in courts to help people with disabilities.
Whitener’s co-chair on the task force, King County Superior Court Judge David Whedbee, is a paraplegic after a rock climbing accident. 
“Disability justice must remain a permanent part of how we define access, equity and justice moving forward,” Whedbee said in the symposium. “This work is not finished, it is only just beginning and it will take all of us.”

Whitener wants a commission focused on this issue, similar to minority and justice and language access commissions. She also plans on proposing changes to General Rule 33.
The goal for Whitener is to build a legal system where future generations don’t have to hide.
“It’s not about special treatment,” she said. “It is about being able to be your authentic self.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Justice-G.-Helen-Whitener-1024x701.jpg,,,2025-09-15 18:56:54.330340

The petition, filed on Monday, requests route and pipe-size modifications to add an ethanol plant to the route and to “amend the conditions regarding North Dakota and South Dakota.”
In the IUC’s approval of the CO2 pipeline permit through Iowa, it noted Summit could not begin construction until it had received route and storage permission from North Dakota — where the pipeline is slated to deposit the sequestered carbon in an underground rock formation — and route permission from South Dakota.

South Dakota enacted a law earlier this year to stop the use of eminent domain on carbon sequestration pipelines, and has denied Summit’s permit requests twice. Summit’s permits were approved in North Dakota, but have been tied up in litigation.
In the petition to the IUC, Summit said its request to change the language was not meant to change the “protections against a ‘pipeline to nowhere.'” Summit said this change would reflect that “additional options for storage and pathways to storage are developing and may provide a better solution.”
Summit asked that the state-specific language be removed from the order to instead read:
“Summit Carbon Solutions, LLC, shall not commence construction on any segment of pipe in Iowa until it has secured access to one or more sequestration sites and permits or agreements to allow it to reach such storage … and has filed proof of such approvals with the Commission.”
The other requested changes, according to the petition, would account for ease of building the pipeline around railroads and roads, and to facilitate connections to sequestration sites that have since been added to the project.

(Gov. Tom Wolf/Flickr)Eugene DePasquale, a former member of the state House and two-term state auditor general, was elected to lead Pennsylvania’s Democratic Party for the next year. He will serve out the remainder of state Sen. Sharif Street’s term.
Democratic state committee members gathered in Lancaster for their fall meeting earlier this month to hold the special election. Street served as the party chair since 2022, but announced he would step down to focus on his campaign for Congress.
DePasquale is now at the helm after the Democratic Party suffered losses up and down the ballot in the commonwealth in 2024, including his own defeat in the race for state attorney general, and as Republicans continue to narrow the voter registration gap in the Keystone State.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
He spoke with the Pennsylvania Capital-Star about the challenges he sees facing the state’s Democratic Party, his opinion on Democratic U.S. Sen. John Fetterman’s job performance, and what steps need to be taken to win back voters who have left the party. 
This interview was lightly edited for length and clarity.
Capital-Star: Why did you decide to run for chair of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party?
DePasquale: I think we’ve all got to do our part to step up and help.
I mean, I think that there’s a lot of challenges in our country.
I know as a Democratic Party, I think there’s a lot of things we could be doing better. 
I think I’ve got a background to help that, and I know I’ve got something to offer the public at large, and certainly the Democratic Party.
So, I decided to run, and certainly other party leaders, the governor included, asked me to consider this, and I was happy to do it.
Capital-Star: So, you were elected in a special election to complete state Sen. Sharif Street’s term as party chair. So that term will end next year. Are you planning on seeking a full term as party chair?
DePasquale:  I am. 
Capital-Star: Republicans secured big victories in Pennsylvania in 2024, as you know, with President Donald Trump winning the state’s 19 electoral votes, flipping the Senate seat red with Dave McCormick’s victory over Bob Casey, flipping two congressional seats and winning all the statewide row offices.
You traveled the state last year, and you talked to voters on the campaign trail in your run for attorney general. What do you think happened in 2024?
DePasquale: I think it is very clear that there was a large segment of the electorate that felt that the Democratic Party had lost touch with their concerns, particularly on economic issues. 
There are people that have voted for Democrats in the past that did not vote for us in 2024.
That certainly is going to be a priority for me as party leader moving forward, to try to help win those back.
But that, to me, is clearly what happened.
Capital-Star: How would you describe the current state of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party?
DePasquale: I think Chairman Street did a great job.
I think there were some other headwinds that were beyond his control, namely inflation and some of the issues with President Biden deciding to drop out. Some of the circumstances there that were obviously a challenge for us as a party at the ballot box in 2024, but under his watch, we elected a Democratic governor and flipped the House Democratic.
So, there were some successes under his tenure, but we certainly have our challenges moving forward as what was exposed in the 2024 election.
Capital-Star: So what do you view as the biggest challenges currently facing the Pennsylvania Democratic Party?
DePasquale: It’s making sure we win those voters back.
Capital-Star: And how do you win those voters back?
DePasquale: Listening to them and putting real, concrete ideas on the table to address their concerns, and those are mostly pocketbook, economic issues.
And as we see now, there is an opening because the Trump administration has failed them.
When you look at inflation still being a problem and this tariff chaos, when you look at the package that was passed by all Republicans in D.C. that is now going to be ripping health care and food security out of the hands of millions of vulnerable Pennsylvanians, and when you see a tax code now that further favors the ultra rich and corporations at the expense of average everyday Americans, I think people are now frustrated with President Trump and feel let down, but we’ve got to show that we hear them as well, and we’re going to address their concerns if we’re put back into power.
Capital-Star: Although Democrats still hold a voter registration advantage in Pennsylvania, Republicans have significantly cut into that in recent years. What do you think has happened that has led to the Democratic Party’s massive voter registration advantage being significantly narrowed?
DePasquale: So, there’s a couple things.
First of all, it’s very clear that the party didn’t have enough emphasis on actually registering people as Democrats. That’s number one.
Number two, it’s clear that a very big chunk of Pennsylvanians, and you’re seeing this issue across the country, have lost faith with both parties, which leads to the third point, the largest voting share increase in the state, is actually not affiliated.
So, I know the Republicans have put more emphasis on this than we have.
Under my leadership, we’re going to change that.
But there’s also, for lack of a better phrase, a brand issue, that we’ve got to show the people that are frustrated with both parties that we’re the ones fighting for them.
Capital-Star: It’s an interesting point you bring up how unaffiliated voters have been gaining momentum in the state. Like you said, the numbers show that there are more people registering unaffiliated or independent.
On that note, over the summer, a King’s Bench petition was filed to the state Supreme Court in an effort to have open primary elections in Pennsylvania.
Do you think Pennsylvania should have open primary elections? And if there were open primaries, what kind of impact do you think that would have on elections in the state?
DePasquale: Look, this is not an official statement, on behalf of the party, but for myself, when I was a legislator, I introduced an open primary bill.
So, I have long believed this.
I believe in empowering more voters.
Now, again, that’s not an official party position, but that’s something I support.
And I do think that if you allow non-affiliated voters to vote in the primary, it would force candidates in both parties to speak to a broader swath of the electorate.
Capital-Star: Another task that you have as the state party chair is fundraising. Can you talk about what kind of emphasis you’re going to have on that as state party chair, and what do you think, you could be doing differently in that space, as opposed to the previous administration?
DePasquale: Well, I don’t want to get into what the previous administration did.
I know Sharif had some challenges running for Congress and doing this at the same time, but I do know we’ve had a good first week out of the shoot.
But, look all the things you want to do, television ads, mailers, name the list, hire staff, organize regions: that stuff all costs money.
You got to raise money to do it.
So, I’ve got to do my job to outreach the people that are committed to the party, show them a plan and then get them to invest in it.
And like I said, the first week, we’ve had some pretty good success.
Capital-Star: I asked a similar question to Pennsylvania Republican Party Chairman Greg Rothman, when I interviewed him earlier this year. So, I want to ask you essentially the same thing: Do you think the governing approach for Democrats in Pennsylvania should be towards a purple state, or should they treat Pennsylvania as a blue state?
DePasquale: Well, I think you should always do what you believe is right and then make the case to the public as to why it’s right.
Capital-Star: You sort of touched on this earlier in the interview, but what are the issues that you believe Democrats should address to earn back the trust of voters that maybe have left the party in recent years?
DePasquale: We’ve got to do a better job of listening.
Then we’ve got to do a better job of putting ideas on the table to address their concerns, and then you got to deliver once you’re given power again.
Capital-Star: I was watching the Phillies game last night (Wednesday night) and noticed an ad promoting the three Supreme Court justices, who were elected as Democrats in 2015, and they’re seeking retention in 2025. What kind of investment is the party making for those 2025 retention races, and how important are those judicial races?
DePasquale: That is the top priority of the party between now and November, priority, full stop.
There are other local races that certainly matter, and the judicial election statewide certainly matter, but the top priority is all of it: retention, Supreme Court, Commonwealth Court, Superior Court.
Capital-Star: What kind of investment is the state party going to make, do you think, in those races?
DePasquale: We will spend what we raise to make sure that happens.
Capital-Star: Then after November, of course, 2026 is around the corner. I know as party chair, your goal is to compete in every corner of the commonwealth. But what do you view as the top priorities in next year’s elections? What are the particular races that you think are must wins, or the highest priorities that you would view as the biggest victory, should you flip some seats as well? What are those races?
DePasquale: Certainly re-electing the governor and the lieutenant governor, holding the state House, hoping to flip the state Senate, and then competing in all the congressional districts.
But particularly, we know that there we’re going to be a battleground in at least four or five of them, and if we win the majority of those, we are going to be the reason why Democrats control the U.S. House of Representatives.
Capital-Star: Can you expand upon which specific congressional seats? You mentioned those four or five?
DePasquale: You’ve got the Philadelphia suburbs, you’ve got PA-10 (Republican incumbent Scott Perry’s district). You’ve got the Lehigh Valley, Northeast Pennsylvania, and certainly retaining all of our Democratic incumbents, as well.
Capital-Star: You already mentioned Gov. Josh Shapiro is seeking a second term as governor. What do you think the message should be from his campaign next year?
DePasquale: Well, I think he’s had a great record.
I think Pennsylvania has moved forward under his leadership.
I think from whether it was the I-95 collapse to greater investments in education, I think he’s made it easier and simpler for people to own businesses in Pennsylvania, tax relief for seniors. There’s been real tax relief. I believe those are all going to be on the campaign trail pushing forward. I think he will win and win in convincing fashion.
Capital-Star: Somewhat shifting gears here, but this is still a relevant conversation that, actually, I asked Governor Shapiro about at a press conference about a month ago. Some states, blue and red, are currently in the process of redrawing their congressional maps before the 2026 election. Do you think Pennsylvania should consider drawing new congressional boundaries before the next midterm election?
DePasquale: I mean, one of the things about being a divided state with the Republicans in the Senate, the Democrats in the House, I just don’t see that being even remotely close to realistic.
Capital-Star: I noticed U.S. Senator John Fetterman announced that he was supporting your bid for party chair.
However, I think it’s fair to say U.S. Senator John Fetterman has caused controversy within the Democratic Party since the beginning of Trump’s second term for a few positions he’s taken, with some in the party, including Cumberland County Democratic Party Chairman Matt Roan calling on him to resign. What have you made of Senator John Fetterman’s job performance?
DePasquale: Look, I believe the senator is fighting for what he believes in and what he campaigned on, and he’s a loyal Democrat, and he’s offered to help support the party, and we appreciate that, and I’m hopeful to continue that working relationship moving forward.
Capital-Star: We’ve seen in recent months, poll after poll at the national level signals that the Democratic Party’s approval rating is the lowest it’s been in decades. Why do you think the Democratic Party is unpopular nationwide? This is not a Pennsylvania-centric issue, but what do you think the party as a whole, nationwide, outside of your role, needs to do to win those voters back? And why is that happening?
DePasquale: Part of it was a loss of focus on us talking about economic issues.
The second part is, I think that stems from actual registered Democrats being frustrated… not seeing the party fighting back enough against the extremism of the Trump administration.
I think you’ve got to do both, not only push back against President Trump, especially on the economy and these oversteps of his authority, but also make sure you’re reconnecting with voters.
We’ve got to do both.
Capital-Star: What are the long term goals for Pennsylvania’s Democratic Party that you would like to accomplish while you’re at the helm?
DePasquale: I want to make sure that we have a Democratic Party that’s fighting for all of Pennsylvania, and that we are winning more elections and making sure that Pennsylvania is a better place to live, work and raise a family.
That’s the ultimate goal of what the Democratic Party is and what the goal of winning elections needs to be.

Roberts, R-Burlington, is calling for the firing of a university employee in Louisville. (Photo provided by Rep. T.J. Roberts)A Kentucky Republican lawmaker is criticizing a University of Louisville employee for a Facebook post she made after conservative activist Charlie Kirk was gunned down last week while speaking at a college in Utah. 
State Rep. T.J. Roberts, R-Burlington, voiced the criticism in response to a post on X by LibsofTikTok, a right-wing social media account that has millions of followers and has targeted numerous online commenters for what it says are disrespectful and objectionable statements in the wake of Kirk’s death.
Kirk, 31, died Wednesday after he was shot at an event at Utah Valley University. A suspect is in custody. 
According to a screenshot in Roberts’ post, Alex Muckler, the assistant director of admissions for UofL’s Brandeis School of Law, shared a 2023 quote from Kirk about gun violence deaths being “worth it” to protect Second Amendment rights. Muckler introduced her Facebook post by writing,“Presented without comment.”
UofL spokesperson John Karman told the Lantern in an email that the university is reviewing  the comments and added that Muckler is not on leave from her position. Muckler declined to comment for this story. 
“We have received feedback from both elected officials and members of the community,” Karman said. 
Roberts said Muckler’s post took Kirk’s original comments out of context and that they were presented “while his body is still warm.” 
“This comment in itself is an effort to minimize an assassination that took place on American soil,” Roberts said. 
“I think Muckler should be terminated from employment,” Roberts said. “I don’t think that people in our institutions that can determine whether you are admitted or not to your education for your career, should be in that position if they’re celebrating the murder of someone that thousands of UofL students look up to — and that’s both sides by the way.” 
Roberts’ original X post about Muckler was in response to a post from LibsofTikTok about a University of Kentucky employee. 
Another Republican lawmaker, Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, of Smithfield, replied on X to Roberts’ post that Muckler “needs to be fired immediately.” 
LibsofTikTok shared a post by Bradley Van Hook, a UK employee who is now on leave for a comment he made on a WKYT article about Kirk’s death. Van Hook had paraphrased a quote from attorney Clarence Darrow, who died in 1938, writing, “I have never wished a man dead, but I have read some obituaries with great satisfaction.” LibsofTikTok initially misidentified Van Hook as an employee of Eastern Kentucky University. 
UK spokesperson Jay Blanton said  that Van Hook, who manages the university’s key shop, is on administrative leave with pay, pending an investigation.
“The statement attributed to him — no matter who made it and what their affiliation is — does not reflect who we are as a community. It is cruel. It is insensitive and it is wrong,” Blanton said in a statement. “I should also add that whenever we receive a complaint about alleged or potential employee misconduct, we conduct a review or investigation. That is our protocol. We are proceeding in accordance with that process.”

Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA, was a polarizing figure who regularly travelled to universities to host viewpoint debates with college students. He hosted such events at UK in recent years. Turning Point USA also maintains a searchable “watch list” of professors it accuses of pushing “leftist propaganda” in the classroom.
Workers across the country have been fired or placed on leave because of public remarks about Kirk following his death. Asked about concerns for protected speech under the First Amendment, Roberts said “you have the right to criticize officials, to criticize public figures, to enter into the marketplace of ideas — and that’s exactly what Charlie Kirk did, and he was killed for it.”
Roberts said he wasn’t interested in hearing from the other side of the political aisle about suppression of free speech.  
“I don’t want to hear a word from the actual advocates of cancel culture when it comes to be that employers are not willing to put up with the celebration of assassination and the celebration of violence,” Roberts added. “I think that is a total bait-and-switch, because they’re insisting upon a right that they never guaranteed to the other side.”

Bill Lee and the state’s Republican U.S. senators, Bill Hagerty and Marsha Blackburn, the president signed a presidential memoranda to establish a “Memphis Safe Task Force” to address violent crime using federal law enforcement and agencies. “We're sending in the big force,” Trump said. Multiple federal agenciesIn addition to the National Guard, the task force will include the U.S. Marshals Service, FBI, Drug Enforcement Agency, Homeland Security Investigations and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. It’s unclear how many Guard members or members of federal law enforcement will be sent. “This task force will be a replica of our extraordinarily successful efforts here, and you'll see it's a lot of the same thing,” Trump said of using the National Guard in the district. It’s the first time Trump has sent the National Guard into a red state, after seizing control of the California National Guard from the state’s governor — a Democrat — for deployment in Los Angeles, and then sending Guard members to the district, another Democratic stronghold. While homicide rates remain high in Memphis compared to the nation, murders overall from 2023 to 2024 have decreased by 14%, according to the most recent data from the Memphis Shelby Crime Commission.The Memphis mayor's office could not immediately be reached for comment. Trump added that St. Louis, Missouri, could also see similar action. Other citiesThe dispatch of the National Guard to Tennessee comes after Trump has threatened to send troops to other cities including New Orleans; Portland, Oregon; and Chicago. Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker pushed back and the president had backed off his threat, though he mentioned the city again on Monday. Governors have control over their state National Guard except in rare circumstances where the president can seize control. Pritzker has repeatedly rejected the idea of sending the National Guard into Chicago.“If we don’t have the governor's help we’re doing it without him,” Trump said of Pritzker. With Memphis, Lee welcomed the intervention and thanked Trump for directing federal resources to the city. “We are very hopeful and excited about the prospect of moving that city forward,” Lee said.",,,,2025-09-15 18:56:54.330340

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Bovine bird flu is now a thing in Nebraska, according to the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. 
The Nebraska and U.S. Departments of Agriculture in recent days identified a case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in a dairy cattle herd in central Nebraska.
The Animal Plant Health Inspection Service, working with the National Veterinary Services Laboratories confirmed a similar strain of the virus to what infected a herd in California.
Cattle are at little risk of death with proper care, and the herd has been quarantined, officials said. 
Nebraska State Veterinarian Dr. Roger Dudley asked the state’s cattle producers to monitor their biosecurity protocols and contact a vet if they notice any symptoms. Dairy cattle experiencing signs of the virus should be reported to NDA at 402-471-2351 or the USDA at 866-536-7593.
The state warned farmers to watch for decreases in hunger and milk production, along with clear nasal discharge, tacky or loose feces, dehydration, fever and lethargic behavior.
Producers can find more information on how to handle sick animals at nda.nebraska.gov/animal/avian/ and from USDA at https://www.aphis.usda.gov/livestock-poultry-disease/avian/avian-influenza/hpai-livestock. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have said the threat to human health from infected animals remains low, but has said infections are possible from direct contact.

Residents say the tower violates their local zoning rules and would harm the scenic view from state-protected Tinmouth Channel, among other concerns.

Near the serene, scenic landscape along Route 140 and the state-protected Tinmouth Channel wetland, a Massachusetts-based company wants to erect a 160-foot radio tower, drawing local pushback. 
Public comments have poured in to the Public Utility Commission from Tinmouth residents opposing the project proposed by Industrial Tower and Wireless. The comments say the project would violate local zoning and Tinmouth’s town plan, negatively impact wildlife habitat and would interfere with the scenic views, among other qualms. There were no statements of support for the project submitted to the commission before the deadline last Tuesday. 
Tinmouth residents, along with Industrial Tower and Wireless, now await further process determinations by the Public Utility Commission on whether to hold an evidentiary hearing and eventually to approve or deny Industrial Tower and Wireless’ request. 
When Industrial Tower and Wireless proposed the tower in February, Tinmouth Town Clerk Fallar said she told the company to not go forward with the project on the behalf of the town.
“We don’t want this here,” Fallar said. “It doesn’t comply.”
Fallar said the company initially proposed to place the tower in a protected zone solely designated for agriculture and forestry. Industrial Tower and Wireless then moved the planned site across the town’s zoning line in a conservation district where towers are allowed a conditional use, Fallar said. 
But, Fallar said, the current Industrial Tower and Wireless proposal does not meet the conditions for use, as telecommunications towers cannot be built higher than 130 feet, or 20 feet above the average tree height. A 160-foot spire with mounted antennas would stand far above what is allowed by the local zoning regulations, she said. 
Kevin Delaney, a vice president for Industrial Tower and Wireless, wrote in prefiled testimony dated Aug 8 that the project will allow the company’s customers “living in, working in or passing through the Tinmouth area” to use the company network, “something that is impossible at present.” The project would enhance remote work access and be available for colocation of telecommunications technology by other providers, Delaney wrote.

“As such, the project will promote a balanced, diverse economic base, with a focus on locally owned businesses, including home-based ones,” Delaney wrote. “This type of project also brings with it the opportunity to attract the major wireless communications carriers to the area to improve upon their wireless communications networks.”
Burlington attorney for Industrial Tower and Wireless, Cooper Hayes, declined to comment on the ongoing matter. 
Both the local select board and planning commission unanimously voted against supporting the radio tower, Fallar said. On behalf of the town, Fallar submitted an intervention to the Public Utility Commission to become a party to Industrial Tower and Wireless’ Aug. 8 application for a certificate of public good. On Sept. 9, Fallar asked on behalf of the town that the Public Utility Commission deny the request or schedule an evidentiary hearing on the tower company’s request if an initial denial is not possible. 
“We are disappointed that ITW is choosing to ignore the clear written community standards and recommendation to deny this tower which is required by statute to be given substantial deference,” Fallar wrote. “The proposed tower in this location will not promote the general good of the state.”

In March, the Rutland Regional Planning Commission also voiced concern to the Public Utility Commission due the project violating the town plan and the potential impact on the natural resources of the Tinmouth Channel, a state-protected wetland area, according to a letter signed by Board of Commissioners Chair Erika Berner and submitted by Executive Director Devon Neary. 
“Ensuring this project does not adversely affect such an environmentally sensitive area is critical,” Berner wrote. “Local planning efforts are essential to land use decisions, and the Commission believes that the Town’s determination should be given significant weight.”
Annette Smith, executive director of the nonprofit Vermonters for a Clean Environment, said requests for radio and cell towers have cropped up across the state in recent years, including in Manchester, Chelsea and Hardwick, and Vermonters’ resistance to cell towers goes back decades. A proposed radio tower by Industrial Tower and Wireless in Enosburg has been caught up in contentious debate and litigation for several years.

Smith is concerned that once the aesthetics of a site is degraded with a tower “that opens the door to more degradation — you can’t say it’s free of industrial development.”
Smith, of nearby Danby, said she helps local communities navigate the Public Utility Commission’s opaque public participation process and fight radio and cell towers from “cluttering up the landscape.”
Cris Carabeau, a Tinmouth resident who lives near the proposed project, also filed an intervention and request for a hearing to the Public Utility Commission. Cris and her husband Larry, who serves on the local planning commission, said the scenic view of the Tinmouth mountain valley across from their farm has brought joy over the years, and they are worried about the impact of the tower on their property value. 
Carabeau added that the town has sufficient communication signals for law enforcement and emergency services, so she does not think the tower will ultimately serve the public good.
Adam Guettel, another neighbor to the proposed project, voiced concerns over the health impacts of wireless telecommunications technology if the Industrial Tower and Wireless colocates a cell antenna on the radio tower. Guettel said he intervened in the Public Utility Commission so that residents have more access to the decision-making process.
“I feel betrayed that this should be going on so quickly and without our intervention,” Guettel said “We have to slow the process down.”
The “top two issues” Smith hears from residents are the negative impacts on property values and concerns that cell towers cause cancer or other detrimental health effects, yet those are not concerns that the Public Utility Commission considers in their determinations. 
There is not strong evidence that radiofrequency waves cause negative health outcomes, according to the American Cancer Society. But the group also acknowledges that more research is needed to understand long term impacts of new cell technology. 
According to the prefiled testimony of professional engineer and project manager Louis Hodgetts, employed by DuBois & King, the project also expands the range for emergency service calls, and would not have adverse impacts on the conservation area and conforms with the local town plan.

While recognizing the presence of rare species like the long-headed thimbleweed and calcareous red maple, Hodgetts wrote, “the area of proposed disturbance generally lacks high-quality or irreplaceable natural communities.”
Tinmouth Tree Warden, forester and fire department worker David Birdsall said the town does not need additional radio or cell tower services. He is worried about the impact to the view and harm to the rare, threatened and endangered species within the Tinmouth Channel. 
The Tinmouth Channel, a state wildlife management area, contains a large deer wintering area, habitat for migratory birds and the northern long-eared bat, a wetland complex and the state’s biggest open intermediate fen, Birdsall wrote in his comments to the Public Utility Commission.
“There’s very few places in Vermont that are this exquisite,” Birdsall said. “It’s ridiculous to think about putting something like this this close to that gem.”

(Photos of Neronha and Shekarchi by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current; photo of Foulkes by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current; McKee campaign video still)Nearly one year out from the state’s gubernatorial primary, most voters haven’t decided who they will vote for, according to a new University of Rhode Island survey published Monday. 
The third annual Rhode Island Survey Initiative administered by YouGov took the temperature of 500 adults on housing, health care, the Washington Bridge, media consumption and politics. The margin of error was 6.1%
In a hypothetical, four-way primary between Gov. Dan McKee — the only declared candidate at the time of the August survey — and potential challengers Helena Buonanno Foulkes, Attorney General Peter Neronha, and House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, McKee maintained a 3.5% lead over no. 2 Neronha.
The most prevalent answer from those surveyed, however? “Not sure” was the response from four in 10 of the 362 registered Democrats and unaffiliated voters who answered the question. 
“The way I read this is that we’re a long way out from the primary, especially in the minds of Rhode Islanders,” Ashlea Rundlett, associate political science professor and director of URI’s master’s program in international relations, said in an interview on Monday. “At the time, they hadn’t really started campaigns.”
That changed Sept. 9, when Foulkes, a former CVS executive who lost to McKee by three percentage points in the 2022 Democratic primary, kicked off her campaign with a splashy event at Roger Williams Park Casino in Providence. 
Rundlett acknowledged that the results of the URI survey, conducted from Aug. 1 to Aug. 18, might look very different if the same question was posed again now that Foulkes has entered the race and McKee has begun campaigning more publicly.
“I expect that even if we were to run this poll next week or the week after, it would change,” she said.
Trading jabs 
Hours before Foulkes made her pitch to a crowd of supporters, McKee’s campaign released a digital ad attacking Foulkes for her role in the opioid crisis. A 2024 federal lawsuit against CVS Health accuses the pharmacy giant of knowingly filling fake prescriptions for opioids over a 10-year period, faulting executives — though not explicitly Foulkes — for putting profits over people’s safety.
Christina Freundlich, a spokesperson for McKee’s campaign, took another indirect jab at Foulkes in her response to the survey results Monday. 
“While Washington Republicans further restrict access to quality health care, Rhode Islanders can’t afford a governor who turned a blind eye to illegal opioid sales to lead the state,’ Freundlich said. “Rhode Island needs a governor like Dan McKee who will fight for a stronger health care system instead of someone who profited off the opioid crisis.”
Freundlich did not identify Foulkes by name.
Foulkes trailed McKee by four percentage points in the survey with 14.3% also just behind Neronha, who received 15% support.
“Helena is working to earn every vote,” Jon Romano, a campaign spokesperson, said in an email. That’s why she’s holding community gatherings in all 39 cities and towns to hear directly from Rhode Islanders about their concerns and ideas.”
While she is identified as “former CVS executive,” in the URI survey, Rundlett also said she did not think the ties to the controversial company hurt Foulkes’ performance in the survey. McKee’s campaign had not yet released its attack ad at the time of the poll.
Rundlett said poll writers had “extensive discussions,” about what title to give Foulkes, the only non-sitting officeholder, and only woman, among the bunch of potential names on the ballot.
“Ultimately, we ended up choosing what we saw most frequently in the media,” she said of Foulkes’ title. “I also felt like it was a title that said what someone accomplished, versus ‘former candidate,’ which doesn’t say much about who they are or where they come from.”
Neronha did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment on his inclusion in the poll, or second-place level of support. In an interview last week, the term-limited AG said he was still contemplating a run, but had not made a decision. 
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi received the smallest level of support among survey takers — just over 7% — despite being the top fundraiser in the state. The Warwick Democrat did not address his potential candidacy Monday, instead touting the state legislation passed under his leadership.
“The poll confirms that Rhode Islanders care deeply about the accessibility and affordability of housing and health care, two issues which the General Assembly has focused on since I have been Speaker,” Shekarchi said in an emailed response. “There is much work to be done, and I remain steadfast in my belief that we can continue to address these challenges by bringing people together.”
To Rundlett, the race remains open, with all four potential competitors falling within the 6.9% margin of error for the survey question.
“I don’t think it says a ton about who has an advantage,” she said of the results. 
Finding disfavor 
Especially because McKee struggles to win over the electorate generally.
Roughly 37% of those surveyed disapprove of the way the governor is handing the top leadership role, down 26 percentage points from the public sentiment when the question was asked a year ago. But, that’s in part because this year’s survey gave participants the option to answer “not sure,” whereas the 2024 survey forced them to choose between approve and disapprove, Rundlett said.
McKee’s 29% approval rating this year is in line with results of a pair of polls released in July — one national and one by the Pell Center at Salve Regina University — both showing one-quarter of voters looked favorably on the governor’s job performance.
The new URI poll also indirectly links McKee’s struggles in the public eye to the ongoing Washington Bridge crisis — more than six in 10 named McKee as one of the people “highly” or “somewhat responsible” for the crisis. The Rhode Island Department of Transportation, and its director, Peter Alviti Jr., faced more blame, named by 77% of survey participants.
Foulkes in her campaign kickoff said the expensive and delayed Washington Bridge rebuild was a “glaring example” of McKee’s broader inability to effectively lead, contrasting the five-year replacement timeline with her giving birth to four children in four-and-a-half years.
Freundlich declined to answer questions on the survey results regarding the governor’s approval rating.

Speaking in Orlando, Ingoglia said the general fund budget for Orange County had increased by more than $559 million — a nearly 54% boost — in that time, as he continues to make the case along with Gov. Ron DeSantis that local government spending is out of control and is the reason why Floridians deserve property tax relief.
“Your local government here is taking the money and spending it and expanding government, creating new programs that probably shouldn’t be paid with your tax dollars, expanding already existing programs that are paid by your tax dollars, and just wasting it willy-nilly,” he said.
Orange County’s current budget sits at $8.2 billion.
County Mayor Jerry Demings fired back, complaining Ingoglia got basic facts wrong and neglected to consider the costs of accommodating the area’s huge tourism numbers. Also, that the CFO didn’t account for higher law enforcement salaries in Orange County.
“What I’m saying here is that the CFO ought to get his own house in order first, before he starts looking at someone else’s house,” Demings said.
Since DeSantis appointed him as CFO in July, Ingoglia has spearheaded a team of state auditors who have visited more than a dozen city and county governments to look for what they claim is waste, fraud, and abuse.
This DOGE tour comes as both men are on a full-fledged campaign to give Floridians a chance to vote to substantially reduce or eliminate taxes for homesteaded properties in a 2026 ballot measure. (Ingoglia would also be a likely candidate for CFO on that same statewide ballot).
Ingoglia and DeSantis are attempting to preempt criticism by local government officials that reducing property taxes would severely harm basic government services that they pay for, such as police, fire, parks and recreation, libraries, and public health.
Local government officials in other parts of the state have defended their increased budgets in recent years, citing inflation and rising population.
Ingoglia disparaged part of that argument on Monday, saying that Orange County’s population has only increased by 79,000 people in the past five years. And he said that in those same five years the county had hired 661 new employees.
The CFO said his DOGE team found $190 million in excessive spending during the audit period. He said auditors looked back to Orange County’s 2019-2020 fiscal year budget and increased it every year to account for inflation and population growth. They added two additional “buffers” of 5% and 10% to accommodate for the fact that government doesn’t run as efficiently as the private sector.
“When you factor in all of that, Orange County’s budget should be almost $200 million less than it is right now,” he said, adding that that broke down to about $148 per taxpayer.
He said the county could “easily” reduce the tax rate in Orange County by 0.86 mills and offer “real property tax relief.”
The CFO didn’t list any particular programs that would qualify under his definition of wasteful spending. DOGE auditors made requests to Orange County officials for information related to interactions and assistance to programs that serve Black, Carribean, and LGBTQ communities, according to the Orlando Sentinel.
And when DOGE auditors went to St. Petersburg last month, they posed numerous inquiries about DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion), resiliency, and climate change and specific purchases of electric vehicles.
‘Fiscally responsible”?
Part of the promise by Ingoglia and DeSantis is complete elimination of property taxes on homesteaded properties.
However, that likely constitutional amendment would not constitute a full revocation of property taxes, according to a key state legislator.
“We don’t see that as fiscally responsible,” state Rep. Toby Overdorf (R-Stuart) told WFLX television last week. Overdorf is co-chair of the select committee created by House Speaker Daniel Perez to study property tax relief.
Every piece of information was “quadruple-checked and verified” by the Florida Department of Revenue, Ingoglia said. “All they’re trying to do is keep the gravy train of your dollars flowing into their coffers so they can continue expanding government. Don’t buy it.”
During an Orlando press conference last month, Ingoglia accused Orange County officials of failing to cooperate with requests — that some employees provided incomplete, scripted answers in interviews and may have withheld or edited documents. Ingoglia said he planned to issue subpoenas to Orange County employees and may bring in digital forensic investigators.
Demings responded that all his employees had “fully cooperated” with Florida DOGE.
Ingoglia said on Monday that the issue of overspending in Orange County was so big that he predicted that “a lot” of local officials would be voted out of office, and then took a dig at Mayor Demings’ ambitions.
“You have a mayor now who’s deciding that he wants to run for governor,” he said. “This type of spending should be disqualifying.”
Orange County responds
Late on Monday afternoon, Demings, a Democrat, responded to Ingoglia’s comments in a press conference, sounding very much like a potential 2026 gubernatorial candidate. He said the CFO had made allegations “that factually just were not true” and that he had used some “fuzzy math” in making his calculations.
YouTube video screenshot of Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings in Orlando on September 15, 2025.
Regarding the basic numbers, Demings said the county’s population had increased by 125,488, not 79,000, citing the University of Florida’s Bureau of Economic and Business Research as his source. He said general revenue had increase by $474 million over the past five years, not $559 million as Ingoglia had alleged.
Much of that had to do with inflation, Demings insisted, raising the costs for a myriad of items, including what the state charges counties for public pensions and benefits. And he stressed that Orlando is the No. 1 tourist destination in North America, with more than 75 million tourists and an economic impact of more than $94 billion last year, according to Visit Orlando.
“That means that in addition to permanent residents, we must provide services for an additional 206,000 people every day within our community,” he said. “There is no other local government in Florida with that type of impact on services.”
Demings acknowledged that the county had hired 661 individuals over the past five years, but said that more than half of them (333) were public safety officials, and said that unlike the state, the county was paying them a competitive wage.
“As a former law enforcement officer, a former sheriff, a former chief of police, a former public safety director, what I can tell you is this: it is well known amongst those of us who truly have served in those capacities, that the corrections and prison guards don’t make what they should make in the state of Florida,” he said. “It is well known that the troopers are some of the lowest paid law enforcement officers in the state of Florida.”
Demings attacked state Republicans for failing to address the problems of high property insuranceand health costs, plus the lack of affordable housing in Florida.
He said that if the state sincerely cared about the county’s budget, “they would sit down and talk to us like decent folk would do, rather than issue subpoenas. They could have simply had a conversation with us. No, they wanted to be heavy-handed. They wanted to perform before the cameras. That’s what the residents of Florida are sick and tired of. They want people in office who are going to take care of the people of this state.”
Demings was asked by a reporter after his 14-minute press conference whether his response means that he had officially announced that he was running for governor.
“If I had announced that I was officially running for governor, I would have had a big announcement. That hadn’t happened yet, okay?” he said. “I’m not saying that I’m not going to run. Given these things that’s been happening, I just might do that.”

,California,2025-09-15 22:05:59+00:00,CalMatters,More California high school seniors applied for college financial aid this year than last,Mikhail Zinshteyn,,,,,https://calmatters.org/education/higher-education/2025/09/financial-aid-california-2/,"About 340,000 California students completed a financial aid application, up about 11% over last year.","In summary
About 340,000 California students completed a financial aid application, up about 11% over last year.


Nearly three-quarters of California public high school seniors applied for federal financial aid this year, soaring past last year’s figures by 11 percent and giving further indication that California’s efforts to get more students to apply for federal grants are paying off. 
This time last year about 307,000 high school seniors completed a financial aid application. This year, that number is around 340,000. The California Student Aid Commission that oversees college aid in the state released the information today. In 2023 a slightly higher share of seniors completed aid applications — about 74% to this year’s 72.7%. In 2024, the figure was 64%.
“We must take a moment to reflect and celebrate this achievement for California’s future,” said Daisy Gonzales, the commission’s executive director and who formerly led the state’s community college system, said in a statement. “With more high school seniors applying for financial aid, we can expect our higher education segments to serve more students.” A spokesperson for the commission, Shelveen Ratnam, said Gonzales and other commission executives were unavailable for an interview today.  
A 2021 state law required high schools to ensure their seniors complete financial aid applications. Neglecting to complete the application denies students the ability to receive $22,000 or more in state and federal financial aid in their first year of college. Last year the commission conducted market analysis to understand why parents and students do not apply for aid. Among the answers: families were skeptical that aid can actually be free.California is expected to spend about $2.9 billion on student financial aid in 2025-26, a major reason why more than half of California residents do not pay any tuition to attend the state’s public universities.
Immigration worries aren’t suppressing applications
Data that the commission shared with CalMatters also shows that more students whose parents don’t have lawful immigration status applied for federal financial aid than last year. Somewhat surprisingly, this year’s figures surpass those from 2023. 
The revelation for now rebuffs worries that the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown would prompt more college students to leave federal money on the table to try to protect their parents. 
About 64,700 high school seniors from so-called mixed-status families completed a Federal Application for Financial Aid, or FAFSA, in 2023 by the Sept. 2 deadline. In 2024, the figure dropped to just under 60,000. This year, it jumped to over 69,000.
The commission’s numbers capture the number of students who applied for state and federal financial aid in the spring to attend four-year universities and students who applied by Sept. 2 to be eligible for aid to attend community colleges. The decline in 2024 is attributed to major technology issues with a revamped FAFSA that blocked tens of thousands of students whose parents lacked Social Security numbers from completing the aid application. 
Unlike federal aid applications, California’s own Dream Act application does not share user data with federal agencies. The vast majority of students complete the FAFSA, though in recent years the commission has suggested to students in mixed status households that it may be safer to apply for just state aid. Other nonprofits focused on college access gave similar advice. “We cannot speculate as to why each student from a mixed-status family did or did not complete a FASFA,” Gonzales wrote in an email. But in her conversations with families in the San Diego area, she said the adults told her that giving their kids a better life was why they came to the U.S. Meanwhile, “families acknowledged the fact that they may be already sharing their data with the federal government,” she added, such as when they file taxes or adjust their immigration status.Roughly 3.3 million Californians live in mixed-status households, including 1 in 5 children under 18, according to 2021 data from Equity Research Institute, a USC research group.The California Dream Act Application gives students access to state tuition waivers and several thousand dollars in other grants, but FAFSA is the only way for students to also receive federal student loans and the Pell grant, which can provide more than $7,000 a year to low-income students. 
The student aid commission and its financial aid support partners hosted more than 1,200 workshops on completing financial aid applications this year and trained over 16,000 professionals to help students apply for the aid.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/101024_San-Diego-State_AH_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-15 18:56:54.330340

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Death row inmate Steven Bixby may be obstinate and have atypical beliefs about the law, but he can still face execution, a judge decided.
Circuit Court Judge R. Scott Sprouse’s 24-page order, dated Friday, opens the door for Bixby to receive a death warrant, which would be the seventh issued since the state resumed executions in September 2024. Bixby’s attorneys could appeal the decision, potentially prolonging the process.
Another death row inmate, Gary Terry, appealed a Lexington County judge’s July decision that he was not intellectually disabled, which cleared the way for him to receive a death warrant as well unless a higher court intervenes. His appeal to the state Supreme Court is pending.
Delusions or political opinions? SC judge to decide if inmate is competent for execution

During a two-day hearing last month, Bixby told Sprouse he believes he is innocent of gunning down Abbeville County Deputy Danny Wilson and Constable Donnie Ouzts outside his parents’ house in 2003. Every court that has convicted him or upheld his sentence has violated the law, the 58-year-old said during an 11-minute address. Under Bixby’s reading of the Constitution, the only offense for which a person can be sentenced to death is treason, he said.
Bixby has “strong religious beliefs” that cause him to find “religious significance that others may not find correlated,” Sprouse wrote in his order.
Although psychiatrists laid out clear, strong beliefs that Bixby holds, none of the four experts who testified during his hearing last month “opine that these beliefs, whether on law or religion, rise to the level of delusion or render him incapable of understanding reality,” he wrote.
For instance, Bixby finds messages in numbers he believes hold special significance, and he has said an angel was present at the scene of his crime, his attorneys said. Bixby’s legal and religious beliefs sometimes intersect, such as in handwritten court filings in which he claimed judges who denied his appeals were controlled by Satan.
Because of his thoughts on the law, Bixby has been unable to effectively communicate with his team of attorneys, which is one of the two prongs that inmates must meet to be considered competent under state Supreme Court precedent, his attorneys argued.
Many of Bixby’s beliefs align with those of so-called constitutionalists, who believe the Constitution is the only valid law, and sovereign citizens, who denounce the government altogether, experts said.
Bixby hasn’t identified himself as belonging to any particular political group.
Besides, a person’s way of thinking about the law or religion, however atypical, can’t render them incompetent, Sprouse wrote.
Attorneys say inmate who killed 2 officers in 2003 shootout can’t be legally executed

“Neither the obstinance nor the desire for confirming arguments is relevant” in determining whether Bixby is competent, Sprouse wrote.
Psychiatrists hired by Bixby’s defense team, the attorney general’s office, the court and the Department of Corrections agreed that Bixby had narcissistic personality disorder, a mental condition that causes a person to believe themselves to be the center of the universe. He also had post-traumatic stress disorder, psychiatrists agreed.
Bixby angered easily and was often stubborn and difficult to work with, psychiatrists testified. But he was also able to understand when his anger was misplaced or work through it well enough to cooperate despite holding a grudge, Sprouse wrote.
For instance, Bixby once apologized to prison staff for accusing them of keeping him from talking to his attorney after learning his attorney was having a problem with the phone system, a Department of Corrections psychiatrist testified.
These sorts of cases “certainly demonstrate his ability to understand the circumstances of his reality, assess new information, exercise choice, and rationally communicate with others,” Sprouse wrote of Bixby.
“His beliefs may predispose, or even greatly predispose, him to anti-government thoughts — but does not form an unreasonable, unshakeable belief that interferes with choice,” Sprouse continued.
Death row inmate is not intellectually disabled, SC judge rules, clearing way for execution

Nothing in the law required Bixby to do what his attorneys suggested, Sprouse wrote. Even if Bixby doesn’t agree with the way the law works or legal decisions in his case, he understands the facts of his case, the reason he was sentenced to death and the finality of execution, Sprouse wrote. A basic understanding of the crime and its punishment is required for an inmate to be put to death.
Bixby is able to “rationally communicate whenever and with whomever he wishes,” and any conflict he has with his attorneys “is simply his obstinance regarding what the correct application of constitutional law should be, and his desire that the pursued arguments reflect those beliefs,” Sprouse wrote.
Despite disagreeing with his attorneys’ claim that he was incompetent, Bixby agreed to move forward with the argument, which showed his ability to communicate with his attorneys, even if he was a difficult client at times, Sprouse wrote.
“At most, it would appear that (Bixby) simply chooses at times not to agree and/or cooperate when his beliefs about constitutional rights or religion are directly challenged, and his personality disorders make such disagreement more difficult to manage,” Sprouse wrote.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4237-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 18:56:54.330340

UVM Health Network, the parent company of the state’s largest hospital, is “physically and spiritually distant” from its mission and from Vermonters’ needs, said the chair of the Green Mountain Care Board.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, in Burlington on May 31, 2024.  File photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
The state’s main health care regulator approved budgets for all 14 of Vermont’s community hospitals during two hearings convened last week. The Green Mountain Care Board forced a reduction of almost $95 million to the revenue that hospitals can receive next year from commercial insurers, with the large majority cut from the budget of the University of Vermont Medical Center, the state’s largest hospital, based in the Burlington area.
The care board annually reviews the hospitals’ budgets for the upcoming fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. The process gives the board a way to place caps on what the hospitals can charge commercial insurers for services and how much revenue they can bring in as a result of those charges.
This year, the board approved the proposed budgets from eight of the state’s hospitals without any changes. UVM Medical Center’s allowed charges to commercial insurers were cut by roughly $88.5 million — from a proposed $1.16 billion net revenue from commercial insurers to the approved $1.07 billion. 
UVM Medical Center’s initial budget proposal already included a significant rate reduction of 7.9%. That percentage reduction took into account the requirements of new legislation as well as a care board enforcement action, which required lowered future costs to commercial insurers to compensate for the hospital receiving more revenue than the care board approved for fiscal year 2023. However, without those adjustments, the hospital’s request was for a 2.4% increase in commercial revenue. The board’s approved commercial revenue cap amounts to a 6.4% cut in general and a total of 16.7% decrease when the impact of the enforcement and new legislation is included. 
Relatively minor cuts were sustained by the other two Vermont members of the University of Vermont Health Network: Central Vermont Medical Center in Berlin and Porter Hospital in Middlebury. The board also cut the budgets submitted by Brattleboro Memorial Hospital, Copley Hospital in Morrisville and Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington more substantially as a percentage of their size.
While the total dollar amount of budget reductions came in lower than what was cut during the same process last year, the review comes as curbing hospital and commercial insurance prices has become a matter of intense focus by the Legislature and the administration of Gov. Phil Scott. As a result of those efforts, which included a cap on hospital charges for outpatient injectable drugs, hospitals were already projecting smaller cost increases than in recent years.
Recently, the state’s Department of Financial Regulation, an appointed independent liaison and Scott himself have pushed to bring health care costs in line with what’s affordable for Vermonters.  
“The fact is, like in education, well-intentioned policies Vermonters were promised would make things better and more affordable are not working as intended, and many have become counterproductive,” Gov. Scott wrote in a Sept. 4 press release. “The status quo has allowed unacceptable amounts of administrative cost growth, unbearable pricing strategies, and perverse financial incentives and executive bonuses paid for by skyrocketing premiums,” he went on. 
The letter served as a signal to some longtime observers that this year’s decisions might have even more riding on them. 
“I’ve never seen anything remotely that incisive, quite frankly,” Sam Peisch, a policy analyst at the health care advocate’s office, said in an interview with VTDigger.

Focus on UVM Health Network
The board spent most of its discussion on Friday narrowing in on the imbalance in costs between UVM Medical Center, which provides direct patient care, and its parent company. The UVM Health Network owns two other Vermont hospitals — Central Vermont Medical Center and Porter Medical Center — and three in eastern New York state.
Board chair Owen Foster did not mince words at Friday’s meeting. 
“University of Vermont Health Network does not provide health care,” Foster said. “It’s essentially an expensive and ineffective layer of overpriced and unnecessary corporate bureaucracy that has proven itself both physically and spiritually distant and unconnected from the mission of our flagship academic medical center and the needs of Vermonters.” 
Foster outlined what he called the “corporate shell game” of cash flow from the medical center to the network and the network’s three New York hospitals. That cost shift results in the medical center’s profit margins and cash reserves appearing smaller than they should be, he said. 
During Friday’s hearing, Foster became particularly animated when citing the service cuts UVM Health Network made last year: He explained that while the network shuttered dialysis programs and clinics in the Mad River Valley, it also moved $10 million from UVM Medical Center to its New York hospitals.
Under the network’s management, Vermont’s hospitals have seen “unrelenting expense growth far exceeding inflationary metrics,” Foster said, while the quality of care has deteriorated and the gap between executive compensation and the network’s lowest-paid workers has widened.
Foster cited “excessive charges” for life-saving medications and medical imaging, and a waitlist of more than 3,000 patients for a colonoscopy, all while the network invests in its lobbying and external-relations arm. He worried about the impact of losing services like birthing centers or primary care clinics all across the state while individuals, families and insurers all struggle to keep up with the high cost of health care. 
The budget the care board approved purposely left no margin for the UVM Medical Center to add to its reserves, citing the fact that the hospital’s reserves go to the health network. Allocating more reserves to the medical center would go against the careboard’s mission, Foster said, “given [the Network’s] use of Vermont money to cover its inability to sustainably operate New York hospitals that it owns,” Foster said.  
Earlier in the week, Foster floated a proposed budget condition that would restrict the flow of funds from UVM Medical Center to the health network or to its New York hospitals. However, the health network’s general counsel Eric Miller filed a letter stating that the care board’s attempt to do so went beyond its mandate and violated the Constitution:
 “Seeking to regulate that interaction, at the eleventh hour of the budget-setting process, without taking any testimony, providing any opportunity for hearing, or setting any standards on the topic would be arbitrary and capricious and lead to unintended consequences that will inhibit hospitals and insurers from working together to reform the way health care is reimbursed,” Miller wrote. 
During the public comment period at Friday’s hearing, Stephen Leffler, UVM Medical Center’s president, responded to the board’s frustration with the structure of the health network saying, “I agree with many comments about how we have to be better and work better with you, but I do caution not to throw everything about the Network away.” 
He cited the good he sees coming from the network, like the flow of patients across both sides of the border with one electronic medical record system so that scans and tests done in one state can be used by a specialist in the other. Also, the relationship allows for the network to increase specialty services in different regions while also lightening the overall load on UVMMC, Leffler said.
The UVM Medical Center’s board of trustees is committed to making improvements to quality and meeting the care board’s budget requirements, said the hospital trustee chair Jesse Bridges, during Friday’s public comment period. “Our volunteer boards are working hard to do their best to make sure that we are pulling and pushing in the right direction,” Bridges added.
The care board also approved a budget condition that it says gives the hospital flexibility to lower prices for outpatient care as part of negotiation with insurers. 
Following the board decisions, UVM Health Network spokesperson Annie Mackin expressed the group’s desire to move forward with what the care board handed down. 
In a statement, she wrote: “University of Vermont Health Network is proud to provide health care to more than a million people in Vermont and northern New York. We have committed to collaborating as a strong partner in reducing expenses, limiting growth of hospital costs, and providing high-quality, sustainable care to the communities we serve.” 
She said that the network will review the written budget orders when they are published on Sept. 30.  “Much work remains, and we and our partners will need to continue taking steps to improve affordability not just in this budget cycle, but in the months and years ahead,” she added. 
In his Friday comments, Foster expressed gratitude for the providers and work of the hospitals themselves, despite high costs: “University of Vermont Medical Center’s problem is not with the care board or Vermont’s inability to give it money. It’s with its own corporate parent that has drained its assets and forced it to pay for an unnecessary layer of corporate bureaucracy. The Health Network has proven to be an irresponsible steward of Vermont’s limited health care dollars,” he said.

Spencer Cox talks to media after conservative political commentator Charlie Kirk was shot and killed during an event at Utah Valley University in Orem on Wednesday, Sept. 10, 2025. (Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As Utah and the rest of the nation continue to contend with the gruesome killing of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk in front of thousands of people at Utah Valley University last week, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox emphasized unity in a message for the state’s college students. 
“You can build a culture where we embrace differences without letting hate divide us, where hope is stronger than cynicism, and where forgiveness breaks the cycle of violence,” Cox said in a recorded video message that was circulated to university campuses on Monday. 
“My friends and Utahns, this is our moment,” he said. “The question is, do we escalate? Or do we walk down the better path? My prayer is that you will choose humanity, connection and love. And I believe with all my heart that you will.” 


Cox, a Republican, has made several appearances on national television in the days since Kirk’s shooting, which he has called a “political assassination.” He’s given multiple impassioned speeches — including one on Friday, when officials announced the suspected shooter, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, had been taken into custody — calling the shooting a “watershed (moment) in American history.” 
“The question is,” Cox said on Friday, “what kind of watershed? And that chapter remains to be written. Is this the end of a dark chapter in our history, or the beginning of a darker chapter in our history?” 
During appearances on NBC’s “Meet the Press” and on CNN over the weekend, Cox repeatedly pointed to an escalation of political violence in the U.S. in recent years — and he urged Americans to not wait for a political leader, whether it’s a president or a governor, to “lead us out of this,” but instead take individual actions to build bridges in their communities. 
He also repeatedly warned of the dangers of social media, which he called a “cancer on our society.”
‘Our nation is broken,’ Utah Gov. Cox says of Charlie Kirk assassination

“I can’t emphasize enough the damage that social media and the internet is doing to all of us. Those dopamine hits, these companies — trillion-dollar market caps, the most powerful companies in the history of the world — have figured out how to hack our brains, get us addicted to outrage … and get us to hate each other,” Cox said on “Meet the Press.”
Cox said he’s watched it happen “in real time” in the wake of Kirk’s killing, and “in every corner of our society.” 
“The conflict entrepreneurs are taking advantage of us. And we are losing agency,” Cox said. “We have to take that back. We have to turn it off. We have to get back to the community, caring about our neighbors, the things that make America great.”
It’s not the first time Cox has tried to encourage civility in politics — or has gone after social media companies. 
When he served as chair of the National Governor’s Association, Cox championed a “Disagree Better” campaign meant to discourage hyperpolarization and hate. And Cox has been a vocal supporter of Utah legislative efforts to regulate teen use of social media. Utah state leaders have also filed four lawsuits against major social media companies, including Meta, TikTok and Snapchat, over how addictive algorithms interact with minors.

State and local officials have not yet revealed more details about Kirk’s suspected shooter’s motives, but Cox pointed to shell casing engravings that indicated anti-fascist messages and vulgar internet memes. He also said, according to accounts from friends and family, that Robinson seemed to have been “radicalized.” 
“Clearly there was a lot of gaming going on. Friends that have confirmed that there was kind of that deep, dark internet, the Reddit culture, and these other dark places of the internet where this person was going deep,” Cox said on “Meet the Press,” adding that the bullet casing inscriptions seem to show “the meme-ification that is happening in our society today.” 
Cox, in his message to Utah’s college students on Monday, acknowledged that the past week has been “incredibly tough.” 
“Right now, it may feel like rage is the only language in our politics, but you have the power to choose differently,” Cox said. “Every person you meet is more than a party, or more than a label, more than a post online. Everyone deserves dignity and respect.” 
That means, Cox said, “talking to people you disagree with, listening even when it’s hard, and forgiving, even when it feels impossible.”

“Campuses like yours must be a place of the free exchange of ideas,” he said. “It’s critical to our American experiment.” 
The governor challenged students to “spend less time online, where outrage has become so normal, and more time in the real world.” 
“Put down your phone. Read something that lifts your spirit. Go outside. Laugh with your friends. Serve your neighbors,” he said. “Remember, what happens online is not real life.” 
Cox also urged anyone who is skeptical whether “this can actually make a difference,” to “look around.”
“When tragedy struck this past week, there weren’t riots or destruction. There were vigils, prayers, and people coming together,” he said. “That’s the Utah way. Your generation can carry that forward.”

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)State and federal lawmakers have turned their eyes toward Iowa’s institutions of higher education as the fallout from right-wing podcaster Charlie Kirk’s death continues, with Iowa university employees allegedly joining others online speaking about the incident in a positive light.
Rep. Taylor Collins, R-Mediapolis, and Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, signed a letter directed to the Iowa Board of Regents this weekend calling for the immediate firing of employees who they said “publicly celebrated his killing online.”
“Each instance of social media posts with cheers, taunting, and vile glee is more disturbing than the last,” the letter stated. “Such behavior is sickening – no American’s death should be celebrated, especially by those charged with the honorable duty of educating Iowa’s youth.”

Kirk was shot last week while holding a public speaking event at Utah Valley University through his organization, Turning Point USA.
Collins identified the social media posts mentioned in the letter as coming from two Iowa State University employees, though the Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to independently verify the posts.
One of the posters stated they are “pretty sure we’re all okay with political violence,” but did not mention Kirk or the shooting. The other pointed out comments previously made by Kirk as to the trade-off of gun deaths and 2nd Amendment rights, saying in their post he “got what was coming” and they are “happy he’s rotting in hell now.”
The comments referenced in the post come from a speech by Kirk in 2023, according to a Newsweek article from the time, during which he said he believes some gun deaths annually are worth having the 2nd Amendment — calling it the “cost” of getting to own guns and “protect our other God-given rights.”
ISU spokesperson Angie Hunt said in an email the university doesn’t have any comment on the employees, posts or possible investigation.
Iowa Board of Regents President Sherry Bates released multiple statements in the wake of the killing, the first reaffirming the board’s belief in free speech and that “no one should feel unsafe when sharing their views.” She stated in her second statement, released Sept. 12, that the board was aware of posts from university students and employees on Kirk, and his death “should not be celebrated.”
“These posts and others like them are offensive, insensitive, and in no way reflect the views of the Board of Regents or its universities,” Bates said in her statement on social media posts. “The comments are inconsistent with the Board’s values to create a civil and respectful environment at our public universities.”


Regents president highlights campus intellectual freedom centers
Bates also mentioned in her first statement, released Sept. 11, how efforts to form “civic and intellectual freedom centers” on public university campuses show the board’s commitment to keeping Iowa’s public colleges safe and respectful of “open dialogue.”
“These centers will provide scholarship and discussion regarding our great nation and the Constitutional principles on which it was founded,” Bates said in her statement. “Differing opinions will be heard, but threats and violence are unacceptable and will not be tolerated.”
The board is set to approve the membership of an advisory council to the University of Iowa’s center for intellectual freedom at its meeting this week, with the center currently in formation after state law required it.
Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks said in a post on X that the UI should name its new center after Kirk, which would honor who she described as “a true defender of free speech and open debate.”


However, Collins’s and Evans’s letter stated such statements are not enough to fix what they’ve identified as wrong on Iowa college campuses.
The social media posts referenced by Collins are proof of how far higher education has strayed from its base mission, the letter stated, and universities are no longer “the epicenter of civil debate and respectful discourse, the very pillar of Charlie Kirk’s ethos.”
“Boilerplate press releases will not solve the culture problem on our college campuses – only decisive action with a clear red line,” the letter stated. “Today, we are calling for any university employees who celebrated the death of their fellow American to be terminated immediately.”
Board of Regents spokesperson Josh Lehman said in an email he has nothing to add from the statements made by Bates last week, in response to questions sent by the Iowa Capital Dispatch about the social media posts and whether they have been verified by the board.
The board will go into closed session Wednesday morning, Lehman said in his email — a late addition to the Sept. 17-18 meeting agenda.
According to the closed session notice, the board will discuss items relating to student and employee records and “evaluate the professional competency of an individual whose appointment, hiring, performance or discharge is being considered as necessary to prevent needless and irreparable injury to that individual’s reputation.” They will also discuss topics involving current or imminent litigation, according to the notice.
Universities in Mississippi and South Carolina have already suspended or fired employees for making online comments about Kirk’s death, including Clemson University and the University of Mississippi.
PEN America, the U.S. branch of an international nonprofit dedicated to protecting free expression, released a statement expressing alarm at faculty and staff losing their jobs across the U.S. for posting about Kirk, from Florida to Tennessee and more.
PEN America Program Director for Campus Free Speech Kristen Shahverdian said in the release “knee-jerk dismissals” of faculty and staff for online comments “raises concerns about institutions responding to political pressure and social media outrage” rather than reviewing cases with due process and with the same standards.
“Faculty in particular have broad leeway to speak on issues of the day, a necessary protection for academic freedom and scholarship. However, when administrators fire faculty over social media commentary—whether that speech is offensive or topical—they set a precedent that will be used to silence scholars and students across the spectrum,” Shahverdian said in the release.  “These firings reverberate beyond the campus walls, creating a culture of fear across society at large.  Universities should rebuke violent rhetoric and condemn offensive speech, but they should not impose blanket firings on protected speech.”

The FAIR Plan faces accusations of denying smoke-damage claims and more. Can California lawmakers keep the insurer of last resort accountable?


In the closing days of the legislative year, California lawmakers sent Gov. Gavin Newsom a bill that is meant to toughen scrutiny of the state’s embattled fire insurer of last result by insisting that two of their leaders join its governing committee.
Assembly Bill 234 would put the state’s two top lawmakers — currently Senate President Pro Tem Mike McGuire and Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas — on the governing committee of the FAIR Plan, the insurer that’s mandated by law to sell policies to homeowners who can’t get them from other insurance companies. But the lawmakers or their representatives would be non-voting members of the committee, raising concerns about the bill’s effectiveness.
The FAIR Plan, which is an alliance of insurers that do business in the state, has grown to more than 610,000 policies as of June, a 154% increase since September 2021. It has become one of the largest insurers in California as other insurance companies have canceled or stopped issuing new policies here, citing growing wildfire risk. The plan is run by its member insurers — not the state. Its governing committee consists of mostly insurance representatives, though the governor appoints some non-voting members.
Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara asked the governor to sign the bill, saying in a letter dated Saturday that it “will help further needed transparency of this insurance safety net while supporting legislative policymakers’ oversight efforts.”
The bill, which the Assembly sent to the governor on Saturday, would be effective immediately and comes at a time of numerous challenges for the FAIR Plan:

It faces lawsuits from homeowners who say they have been denied coverage for their smoke-damage claims from the Los Angeles County fires in January. Hilary McLean, spokesperson for the FAIR Plan, said the plan would not comment on ongoing litigation.
In July, the state’s Insurance Department filed legal action (not a lawsuit) against the plan, accusing it of denying more than 200 smoke-damage claims and saying the department’s multiyear investigation found hundreds of violations of consumer-protection laws. The FAIR Plan has responded to the department’s Order to Show Cause by requesting a hearing before a state administrative body. McLean said the plan has been working with the department over the past year to “update and clarify its policy language around smoke damage, so the language reflects the manner in which these claims are being adjusted.”
Earlier this month, Gov. Gavin Newsom accused the FAIR Plan of violating court orders related to covering smoke damage and urging it to start approving smoke-damage claims “expeditiously.” McLean said the plan “appreciates Gov. Newsom’s concerns about handling claims quickly and fairly. We are committed to ensuring that every policyholder is treated with compassion, respect and in full accordance with California law.” She said the plan will submit a response to the governor this week.

McLean said the plan does not have a position on the governing-committee legislation.
The smoke-damage complaints come on top of numerous other issues FAIR Plan policyholders and insurance professionals have raised. As CalMatters reported last year and earlier this year, those include poor customer service, payment delays and slow response times, which the plan attributed to growing pains.
Lara supported the bill, saying in a submitted argument that “the FAIR Plan…must work harder to be more accountable to the public.”
The Consumer Federation of California opposed the bill, criticizing it for not having enough teeth. 
“Is it a bad thing? Probably not,” Robert Herrell, executive director of the nonprofit group, told CalMatters. “But if anybody thinks that putting two non-voting members on the committee is going to be meaningful, they’re deluding themselves.” 
Herrell, a former deputy insurance commissioner under former Commissioner Dave Jones, said the FAIR Plan governing committee — which is mostly made up of the insurance industry — will still have the ability to conduct business behind closed doors.
Joel Laucher, who also worked under Jones and is now a program specialist at consumer advocacy group United Policyholders, used to go to the FAIR Plan’s governing committee meetings as chief deputy commissioner of rate regulation. He said at several meetings, he would have to wait while the committee’s executives went into closed sessions.
“They stated that their executive sessions were privileged, confidential and not open to the department,” Laucher said. 
But he said it could still be useful to have state lawmakers on the committee who could learn more about the workings of the FAIR Plan. “Having direct experience as a legislator might provide them with some understanding and information they might need to initiate broader authority over the FAIR Plan,” he said.
During the vote on Friday, Democratic Sen. Anna Caballero of Merced said the roles of the two lawmakers or their representatives would “mirror that of the governor’s four existing non-voting appointees.”  
Paying claims over time
The Legislature also passed AB 226, which will allow the FAIR Plan to get bond financing through the California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank. The bill aims to ensure the plan, which has warned about its continued ability to pay claims, will be able to spread out financing its claims payments over time. 
Assemblymember David Alvarez, the Democrat from Chula Vista who co-authored the bill, told CalMatters that funding for the FAIR Plan was a priority for the Legislature.  
“If the FAIR Plan became insolvent, our (insurance) crisis would become a disaster,” said Sen. Roger Niello, the Republican from Roseville who’s vice chair of the Senate insurance committee. 
Automatic payments
Lastly, lawmakers sent AB 290 to the governor’s desk. The bill requires the FAIR Plan to establish a system for its policyholders to make automatic payments. The FAIR Plan originally opposed the bill but now has no position on it, McLean said. The plan will have to create the system to give policyholders the automatic-payment option by April 1, 2026, but policyholders cannot be canceled or not renewed if they don’t enroll in it.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/010824_Eaton-Fire_JH_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-09-15 17:56:46.537810

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Supreme Court has temporarily blocked controversial new academic standards for social studies education while a lawsuit challenging their constitutionality is pending.
Oklahoma public schools must revert to the previous version of the social studies standards approved in 2019, the Court ruled in a 5-2 decision issued Monday. The justices decided the state cannot enforce nor spend funds to implement the 2025 social studies standards until the Court issues another order in the case. 
A group of 33 Oklahoma parents, teachers and faith leaders filed the case with the state Supreme Court on July 1, contending the new standards unconstitutionally impose Christian beliefs on public school students.
The plaintiffs also contend the Oklahoma State Department of Education and the state Board of Education failed to uphold state laws and regulations, including the Oklahoma Open Meeting Act, when approving the new standards in February. 
Half of the board’s sitting members said they were unaware the version of the standards they approved contained significant differences from the original draft the Education Department released in December. Key differences include disputed claims that there were “discrepancies” in 2020 presidential election results and that the origin of COVID-19 was a Chinese lab.
The Education Department waited weeks after the vote to publicly share the version of the standards with the new content included. Neither the board’s meeting agenda nor state agency staff acknowledged the changes before the vote.
Academic standards are a lengthy list of topics that Oklahoma public schools must teach to students at certain grade levels.
The plaintiffs contend the new social studies standards would violate students’ religious liberties by requiring schools to teach from the Bible.
Under the new standards, elementary students have to learn Bible stories and Jesus’ teachings “that influenced the American colonists, founders and culture.” In fifth and eighth grades, students must be taught the Judeo-Christian values that influenced America’s founders.
Attorneys from the national organization Americans United for Separation of Church and State and the local Oklahoma Appleseed Center for Law and Justice are representing the plaintiffs.
“Public school classrooms may not be used to endorse religious doctrine — no matter what the religion is or how many people follow it,” said Brent Rowland, Oklahoma Appleseed’s legal director. “Blocking these standards means Oklahoma students can learn history and civics in a way that respects every family’s beliefs while inspiring them to think critically, ask questions, and engage as informed members of our democracy. This ruling moves us toward the open, rigorous, and inclusive public education our students deserve.”
The state Department of Education did not immediately comment on the Court ruling 
Justices James Winchester, James Edmondson, Douglas Combs, Noma Gurich and Richard Darby concurred in the decision.
Chief Justice Dustin Rowe and Justice John Kane IV dissented. Two justices, Dana Kuehn and Travis Jett, recused.
Kane issued a single quote in dissent, stating he would prefer the case first go through a trial court.
Rowe wrote a full dissenting opinion, stating a trial court rather than the Supreme Court is meant to review the allegations of an Open Meeting Act violation.
“The 2025-2026 school year is well underway with the 2025 Standards in effect in school districts across the state,” Rowe wrote. “To issue an injunction at this point — months after the alleged Open Meeting Act violation and after the 2025-2026 academic has commenced-would be contrary to our legal precedent and disruptive to school curriculum statewide.”

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)Rural hospitals are less likely to offer obstetric services after they’ve been acquired by a larger health system, leading to mixed outcomes for mothers and babies, according to new research.
It’s part of an accelerating trend that’s reshaped how Americans get health care: Larger health systems gobble up smaller facilities in a bid for financial stability.
“The hospital industry has undergone tremendous transformation over the past few decades, with nearly 1,600 mergers between 1998 and 2021,” said Martin Gaynor, a coauthor of the study and emeritus professor of economics and public policy at Carnegie Mellon, in a statement.
Those large-scale changes to the health system can affect costs, quality and access to care, he said.
Over the past five years, more than 100 rural hospitals have stopped delivering babies or announced they’ll stop in 2025, according to the most recent data from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform. Less than half of rural hospitals still offer labor and delivery services.
Gaynor and a team of researchers from Carnegie Mellon, Northwestern University and the University of Georgia examined how hospital mergers have affected access to obstetric care in rural areas, and the quality of that care. They found that rural hospitals were part of more than 450 mergers from 2006-2019.
Once those rural hospitals were acquired by larger systems, they were 30% less likely to still offer labor and delivery services five years later. Many of the shuttered obstetric departments were the sole local source of obstetric care.
That loss translated to fewer resources — such as practicing OB-GYNs — in the county where the acquired hospital was located, researchers found.
The number of births in those counties didn’t change; families just had to go elsewhere for care.
Less access to nearby care could explain those counties’ small increases in health problems among women during or after pregnancy and child birth, and higher rates of smoking among pregnant women, researchers said.
On the flip side, they found that some patients went to higher-quality facilities farther away. And in rural hospitals that didn’t close their obstetric departments following a merger, the quality of care tended to rise.
‘Expensive and complicated’: Most rural hospitals no longer deliver babies

In recent years, officials in dozens of states have championed laws to increase oversight of mergers and other health care dealmaking.
In the wake of devastating hospital closures tied to corporate financial maneuvering, some states have strengthened their antitrust laws.
Last year alone, 22 states enacted at least 34 laws related to health system consolidation and competition, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, an advisory think tank for lawmakers. Other states, meanwhile, have paved the way for health mergers in a bid to save failing rural hospitals.
At least 35 states now require hospitals, health systems, providers and private equity firms to notify a state official of proposed mergers or other contracts.
Earlier this month, California lawmakers passed a bill to expand the state’s authority in overseeing mergers and acquisitions in health care. It’s headed to Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s desk, though Newsom vetoed a similar measure last year.
At the federal level, President Donald Trump’s administration has not signaled an interest in increasing antitrust oversight. But Trump’s recent tax and spending law did include $50 billion in funding over the next decade aimed at helping states strengthen rural health care. Massive cuts to Medicaid also in the law could have devastating impacts on rural hospitals struggling to stay afloat, however.
The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services this week announced that states have until Nov. 5 to apply for rural health funding. States must show that they’ll use the federal dollars in a way that aligns with certain CMS goals, including helping improve access to care and strengthening retention of health care workers.

School officials from Stowe and Morristown said a merger is the best possible scenario for what they called a likelihood of district consolidation under H.454.

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in News & Citizen on Sept. 11, 2025.
Seven years after their state-arranged marriage and four years after the voter-approved divorce, the Stowe and Elmore-Morristown school boards have unanimously passed resolutions recommending another merger.
After school board meetings on Monday and Tuesday, Lamoille South Supervisory Union Superintendent Ryan Heraty, who oversees schools in Stowe, Morristown and Elmore, submitted the resolutions to the Vermont Legislature’s School District Redistricting Task Force, which has been tasked with drafting new school district boundaries under H.454, a bill that tees up sweeping education reform for the state.

“If the redistricting task force requires a merger of the Stowe School District, we support a joint district with the Elmore-Morristown Unified Union School District (EMUU),” reads the resolution.
School officials from Stowe and Morristown said a merger is the best possible scenario for what they called a likelihood of district consolidation under H.454. While they’d prefer keeping individual districts, the officials said a lack of representation on the redistricting task force might lead to a greater consolidation of the greater Lamoille County school system, which includes three supervisory unions with more than 20 schools spread out over roughly 400 square miles. According to Heraty, that would be disastrous.
H.454, which passed in June, established a new student-weighted formula for state education funding and a process for drawing larger school districts across Vermont. The initiatives go together, according to Heraty, a PhD candidate in education leadership and policy who has been outspoken about the bill’s potentially negative effects on rural schools.
“They need to draw new districts to make their formula work,” Heraty said.
The redistricting task force has until December to draft new districts, at which point it will present them to the Legislature. The group met on Wednesday in Waterbury, after press deadline, and discussed two potential models for district consolidation, one based on counties and another based on regional technical education centers, according to agenda items. In this case, Green Mountain Technology and Career Center also serves schools in the Lamoille North and Orleans Southwest supervisory unions.
At this week’s meetings, Stowe and Morristown-Elmore school board members and Heraty spoke against those types of districts. Under the state’s proposed funding formula, Stowe and Morristown-Elmore work well together, they said, but folding them into a bigger district will have a negative impact on students, teachers, administration and taxpayers.
‘It’s like when you get married’
The Stowe and Elmore-Morristown districts are well-positioned for a merger, Heraty said. The boards and administration have already navigated one before and many of the same players are still around, and the schools, which are relatively connected geographically, share sports teams and transportation routes. But most importantly for some school officials, Stowe and Elmore-Morristown are solvent, and they don’t want to incur new debt.
“Nobody is talking about debt right now, but it’s a huge factor,” Heraty said,
It’s not like the schools in Stowe and Morristown don’t need work — Stowe voters rejected a $39 million bond in 2023. Instead of bond votes, the districts have opted to chip away at capital projects with smaller investments from the reserve fund year after year, Heraty said.
The Lamoille North Supervisory Union has taken a different approach. Over the past decade or so, the district has taken on five bonds totaling more $18 million for school projects, including $10 million for Hyde Park Elementary School. The oldest bond retires in June 2027 and the youngest June 2048.
“It’s a puzzle lawmakers haven’t solved,” Heraty said. “As soon as they start saying to taxpayers, ‘You’re going to have to encumber debt you didn’t vote for,’ people are going to revolt.”
Rep. Rebecca Holcombe, D-Norwich, a redistricting task force member and former Vermont Secretary of Education, said the debt implications vary based on how the districts shape up.
“It’s like when you get married, you marry someone with all their blessings and faults,” Holcombe said. “Everybody brings something to the table.”
According to the resolutions, the combined district would also balance under the state’s new student-weighted funding formula. For example, Stowe alone would lose millions, Heraty said, but combining with Morristown-Elmore — and creating a district with a demographically diverse population and a relatively large student body and property grand list — would generate enough funding to cover expenses.
Jed Lipsky, I-Stowe, who voted against H.454, said the proposed merger is the best possible scenario, given the legislation coming down the pike.
“There’s going to be a lot of change statewide,” Lipsky said. “Hopefully ours will be minimal, but it would be a great first step to have Lamoille South restructured as it had been.”
Déjà vu?
On Tuesday night, the Elmore-Morristown school board passed the resolution unanimously after a four-minute conversation, but the Stowe vote was drawn out over two meetings.
During the initial conversation for Stowe last week, the proposed resolution took board member Andrew Kohn by surprise, and he requested more time to review it. Board member Ryan Bennett was also absent from that meeting.
“I’m afraid of the public’s view of this,” Kohn said. “I’d be very uncomfortable reversing a 3-2 majority vote from two years ago that separated the districts without having public input on whether they want to join again.”
In 2018, the Stowe and Elmore-Morristown school districts were forced to merge under Act 46, which passed three years earlier, but local representatives and school leaders fought tooth and nail to overturn the merger. The effort was reaffirmed by a 1,068-464 vote to separate in 2021.
To some voters, this week’s recommendation to merge again may represent a flip-flop from 2021, but Stowe school board chair Tiffany Donza said the board is merely responding to the state’s changing education policies over the last two and a half decades.
Donza supported the separation in 2021. At the time, Stowe was pursuing a $39 million bond for renovations to the middle and high school, and she didn’t feel it was fair to burden Morristown-Elmore taxpayers with that expense. Had Donza known the bond would fail, she said she might have felt differently about the separation. She noted that Stowe’s property tax rate shot up after the separation due to Act 127, which landed around the same time.
Unlike with Act 46, Donza said the fight with H.454 isn’t exclusive to maintaining individual districts. Act 60 in 1997 was about funding, Act 46 was about a governance structure and H.454 is about both, she said.
“That’s the biggest part people need to understand,” Donza said. “The new funding formula is going to get overlaid on districts, and if they left us alone it will be a form of punishment, intentional punishment, because we won’t have the money to operate our schools.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Gov. Dan McKee announced Monday afternoon his administration will give the cash-strapped Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) over half a million dollars, but it won’t go toward the agency’s operational costs.
Instead, $510,000 has been earmarked for three projects meant to help the state’s public bus agency meet Rhode Island’s lofty climate goals.
The funding is part of a larger $1.5 million fiscal 2026 spending plan approved by the Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council (EC4) at its meeting Monday afternoon.
“The approval of this funding represents continued investment in Rhode Island’s progress toward a climate-resilient future,” McKee said.
And crucial to that task, the governor said, is in exploring lower cost transit options as outlined in the “budget framework” he reached with the agency to avoid bus driver layoffs under a now abandoned plan originally proposed July 24 to address a $10 million budget deficit. 
RIPTA was considering cutting or reducing 58 routes but instead will reduce service by cutting some buses, reducing schedule spans, decreasing frequency, and getting rid of segments on 46 different lines.
In return, McKee is filling RIPTA’s deficit with $3 million in federal Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality funds the agency will have to pay back later. 
The $510,000 is for three specific programs: on-demand transit services, a “vanpool” subsidy program, and a new effort to promote public transportation to visitors traveling to Rhode Island.
The bulk of RIPTA’s share of the financial package — $440,000 — will go toward trips that can be booked in advance in Newport, Middletown, Narragansett, South Kingstown and Woonsocket.
Another $15,000 is earmarked toward continuing RIPTA’s “vanpool” services, which allows a group of commuters to lease a shared vehicle through Enterprise Rent-A-Car and use it for daily commutes in areas without robust bus service. Costs to use a van vary based on mileage, but start around $50 a month, according to RIPTA.
In return, the statewide bus agency provides commuters with a $100 subsidy. The EC4’s spending plan adds an additional $200 monthly subsidy for new vanpool riders.
The remaining $55,000 for RIPTA will be used to promote transit to offer roughly 4,000 complimentary bus passes to travelers who fly into Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport and stay in nearby hotels.
Funding is not allowed to be used toward RIPTA operations, Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management spokesperson Kim Keough confirmed in a phone call Monday afternoon. She said EC4 funding is only eligible for the three earmarked projects and must be spent within a year.
Funds are expected to be disbursed in November or December, Keough said in a text message.
RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand thanked the McKee administration for the $500,000.
“This funding will allow RIPTA to not only improve mobility for residents, workers, and tourists, but also help grow ridership and advance Rhode Island’s long-term climate and transportation goals,” he said in a statement.

The voluntary program connects defendants with trained community navigators who refer them to mental health treatment and other services. If a defendant successfully completes a navigation plan in collaboration with court staff, the courts will dismiss the charges against them. Those who fail to remain engaged with available services will still face criminal proceedings.
To be eligible, someone must meet three criteria: have a confirmed severe mental illness; be charged with a misdemeanor — except for DWI — or a nonviolent felony; and have had their competency raised in a criminal case in the last five years or have been ordered into assisted outpatient treatment or civil commitment in a locked psychiatric facility.
The Administrative Office of the Courts and the First Judicial District Court announced the project on Sept. 8, but launched it in April, according to the program’s first monthly report. In the program’s first three months, court officials clarified its eligibility criteria; expanded how they collect data on it; and hired the University of New Mexico to study its implementation and outcomes, the report states.
The project in July screened 670 cases of people held in local jails, determined nine people were eligible and enrolled three, the report states. A tenth person was found eligible and enrolled earlier, either in May or June, AOC Spokesperson Barry Massey told Source NM. Of the four who initially enrolled, only one remained as of publication, with the others failing to meet the program’s criteria. Eligibility decisions were pending in four cases.
Court officials shared the data at the program’s launch celebration Friday in Presiding Judge Donita Sena’s courtroom at the Santa Fe County Magistrate Court.
“If we have a defendant that is going to come through our courts, and they need resources, and if we have that ability to give that to them, then by God, that’s what we’re going to do,” Sena told the people gathered in the courthouse.
The pilot program is designed to serve up to 30 participants at any given time, the report states, based on funding and navigation service delivery. It is meant to help a “very narrow” population, AOC Senior Statewide Behavioral Health Manager Stacey Boone said at the event on Friday.
Across the state in July, in the four existing competency diversion pilot projects, 65 people were found eligible and 22 people enrolled, according to AOC data. There were 62 active cases and six graduations, the data show.
State Supreme Court Justice Briana Zamora, the court’s liaison to the Commission on Mental Health and Competency that started the pilots, said for too long, many people found to be incompetent have cycled through the criminal legal system because instead of receiving timely treatment or services, they sit in jail waiting for their cases to be dismissed.
“This pilot program is about intervention over incarceration,” Zamora said in remarks at the event. “It is about giving people a real chance to stabilize, recover and return to our community with dignity and support.”

Sept. 12, 2025. (Photo by Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — For the second month in a row, Nebraska’s general fund tax receipts came in modestly above forecasts, but there’s still a ways to go to fill the state’s projected deficit.
The Department of Revenue released Nebraska’s August tax receipts Monday showing a net gain of 2% over what Nebraska’s Economic Forecasting Advisory Board predicted in April. That jump equates to roughly $12 million in additional tax revenues flowing into the state’s coffers.
Nebraska ended the last fiscal year with net tax receipts down about $86 million from forecasts, leading to a projected state budget deficit of about $95 million.
The latest receipts help with filling that deficit, along with Nebraska’s July receipts being roughly $20 million higher than projections. The forecasting board considers these reports when making revenue projections, Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent said.

But the progress also must contend with other economic factors, including the federal budget reconciliation bill. A different revenue report that came out earlier this month shared that the new tax and spending law could cost Nebraska’s state government about $216 million over the next two years.
The biggest contributors to higher revenues in August were individual income taxes, which came in 5.1% above projections, and sales and use taxes, which came in 3.2% above projections.
Neither Patent nor Appropriations Committee Chair State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood was certain about the reasons why. Patent said September is usually a high revenue month for the state because that’s when estimated tax payments are due. Perhaps enough people paid early to account for the increase, but she said she couldn’t be sure. Clements also speculated that it might be business officials paying taxes for their businesses through individual income taxes.
On the flip side, corporate income taxes came in 31.2% below projections for August. Neither Clements or Patent could say with any certainty what caused that either.
July and August’s receipts broke a months-long pattern of Nebraska’s tax revenues falling below forecasts. However, Clements and Patent each said it’s too early to say whether this is a sign the state’s monthly revenues will keep moving in a positive direction.
“One month at a time,” Clements said. “We’re just watching it.”

Sanders contacted Republican Party of Arkansas Chairman Joseph Wood and Democratic Party of Arkansas Chairman Col. Marcus Jones to certify the vacancy on Monday, according to a news release from Sanders’ office.
Each party must notify Sanders or her chief legal counsel, Cortney Kennedy, within 10 days whether they plan to hold a primary election or a convention of delegates in order to choose their candidate for the special election, according to the news release.
Stubblefield, a Republican from Branch, died Sept. 2 at the age of 74. He had served a dozen years in the Senate and previously four years in the House of Representatives. He lay in state at the Capitol on Thursday, and his funeral and burial occurred Saturday in Charleston.
Senate District 26 includes parts of Franklin, Johnson, Logan and Sebastian counties. Stubblefield won reelection last year to a term that ends in 2029.
The most recent special election for the Arkansas Legislature was in February 2022 when Republican Colby Fulfer narrowly defeated Democrat Lisa Parks to represent a portion of Northwest Arkansas. Both parties held primary elections before the general election.
Fulfer succeeded Sen. Lance Eads, R-Springdale, who resigned in October 2021 to take a position with a consulting firm. Fulfer left the Senate at the end of Eads’ term in 2023.

(Courtesy of Brookings Register)The halcyon days of the for-profit newspaper are over, and that’s not news.
There are just too many competing sources of information for printed papers to command the kind of attention and rake in the kind of advertising dollars they did in the pre-internet era.
But that doesn’t mean the days of newspapers are gone.
At least that’s the bet Corey Champion and his father, Scott, made last month. 
Scott is the CEO of North Carolina-based Champion Media, which acquired four South Dakota newspapers that were shuttered without notice in early August by News Media Corp. That Illinois company blamed the closures on down times for newspapers, and on the collapse of a deal that would’ve sold its 30-plus mostly rural newspapers to another company.
When the deal died, so did the Huron Plainsman, Brookings Register, Moody County Enterprise and Redfield Press. 
Corey, chief financial officer for Champion Media, talked recently with South Dakota Searchlight about why his North Carolina-based company decided to bring the papers back to life.
The following conversation is edited for length and clarity.
How did your family wind up in the newspaper business?
I’m the third generation in the newspaper business. My grandfather and grandmother started a penny saver [a freely distributed local advertising publication] in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and then another one in Monmouth, Illinois. They eventually sold out to a company that later became known as Gannett [owner of USA Today and the Argus Leader, among others]. 
Company’s sudden shutdown closes four newspapers in eastern South Dakota

My father actually stayed on board with the company when they sold out, worked his way up. At the time, I was still in college, getting my master’s degree in accounting from the University of Iowa. Afterward, I went and worked for the Kohler company for a while, and kind of specialized in accounting, and then mergers and acquisitions, which I really enjoy doing.
In 2017, my dad had decided it was time to go out on his own. And I was just wrapping up the sale of a furniture company with Kohler, and we decided that we were going to get together. We purchased a group of newspapers from Civitas Media in North Carolina and South Carolina. And then shortly after, purchased the Maysville, Kentucky, Ledger Independent from Lee Enterprises [owner of the Rapid City Journal, among others]. We brought them back private from the corporate side.
How does your company approach the news business?
What we try to do is try to stay very small, nimble and lean, but offer all the back end support — accounting, human resources, finance — so these little community newspapers can just concentrate on reporting local news and selling local advertising. That’s essentially what our business model is. We support these local communities so the staff don’t have to worry about opening mail, cutting checks or worrying about what the payables are. 
How does that work for you financially?
Our values are supporting local journalism and communities. We’re not really out trying to make money for shareholders. We’re essentially just trying to stay profitable, and to not lose money in any market. And the nice thing about being so small and nimble is that we understand that some markets have down years and other other markets have good years. We don’t have to pull the plug in a market because they had one down year. 
A dangerous void grows as South Dakota newspapers close

And we’re very conscious of what we spend our money on. If we can operate our office in 1,000 square feet and make sure it’s affordable and sustainable, that’s what we’re going to do. If we don’t need an internet and a cable service in our office, we’re not going to add a cable service. We try to make all the cuts where we can, so that we can spend our money on pay for the employees. 
That’s really the hardest part in this industry. It’s kind of like being a teacher. There are a lot of teachers, and there are a lot of journalists, that don’t do it for the money. You get rewarded in a lot of other ways.
That’s something that often gets lost when you read about newspapers falling apart. For 100 years, there was no internet, and the newspaper was the primary source of information. It basically printed its own money. Those are the glory days everybody thinks and talks about. That doesn’t exist anymore. And so if you’re a shareholder buying publicly traded stock, thinking that you’re going to buy something that’s going to go back to its glory days, that’s not going to happen.
How did you learn about this opportunity for these four papers?
I got a phone call and heard kind of through the grapevine what was happening. After doing some basic research on the markets, I thought ‘you know, these are really good communities.’ With a few changes, I felt like they could be a sustainable market. 
For example, cutting the days, from printing five days a week to two days a week. I’d say that’s more of a standard practice nowadays. The majority of our costs are actually associated with the delivery costs, coming from the post office, that we have absolutely no control over. 
When you’re looking at how much people are paying for a subscription and how much it costs to deliver them a paper five days a week, you’re losing money on every paper you deliver. But if you only deliver two days a week, it cuts that expense way down and lets you send out a better, bigger paper, where you give people more of what they want to read.
Are we talking about a two-day-a-week product in Huron and Brookings?
The weeklies (Redfield Press and Moody County Enterprise) will stay weekly, but Brookings and Huron will be two days a week. I would love to keep putting out a paper five days a week, but I would rather put out a paper two days a week than put out no paper at all, right? That’s kind of what it comes down to.
Had you been to South Dakota before? Did you know much about the state before this?
We have a paper in North Dakota, then up to Minnesota. I’ve been to Minnesota and North Dakota. I figured it wouldn’t be much different. Plus I grew up in Iowa and Illinois. They’re kind of just good old Midwest towns, and I really believe those good Midwest towns will still support their local newspaper and local journalism. That was a piece that I really liked.
So what is the future? How long does it last? Where are we going in the long term?
There’s a huge uptick in our digital, online readership. A print paper isn’t going to be printed forever. But local journalists, and the newspaper aspect of writing local content to gain readership and selling advertising to help support it, then finding enough community members to buy subscriptions to support it, that will always continue. In a smaller market that doesn’t have a TV station, that maybe has a radio station, people heavily rely on us to communicate to them about what’s going on. They need a watchdog. 
I think what happened here is a good example. When these papers abruptly shut down, everybody in the community kind of realized that they actually missed their newspaper, and they wanted it more than they were giving the paper credit for. Oftentimes newspapers get a bad rap, where people like to complain about the content in the paper. But then when there’s no content at all, there’s really a void that they don’t want to have in their community. 
So I think that the newspapers will continue forever. I wouldn’t be in this industry if I thought otherwise. I just don’t know that the actual print paper will last forever.

Francetta L. Mays earlier this month filed paperwork with the Oklahoma Secretary of State’s office in hopes of putting the idea before voters in the form of State Question 838.
The measure asks voters to designate June 1 as “Greenwood Remembrance and Reconciliation Day.”
The day would recognize the trauma the overlooked community is still suffering, Mays said Monday.
“Lives were lost,” Mays said. “The economic development of the community has suffered.”
Mays is associate pastor of Vernon AME Church in the Greenwood District. The church is the only surviving Black-owned structure from the 1921 race massacre.
The day would recognize and honor the victims and survivors of the Tulsa Race Massacre, which occurred from May 31 to June 1, 1921. White mobs burned and destroyed 35 blocks of Black homes and businesses in the Tulsa neighborhood. Officially around three dozen residents died, but some estimate as many as 300 people were killed. 
The proposed measure would not have a fiscal impact on the state.
It seeks to create a new law.
Because it is a new law and not a constitutional amendment, 92,262 signatures would be needed to put the measure on the ballot. A constitutional change requires 172,993 signatures to get on the ballot. 
Michael Byrd, of Washington, D.C., runs the Bridge Points Project, which works to unstick “the most stuck political issues with ballot measures.” The organization is partnering with Mays on the proposed state question.
If approved by voters, the measure would just create a day of observance, he said.
“I can’t think of any more of an Oklahoma issue than the Tulsa Race Massacre,” he said.
Polling indicates it has a super majority of support, he said.
Byrd said he expects the process to go quite smoothly. Supporters hope to get it on the November 2026 general election ballot, he said.
Rep. Ronald Stewart Jr., D-Tulsa, said the event is significant enough to be recognized with state day of remembrance.
Stewart said he recognizes that talking about historical events sometimes is met with resistance.
“In order to learn and progress from our history, the good, bad or the ugly, recognition such as this goes a long way in the healing process and the planning of our future,” Stewart said.

(Photo by Jerry Cornfield/Washington State Standard)Thousands of state government and community college employees in Washington have overwhelmingly ratified a new one-year contract that would secure raises they lost out on in July.
Nearly 5,300 members of the Washington Public Employees Association didn’t get a 3% pay hike other state workers received July 1 because they failed to approve their two-year deal in time for lawmakers to account for it in the state budget.
For the past three weeks, these state government and community college employees voted on separate tentative agreements. Both were approved by more than 90% of those who participated, the union announced Monday.
“We’re glad to have ratification done and this round of negotiations behind us,” association president Amanda Hacker said in an email. 
The next step is convincing state lawmakers and Gov. Bob Ferguson to fund the agreements in the 2026 supplemental budget they will craft next legislative session.
“While this latest agreement does not address the state’s ongoing failure to pay employees a fair wage, it will bring our members back up to parity with other state workers,” Hacker said. “We look forward to the legislature doing the right thing this time and funding all state employee contracts.”
Those affected work at 14 community colleges and in nine state agencies. Among them are the Department of Natural Resources, Department of Revenue, the Liquor and Cannabis Board and Department of Agriculture.
By law, public sector unions in Washington must approve a new contract by Oct. 1 to be considered by the governor for funding in the ensuing two-year budget.
The spending plan Ferguson signed in May funds multiple public employee union contracts with pay hikes of 3% on July 1 and 2% next July. These agreements contain other salary-related changes, including raising the starting wage for state workers to $18 an hour.
But last fall, Washington Public Employee Association members voted down their tentative agreement in pursuit of larger wage hikes. They didn’t get them, eventually ratifying an accord on April 3 with pay provisions mirroring those they’d rejected earlier. 
The legislative session ended three weeks later.
This time around, if the two contracts ratified Monday are funded, they will take effect at the start of the next fiscal year on July 1, 2026, and cover the second year of the biennium.
Most details in the agreements are the same. The primary difference concerns who is eligible to receive back pay.
State government employees would get the 3% bump paid retroactively and a 2% increase on July 1, 2026. Workers who depart before next July will receive retroactive compensation for the hours worked in this fiscal year.
Under the deal with community college employees, those working on July 1, 2026, would receive retroactive pay. Anyone who is laid off, loses their job due to a disability, or retires would also be eligible for the back pay. But those who leave on their own before the start of the contract would not be eligible for any back pay.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_2227-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-15 17:56:46.537810

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Even after cutting $59 million from what health insurers requested, 170,000 Rhode Islanders will shoulder the steepest annual premium hikes in more than a decade, the Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner Cory King said Monday.
King’s bleak conclusion came in tandem with the office’s approval of 2026 commercial premiums, following a four-month review process.
“There’s no sugar-coating this,” King said in an interview. “It’s going to produce financial hardship for people. Unless we can get the costs of hospitals and physicians and drugs under control, I worry we’re going to see more of this.”

The annual balancing act between rising expenses cited by insurance companies as justification for rate increases, and out-of-pocket costs for one-third of the state’s residents, is never easy. (Self-funded insurance in which employers assume the financial risk for the medical costs are not subject to state review on rate hikes). But this year’s calculations were more difficult than unusual, King said.
“To be totally frank with you, I think we’re at an inflection point right now, and I think we need to be proactive to ensure that these high, double-digit increases don’t become the new normal,” King said
The state health insurance commissioner is required by law to guard the solvency of insurance companies, which in turn affects payments to hospitals and health care providers. But the commissioner also cannot legally approve a requested rate hike that is not in the public’s interest. 
“It’s not about just giving [insurers] what they need,” King said. “It’s trying to balance the delivery system, insurers and consumers with an ever decreasing ability to pay.”
Farewell to ACA federal tax credits
And this year, one big pain point for insurers and customers is out of King’s control: the Dec. 31 expiration to federal tax credits under the Affordable Care Act. The decision by Congress not to extend the discounts will spike average annual household insurance costs by 85%, or $1,250 a year, for 40,000 people in Rhode Island, according to HealthSource RI, which runs the state marketplace. As premiums rise, HealthSource estimates 13,000 people will be unable to afford coverage, or opt to forgo it — the latter mostly younger, healthier and more comfortable taking the risk. That in turn increases the concentration of older, sicker — and more medically expensive — people left for insurers to cover.
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island and Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island — the two commercial insurers who provide coverage to people who buy insurance through the state marketplace — pointed to the expiring federal subsidies as justification for a large chunk of their requested premium hikes. 
Starting in January, a new fee included in the Rhode Island General Assembly’s fiscal 2026 budget will increase insurance premiums by $50 per person per year — or $200 for a family of four. When insurers submitted their proposed 2026 rate hikes in May, the budget was still in its drafting phase, and the health services assessment fee had not yet surfaced.










There’s no sugar-coating this. It’s going to produce financial hardship for people. Unless we can get the costs of hospitals and physicians and drugs under control, I worry we’re going to see more of this.


– Rhode Island Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner Cory King


Incorporating this policy change, along with other state mandates and economic factors, King arrived at modified premium hikes that still mark double-digit increases over the previous year.
For the 36,167 marketplace enrollees covered by Neighborhood, costs will rise 20.5% — less than 1 percentage point less than the 21.2% increase the company requested. 
Blue Cross marketplace rates will rise 22% for its 18,172 enrollees, nearly seven percentage points less than what the insurer requested.
Both companies indicated in separate statements that they accepted OHIC’s decision while continuing to stress the financial pressures they face, which in turn affect their payments to hospital and health care providers, weighing down their balance sheets. 
Blue Cross estimates its own costs have risen 20% over the last two years as drugs and services become more expensive, along with state-mandated spending. A new state requirement calling for a 30% boost to commercial reimbursement rates to primary care providers starting in January accounted for another fifth of Blue Cross’ requested increase.
“We understand the impact that rising healthcare costs have on our members and the importance of ensuring access to high-quality care,” Rich Salit, a Blue Cross spokesperson, said Monday. “That’s why we are working hard to manage costs through operational efficiencies, improved care management, and collaboration with state leaders, hospitals, and other providers on solutions to improve healthcare affordability.”
Elizabeth McClaine, vice president of commercial products for Neighborhood, noted that its individual market plan remains the least costly in the state. 
“We take this responsibility seriously and remain committed to providing accessible, cost-effective, and equitable health care for all our members,” McClaine said. 
On average, Affordable Care Act marketplace insurers have proposed raising premiums by 26% next year, according to an analysis by KFF of 312 insurers across 50 states and D.C. The proposed rate hikes range widely, from over 50% by five separate insurance companies in Arkansas, to a 10% drop by one Pennsylvania marketplace insurer. 
In Massachusetts, proposed rates by marketplace participants ranged from 7-12%, while Connecticut insurers requested increases of 4.7% to 28.6% for marketplace plans.
The AG vs. his expert 
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha denounced commercial insurers during the review process, urging King for the fourth consecutive year to reject requested rate hikes completely. For the first time this year, Neronha tapped a Brown University health economist, Christopher Whaley, to help make his case to King’s office.
The OHIC decision directly quoted from Whaley’s testimony in its announcement of the rate decisions noting that Whaley called the state’s review process “important” and “effective.”
King said he included Whaley’s direct testimony as a way to respond to Neronha, who previously characterized the state rate review process as “illegitimate” and overly conciliatory to insurance companies. 
“I take exception with that characterization of our rate review, and apparently his expert does too,” King said. 
Neronha was not budging.
 “As I’ve said countless times, Rhode Islanders deserve a health care system that can sustainably address their care needs,” Neronha said in a statement Monday. “And yet, year after year, the Health Insurance Commissioner continues to approve higher rates without evidence that these rate increases are helping to improve the system in which Rhode Island consumers are being forced to invest.”
Meanwhile, Gov. Dan McKee has entered the chat, urging King to consider a more “aggressive” review of health insurance costs, and ways to minimize them, in the year ahead. 
“Affordability and access to health insurance and healthcare impacts the quality of life of all Rhode Islanders and our economic growth,” McKee wrote in the Monday letter to King. “We must make the changes necessary to contain and prevent increased health insurance premiums to avoid Rhode Islanders becoming uninsured or underinsured.”
McKee suggested a temporary moratorium on new, unfunded health insurance mandates such as what lawmakers enacted in the 2026 budget, as well as a new cap on some of the cost factors, such as administrative charges. 
King said he agreed with McKee’s ideas, though his decision already incorporates some of McKee’s recommendations, including a first-time veto of any increases tied to insurance companies’ administrative expenses. OHIC also rejected companies’ pitches for more money in anticipation of tariff-related financial fallout on drug costs, noting the impacts remained hypothetical. 
The rate approvals announced Monday also trimmed requested increases by insurers in the small and large-group markets. 
The 42,865 enrolled in small-group plans will see 2026 premiums rise by 17.6% on average, versus the 22% average increase requested by Blue Cross, Neighborhood, and UnitedHealthcare of New England. Large group market plans, which cover 77,654 people, will increase 19.3% on average, compared with the 24.1% average requested increase. Insurers who cover large-group plans include BlueCross, UnitedHealth, Harvard Pilgrim, Aetna and Cigna.

(Photo by Matt Rourke/The Associated Press)Now that Attorney General James Uthmeier says that the open carrying of firearms is Florida law, a coalition of Second Amendment groups are warning lawmakers not to weaken it in any implementing legislation they may present when the Legislature convenes next year.
A three-judge panel of the Florida First District Court of Appeal (DCA) ruled last week that the state’s 1987 law banning open carry in Florida is unconstitutional. In the immediate aftermath, various law enforcement agencies throughout the state announced that they would no longer enforce the law, while others said that they were still studying the ruling and would not change existing policy — in some cases because the decision made by the First DCA only applied to 32 counties under its jurisdiction, mostly in North Florida.
Uthmeier clarified on Monday that the legal decision applies to every part of the state.
“Because no other appellate court has considered the constitutionality of Florida’s open carry ban since the SCOTUS decision in Bruen, the 1st DCA’s decision is binding on all Florida’s trial courts,” he said on X. “Meaning that as of last week, open carry is the law of the state.”
No ‘new restrictions’, Second Amendment groups say
Second Amendment groups that have been advocating for the Legislature to repeal the ban on open carry are cheering last week’s ruling. But they’re also warning state legislators not to add any new regulations in legislation they offer next year putting open carry into statute.
“Florida Carry (FLC), Gun Owners of America (GOA), National Rifle Association (NRA), and Florida Gun Rights (FLGR) all have spent countless dollars and man hours in this fight, that they have now won,” said Luis Valdes, Florida state director of Gun Owners of America in a statement.
“These organizations stand united in solidarity that any new restrictions on this right or to limit the impact of this VICTORY, will be vigorously and strongly opposed by a unified front of Florida gun owners and the members of these four organizations.”
“Member of Florida Gun Rights stand united and strong against any potential infringements on the recent ruling which declared Florida’s ban on open carry as unconstitutional,” said Logan Edge with Florida Gun Rights in a statement texted to the Phoenix.
“The legislature remains a hostile opponent against gun rights and open carry, but after many years of pushback, gun owners gained a massive victory in the courts,” he added. “We will make sure every Tallahassee legislator hears from gun rights activists and oppose any effort to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.”
Potential legislation with holster retention levels
What some gun rights group don’t want the Legislature to do in any implementing bill is to include what are known as holster retention levels for individuals carrying firearms on their person — they want no restrictions at all. There are four levels of restraint or retention, according to concealedcarry-ed.

Level 1 – holsters keep the gun in the holster through friction only.
Level 2 – holsters use friction plus an additional restraint. This restraint could be a thumb strap, a flip-up strap, an automatic lock, or some other device.
Level 3 – holsters use friction plus two additional restraints.
Level 4 – holsters use friction plus three additional restraints.

“Gun owners of America is extremely proud of this court victory finally securing our Second Amendment rights and we want to make sure that Florida does not go through the same issues that happened in New York after their win with the Bruen decision,” Valdes said in a written statement sent to the Phoenix. “After Bruen, the NY Legislature passed gun control to weaken that ruling, and we want to make sure that the same does not happen here in Florida.”
Following the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in NYSRPA v. Bruen in 2022, the Democratic-controlled New York Legislature approved and Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul signed legislation strengthening that state’s gun laws and adding restrictions on concealed carry weapons.
With Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis an advocate of open carry, he isn’t likely to sign off on any legislation that would weaken the state’s new policy.
Uthmeier emphasized on Monday that while the DCA’s decision repealing the ban is now state law, that the decision did not affect another part of Florida law that bans the open carrying of a handgun or concealed weapon in a number of public places.
Those places include any law enforcement agency; courtroom; prison; jail; polling place; government meeting; school, college, or professional athletic event; elementary or secondary school facility; airport; or establishment that dispenses alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises.
The same holds true for private property owners, who maintain the right to prohibit individuals carrying guns from their premises, Uthmeier said.
In a statement issued later on Monday, Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried said that while she has a “long history” of advocating for Second Amendment rights, she believes the First DCA “erred” in last week’s opinion.
“Nationwide, we are seeing harrowing levels of gun violence, marked by assassinations, school shootings, and people being killed in places of worship,” she said.
“This is a moment in history when we need to promote safer environments, not embolden those who could abuse the ruling’s intent to sow seeds of terror.  We strongly encourage law enforcement to wait for a final legal judgment before allowing open carry, as it may cause confusion that leads to danger at a time when calm and clarity are so desperately needed.”

The umbrella term “school choice” centers on programs that offer alternatives to one’s assigned public school.The agency also said it’s investing more than $160 million total in American history and civics grants — a $137 million increase in the funds Congress previously approved. In its announcement, the agency said “these investments will be repurposed from programs that the Department determined are not in the best interest of students and families.” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said her department “has carefully scrutinized our federal grants, ensuring that taxpayers are not funding racially discriminatory programs but those programs which promote merit and excellence in education,” in a statement Monday. She added that the administration “will use every available tool to meaningfully advance educational outcomes and ensure every American has the opportunity to succeed in life.” There was no breakdown made available Monday as to which programs or individual institutions would gain funding.HBCU ‘godsend’Lodriguez V. Murray, senior vice president for public policy and government affairs at UNCF, which supports historically Black colleges and universities, said the extra funding is “nothing short of a godsend for HBCUs,” in a statement Monday.   “We are grateful to have worked with the Trump Administration, Secretary McMahon, and her Department of Education team in achieving this one-time infusion of grant funding,” Murray said.  Murray noted that “HBCUs are currently and have been underfunded since their inception” and “while we are grateful for these funds, we are still under-resourced.” The National Center for Education Statistics noted that in 2022, there were “99 HBCUs located in 19 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.”",,,,2025-09-15 16:58:03.682518

Mike Kehoe called a special session to redraw Missouri’s congressional map without a compelling reason, attorneys for the Missouri NAACP said Monday.
Therefore, they contend, the map passed by lawmakers should be declared void.
In the first of what promises to be extensive legal wrangling over the new maps, Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh heard arguments in a case that contends lawmakers should never have met at all. Filed by the NAACP as the special session began, attorney Sharon Jones argued Monday afternoon that the litigation should not be thrown out just because the session is already over.
There are, she said, questions that should be answered about the governor’s power to convene the legislature.
“We are in a position where new maps are going to have to be prepared, where legal challenges are already ongoing based on the legislation that passed,” Jones said. “The harms, because of what we believe to be an improperly called extraordinary session, continue to march, and that’s why we’re still seeking the preliminary injunction and the temporary restraining order.
Limbaugh did not rule immediately and did not estimate how long he would take.
Three lawsuits and a referendum: New Missouri congressional map faces multiple attacks

Opposing the lawsuit, state Solicitor General Louis Capozzi said the case should be dismissed as moot because the legislature has met and adjourned. If that isn’t enough to dismiss the case, he said, the inherently political nature of a special session decision gives the governor broad discretion.
The Missouri Constitution says the governor can call lawmakers into session on “extraordinary occasions” after naming the items “on which action is deemed necessary.”
“Plaintiffs want this court to second guess the governor on what constitutes an extraordinary occasion,” Capozzi said. “There’s no precedent to guide the court on that open-ended inquiry, no cases at all. It’s an inherently political and policy focused decision, and without any precedent to guide the court, the court should not start down that path.”
Over 10 days ending Friday, the General Assembly met and passed two bills responding to Kehoe’s call to revise congressional maps and pass a proposal making it harder to pass constitutional amendments by initiative petition.
The revised congressional district map is intended to flip the 5th District, currently held by U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat, to Republican control.
Barring court action or a referendum petition to delay it, the new maps will take effect Dec. 11 and be used for elections in 2026. The proposal on initiatives will be on the November 2026 ballot unless Kehoe designates it for an election at an earlier date.
The NAACP lawsuit initially sought to block the legislature from meeting at all. Now the civil rights organization is asking that the legislature’s actions be declared invalid.
Jones admitted that no court has ever done what the NAACP is asking Limbaugh to do.
“There have been some cases that are about how far the legislature can go under (during a special session) but not how far the governor can go,” she said.
Along with the NAACP lawsuit filed as the session began, two additional lawsuits have been filed since the General Assembly adjourned. Both challenge the constitutionality of revising congressional district lines other than immediately after a federal census.
One, filed in Jackson County, alleges that lawmakers put the same Kansas City precinct into two districts, “creating a map that is malapportioned and/or noncontiguous.” The other, filed in Cole County, challenges the new map by questioning the power of the legislature to act between censuses.
The NAACP filed an updated petition Sunday, recognizing that the legislature had already met and adjourned after passing the bills Kehoe wanted.
“The court should require a minimum showing of some set of circumstances or events outside of the normal course of business to justify the convening of the legislature in an extraordinary session,” the revised filing states.
All the main questions raised by the NAACP are moot and the validity of the legislation is being tested in other courts, Capozzi wrote in a filing to the court seeking dismissal of the lawsuit.
And, he noted, the redistricting power is not limited to a particular time by the Constitution.
“Nothing prohibits the General Assembly from adopting a new federal congressional map mid-decade,” Capozzi wrote. “The Missouri Constitution is simply silent on that question. And where the Missouri Constitution is silent on a challenged legislative power, the General Assembly has the discretion to act.”
The question of whether a governor can call a special session is not purely political, Jones said.
“We are not talking about a question that is purely one of discretion,” Jones said. “We are talking about a question of how far does constitutional authority go.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/092623_colecountycourt2-scaled-e1757967844893-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-09-15 16:58:03.682518

Ombudsman Jonathan Grate is at left and Alexander Magera, general counsel in the auditor's office, is at right. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)Franklin Circuit Judge Thomas Wingate has dismissed a lawsuit that sought to make the Cabinet for Health and Family Services implement a 2024 unfunded law and cooperate with a related investigation. 
This ruling comes four months after Kentucky Auditor Allison Ball sued over Senate Bill 151, the unfunded 2024 law that was drafted to help kinship care families but hasn’t been implemented due to a $20 million funding dispute between the legislative and executive branches of government. 
That law — on paper but not yet in reality — allows relatives who take temporary custody of a child, when abuse or neglect is suspected, to later become eligible for foster care payments. 
In October 2024 Ball launched an investigation into the cabinet’s ability to implement the law and alleged in her May lawsuit that the cabinet wouldn’t cooperate with that fact-finding mission. Then, she sued to gain access to information for the investigation and asked the court to force implementation of the law. 
‘Shame on you:’ Kentucky auditor’s standing questioned in kinship care lawsuit

In his Monday ruling Wingate found that the cabinet “has not failed to respond and has not refused to comply to the same degree as that found” in case law and that “no subpoenas have been sought, CHFS has complied with many of the auditor’s requests, and, finally, CHFS has asserted that the auditor ‘need only provide a name and CHFS will set up an interview just as it always has.’” 
Wingate also said Ball “has not yet exhausted administrative means to obtain documents and the matter has not yet ripened into a concrete dispute.” 
Norma Hatfield, the president of the Kinship Families Coalition of Kentucky who is also raising two grandchildren, said she’s “very frustrated” by the ongoing dispute, which she called “political game play.” 
“I don’t know how this can be happening a couple years later,” Hatfield told the Lantern. “It’s like we’re on a train that doesn’t have any stops.”  
An auditor’s office spokesperson said Ball has “directed the issuance of subpoenas as the necessary next step to protect Kentucky’s kinship caregivers and the children in their care.” 
The auditor has 30 days to decide if she wishes to appeal the ruling.

Gov. Andy Beshear, who was previously dismissed from the lawsuit, said in a Monday statement that the “dismissal of this unfounded lawsuit proves that Team Kentucky isn’t letting politics get in the way of doing what’s right.” 
“My administration has always prioritized the safety and wellbeing of Kentucky’s children, and we’re committed to working with any office to see that goal through,” Beshear said in a statement. “Implementing Senate Bill 151 requires more funding, yet the General Assembly failed to do so in both the 2024 and 2025 legislative sessions.”
Ball said in a statement that she will “remain committed to fighting to ensure these families get the resources they rightfully deserve” and that the subpoenas she’s preparing “will reveal the truth about the actual cost and all available resources to fund this program.” 
Kentucky’s kinship care landscape 
In 2024, there were around 55,000 Kentucky children being raised with a non-parent relative, according to a report from Kentucky Youth Advocates. These families often make hasty decisions about taking in their minor relative that leaves them without needed financial support. 
When the state removes a child from a home, grandparents and other family members often choose to take temporary custody rather than have the child go into state custody. State custody is the first step toward foster care. That first decision is permanent under current law which has excluded kinship caregivers who take temporary custody from ever receiving the $750 a month that foster parents receive for each child, the Lantern has reported.
Senate Bill 151 is supposed to give kinship caregivers 120 days to apply to become foster parents for their minor relatives and allows children who are being removed from homes to request their preferred familial caregivers, if they are able.

Hatfield, the kinship caregiver and advocate, said this whole ordeal has left her with some distrust of the state government. 
“This is a problem that is across the board, with the legislators and the cabinet and the governor, and we need to solve that,” she said. “I don’t have a lot of faith, right now, in the process. I just feel like the people that could make that better — all of them — need to get to the table and — let’s start problem solving.” 
Meanwhile, she said, kinship care families are left out to dry. 
“I just know there’s a big, big problem here, and as a result, the people needing to be served are being ignored,” Hatfield said. “We know we can do something different for these kids and those families, and we’re not. And it just covers me with sadness.”

When Dallas Kelly received a Book Award scholarship to St. Michael’s College, the standout student faced a tough decision: follow her dream to a big-city school or make the more affordable choice. As her journey unfolded, she discovered that choosing affordability didn’t have to mean giving up on her dreams.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Dream school me[...]","As Dallas Kelly wrapped up her Junior year at Hartford High School, she had big college dreams. She saw herself at a huge state school with tens of thousands of students in a big city that offered a world of opportunity. “I idolized college in my mind. I was looking for something big and different, something to push and challenge me,” she recalls. 
Then, at an end-of-year awards assembly, the standout student from Sharon received the St. Michael’s College Book Award, which came with a hefty scholarship to the small school in Colchester, Vermont. While she was honored and very grateful for the award, she also began her senior-year college process with a big decision weighing on her: “Do I go to one of my ‘dream schools’ that I don’t know much about, that’s also really expensive? Or do I go to a local college where I could go for virtually nothing?”
Having participated in VSAC’s Talent Search college and career planning program since her sophomore year at Hartford, Dallas was prepared for the college process, even though none of her parents—her mom, her stepdad or her dad—went to college. According to her VSAC Outreach Counselor, Beth Clay, “Dallas worked really hard her senior year, applying for every possible scholarship and grant, and she advocated for herself with many institutions.” Midway through her senior year, she had been accepted to several schools, and it came down to the numbers. 
“VSAC was incredibly helpful. Beth knew how to run the numbers for me, knew the programs, knew the alternatives, knew every possible path I could take to get me where I wanted to be,” says Dallas, who loves children and hopes to work as a pediatric speech-language pathologist or a behavioral interventionist, perhaps specializing in children on the autism spectrum or recovering from trauma. 
“Beth also knew what I needed. She always encouraged me, but she was also realistic. Having real numbers in front of me was so helpful. It helped me not idolize college anymore because the financial reality was in front of me. Without VSAC, I would have been lost in the figures. I’m incredibly grateful that I had that resource.” 
But for several months, Dallas still worried that if she chose the most financially sustainable path, she might be giving up on her dreams. She asked a lot of people for advice, especially those who had gone through the same decision process a year or two earlier. 
As the second youngest of four children, Dallas turned to one of her older brothers, who had to pivot on his own college plan when the school he chose—Johnson and Wales in Miami, Florida—shut down during COVID. “He said he knew I would make anywhere the place I wanted to be once I got there.”  
The others she turned to offered advice on both sides, from “go where you love” to “the dream college isn’t worth it; you’ll find joy and opportunity anywhere you go.” 
In the end, a chance encounter during a visit to St. Michael’s College sealed the deal.
“I went to visit St. Mike’s, and there was this girl I went to middle school with. I had always seen her as this vibrant, social, exuberant person who I could see loving the city life, so I was surprised to see her at this small school. I asked her how she ended up there, and she said she got an amazing scholarship. I asked her what she thought of that decision now. She said it was hard at the time to give up her ideal of the ‘dream school,’ but she had to make the smartest financial decision. She also told me, ‘If you want something, you will seek it out wherever you are. You will make it your home, and you won’t want to leave.’ That helped me a lot.” 
Now a sophomore at St. Mike’s, Dallas has done just that. She’s double majoring in elementary education and English and minoring in psychology. And her extracurricular calendar proves what she soon discovered: “Even though it’s a small school, there is so much to get involved in.”
Dallas is a hiking leader and is training to be a paddle sports instructor at the Adventure Sports Center, where students lead day hikes, rock climbs, and kayaking and mountain biking excursions. She picked up Ultimate Frisbee this year. She is the Class of 2028 representative on the honors program committee. She has an on-campus job. And she’s active with the DREAM mentorship program, where college students are paired with local kids from age 5 to 15 who come from modest-income families. Dallas will be taking on a leadership role with DREAM this year.
How does she manage it all? Strong friendships are key, Dallas says. “My roommates are well-organized and focused people, so we all keep each other on track,” she says with a laugh. 
Looking back on her journey, Dallas recalls something she heard often as she was weighing her college decision. “A lot of people told me, ‘Go to the school that will make you happy every day.’ Originally I thought that was one of my big-city dream schools,” Dallas says. “Now I realize those schools might have been exciting for every day of the first semester. But God knew my heart. He knew that what I needed from a school in order to call it my home was a tightknit community, access to some sort of a city, and most of all nature to explore. And that’s what St. Mike’s gives to me.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-09-15 20:16:38+00:00,Mississippi Today,"Immigrant detained despite work permit, no criminal history",Mina Corpuz,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/15/immigrant-detained-despite-work-permit-no-criminal-history/,Immigrant's detention in Mississippi may relate to recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing ICE stops based on race and ethnicity.,"“Wait here while I check your information. Everything will be alright.” 
That’s what Mario Reyes Rodas’ attorney said the federal immigration officer told his client the morning of Aug. 27 during a traffic stop along Interstate 20 in Rankin County. The Morton resident provided a current driver’s license and work authorization card that has allowed him to work as a landscaper while he sought permanent residence. 
Then came the questions. 
Where are you from? Mexico, Reyes Rodas answered. Do you have a visa or authorization to be in the country? No, the man replied, though he had been trying to obtain permanent residency for years. 
That was enough information for him to be detained, even though he has no criminal record. 
Reyes Rodas left his car on the side of the road as he was detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. He was taken to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Pearl to be processed and then to the Madison County Detention Center. Within a week, he was taken to River Correctional Center, an ICE facility in Ferriday, Louisiana.
“He hasn’t seen freedom since then,” said Jeremy Litton, who is representing Reyes Rodas in an ongoing immigration case. 
Reyes Rodas was charged with the civil violation of entry into the country without authorization, his attorney said. 
The 40-year-old father of two was not given a reason for his detainment, his attorney said, nor was there documentation of a warrant to arrest or detain him. 
Litton said his client also was not stopped that day under suspicion of violating a state law, such as speeding. 
Why, then, Litton wondered, was Reyes Rodas detained. A week and a half later came a potential answer. 
On Sept. 8, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that federal immigration officers can stop people without reasonable suspicion based on their apparent race or ethnicity, if they speak in Spanish or accented English, if they are in a place where undocumented immigrants are known to gather and if they work in specific jobs that undocumented people are known to work. 
Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in the Sept. 8 majority order that multiple considerations taken together “can constitute at least reasonable suspicion of illegal presence in the United States.” 
In her dissent, Justice Sonya Sotomayor argued the Trump administration has declared all Latinos regardless of U.S. citizenship who fit those criteria “are fair game to be seized at any time.” 
Reyes Rodas isn’t the only person detained who doesn’t have a criminal background. 
As of September, 70% of all people held in immigration detention centers around the country have no criminal convictions, according to Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse immigration data by Syracuse University. Of those with criminal convictions, many committed minor offenses such as traffic violations. 
A spokesperson from Customs and Border Protection confirmed the detention of Reyes Rodas and that he was turned over to Immigration and Custom Enforcement for removal processing. An ICE spokesperson was not immediately available for comment. 
Federal immigration agents have conducted immigration enforcement along I-20, including in March and May that resulted in at least 70 arrests and seizure of firearms and ammunition.  
Emmanuel Reyes, the eldest American-born son of Reyes Rodas, remembers finishing work on Aug. 27 when his girlfriend called. 
Don’t worry, she told him, but immigration officers picked up your father. Reyes said the news immediately sent him into a panic. 
Reyes said his father is a loving man of faith who has supported him and his 17-year-old brother, coming to every game, meet and match for the multi-sport athletes. 
His parents came to America 20 years ago to provide support for their family members in Mexico, and they stayed to give their sons a better life. Reyes said he and his brother have grown up aware of their U.S. citizenship and looked for ways to help their parents, including how to help them gain legal status. 
“My dad was trying to live for what he came here for, the American dream,” Reyes said. “ … They wanted to give us opportunities. It’s better here.”
Litton has represented Reyes Rodas since 2019, not long after he was one of more than 600 mostly Latino workers detained in raids at chicken processing plants in central Mississippi. 
That year, he filed an application requesting the dismissal of removal proceedings against Reyes Rodas, which is a defense available to those facing deportation who meet certain requirements, including a clean criminal record, continuous presence in the country for at least 10 years and potential hardship to his U.S. citizenship children if he were deported. 
Litton said the 42B application is a pathway to a green card: permanent residency that allows people to live and work in the United States.   
As they waited for the application to be processed, Litton said Reyes Rodas applied and received authorization to work, which is valid through 2029. That document enabled him to get a Mississippi driver’s license.  
It took several years for Reyes Rodas to be issued notice to appear in immigration court to be able to file the 42B application. His first court date scheduled in 2021 was delayed several times, Litton said. 
By 2023 as they prepared for the hearing, Litton looked up the case and found it was gone, which he said is something that has happened in a handful of other cases relating to the poultry raids. 
Reyes Rodas had a court date scheduled for Tuesday with the LaSalle Immigration Court in Jena, Louisiana. But like his earlier case, the date disappeared off the court calendar, Litton said he learned Friday afternoon. 
As a result, Litton plans to request a bond hearing to argue that Reyes Rodas had valid work authorization and a pending immigration application when he was detained and mention the administrative challenges with his case.  
However, Reyes Rodas may not be able to receive it in light of a recent Board of Immigration Appeals decision stating that immigration judges lack the authority to approve or hear bond requests for those already in the country without authorization. 
Litton said it’s “indefinite detention” for anyone, regardless of when they entered the country.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/15151202/Reyes-Rodas-family-photo-recent-edit-2.jpg,,,2025-09-15 16:58:03.682518

The recent string of crashes began Aug. 10, when a box truck hit Highway Patrol Trooper Dennis Ricks during an early morning traffic stop in Orangeburg. Ricks died from his injuries three days later.

Around midnight Sept. 7, a truck hit Senior Trooper Mitchell Williams with its side mirror on Interstate 77 near Columbia. Williams went to a local hospital and was released the same day, according to the Department of Public Safety. Two days later, Master Trooper Wayne LaBounty was airlifted to a hospital after being hit during a traffic stop in Lexington County, according to the department.
LaBounty is still in the hospital in stable condition, said Col. Christopher Williamson, commander of the state Highway Patrol.
Any driver passing an emergency vehicle, tow truck or construction crew stopped on the side of the road must “significantly reduce the speed” of their car and switch lanes if possible under a 1996 law known as the Move Over Law.
That law is often difficult for single troopers to enforce, since they are typically busy with whatever drew them to the side of the road in the first place. Through Friday, the Highway Patrol will send cars out in pairs for “Operation Keep Us Safe.”
That way, when one trooper makes a traffic stop, the other can monitor other drivers and pursue anyone who fails to slow down or move over, Williamson said.
Violators will receive a fine of between $300 and $500, according to the law.
Williamson has asked every sheriff’s department in the state to be similarly diligent about ticketing people who fail to yield for emergency vehicles this week.
Flashing messages on the state’s highways will read “See flashing lights, move over. It’s the law.”
The goal of the weeklong “blitz,” as Williamson called it, is to remind drivers of the law, he said.
Too many people are either distracted while driving and miss the emergency lights or don’t care enough to pull over, Williamson said.

The trend of drivers not following the Move Over Law has been happening for much longer than a month, he said.
Earlier this year, the Department of Public Safety reminded drivers of the importance of slowing down and moving away from law enforcement after two near-misses in less than two weeks.
On June 4, as a trooper spoke with the driver of a stopped car in Dorchester County, another car plowed into the scene, narrowly missing the state trooper and sending the parked car careening off the road, according to a video the department released of the incident. Ten days later, another video showed a trooper in Richland County leaping over a guardrail to avoid a car that lost control near the scene of another accident.
Williamson stopped short of asking for a change in law Monday, pleading instead with the public to follow what’s already in place or face the penalties.
“I don’t know how to get through to people to care about what’s going on outside of their phones, their own vehicles and their own world,” Williamson said. “What I do know is that their lack of attention, their lack of good judgment and their lack of regard for other human lives has got to stop.”
Workers who must stop on the side of the road understand their jobs come with some level of risk, but it’s up to drivers to minimize the chance of harming them, Williamson said.
“What we didn’t sign up for is a blatant disregard for our safety that seems to be running rampant,” Williamson said. “There’s only so much our troopers can do to control the conditions and environment on the side of an interstate with vehicles flying by at speeds often higher than the posted speed limits.”
If one of those cars loses control, the result can be devastating for the troopers and their families.
Master Trooper Devin Kugler, for instance, always takes an extra look over his shoulder when making traffic stops after a crash left him with brain injuries, broken bones, nerve damage and hearing loss.

Kugler was preparing to perform a sobriety test on the side of a Greenville County road when a car hit him. The driver who struck him pleaded guilty to hit-and-run charges in 2023 and was sentenced to five years in prison.
Many people zoom past emergency lights without causing a collision, so they think there’s no reason to slow down, especially if they’re in a hurry, Kugler said. But slowing down often adds just a few extra seconds to a commute and could save a life, he said.
“We’ve got to put forth that extra effort,” he said.
Lois Rao echoed his plea. Every time she hears about another trooper injured or killed on the side of the road, she thinks of her son, Michael Rao.
He was on the side of a Clarendon County road helping a stranded driver when a pickup truck struck him at 81 miles per hour. Rao died from his injuries two days later, in June 2002. The pickup driver pleaded guilty to reckless homicide and spent five years on probation.
More than two decades later, Lois Rao still chokes up when talking about her son.
“The Move Over Law does save lives,” Rao said. “Do not subject another mother to bury her son.”
Although the targeted enforcement effort will last only a week, drivers should continue to expect tickets for disobeying the law after this week, Williamson said.
Officers will also more strictly enforce the hands-free driving law that went into effect Sept. 1. Until February, anyone caught holding a cellphone while driving will receive a warning, officials said.
“After Friday, I hope that the broader public don’t think that we are just going away,” Williamson said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_4363-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 16:58:03.682518

WILMINGTON – The Delaware Community Foundation (DCF) announced a five-year, $13.1 million investment in the Delaware Center for Cognitive Aging Research (DECCAR) at the University of Delaware (UD) through its Paul H. Boerger Fund.
“This transformational gift will significantly expand Alzheimer’s research throughout the state,” said Director of DECCAR and Associate Professor of Kinesiology and Applied Physiology Christopher Martens.
The planned investment, one of the largest in Delaware’s history for Alzheimer’s research, aims to accelerate studies focused on prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.
“No one has to look very far afield to witness and understand the tragedy of Alzheimer’s, and the research supported by this grant will help UD researchers come ever-closer to uncovering life-improving and life-saving solutions,” said DCF President and CEO Stuart Comstock-Gay. “The grant was provided through the generosity of late Paul H. Boerger, who made a substantial legacy gift to the fund he had established at the DCF in his lifetime, and his foresight will help so many.”
Legacy of Paul H. Boerger
The Paul H. Boerger Fund was created in 2014 and received an estate gift following Boerger’s death in 2017. His wish was that the fund support research to prevent and/or cure Alzheimer’s disease. In 2023, the fund awarded $575,000 to DECCAR to launch the Delaware Longitudinal Study for Alzheimer’s Prevention (DeLSAP), which explores how health, lifestyle, and biology influence dementia risk and helps identify early signs of impairment.
Following the study’s success, DCF invited DECCAR to submit a new proposal, resulting in the $13.1 million commitment.

“This transformational gift will significantly expand Alzheimer’s research throughout the state,” Martens said. “It will also help grow the number of researchers in Delaware focused on Alzheimer’s disease, promoting an interdisciplinary approach.”
University Partnership
Interim UD President Laura Carlson emphasized the impact of the foundation’s support.
“Every one of us has a family member or friend who has been deeply affected by Alzheimer’s. I’m proud that UD is working better to understand this terrible disease and partnering with others throughout the state to work on its prevention, diagnosis and treatment,” Carlson said. “We are grateful to the Delaware Community Foundation for their support which allows us to escalate our research and expand our community outreach.”
Expanding Research Capacity
The investment will allow DeLSAP to grow from 100 to 500 participants over five years. It will also fund development of a blood test to identify biomarkers predicting Alzheimer’s progression and support the purchase of a $3.2 million state-of-the-art MRI machine at UD’s STAR Campus, enhancing access to critical diagnostic tools",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pexels-edward-jenner-4033145-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 16:58:03.682518

An Iowa judge has fined the Pennsylvania insurance commissioner $481,500 for contempt of court after finding that she deliberately violated a court order in a civil case brought by Iowa’s insurance regulators.
The civil penalty marks the latest development in a long-running legal dispute between the insurance commissioners of Iowa and Pennsylvania.
In 2022, Iowa Insurance Commissioner Douglas Ommen sought an injunction against the financially struggling Senior Health Insurance Company of Pennsylvania, or SHIP, arguing the company intended to “coerce vulnerable Iowans” into paying confiscatory rate increases of 400% or more for their long-term care insurance policies, even while imposing “draconian” cuts in benefits.

At the time, Ommen said SHIP, which had sold long-term care insurance policies to more than 880 Iowans, was financially insolvent with a $1.3 billion funding shortfall. Because of the company’s financial condition, control over SHIP had been handed over to a so-called “special deputy rehabilitator,” Patrick Cantilo, and to the Pennsylvania insurance commissioner.
The injunction, which was later granted, barred Cantilo and the Pennsylvania commissioner from offering any rates, riders or policy documents to any Iowa policyholders that had not been previously authorized and approved by the Iowa insurance commissioner.
In January 2025, SHIP informed the Iowa insurance commissioner the company had filed a request with the commonwealth court of Pennsylvania to begin implementing a court-approved “rehabilitation plan” for the company, allowing SHIP to contact Iowa policyholders and to offer, or in some cases force, changes to their policies.
The Iowa commissioner then informed SHIP that even if the Pennsylvania court granted the request and the company followed through, it would be in clear violation of the injunction issued in Iowa. Under that scenario, the commissioner warned, he would authorize the Iowa attorney general to seek sanctions against SHIP.
According to court filings by the Iowa insurance commissioner, SHIP “did not back down” and, in April 2025, more than 480 SHIP policyholders in Iowa became the target of a mass mailing informing them of potential modifications to their policies.
The Iowa commissioner then sought a contempt finding against SHIP, Cantilo and the Pennsylvania insurance commissioner.
Judge: Defendants ‘orchestrated’ Pennsylvania order
Jospeh Gamble, one of the attorneys representing SHIP, the Pennsylvania commissioner and Castilo, argued in court filings that by offering Iowa policyholders the option of choosing the manner in which their benefits might be reduced, the defendants had been acting in the policyholders’ best interests.
The Iowa commissioner, Gamble asserted, was “seeking only to punish the defendants for their desire to provide the best possible outcomes for policyholders based on the input of those policyholders.”
Polk County District Court Judge Scott J. Beattie recently ruled in the Iowa commissioner’s favor, noting that a showing of contempt would require proof the defendants had acted intentionally and deliberately “with bad purpose, evil, or wanton disregard for the rights of others.”
The evidence, Beattie said, established beyond a reasonable doubt the defendants willfully and deliberately violated his injunction by pursuing “authorization” from the Pennsylvania court to take actions they knew were already prohibited by the Iowa injunction.
The defendants then notified Iowa policyholders of proposed rate and benefit changes, and asked policyholders to select rates or benefits other than those authorized by the Iowa commissioner.
The defendants’ argument that “they were merely following a Pennsylvania court order does not excuse their contempt,” Beattie found. “Defendants orchestrated and requested the Pennsylvania court order with full knowledge it would violate this court’s injunction.”
Beattie found that each of the letters sent to SHIP’s 481 current Iowa policyholders constituted 481 separate acts of contempt of court. Similarly, a May 2025 mailing from SHIP directly the Iowa policyholders constituted an additional 481 acts of contempt, Beattie ruled.
Beattie assessed the defendants a $500 civil penalty for pursuing the Pennsylvania court order, plus a $500 civil penalty for each of the two letters SHIP or its representatives sent the 481 Iowa policyholders, for a total penalty of $481,500.
That penalty, Beattie ruled, is to be paid jointly by Jessica K. Altman in her official capacity as Pennsylvania’s insurance commissioner, and by Patrick Cantilo, the special deputy rehabilitator. Additional sanctions may be imposed for any future violations, Beattie warned.
Iowan paid $107 per month for 27 years
In his ruling, Beattie cited testimony from Janet Galloway Huston, a 75-year-old retired attorney from Iowa. Huston had testified that she maintained her SHIP policy for long-term care since January 1998, paying $107 per month in premiums for over 27 years without ever receiving benefits under the policy.
Her policy, she testified, was to provide $253 per day for either assisted living or nursing facility care. Because assisted-living care in the Des Moines area costs $8,500 to $10,000 per month, she testified, her policy would cover roughly 60 percent of her actual costs.
Huston testified that she and her husband “went through a very massive financial structuring so that we could provide for ourselves. This was one of the pots, one of the ways that we could ensure our care in old age, and so it was definitely one of the pots that we elected to purchase the policy and relied on.”
In her testimony, Huston expressed anger upon receiving SHIP’s notification of a potential reductions in her benefits, explaining that “I do not have enough money in my current income and the other pots that I have available to me to sustain assisted living or long-term care” and would have to instead rely on Medicaid for her care.
“We relied upon the actuaries and the experts in the insurance field when my husband and I purchased these policies,” she testified. “We relied upon the expertise provided by the insurance company that these benefits would be there long term.”
The civil penalties imposed by Beattie deal only with the violations of the court’s temporary injunction. Still to be decided are the larger issues that gave rise to the Iowa commissioner’s lawsuit, which include allegations of violating Iowa insurance regulations.
A trial on those issues is currently scheduled for June 29, 2026.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-09-15 20:05:45+00:00,CT Mirror,US Army Corps cites progress clearing hydrilla in CT. What’s next?,John Moritz and Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/09/15/hydrilla-done-0912/,"Officials say they’re turning the tide in a long-running fight against hydrilla — but to continue, the Army Corps needs additional funding.","For the first time since the highly-invasive aquatic weed hydrilla appeared on the Connecticut River in 2016, officials say they’ve begun to turn the tide in their long-running fight against it.
In a handful of locations along the river where the weed once grew in thick mats, attacks with chemical herbicides have reduced its prevalence to a few isolated clumps. 
In other areas, researchers with the United States Army Corps of Engineers are already planning for their next offensive — tentatively scheduled for next summer — by using tracer dyes to track the flow of water and determine precisely how much herbicide they need to use to target the weed while minimizing harm to other, native species of plants.
“It’s going to take time to control hydrilla, it’s not going to be like a one-and-done kind of treatment and then you walk away,” said Keith Hannon, the project manager for the Army Corps’ New England District. 
“There is reduced regrowth compared to previous years, but it is growing back,” Hannon added. “That’s why the work we’re doing here is going to be, hopefully, used to inform a larger management plan.” Hannon said local and state officials would then be able to deploy the plan to manage regrowth over the long term.

In order for the work to continue, however, Hannon said the Army Corps would need to receive additional funding that’s currently awaiting approval from Congress.
Researchers were forced to scale back their efforts earlier this year after lawmakers failed to include money for the Connecticut River hydrilla project in the latest government funding bill. U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., has since requested an additional $5.5 million in funding for project as part of a cost-sharing program with state governments.
Blumenthal said Friday that he is seeking to include the money in the Senate’s annual Energy and Water Development bill, which is currently being held up amid a dispute over funding for clean energy programs.
“I have very strong hopes,” that the funding will be approved, Blumenthal said. “I’m optimistic because it’s a program that makes eminent good sense from an environmental and economic standpoint, and obviously it has strong support among the states most deeply affected.”

The project also faced a period of tumult this summer when a sudden controversy arose around one of the herbicides being used by researchers: diquat dibromide.
In a series of social media posts that quickly racked up thousands of views, opponents spread inaccurate information about diquat — a common herbicide that is widely used in aquatic applications — and accused officials of deceit despite several public meetings that were held to raise awareness about the project. Some of the posts leveled attacks against the researchers themselves, accusing of them of trying to “poison” the river.
As as result of that pushback, the Army Corps ended up extending delaying its work by several weeks in order to solicit more feedback from the public.
When the work resumed in August, officials said there was only enough time and federal funding available to apply herbicides in two locations along the river: the Chester Boat Basin and Selden Cove in Lyme.

Hydrilla is native to Eurasia, but has already spread across much of the Eastern Seaboard since it was spotted in Florida in the 1950s. The strain found in the Connecticut River, however, is genetically distinct from other varieties and is known to spread vigorously through fragments carried by currents, boats and boat trailers. 
Officials said they believe the plant may have been introduced to the river near Agawam, Mass., and spread south to the mouth of Long Island Sound as well as in several lakes and ponds.
The purpose of the Army Corps’ project is not to eradicate hydrilla from the river, but instead to gain a better understanding of which chemicals and methods work best at combating the strain so that those results may be replicated in other regions to stop it from spreading.
“If you don’t take care of it when it’s in a pond, next thing you know it’s in millions of acres,” said Ben Sperry, a Army Corps research biologist based in Gainesville, Florida, who traveled to Connecticut to oversee the project’s field work. “That’s the big concern if this thing starts to spread south. It has the capacity to replace other species.”
In addition to the Army Corps, the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station has also provided support for the project.
The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, while not directly involved in the team’s research, is in charge of reviewing and issuing the permits necessary to apply herbicides within the state’s waterways.
“Generally speaking, DEEP supports efforts to curb the negative impacts of hydrilla and to educate the public about the ways they can assist in those efforts,” DEEP spokesman Will Healey said in a statement.
Early one sunny morning in late August, Sperry’s team of Army Corps researchers — including others who had traveled from as far away as Mississippi and the Great Lakes — arrived in Chester for the first day of treatments.
The team quickly got to work setting up several machines resembling the Star Wars droid R2-D2. Inside each of the machines was a revolving set of tubes to sample water in the basin every hour for up to a day to monitor for nutrients that are released by the plants as they begin to die and decompose.

Meanwhile, contractors for Solitude Lake Management, a private aquatic-management company based in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, began making back-and-forth sweeps across the basin, applying a diluted mixture of herbicides, including diquat, through hoses lowered underneath the surface.
The day after treating the boat basin, the team conducted similar work with another chemical herbicide, endothall, at Selden Cove. Sperry said researchers stayed in the area for several days to monitor the effects of the herbicide. After that, he said they’ll come back once a month — except when the river is frozen in the winter — for up to a year to conduct vegetation surveys.
During an online public meeting last month, the Corps reported the results from its vegetation surveys at four locations treated with herbicides in 2024, which showed large drop-offs in the amount of hydrilla and another invasive species, water chestnut.
Chester Basin, which was treated with a combination of endothall and diquat last year, saw a reduction in hydrilla while native plants pickerelweed, wild rice, and eelgrass were unaffected. The invasive plant cabomba, which is present at the site, is also resistant to diquat and would need to be managed by other methods, Sperry said.
Alicea Charamut, the executive director of the Rivers Alliance of Connecticut, a nonprofit conservation group, said that boaters in areas treated by the Army Corps have also reported clearer waterways — though she cautioned that “several years” of further data is needed to develop an effective management plan.
“Conditions change from year to year,” Charamut said. “I don’t think people truly understand how dynamic river systems are, especially tidal river systems like the Connecticut River… and to be able to understand, we need to have that consistent monitoring and data from year to year, to see how management, how effective it is.”
The final phase of the Army Corps’ work this summer involved a series of “practice runs” using inert dyes that mimic the spread of herbicide through a particular stretch of water.

During one such test at Portland Boat Works earlier this month, researchers set up seven data buoys along more than a mile of river to track the spread of the diluted dye being slowly released from a 60-gallon tank. 
Portland was one of four locations in Connecticut and Massachusetts where the dye studies are scheduled to take place through Sept. 19.
The location was also one of several where the Army Corps applied herbicides to combat hydrilla in 2024, but Sperry said that swift currents in the area prevented the chemicals from settling on the plants. “We didn’t get the level of control we were hoping for,” he said.
Armed with more data, he added, the team hoped to be able to tweak their methods and try again next summer.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/DIQUAT-SPRAYING-0820-DE-032-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 16:58:03.682518

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin is urging a judge to dismiss a lawsuit the state public defender’s office filed to learn more about how state police use and store genetic evidence analyzed using “rapid DNA” technology.
The public defender’s office sued in July after learning during discovery in a criminal case that the state has maintained what the office called a secret database of rapid DNA evidence since 2021. Such storage risks civil rights abuses because it’s unregulated, was not authorized by legislators, and is largely unknown to the public, the lawsuit said. The office wants the internal memo it says “authorized” state police to create the database, but Platkin’s records custodians have refused to disclose it.
In a filing last week, Platkin argued that the public defender’s office already has a copy of the state police’s manual explaining how rapid-DNA tests are performed at crime scenes and police stations and how that genetic data then gets stored. So they don’t need the May 2021 internal memo, which was written by a lawyer with the state’s criminal justice division, the filing says.
That memo did not authorize rapid DNA and instead contains legal research and analysis addressing how law enforcement agencies should use rapid DNA technology and how criminal defendants could challenge its use, Platkin says. It’s a deliberative document and predated the attorney general’s July 2021 decision to green-light the use of rapid DNA, making it exempt from disclosure under the state’s Open Public Records Act, the state argued.
Platkin’s office also denied the public defender’s claim that people whose DNA winds up in the database don’t have a clear path to remove it.
“Disclosure would create a profound chilling effect on the government because agencies would no longer be assured that their internal deliberations are protected. Such result would be absurd,” the filing says.
The technology allows officers to get DNA results within about 90 minutes, bypassing backlogs and sometimes lengthy delays at DNA laboratories. Critics have questioned its accuracy, raising concerns about quality controls.

Bernie Sanders to try and rein in what they view as corporate greed by taxing excessive salaries for America’s top executives.
HR 5298, known as the Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act, would raise taxes on corporations that pay their executives 50 times the wages of their workers. A news release circulated by Tlaib’s office said that if Tesla, X and SpaceX head Elon Musk, for example, receives the full $975 billion compensation package that Tesla’s board recently proposed, the company would – under her bill – owe up to $100 billion in additional taxes over the next decade.
“Working people are sick and tired of corporate greed. CEOs are now making 290 times more than their average worker,” Tlaib said in a statement. “It’s disgraceful that corporations continue to rake in record profits by exploiting the labor of their workers. Every worker deserves a living wage and human dignity on the job.”
Sanders, in a statement, said American workers can no longer tolerate a “rigged economy,” one that “enables the richest man in the world, Elon Musk, to become the first trillionaire while 60% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck and millions work longer hours for lower wages.” 
“It is unacceptable that the CEOs of the largest low-wage corporations make more than 630 times what their average workers make,” Sanders said. “This is not only morally obscene, but also insane economic policy. No society can survive when one man becomes a trillionaire while the working class is unable to afford basic necessities.”
The Democrats’ bill would also create penalties that would start at 0.5 percentage points for companies with CEO-to-worker pay ratios between 50-to-1 and 100-to-1, increasing to the highest rate for firms where executives make more than 500 times worker pay. The proposal would raise an estimated $150 billion over 10 years if current pay patterns continue.
It is unclear whether the bill has any momentum, as both chambers of Congress are controlled by Republicans, and with President Donald Trump in the White House.

Goldner was appointed to the commission in May 2021 and has served as chair since November of that year. Ayotte informed Goldner via a letter that he would not be reappointed. 
Goldner
The letter, dated Sept. 15, states that Goldner’s term would conclude at 5 p.m. that evening. Goldner’s term ended officially on July 1 but he had continued to occupy the seat on a holdover basis. Ayotte’s decision to end his term was originally reported by WMUR.
Ayotte did not provide a reason for her decision in the letter, in a statement from her office sent via email on Monday, or in social media posts referencing the decision.
“Governor Ayotte thanks (Goldner) for his service to our state,” spokesperson John Corbett said in the statement. “The Governor’s Office has begun an immediate search for his replacement to ensure the regulatory process is transparent, accountable, and protects Granite Staters from rate hikes.”
New Hampshire Consumer Advocate Donald Kreis said he was not surprised by the decision. 
“The governor made her displeasure with Goldner pretty public,” Kreis said, pointing to Ayotte’s reaction to a ruling of the PUC in July granting rate increases to utility Eversource Energy. In a statement, Ayotte said at the time she was “extremely disappointed” in the outcome of the case. 
While Kreis said Goldner was “a thoughtful and respectful presence in the hearing room,” the commissioner’s business background showed in his leadership style and approach to regulation, according to Kreis. 
Goldner is an engineer and former business executive who worked for semiconductor and other electronics businesses for more than 30 years, according to a biography on the PUC website. His industry-insider approach sometimes made litigating before the PUC a challenge, Kreis said.
“I think Chairman Goldner had trouble understanding the difference between running a utility company and regulating a utility company,” Kreis said. “… When you’re the regulator, you’re better advised to let the stakeholders try to work with each other to address as much as they can by consensus.”
Goldner’s term on the PUC also began controversially, with critics accusing him of denying climate change and not being sufficiently familiar with clean energy technology after he was nominated by former Gov. Chris Sununu in 2021.

The vote was the result of a procedural error — town officials had failed to correctly warn the initial bond votes.

This story by Briana Brady was first published in the Shelburne News on Sept. 11, 2025.
Shelburne voters on Tuesday re-certified a slate of bonds that had previously been approved by residents over the past four years.
The 15 different bonds total just over $5 million dollars and pay for some projects that have already been completed, such as the Irish Hill recreation path and the beach house replacement. There were no new bonds included in the vote, which passed 671-111.
The vote was the result of a procedural error — town officials had failed to correctly warn the initial bond votes.
According to state law, legal notices must be placed in the paper of record every week for three consecutive weeks leading up to a bond vote. In the case of these bonds, not all those notices were placed, which nullified the initial votes and prevented the town from accessing the bond funds.
The town caught the issue as part of a financial overhaul led by the new finance director Patricia Carpenter. Over the last year, her office has been working through a backlog of audits that hadn’t been completed since 2021.
In assessing the town’s finances, Carpenter’s office noticed that many of the bonds that had been taken out over the years had never been drawn down — towns will traditionally front cash or take out short term loans known as bond anticipation notes to pay for projects, taking on the debt with the state bond bank once the item has been purchased or the project completed.
This put Shelburne in a sticky situation. Because the bonds had never been drawn down and now couldn’t be due to the issue with the legal notices, it left the town with $1.2 million in cash on hand and an $800,000 bond anticipation notice for new water meters that would need re-approval to be rolled over on Sept. 20.
Had the vote been rejected, the town might have been forced to use private loan providers to finance its debt, which usually offer much higher interest rates than the state bond bank. Currently the interest rate at the bond bank is around 5% — higher than it might have been when the bonds were initially passed, but lower than what the town might find elsewhere.
In response to an email releasing the unofficial results of the vote on Tuesday night, town employee Susan Cannizzaro quickly wrote what most were probably thinking, “Phew! Great news!”
Although the town will now be able to draw down its bonds, there are still some issues that need attention.
Carpenter said the problems with warning for the bond votes is an example of why the town’s financial policies and procedures need updating — there was confusion over whose responsibility it was to post the legal notices.
“The people that were here were here for so long that they didn’t have policies and procedures. They just knew what to do. And so, when you get new people in here, we all don’t know,” Carpenter said in an interview about the financial audits.
Updating the policies and procedures, she added, and writing everything down, will ensure that, even if there’s turnover, everyone will know who is responsible for what.
“I am excited to get back to work now that we’ve put this issue behind us. Onward!” selectboard chair Mike Ashooh wrote in response to the bonds passing again.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota has earned the highest possible bond rating from three of Wall Street’s major credit agencies, affirming the state’s strong financial position despite some concerning fiscal trends and uncertainty from the federal government.
Minnesota’s AAA bond rating, which it has maintained for four consecutive years, means that the state can borrow money cheaply to fund infrastructure projects.
“While actions at the federal level are creating red flags for the U.S. economy, America’s top rating agencies have once again signaled their support for the responsible financial decisions we are making here in Minnesota,” Gov. Tim Walz said in a statement Monday. “These ratings are a testament to the strength of Minnesota’s economy and our commitment to responsible financial stewardship.”
Walz is expected to announce a bid for a third term any day now.
Minnesota is one of 16 states that have a AAA bond rating, according to the governor’s office.
Moody’s Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Group in their comments affirming Minnesota’s bond ratings said the state has a strong economy and a healthy reserve fund to pay off debt.
Minnesota’s general fund revenues in August were about 4% above the state’s February forecast, according to Minnesota Management and Budget, the state’s budget agency. In fiscal year 2025, year-to-date receipts are about 0.5% higher than the forecast.
In May, Moody’s downgraded the country’s credit rating, citing concern over the federal government’s ability to pay back debt.
The downgrade “reflects the increase over more than a decade in government debt and interest payment ratios to levels that are significantly higher than similarly rated sovereigns,” Moody’s said in a statement.
Erin Campbell, MMB’s commissioner, said in a statement that Minnesota had to make difficult budgetary decisions during the legislative session earlier this year, but it has paid off through the state’s bond rating.
“We had to make hard budgetary choices this year and were able to reach consensus on those choices with the most closely divided Legislature in the country — which is a major accomplishment,” Campbell said.
The state government is confronting significant growth in health care spending due in part to the aging of Minnesota’s population and corresponding increase in people who need help, while economic growth has been hampered by a lack of workers.
MMB will make another detailed forecast in November or early December.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN250425_1005-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-09-15 15:56:56.803438

(File photo courtesy of Clemson University)Clemson University has fired an employee and removed two professors from teaching duties for what it called “inappropriate” social media posts related to the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
The firing came two days after the university suspended the still-unnamed employee. An investigation for possible termination is underway for the two professors. They were initially told Friday to “stay out of the classroom,” a statement from the school read.
The public Upstate university declined to provide any further information on the “personnel matters.”
Clemson announced the firing and teaching suspensions an hour before the school’s governing board was scheduled to gather for an emergency meeting Monday.
The social media posts came to light last week when Clemson College Republicans began flagging the three employees’ online reactions to Kirk’s death — including posts from two assistant professors.
The actions followed outcry online from state politicians, Clemson students and alumni and Republican members of South Carolina’s congressional delegation.
The school posted a notice of the closed-door meeting following a letter from Legislature’s GOP leaders Saturday calling on the board to gather.
Clemson suspends employee following social media posts mocking death of Charlie Kirk

On Monday, Attorney General Alan Wilson, who is running for governor in 2026, told Clemson leadership they can fire the employees without risking prosecution.
A state law dating to 1950 makes it illegal to “discharge a citizen from employment or occupation” because of their “political opinions or the exercise of political rights and privileges guaranteed to every citizen.” Violators can be fined up to $1,000 and sentenced to up to two years in prison.
But that law “poses no obstacle from a criminal law standpoint to the termination of these individuals,” Wilson wrote in a publicly released letter addressed to Clemson President James Clements. The attorney general noted he’d carefully reviewed the law’s history and court precedent.
“I have determined that any corrective action by Clemson, terminating these professors, will not be prosecuted in the criminal courts of this State,” he wrote, adding that applies to every other college in South Carolina as well.
“I strongly support freedom of speech protected by the First Amendment, as defined by court decisions, as well as civil discourse conducted in a civil manner,” he wrote. “The statements of these professors were far from civil, however. Just the exact opposite.”
Wilson, in his letter, called the comments “vile and incendiary comments on a public platform.”
While Clemson officials don’t risk prosecution, the college could still be sued “if the professors believe their free speech rights were violated” by their firing, Wilson noted. However, he concluded by citing a 2006 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court that all employees of the government “must accept certain limitations on his or her freedom.”
No one requested Wilson’s opinion. He reviewed the law on his own, according to his office.
Two days earlier, when Clemson announced the first suspension, Wilson posted on social media “Nope. Not good enough.”
“Clemson, you know what to do — do it,” wrote the graduate of Francis Marion University and the University of South Carolina School of Law.
Other Republican gubernatorial candidates also weighed in. None of them graduated from Clemson.
U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, whose district covers South Carolina’s Charlotte suburbs, posted on social media that other universities have fired employees and expelled students.
“For the safety of the students, Clemson must take action or lose every cent of funding,” wrote Norman, a Presbyterian College graduate.
Clemson is far from the only public college investigating social media posts.
The University of Mississippi announced last week it had terminated an employee due to “hurtful, insensitive comments” made on social media regarding Kirk’s killing, according to reports by Mississippi Today, a States Newsroom affiliate.
Ball State University also is investigating similar postings from a pair of employees, according to the Star Press in Muncie, Indiana.
Middle Tennessee University fired a dean for online comments.
And the University of Tennessee announced Monday it was investigating posts from an assistant professor, NBC affiliate WSMV-TV reported.
SC colleges to talk about campus safety in wake of Charlie Kirk assassination

U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, a Citadel graduate who represents the state’s coastal 1st Congressional District, called on state legislative leaders to call a special session to “defund Clemson until they do what is right, ethically and morally.”
Furthermore, Mace wrote a letter to U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, asking the agency to “cut off federal funding from any elementary, secondary, and post-secondary educational institution refusing to hold teachers or administrators accountable for celebrating the murder of Charlie Kirk.”
And Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette on Saturday urged students to drop out of any classes taught by professors who “spewed hateful speech and far-left rhetoric celebrating the death of Charlie Kirk.” For all students who drop a class for those reasons, their schools should refund them for the cost of the class, said Evette, a graduate of Cleveland State University in Ohio.
Kirk, who co-founded Turning Point USA in 2012 to combat progressive politics on college campuses, was shot in the neck about 12:20 p.m. Wednesday as he debated with students at Utah Valley University. About 3,000 people gathered outside for one of Kirk’s signature “prove me wrong” events.
A controversial figure whose organization fueled a conservative youth movement, Kirk was answering a question about mass shootings when he was hit by a single bullet. The 31-year-old father of two was pronounced dead at a local hospital. On Friday morning, officials announced the arrest of a 22-year-old Utah man, who was not a student of that college.

(Photo by 	GarysFRP/Getty Images)The federal permit that allows Northwest states and some Native nations to trap and kill salmon-eating sea lions in the Columbia River was reapproved late last week.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Marine Fisheries Service renewed a 2020 permit that had allowed the removal of 540 California sea lions and 176 Steller sea lions from Bonneville Dam and Willamette Falls.
Of that approved number, only 116 Californias and 114 Stellers were taken. The new permit allows the remainder of the original permit to be removed — a total of 486 sea lions between now and Aug. 22, 2030.
The approach generated immense pushback in the late 2010s, with the 2020 permit application generating about 22,000 public comments — of which, fewer than 200 supported it, The Seattle Times reported then.
But controversy over the killings has faded in the years since. Officials have repeatedly failed to reach consensus on how to fight off salmon extinction in the river, leaving sea lions as an obvious target.
This time, NOAA said, the permit application received only one comment.
 Key salmon predators

“This extension allows us to continue important work to manage (sea lion) predation on salmon, steelhead and other native fish populations while supporting ongoing recovery efforts in the lower Columbia River,” Casey Clark, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife’s lead marine mammal researcher, said in an email.
The department targets the sea lions at Bonneville Dam in particular because fish returning to spawn are corralled into the dams’ three fish ladders’ roughly 12-foot-wide entries as they try to pass the dam. That turns the entrance into a buffet for the opportunistic predators.
“The dams have created an ‘evolutionary win’ for the sea lions: They can feast at the fish ladders with very little effort,” said Kerry Solan, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Portland District, which runs the dam. “As part of our (sea lion) hazing efforts, we use pyrotechnics and rubber bullets: basically, nonlethal deterrents to move the sea lions away from those areas.”
But the animals don’t waste time while they’re at the dam. They eat three to five salmon a day on average, said Doug Hatch, a senior scientist at the Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fishing Commission, which represents three of the four treaty tribes in the program.
Hatch has led the organization’s sea lion program since 2005, and says 515 sea lions have been removed since 2008.
The vast majority of those removed sea lions were killed, largely because zoos don’t want them, he said. The animals are killed by a veterinarian who injects them with a sedative, then euthanasia drugs.
While removal numbers vary from year to year, federal data shows the total is trending upward.
And Hatch said modeling shows those 515 removals have helped keep struggling salmon stocks afloat, for now.
“Conservative estimates put that at over 100,000 fish that have been saved by these sea lion removals,” he said.
Those removals are crucial for stopping sea lions from “decimating” salmon stocks, Solan said. That’s because, despite the Corps’ best efforts to scare the animals away, they just keep coming back.
“Hazing temporarily changes foraging behavior in a small area for a brief period of time, because sea lions quickly learn that hazing doesn’t hurt,” she said in an email. “Overall, it is difficult for nonlethal measures to overcome the lure of a seafood buffet at the artificial constriction presented by the dam.”
 Growing populations

But populations of the protected animals continue to grow.
The first three Steller sea lions were documented at Bonneville Dam in 2003, according to NOAA Fisheries. Fifteen years later, “a minimum of 66 animals were observed at the dam during a single day.”
And in the past decade, the number of California sea lions in the Columbia River basin jumped from fewer than 500 to around 4,000.
Hatch said that while no one knows exactly what’s driving that, the best guess is that food sources in Southern California collapsed, and then decent Columbia River fish returns in the 2000s drew sea lions here.
But during that same roughly 20-year period, salmon and steelhead populations have stayed static at Bonneville.
In the river at large, between 10 million and 18 million fish returned each year before the hydropower system. Recently, they’ve numbered about 2.3 million.
Wild fish, in particular, have suffered. Most wild Columbia Basin salmon and steelhead runs are less than 5 percent of their pre-1850s levels, a 2022 NOAA report found.
Of course, the fish confront more challenges than just sea lions. Climate change, ocean overfishing, habitat destruction and dams (which obstruct fish passage and heat the river to deadly highs) all play huge roles in their struggles.
Compounding that, the Trump administration has gutted recovery funding, and the hydropower industry is lobbying for reduced accommodations for the fish.
 More removals ahead

Amid unending finger-pointing over what can be done to prevent salmon extinction in the basin, sea lions have emerged as a rare point of agreement, allowing the removal program to continue largely outside of the limelight.
The program is expanding beyond the easy pickings near Bonneville and Willamette Falls and will remove sea lions at more sites between the Interstate 205 Bridge and McNary Dam.
But Hatch acknowledged that likely won’t be enough to satisfy some who want sea lions removed from other locations. Earlier this year, for example, smelt dippers on the Cowlitz River fumed when the animals munched on smelt runs the state blocked them from harvesting.
“I’m sure, from many people’s perspective, we’re not doing nearly enough,” Hatch said.
But for Hatch, the goal is just to break the animals’ Bonneville Dam habits and keep them down by the mouth of the river where their diet is more varied than just salmon.
“They’re very clever, these animals are,” he said, “it’s hard to keep ahead of them.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)The federal Rural Health Transformation Fund (RHTF) application period opened Monday. Virginia and other states will now have until Nov. 5 to apply for their piece of the $10 billion dollar per year pie. 
With $50 billion earmarked over the next five years, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator Mehmet Oz emphasized on a press call Monday morning how the fund can address root issues for rural health challenges. 
“We think we have an opportunity not just to plug a few of the holes, but to transform in a lasting way the rural health care system in this country.”
He listed investment in workforce, updates to information technology and infrastructure of hospitals as examples of what the funding could fuel. Governors are supposed to work with their states to draft the applications. Awards should be announced by the end of this year and funding disbursed in early 2026. 
It’s not clear when or if the commonwealth will apply for the funding. A spokesperson for Youngkin did not provide a statement by the time of this publication. 
Half of the funding will be evenly distributed to states with approved applications, Oz said. The other half will be awarded to states based on individual state metrics, a release about the applications opening further explained. 
For states that are deemed to have not performed using the funding, the federal government will “have the ability to claw back some of that money and reallocate it to the states that are performing.” 
“This is not punitive, it’s quality control,” Oz said. 
Former Health and Human Services secretary Xavier Becerra said on a separate press call Monday that the RHTF would not be enough to counter recent federal policy actions  by President Donald Trump’s administration and Republican majorities in Congress that advocates and Democratic lawmakers say stand to strain health care across the nation in the months and years ahead. 
“It’s a prescription for a man-made disaster,” Becerra said of recent changes to vaccine access by current HHS secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the lack of renewal of premium tax credits that help people purchase health insurance, and the reconciliation bill passed this summer that will adjust hospital funding mechanisms and likely cause millions to lose Medicaid coverage.
Federal COVID vaccine access shifts reverberate statewide, Va. advocates, health care workers say

Virginia’s Health Benefit Exchange director Keven Patchett told lawmakers last month that about 100,000 people could fall off their insurance if the ACA tax credits aren’t renewed. Virginia’s Medicaid director Cheryl Roberts noted the state’s 600,000 people enrolled in its expanded Medicaid program are most likely to be affected by the eligibility and enrollment changes spelled out in the reconciliation bill. 
Hospitals have warned for months that they could be faced with cuts to services or closures down the line. Augusta Health also recently closed two primary care clinics and an urgent care clinic under its umbrella in Shenandoah Valley, citing the reconciliation bill as part of the reason. 
When asked on the press call how the transformation fund could help further alleviate issues triggered by the reconciliation bill, Oz said that “providing insurance is not providing health care.” 
Eventually health systems could see spikes in private health insurance as hospitals negotiate with private insurers to help offset costs of caring for uninsured patients, health care associations have said.
Former Health Resources and Services Administration head Carole Johnson said on the press call with Becerra that Congress shouldn’t have voted to alter Medicaid “thinking it’s not going to affect all of us.” 
She called the Rural Health Transformation Fund a “band-aid” for larger problems that was used as a “political solution” to get the reconciliation bill through, following pushback from some Republicans with large Medicaid or rural populations in their states. 
Often, rural hospitals depend on both Medicaid and Medicare populations to make their businesses run, Johnson said. 
 A look ahead

As Congress works to conclude its work for the end of this year, Democrats and some Republicans have their sights set on extending the ACA tax credits, to potentially spare at least the estimated 100,000 from losing coverage. 
Democrats have emphasized the lack of the tax credits renewal was one of several reasons they opposed the OBBA. Though ultimately voting for the reconciliation bill, U.S. Rep. Jenn Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, had expressed concerns about it and has since joined a bipartisan chorus to extend the ACA credits for the time being. 
Following this year’s gubernatorial election, either Democrat Abigail Spanberger or Republican Winsome Earle-Sears could oversee the next state budget that would address changes spurred by the federal health care actions.
Spanberger is examining how to streamline the eligibility process for Medicaid to ensure eligible people don’t fall off. Earle-Sears has expressed interest in tapping into Virginia’s “rainy day fund” to cover the gap, which lawmakers in appropriations committees stress is a short-term solution. Either woman would also be able to weigh in on future Rural Health Transformation Fund applications to direct that federal money to Virginia’s areas of need. 
For now, White House spokeswoman Victoria LaCivita emphasized in a statement that the program is “a win for every rural community across the country, and the administration urges every single governor to apply.”

Dustin McNally, R-Grand Forks. (Photo courtesy of Dustin McNally)Grand Forks-area Republicans selected a University of North Dakota faculty member to fill the legislative seat vacated by Rep. Emily O’Brien.
Dustin McNally, assistant dean of student success for the College of Engineering and Mines at UND, was selected Saturday after multiple rounds of voting by Republican members of District 42. 
“I just want all the people in my district to know that I’m listening to them and trying my best to represent their views,” McNally told the North Dakota Monitor on Monday.
O’Brien resigned her seat in August after accepting a position to become the deputy commissioner for the Department of Health and Human Services. She had served in the Legislature since 2017.
McNally challenged Sen. Claire Cory, R-Grand Forks, during the 2024 Republican primary, but failed to secure the party’s nomination after receiving 44% of the vote in the two-way contest.
“I knocked on 1,000 doors, and talked to people and flyered, so people have heard from me and did vote for me,” he said. “I just didn’t get enough votes. So, I think it made sense for me to be the representative because the people know me.”
Grand Forks lawmaker resigns to join North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services

He said one of the issues he plans to focus on is continuing to reform the state’s property tax system, even after lawmakers expanded the state’s primary residence credit during the 2025 legislative session. 
Phyllis Lewis, vice chair for NDGOP District 42, said she didn’t have too many interactions with McNally before Saturday’s vote, but she hopes he’ll keep the district’s conservative values alive as he becomes a state lawmaker.
“We’ll definitely be looking forward to seeing if he does follow through and does what he’s saying,” Lewis said.
McNally, originally from Lisbon, N.D., holds two bachelor’s degrees from UND in mechanical engineering and international studies. He also received a master’s degree in mechanical engineering from UND in 2007, according to the UND website.
After graduation, he worked as an engineer for the Energy and Environmental Research Center at UND before becoming a full-time faculty member in 2013.
McNally said he plans to run for election to the seat during the 2026 election to seek to complete O’Brien’s term that expires in 2028.
When asked what he will bring to the table as a new lawmaker, McNally said one word: leadership. He added he wants to have meetings with Grand Forks residents and start a newsletter to keep people informed about major issues.
“We don’t just want another vote for someone that is just going to vote on bills, but we need a leader in our district, in the Legislature,” he said.

(Screenshot via Attorney General's X livestream)Attorney General James Uthmeier filed two new complaints Monday against pornography companies based in Cyprus, Florida, and California for failing to prevent children from accessing online adult content.
The complaints were both filed in the Twelfth Judicial Circuit in Sarasota County seeking $50,000 per violation from each of the pornographic companies. The firms have bucked a 2024 Florida law requiring porn networks to install an age verification tool blocking minors from surfing these sites, Uthmeier argues.
“Florida is committed to being the best place to raise children. We passed strong legislation to keep kids from being exposed to harmful and toxic material, and instead of following it, these platforms ignored it,” Uthmeier said in a news release. “We are taking them to court to make sure they cannot continue bypassing Florida’s common sense safeguards.”
This is Uthmeier’s second round of legal action against international pornographic websites lacking age verification tools. In August, he sued a host of Czech-owned porn companies for refusing to comply with Florida age laws. Some decried the “idiocracy” contributing to the “scam” of age verification.
The first complaint targets the Cyprus-based Gethins Limited and the Deerfield Beach-based companies Toccata, Segpay Gateway, and Segregated Payments. The for-profits all work on the website “lustyheroes.com,” which offers pornographic video game content without an age-blocker, the suit says.
The other complaint zeroes in on California’s Aylo Holdings USA and Aylo Billing US, as well as the Cyprus-based Aylo Group and Nutaku Entertainment. The complaint says these companies operate a variety of popular pornographic sites lacking user age-walls, including PornHub, RedTube, Tube8, and YouPorn.
All websites are fully out of compliance except for SpiceVids, which added a paywall in July 2025 and “immediately” allows users to access the site after pressing “enter.”
This comes a year after the GOP-led Florida legislature passed HB 3, which demanded social media sites require their users to be at least 14 and pornography sites ensure their users are over 18.

Patrick Morrisey/Courtesy photo)A West Virginia woman is celebrating this week after winning $1 million by playing the West Virginia Lottery’s Powerball.
Mary Kathryn Hernandez bought her winning Powerball ticket from a 7-Eleven convenience store in her hometown of Hedgesville, according to statements given during a news conference on Monday. 
The prize came from the Powerball drawing on Sept. 6.
A spokesperson for Gov. Patrick Morrisey said, after taxes, Hernandez took home a little more than $700,000 from the winning ticket.
Hernandez did not speak at Monday’s news conference, which was hosted by the West Virginia Lottery with remarks from Morrisey. Morrisey said Hernandez is planning on using some of the winnings to go on vacation with her daughter.
West Virginia law allows lottery winners who win $1 million or more in a state drawing to remain anonymous. Morrisey said Hernandez is one of three out of the last 20 winners of $1 million or more in the state to choose to go public about their winnings.
Dave Bradley, the acting director for the state lottery, said the jackpot that Hernandez won part of totaled $1.8 billion — the second largest jackpot in history — over 42 consecutive weeks of drawings. Hernandez’s winning ticket, he said, was one of 18 total $1 million wins selected in the jackpot’s final drawing.
The 7-Eleven that sold the winning ticket to Hernandez will also receive a 1% selling bonus totaling $10,000. All retailers in West Virginia that sell a winning ticket for $500 or more receive a selling bonus.
Morrisey said he knew the Hedgesville community would be excited for Hernandez’s win. He said the money was “going to make a big difference” in Hernandez’s life and that of her family.
“I think that you’re going to become one of the most popular people in Hedgesville,” Morrisey said. “… I know a lot of the people in that community. This is going to be wonderful. People will be celebrating it.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa’s new state legislator, Catelin Drey, was sworn into office Monday, officially ending Republicans’ supermajority hold on the chamber.
Drey, a Sioux City Democrat, won the August special election to represent Iowa Senate District 1, which was called following the passing of Sen. Rocky De Witt, R-Lawton, in June. The 37-year-old marketing firm account executive and mother won with 55% against her Republican opponent Christopher Prosch at 44% in the election.
On Monday, Drey stood in the Iowa Senate chamber and took her oath of office from Iowa Supreme Court Justice Matthew McDermott. She was joined by her husband, children and Senate Democratic colleagues.

Speaking to reporters, Drey said she was “honored” to join the state Senate while acknowledging that political tensions are high in the aftermath of the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and the shooting of two high school students by a classmate in Colorado.
“There was something very humbling about taking the official oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the state of Iowa at a moment when it feels like that has become increasingly difficult or increasingly controversial,” Drey said. “And so, that oath is sacred, and I look forward to doing the best that I can to uphold that.”
Drey said she believed it was important for leaders to work to prevent future instances of politically motivated violence.
“I think right now we have to turn the temperature down,” Drey said. “And talking to my neighbors, I think that we’re much closer politically than the climate right now gives us credit for. I’m thinking about the safety of kids in school, I’m thinking about the safety of myself and my Senate colleagues. But I am optimistic that we have an awareness now that this type of rhetoric is dangerous, and I’m also optimistic that we can find some solutions to solve the gun violence crisis that is ongoing in this country.”
In addition to speaking in support of efforts on firearm regulation, Drey said that she wants to focus on issues like public education funding, child support and water quality as a state legislator.
With Drey sworn in, there are now 17 Democrats in the Iowa Senate, breaking Republicans’ 34-member supermajority. While Republicans maintain a large majority in the chamber — in addition to retaining supermajority control of the Iowa House and holding all but one statewide elected office — Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner said the special election results will push Iowa Republicans to work more with members of the minority party in the 2026 legislative session than they had in previous years.
“Way too often the last few sessions it was perhaps a Senate of 34,” Weiner said. “Now we’re a Senate of 50. If they want to get people confirmed, if they want some other things, they will need to work with us. But that’s honestly the way it should work.”
In addition to Drey’s victory, Democrats have fared well in some other Iowa special elections in 2025, including the victory of Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, in a January special election. Democrats have said these recent victories show the party could be more competitive in Iowa’s 2026 midterm elections than in previous recent elections.

The Delaware Tourism Office (DTO) has opened applications for the second round of its Tournaments, Events, and Athletic Meets Sponsorship (TEAMS) Program, designed to grow the state’s sports tourism industry.
The TEAMS initiative provides financial support to attract new regional, national, and international sporting events while helping existing tournaments in Delaware expand their reach.
“The TEAMS program plays a vital role in positioning Delaware as a premier destination for sports tourism,” said Division of Small Business Deputy Director Jaimie Watts. 
The program is open to both new and existing events.
“By providing targeted financial support and resources, we empower event organizers to bring high-profile tournaments and competitions to our state—driving economic growth, increasing visitor stays, and showcasing Delaware on a regional and national stage,” said Watts.

 Officials say it is intended to support tournaments that increase overnight stays, boost the state economy, and generate regional or national media coverage.
“Sports Tourism is a major economic driver in our state,” said DTO’s Sports Sales Leader Ryan Wolfe. 
“Last year alone we saw over $75 million in estimated economic impact from our efforts. Programs like TEAMS help us attract bigger, bolder events that bring fans, athletes, and media from all over the country. By backing exciting new events and helping our established tournaments level up, we’re fueling big economic wins, and putting Delaware in the spotlight in the sports scene.”
Applications are available on a first-come, first-serve basis through the DTO website and will be reviewed until funding is depleted.
In its first year, TEAMS received 43 applications across 14 types of sports. Twenty-four organizations were awarded a total of $500,000, generating an estimated $75 million in economic impact, more than 20,000 hotel room nights, and participation from 180,000 people.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/pexels-pavel-danilyuk-6539271-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-15 14:57:01.459426

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s top education official has threatened to ban from the classroom any teacher who “attempts to glorify” the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
But, revoking an educator’s license to teach is not a decision state Superintendent Ryan Walters can make alone. A majority of the Oklahoma State Board of Education would have to agree, and though Walters leads the board, his relationship with a majority of its members has been rocky.
Even when past board members voted in lockstep with Walters, his prior attempts to revoke teaching licenses over political statements have been difficult and protracted legal affairs that sometimes spilled over into court, with educators’ First Amendment rights and their strict professional conduct standards hanging in the balance.
“Let me be clear: any teacher or employee who attempts to glorify this disgusting act of violence will have their teaching license taken from them and will never step foot in an Oklahoma school again,” Walters wrote in an announcement posted to social media on Thursday.
Kirk, a founder of the conservative youth organization Turning Point USA, was shot to death Wednesday while speaking at Utah Valley University. He is survived by his wife, Erika, and their two young children.

Walters on Saturday identified an Inola Public Schools teacher whom he said his administration is investigating for calling Kirk a “racist, misogynist piece of s—” on video. A Sand Springs Public Schools teacher also is under investigation for a Facebook post about Kirk, Walters wrote on social media.
The Sand Springs middle school teacher had written, “Charlie Kirk died the same way he lived: bringing out the worst in people,” according to screenshots posted on social media by Rep. Gabe Woolley, R-Broken Arrow, who alerted Walters to the teacher’s post.
“This disgraceful rhetoric has no place in schools,” Walters wrote of the teacher’s words. “Charlie Kirk was an amazing man who inspired millions of young adults. This will not be tolerated in Oklahoma classrooms. We are investigating this teacher’s actions.”
The Oklahoma State Department of Education has received numerous reports of teachers’ comments, and each will be investigated on a case-by-case basis, agency spokesperson Madison Cercy said.
“Superintendent Walters has made it clear: there is no place in Oklahoma classrooms for disgusting attacks promoting and justifying political assassinations that disrespects a man who dedicated his life to America, truth, and his Christian faith,” Cercy said after Oklahoma Voice asked how the agency would define glorification of Kirk’s killing.

Employees of public and private entities across the country, including public school teachers, are facing punishment in the workplace for posting negative comments about Kirk on social media, according to the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, an organization advocating for free speech. The foundation condemned both the shooting of Kirk and “the cancel culture machine” that has ensued since his death as attacks on free and open discourse.
In Oklahoma, revoking a teaching certificate most commonly occurs when an educator is convicted of a crime, but during Walters’ tenure as state superintendent, teachers’ political speech has come under fire, as well.
Last year, the state Board of Education revoked the certification of former Norman High School teacher Summer Boismier after a yearslong process that involved overruling the recommendations of a judge, who had reviewed the case and found Walters’ staff failed to prove the teacher deserved such a penalty. 
As part of a classroom display opposing book bans, Boismier had posted a QR code that linked to the Brooklyn Public Library’s free online catalog. The state Education Department contended that some of the books, among thousands in the catalog, contained content inappropriate for minors. 
Her appeal to overturn the revocation is still pending in Oklahoma County District Court.
After the 2024 assassination attempt of President Donald Trump, Walters tried to revoke two teachers’ certifications over their social media posts. Both cases still are stuck in procedural limbo, and neither educator has had their certification suspended or revoked so far.
One of the teachers, of Ardmore City Schools, made a Facebook comment stating she wished Trump’s shooter “had a better scope.”
The other, of Edmond Public Schools, is facing decertification over a picture he posted five years before the assassination attempt. The 2019 image shows a child wearing a Trump mask, a boy pointing a toy knife at the mask and the teacher grimacing.  
In August 2024, the state Board of Education referred both cases to a hearing before an administrative law judge, who would review evidence and testimony before recommending whether the board should take further action.

The teacher from Edmond has not yet had his hearing, according to the Oklahoma City law firm he hired to represent him in the proceedings, White & Weddle P.C. 
Records in Oklahoma County District Court show his attorneys have sought a court order to obtain the Education Department’s full investigative file of his revocation case.
The Education Department did not return a request for comment on whether the Ardmore teacher has had her hearing yet.
State law requires strict professional standards for educators that allow teachers to be fired and their certifications to be revoked for certain offenses. That includes punishment for “moral turpitude,” which is defined in part as immoral behavior or failing to faithfully perform a teacher’s duties.
Public schools have “broad authority” to limit educators’ speech both while on the job and outside of work, according to the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teacher union.
Even when an educator is speaking as a private citizen outside of work, a government employer might sometimes limit a teacher’s speech if it is disrespectful or too disruptive, particularly if it sparks protests, complaints from students and families, or criticism from the broader community, according to NEA guidance.
But teachers are still protected under the First Amendment to express their opinions outside the classroom as private citizens, “regardless of whether Superintendent Walters agrees with them,” said Megan Lambert, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma.
“While some narrow categories of speech are not protected by the First Amendment, the Superintendent’s vague description of ‘attempts to glorify’ Charlie Kirk’s death is not among those exceptions,” Lambert said. “In fact, political speech lies at the heart of the First Amendment’s protection, and the state is constitutionally prohibited from punishing teachers because it disagrees with the viewpoint they express.”

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)A New Jersey Republican’s proposal to add additional penalties for politically motivated violent crimes won bipartisan support on Monday.
Sen. Brian Stack (D-Hudson) will join Sen. Doug Steinhardt (R-Warren) as a prime sponsor of yet-to-be-introduced legislation that would create heightened penalties and mandatory minimum sentences for certain violent crimes that were motivated by political animus.
Steinhardt’s push to boost penalties for political violence follows the assassination of Republican organizer and influencer Charlie Kirk, who was fatally shot during an event at a Utah university last week.
“Working together is the only way forward, and it sends a crucial message that this isn’t a partisan issue. Political violence hurts everyone and it’s happening too often to too many people. We must act now to deter it and hold violent offenders accountable,” Steinhardt said in a statement.
Kirk’s killing was the latest in a spate of politically motivated slayings.
In June, a gunman posing as a police officer killed Minnesota state Representative Melissa Hortman, a Democrat, and her husband and critically wounded Minnesota Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife. The shootings prompted New Jersey lawmakers to seek greater protections for their personal information.
“Politically motivated violence is an attack on the foundation of our democracy. No one in this country should live in fear for speaking their mind, and elected officials must be able to govern free from threats, harassment, or attempts to silence them for their beliefs,” Stack said in a statement.
The bill has yet to be formally introduced. Lawmakers can introduce bills when the Legislature is called for a quorum, though the Legislature is expected to stay in recess until after this year’s Assembly and gubernatorial elections.
The scope and severity of the additional penalties contemplated by the bill are unclear. Under existing law, bias intimidation offenses — what New Jersey calls hate crimes — raise the degree of a given offense by one.
For example, an individual charged with second-degree aggravated assault could face five to 10 years in prison, while an individual charged with the same crime with a bias intimidation upgrade could face 10 to 20 years.

Social media comments concerning Kirk’s death have proliferated in Virginia, including remarks by school system workers in Accomack, Chesterfield, and Orange counties and the city of Newport News that have stoked controversy.

On Sunday, Axios Richmond reported that Chesterfield County School Board member Dorothy Heffron announced she would resign at the end of her term on December 31, following her widely criticized social media post that drew condemnation from Gov. Glenn Youngkin, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is also running for governor, and other leaders. 
“Call me old fashioned, but I remember when we used to be okay with shooting Nazis,” Heffron wrote on Instagram. Her account has since been deleted.
“Parents entrust our educators with the care and development of their children, and they rightly expect teachers and school leaders to model the values of respect, civility, and responsibility,” said Gullickson in a statement. “Anyone who would suggest the heinous murder of the father of two young children is acceptable should be disqualified from teaching or working with children again.”
Heffron’s remarks struck a nerve among Republicans including Youngkin and. Earle-Sears, who claimed on Sept. 14 that Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger had not responded to the tragedy or social media remarks.
Spanberger shared a statement with Richmond TV news station WWBT on Sept. 12 condemning political violence.
“As the investigation continues and law enforcement continues to build their case, I think it’s important to state unequivocally: I condemn any efforts to justify or minimize the horrific murder of Charlie Kirk or anyone else,” Spanberger wrote.
The Virginia Education Association (VEA), the largest union for teachers and support specialists, questioned the superintendent’s response when, according to VEA President Carol Bauer, their members face harassment through various forms. 
“This is a little bit of political overreach. I certainly agree that educators should model professionalism. We really cannot support a blanket condemnation that fails to distinguish between private personal expression and professional conduct,” Bauer said to 13News Now.
However, Bauer said the association “stands ready” to support its members “whose due process rights have been violated in this climate.”
In Virginia, multiple cases have arisen regarding remarks about the death of the 31-year-old, who was a husband and father of two young children.
One case involving an unnamed staff member at Newport News Public Schools was suspended after reportedly stating, “I hope he suffered through all of it,” in reference to Kirk.
A staff member of Accomack County Public Schools is also under investigation for a comment posted on social media, according to Superintendent Gennifer Miller. Republicans including Earle-Sears have also highlighted another Central Virginia teacher’s comments about Kirk. 
Del. Mike Cherry, R-Colonial Heights, a member of the state House Education Committee, stated that the public deserves both answers and actions.
“Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, we’ve seen some very concerning language (I’m trying to be polite) from Chesterfield teachers and a member of the school board. “The behavior is not the way we should expect those entrusted with our children to act. The public deserves both answers and actions, and they deserve them fast,” Cherry said in a statement Monday.
Prior to his death, Kirk had been known for galvanizing young Republicans and bringing unity to the party, and his efforts through his Turning Point USA organization were widely credited with cementing President Donald Trump’s reelection. 
Kirk was also often a polarizing figure, known for inflammatory remarks on race, gender and religion — including declaring the Civil Rights Act a “huge mistake” in 2023, calling prominent Black women political figures “affirmative action picks” who “do not have the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously,” and saying “it’s worth it” to have “some gun deaths every single year” to protect Second Amendment gun rights.
Florida teachers have also been warned they will be investigated for derogatory social media posts regarding Kirk.

“We are eager to act on this funding plan in the coming days and swiftly send it to the Governor for her signature,” House and Senate Ways and Means Chairs Aaron Michlewitz and Michael Rodrigues said.
The House plans a formal session Wednesday and the Senate has scheduled a formal session for Thursday.
The joint statement from Michlewitz and Rodrigues, released just after noon Monday, said the funds will help hospitals and community health centers “as they confront rising health care costs in the face of persistent economic headwinds and an unfriendly federal government.”
The House and Senate earlier this year debated funding supplements for health care facilities and the chairs said the $234 million will be included “in a partial supplemental budget to be reported out of the House Ways and Means Committee.”
The Legislature has spent much of 2025 working on spending bills and in July dropped from their last supplemental budget $134 million for the Medical Assistance Trust Fund that both branches originally approved and $209 million for fiscally strained hospitals and community health centers that the Senate pushed.

(Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images)North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality State Energy Office is launching a $10 million Home Repair Weatherization Readiness Program, a companion to the current Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP).
This funding applies to counties damaged by Hurricane Helene and identified as “Most Impacted and Distressed” by the State of North Carolina Action Plan, the agency announced last week.
The office plans to award $6 million to the Western Piedmont Council of Governments and $4 million to a list of current WAP service providers.
DEQ hopes to serve more than 575 households with the program, according to a press release.
The funds can contribute to home repair for affected homes on the WAP deferral lists, where households were placed if a home needed major repairs or other work that was not eligible for existing funding.
“This new weatherization readiness funding is an important piece of the comprehensive effort to accelerate long-term recovery and strengthen energy resilience in communities hit hard by Helene,” DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson said. “These projects will drive down home utility bills and ensure safer, healthier and more energy-efficient homes for families who need it most.”
By making affected homes more energy efficient, DEQ is also helping to lower carbon emissions and reducing the strain on the electric grid,
As the state works to provide additional relief to those impacted families, Gov. Josh Stein made a request Monday to ask Congress for $13.5 billion towards Hurricane Helene recovery.
This allotment would contribute to restoring homes and small businesses, supporting local government services, and rebuilding roads and bridges.
Stein will travel to Washington on Wednesday to meet with federal officials about the plea.
“Nearly a year has passed since Hurricane Helene struck western North Carolina, and it’s been nearly nine months since Congress last appropriated money toward recovery. Just like folks in the gulf states, the mid-Atlantic, and Puerto Rico, the people of western North Carolina deserve federal support after a major hurricane, and the time to act is now,” Stein said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/disasternctwo2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-09-15 14:57:01.459426

The Committee for Safe and Secure Elections, created in 2022, is offering a number of new resources for both election officials and law enforcement officers, including pocket-sized legal guides detailing election laws in all 50 states, giving both groups an easily accessible reference should questions – or issues – arise on Election Day.
According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 22 states have enacted or updated laws to protect election officials and poll workers since 2020. In August, the committee released an updated version of these guides to reflect changes to election laws in states across the country.
In observance of the International Day of Democracy, Sept. 15, the Michigan Advance spoke with Tina Barton, the committee’s co-chair and the former Rochester Hills city clerk, about the threats election workers face, and the committee’s work to prepare and protect them. 
Election law is not something that’s taught at an academy when law enforcement officers begin their careers, Barton said, and laws can differ at sites like schools or libraries when they’re being used as an election site.
“We work with Secretaries of State, with [attorneys general], with election officials’ associations in all the different states to say, ‘Hey, what are the most common offenses, or what would law enforcement most likely be confronted with during an election cycle that you would want them to have that law right there in their hands,’” Barton told the Advance.

Barton pointed to laws regarding carrying guns at polling places as one example.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation in 2024 barring individuals from possessing a firearm in a polling place on Election Day, or while in-person early voting is being held, as well as banning weapons within 100 feet of the entrance to an early voting location or polling place. The new laws also bar individuals from carrying a gun within 100 feet of an absentee voter dropbox, local clerk’s office or satellite office in the 40 days leading up to an election.
Law enforcement also may not be aware of specific details on how many feet campaigners are required to stand away from the entrance to a polling place, Barton said. The guides produced by the coalition act as a roadmap detailing for exactly what an officer’s authority and powers are, and what the restrictions are for violations of the law. 
“When they’re road law enforcement and they’re out writing tickets for speeding, for a light that’s out or running a stop sign, whatever that might be, those are common occurrences for them,” Barton said. “Election cycles, people breaking election laws, committing fraud, that sort of thing, that is not [a] commonality for them. So, this puts that in their hands.”
The guides can also serve as a resource for election officials who are struggling to start a conversation about collaboration with law enforcement, Barton said.
“They can provide that to them… and that often is a really good launching point to start the conversations about, ‘Hey, yeah, things have changed around elections,’” Barton said. “We are seeing some threats and harassment, and we probably do need to know more about this, and we probably should be collaborating,”
The committee recommends that clerks provide printed copies of their election law guides in the supply kits they send out to their precincts, and to introduce them in training sessions with election workers, especially the individuals in charge of overseeing a voting site. 
“It empowers and really kind of arms, if you will, election officials, poll workers, precinct workers, law enforcement,” Barton said.“It puts it, again, quick reference, right in their hands. They don’t have to go searching for it, especially if they’re dealing with somebody who’s belligerent.”










It gives law enforcement a clear path, and it also gives election officials some security of an added layer of protection, recognizing them as a protected profession.


They can also serve as an introduction and a guide for other resources the committee makes available, like its security assessment checklist, and its bomb threat resource guide, Barton said. 
Michigan instituted its own protections for election workers in 2023, setting criminal penalties for intimidating election officials or preventing them from performing their duties during an election.
Barton said these laws provide an added layer of assurance for election officials and offer a clear line for law enforcement to proceed with an investigation and prosecution if there is an official that’s being threatened, harassed or abused.
“I think that it’s good on both sides.” Barton said. “It gives law enforcement a clear path, and it also gives election officials some security of an added layer of protection, recognizing them as a protected profession.”
The Brennan Center for Justice, one of the committee’s supporting organizations, in July published a survey showing an increased number of election officials have begun coordinating with law enforcement. 
In 2024, 62% of the election officials surveyed reported working with local law enforcement, while 83% of the 858 officials surveyed in 2025 reported some form of collaboration.
Barton called those efforts a step in the right direction, noting the benefits that can come from the two groups sharing information and working to understand each other’s work environment.
“My husband’s [in] law enforcement. I’m an election official,” Barton said. “If we were to walk into a big room – consider it maybe as a polling location – our lens on how we view that room and what’s important to us is going to be very different.”
Although Barton said her focus would be on the number of outlets to plug in equipment, the flow of foot traffic and where to place booths, her husband’s focus would be more on safety and the ingress and egress of individuals within the polling place.

When looking at the driving force behind threats to election workers, Barton said it was often a loss of trust in public institutions, which can breed anger against individuals in government at any level for any reason. 
In Michigan particularly, where elections are decentralized, election workers are often the face of government in their communities, she added.
It’s also no secret that the country is very politically polarized, Barton said that’s not something election officials often talk about. Instead, they often keep their focus on the election process, the voters and the accuracy and security of the election.
“I will say, as a career election official, I have been friends with election officials all across the country for many years and the vast majority of them, I have no idea what their politics [are],” Barton said.
The close election results in 2020 also sparked a spread of mis- and disinformation, with the modern technological landscape making it easier for people to be siloed into circles and online algorithms without hearing outside perspectives or opinions.
“We’ve lost the ability to have civil conversations,” Barton said. “And I think that in and of itself is a challenge too. I’ve seen it break down friendships, I’ve seen it break down families, and a lot of it is driven by this mis-disinformation.”
At present, one of the committee’s most requested classes focuses on deescalation techniques, Barton said, telling the Advance that even outside of election season, clerks often find themselves in need of those skills. That’s especially true for those in Michigan who carry other responsibilities outside of administering elections.
Additionally, one in three election workers have experienced threats, harassment or abuse because of their job, Barton said. Data from the Brennan Center survey shows that of those reports, 63% said they’d received threats in person and 59% have received threats over the phone.
The attacks have also gone beyond the professional realm into election worker’s personal lives, with Barton telling the Advance she’d had some officials tell her their children have been harassed at school because of their jobs.
Barton said her career is now focused on teaching election officials how to avoid and respond to threats, like having SWAT teams called to their residence and having their personal information leaked online.
“We want to protect our staff, we want to protect ourselves, we want to protect our voters and we want to protect our families,” she said. “And so it’s an added layer of stress and concern and anxiety that I can tell you 10 years ago I did not feel.”

“This was one of the hardest decisions I have ever had to make. When you are called to service, as I have been, it is difficult to walk away at a time when so many things need attention,” she wrote in a letter to friends and supporters.
The Colorado Springs Republican wrote that a desire to be more present with her two children was a driving force in the decision. She wrote that they plan to move back to Mesa County.
“There is nothing more important in my life than them. They have made so many sacrifices for me to be able to represent you. But they also need their mom right now, and I need to keep them safe,” she wrote.

Colorado Politics first reported Pugliese’s resignation late on Sunday night.
Pugliese was first elected in 2022 to represent House District 14 in El Paso County. She was reelected in 2024. In January 2024, she was picked by fellow Republicans to lead the minority caucus after former Rep. Mike Lynch stepped down from leadership in the wake of a drunken driving scandal.
Her resignation comes about one month after a public confrontation on the House floor on the last day of a special legislative session. Democrats accused her of failing to disclose that former Rep. Ryan Armagost, a Berthoud Republican, took a photo of Democratic Rep. Yara Zokaie and sent it in a Republican House caucus group chat. Republicans responded with crude comments about Zokaie’s appearance and outfit and the photo then landed on social media. It went viral and Zokaie faced threats and harassment, including towards her children.
Pugliese insists that she told House Democratic leadership on April 14 that Armagost took the photo, and those leaders then failed to tell Zokaie. Democrats say they had to review House security camera footage to determine that Armagost took the photo.
It came to a head during a debate over a resolution to condemn Armagost’s behavior, and Pugliese confronted House Majority Leader Monica Duran.
“I am not a liar. I do not appreciate even (implying) that I am a liar, especially in a situation like this,” she said on the House floor.
Duran then responded to Pugliese and said it was an inappropriate time for the topic.
“The point of this day, in this moment, is to acknowledge what one of your members did to a member of mine,” Duran said. “If you want to talk about your character, or lack of character, let’s have that conversation. But I will not have that conversation here in this well.”
Pugliese immediately left the chamber, but returned to vote in favor of the resolution. In her resignation letter, she cited that incident and referenced the “collapse of integrity in the Colorado State House of Representatives.”
“The lies and hypocrisies the Majority spewed were beyond what I had ever expected, even in Colorado politics. It has been degraded, and the one word that is at the top of my mind is toxic,” she wrote.
House Republicans will now need to pick a new leader. A vacancy committee will also need to convene in Pugliese’s district to pick her replacement.
Duran and House Speaker Julie McCluskie thanked Pugliese for her time in the Legislature but did not address the incident during special session.
“Stepping up to lead a caucus and represent communities in our state legislature are commendable acts of public service, and we thank Minority Leader Pugliese for her commitment to the people of her district and service in the legislature. We admire her dedication to her children, and we wish her all the best in her move to Mesa County and in the next chapter of her life,” they said in a joint statement.
The former Senate minority leader, Paul Lundeen, also resigned this summer to head the American Excellence Foundation. Senate Republicans chose Sen. Cleave Simpson to replace him as minority leader.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM) The search for a leader of a new independent oversight office for children in New Mexico’s custody officially opened Friday, amid turnover in leadership at the state’s troubled child welfare agency.
Lawmakers passed House Bill 5 earlier this year to establish the independent Office of the Child Advocate, along with a selection committee to establish a pool of candidates for the governor’s final appointment for a six-year term. The new office, which is attached administratively to the state Department of Justice, marks the latest attempt to address ongoing problems in the state’s child welfare system.
The law requires the child advocate to be an attorney, licensed social worker or psychologist with at least five years of experience in child welfare or juvenile justice.
Applicants for New Mexico’s Office of the Child Advocate have until the end of October to submit a resume.

The position opens as the state Children, Youth and Families Department also undergoes a transition at the top.
CYFD Secretary Teresa Casados announced her immediate retirement on Sept. 5, with her departure following criticism about the state’s reform progress, as well as high-profile suicides of children in care in recent months that sparked investigations by state authorities.
In a discussion with reporters last week, CYFD officials said they intend to prioritize systematic improvements in the division and make progress in the landmark 2020 Kevin S. settlement brought on behalf of the state’s foster children.
“My vision is to accelerate the movement of CYFD, to move our performance measures in the right direction, to get a stable workforce, well trained, educated, and ready to reduce caseloads,” Acting CYFD Secretary Valerie Sandoval told reporters on Sept. 11.
Sandoval also introduced the current CYFD leadership team, which includes Kathy Kunkel, a previous health secretary for the state who had been consulting for the CYFD since January 2024; and Brenda Donald, the former child welfare secretary for Maryland.
State lawmakers have continued to scrutinize lack of progress in the Kevin S. settlement terms, which include releasing more data; providing adequate mental health care; and eliminating group settings for children in state custody.
After lackluster progress and missed deadlines by state agencies, the parties went into arbitration earlier this year.
Kayla Jankowski, the lead attorney for all plaintiffs’ attorneys in the Kevin S. case, told Source NM the turnover in CYFD leadership, while not ideal, may be the catalyst for better outcomes and policy change.
“This is an opportunity for the current secretary and a future leadership to make sure that Kevin S. is their number one priority,” Jankowski said. “It’s also an opportunity for the governor to become more involved and assist by contributing her leadership to implementing Kevin S.”
Native American Disability Law Center Executive Director Therese Yanan, who also represents one of the children in the initial lawsuit, agreed that the settlement terms provide the strongest framework for addressing the state’s child welfare problems.
“It hits everything that needs to be addressed as far as providing community-based placements for children, providing community-based services and keeping children safe,” Yanan said. “The reality is kids need to be with families — not in offices, not in congregate care, not in shelters, not in residential treatment.”
Charles Peifer, an Albuquerque attorney appointed as arbiter in the Kevin S. case, has ordered the state to make “continual and continuous process,” through December and invited Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to personally attend upcoming hearings in October and November.
In a statement to Source NM, Jodi McGinnis Porter, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, said Lujan Grisham would not be able to attend upcoming hearings on Oct. 7 or Nov. 20 due to “scheduling conflicts,” but would continue to meet with the independent monitors.
“The governor will continue to do everything in her power to ensure the safety of our children, as demonstrated by our recent changes to how the CARA program is administered,” McGinnis Porter said. “Governor Lujan Grisham is wholly committed to improving the well-being of every child in New Mexico, as evidenced by her commitment to free early childcare, school meals, and other initiatives.”
Sandoval, who has worked at CYFD since 2016, most recently as a deputy secretary for CYFD’s protective services and juvenile justice department, says she understands the public and lawmakers’ frustration.
“These cases are tragic for us too, they hit me hard every single time,” she said.
As for addressing longstanding issues, she said the department is going to be guided by the experts.
“We’re going to make a better child welfare system, using the tools we have,” she said.

(Maps data: Google, Airbus, CNES/Airbus, Landsat/Copernicus, Maxar Technologies)The second largest mining deal in world history, announced last week, could hand one of Alaska’s largest mines — and a linchpin of the economy of Northwest Alaska — to a new operator.
Canada-based Teck Resources, which has long operated Northwest Alaska’s massive Red Dog zinc mine, and United Kingdom-based Anglo American said on Sep. 8 that they intend to merge into a $53 billion giant.
The new company, to be called Anglo Teck, would take control of Red Dog, a major driver of the regional economy and an important source of revenue for the Northwest Arctic Borough and Alaska Native corporations across the state.
It would mark a return to the state for Anglo American, which once owned half of the controversial Pebble Project — and spent more than a half-billion dollars on it over six years before pulling out in 2013.
The merger with Teck is still pending regulatory approval and could take more than a year to close.
Anglo Teck would be focused on copper, a key metal supporting the global transition to renewable energy, and it would operate dozens of mining projects around the world.
But in a call with analysts just after the deal was announced, Anglo American’s chief executive, Duncan Wanblad, singled out Red Dog, noting its potential “to continue its track record of strong cash flow generation.” The mine, operated on land owned by Northwest Alaska’s regional Native corporation, NANA, churns out more than 550,000 tons of zinc, lead and other minerals each year.
The mine generates some $600 million in annual gross profits for Teck — a share of which is distributed to NANA and then, as required by federal law, shared with other Native corporations across the state.
Industry observers say that the deal, if it goes through, is unlikely to significantly change the way Red Dog operates.
They also expect the new company to continue looking for new sources of ore to keep the mine running. Teck says Red Dog’s main deposit will be depleted in 2031, though it has been studying other prospects nearby.
“The impacts of the merger on Red Dog operations and exploration activities, I think, will be very minor for the foreseeable future,”  said David Hammond, a Denver-based mineral economist who has advised NANA on Red Dog-related matters in the past.
Hammond said he “fully anticipates the merged company will continue to fund exploration activities for the next generation of zinc production” in the region.
Industry leaders expect demand for zinc to grow in the coming years, and Red Dog is one of the world’s largest producers.
The effort to keep the mine running past 2031 has major implications for the Northwest Arctic Borough; Red Dog accounts for some 80% to 90% of the borough’s revenue. Borough officials, already anticipating revenue declines, have been considering cuts to government services.
Reached by phone Friday, the borough’s mayor, Dickie Moto, declined to comment, saying he first wanted to hear more from Teck about the proposed merger.
The company last year received a key permit for its work to find new sources of zinc ore for Red Dog. That work entails building 12 miles of roads and an underground portal that would help the company study two untapped mineral deposits on state land.
State regulators recently released Teck’s revised exploration plans, including a tentative construction schedule that suggests underground drilling at the new site will start in 2028.
“We remain focused on advancing the Red Dog Mine Life Extension to support the long-term economic and social benefits for Northwest Alaska,” Dale Steeves, a Teck spokesperson, said in an emailed statement.
NANA, the Native corporation that owns the Red Dog deposit, did not respond to a request for comment.

The directive reversed years of public and private sector efforts, including an executive order issued by former President Joe Biden in 2021, designed to bolster opportunities for populations that have long been underrepresented, particularly in STEM fields.
President Trump’s order has had a broad impact on institutions around the country, with agencies including NASA and the National Institutes of Health altering websites and eliminating requirements for inclusivity. To align with the new edict, researchers in Maine are changing the way they talk about their work.
Scientists told The Monitor they have rewritten grant proposals to remove language that, in many cases, before January would have been required to secure funding but now is considered a disqualifier. They deleted, for example, verbiage around diversity, supporting underrepresented individuals and similar “broader impact” considerations.
“The minute the election happened, we started trying to change how we spoke about our work,” said Deborah Bronk, president and CEO of Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in East Boothbay.
“You can justify our work many different ways, whether it’s climate change or fisheries or the economy or coastal resilience. We are not talking about climate change a lot these days with most audiences because that’s verboten right now.”

Other researchers reported similar changes.
“We have been making more of an effort to look at the types of language that we include in our grants,” said Jessica Chertow, vice president of research at MaineHealth Institute for Research in Scarborough, the research arm of Maine’s largest health care provider. The research institute relies on federal funding for nearly half of its $52 million budget, according to Chertow.
“We are trying to adhere to the rules and guidance of the new administration but also maintain our beliefs and our values,” said Chertow.
Most of the MHIR’s federal funding comes from the NIH, which recently terminated two grants the institute had been awarded, including one that provided support for early-career investigators. A key word search led NIH officials to mistakenly conclude the funding was being used to support work on vaccine hesitancy, even though the topic had not been studied in years, according to Chertow. The cancelled grant meant the loss of $1.46 million over two years.
Susan Collins’ tightrope walk continues in the fight over medical research

At MDI Biological Laboratory in Bar Harbor, President Hermann Haller said he and his colleagues are ensuring grant proposals are submitted with language that reflects the priorities of the current administration.
“It’s really about ideology, and that’s fine,” said Haller. “We have also re-written proposals that had been funded to fit the current goals of this administration.”
Several organizations said they have also changed the balance between fundamental research — sometimes referred to as high-risk, high-reward research — and more applied, translational work that can more quickly be transformed into practical health interventions or commercial applications.
“We did a strong pivot towards more applied, more commercially relevant research,” said Bronk, noting that the organization was in the middle of a strategic planning exercise when President Trump was elected last November. “We definitely are taking a different tack.”
Bigelow Lab, like other groups heavily reliant on federal funding, is also looking to other sources of revenue, such as increasing use of its fee-for-service analytical facilities and leasing out laboratory space to entrepreneurs working in related fields, said Bronk.
Both Haller, of MDI Bio Lab, and Chertow, of MHRI, said they are similarly shifting what they emphasize.
“Rather than pivot, it’s more about diversification,” said Chertow. “We’re very strong on the basic science side. We have an enormous opportunity to grow the clinical and translational research we do…to build up the clinical research arm of the Institute by leveraging our strengths — access to clinical data and access to patient populations.”
Like her colleagues, Chertow is also focused on new revenue sources, including philanthropy and more robust industry partnerships.
“I’m encouraging the researchers and the [principal investigators] within the Institute to really start thinking in a broader sense about their research funding portfolios.”
For the past 25 years, NIH support has allowed MDI Bio Lab to host promising undergraduates for summer research fellowships. The Lab depends on federal grants and contracts to cover about 44 percent of its $18 million operating budget. When the NIH funds for summer fellowships were unexpectedly blocked earlier this year, Haller and his team scrambled to launch an emergency fundraising campaign to avoid having to cancel the program.
Thanks to philanthropic contributions, MDI Bio Lab ultimately was able to preserve the program, with 23 students spending the summer gaining bench experience at its Bar Harbor campus.
“Independent research organizations like ours depend on federal funding,” Haller said. “Today, there’s enormous uncertainty: What will be funded in the future?”
 Funding cuts, executive orders sow uncertainty
The close knit community of independent scientific research centers in Maine typically lacks the tuition revenues and large endowments universities count on to help buffer the blow of federal funding cuts. In the past decade, federal agencies have funded more than a billion dollars in biomedical research in the state, according to a Monitor analysis of federal data.
That has made it particularly challenging for Maine organizations to navigate the abrupt, often unexplained cuts and delays in federal funding and executive orders that have upended the way science has been supported in this country for decades.
The turmoil has been “gut-wrenching,” said Bronk, of Bigelow Laboratory.
According to Bronk, about half of Bigelow’s $20 million annual budget is supported by federal funding, including from the National Science Foundation, NASA and NOAA, among others. Earlier this year, the Environmental Protection Agency cancelled a multi-year grant to Bigelow without explanation, only to reinstate the funding weeks later, said Bronk.
“The big impact to us is just the uncertainty.”
Long a champion of federal support for science, Sen. Susan Collins (R) has tried to use her clout as chair of the Senate Committee on Appropriations to serve as a bulwark against the worst cuts. But the ability of the state’s senior senator to insulate Maine scientists from the whiplash of federal funding is limited.
“There is no investment that pays greater dividends to American families than our investment in biomedical research,” Collins said in a statement to The Maine Monitor. “The deep funding cuts proposed by the Administration would undo years of Congressional investment. We also risk falling behind China and other countries that are increasing their investment in biomedical research and recruiting U.S. scientists and researchers.”
The Trump administration has proposed reducing federal support for scientific research by more than 30% in the fiscal year that begins October 1. Some NIH institutes would vanish under a proposed reorganization that would consolidate the agency’s 27 institutes and centers into just eight. When the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30, funds in the budgets of NIH and other research agencies that remain uncommitted will expire.
Under Collins’ leadership, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted in July to reverse the cuts. Still, the full Senate must vote to restore funding, after which they will have to reconcile differences with the House.
Scientists are also anticipating changes in the process for awarding federal research grants. An executive order issued in early August will have political appointees review and approve funding opportunities and awards for “consistency with agency priorities and the national interest.”
This is a major shift in the decades-old grant-making process, in which career civil servants have overseen such decisions.
“Science should not be political,” said Bronk. “I’m speaking out more and more, not to be disrespectful of the current administration. They were elected. They have a right to put their fingerprint on our federal government. What I try to focus on is: these are the consequences of federal actions.”
 Researchers prepare for loss of foreign talent
Scientific organizations around the state have also been bracing for a loss of foreign talent. A combination of State Department staffing cuts, travel bans, and the perception that America has become hostile to foreign-born workers resulted in a drop in international students at campuses around the country this fall, particularly in graduate programs and especially in the STEM fields, according to reporting by NPR.
So far, the drop has yet to materialize in Maine, which has fewer international students than the rest of the country. Scientific research organizations said they have seen some defections but are wary of more.

Haller, of MDI Bio Lab, said at least one foreign postdoctoral scientist decided not to join his lab because of the environment, and Bronk said her institute lost a promising postdoc who was already on staff because the person didn’t “feel welcome in this country anymore.”
European institutions are actively recruiting the best U.S.-based scientists, said Haller. In the past, foreign organizations trying to lure investigators from American labs found it difficult to attract the best researchers. Now, said Haller, they have more applicants than they can accommodate.
“We have an excellent reputation in the field, and we have a really lovely culture, so we are a highly desirable destination if you are a marine scientist,” said Bronk, of Bigelow Lab. “But we can’t counter the fear of being detained at an airport and being shipped off somewhere without due process, so it’s just going to get harder.”
Losing foreign-born and trained scientists, she added, risks losing the diversity of perspectives that makes American scientific institutions so impactful.
“Part of the magic of cutting-edge research is lots of different ways of thinking coming around the table. If we fill all the spots with Americans, we will have lost this critical part of our secret sauce.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Lawmakers heard testimony from parents, first responders and faith leaders Monday as they considered a myriad  of proposals to address gun violence in the aftermath of a shooting at the Church of the Annunciation in Minneapolis that left two children dead and more than 20 others injured. 
Gov. Tim Walz said he will call a special session on gun violence this fall, and the Senate Gun Violence Prevention Working Group is evaluating which proposals could be viable in a divided Legislature. 
An assault weapons ban — and any other law regulating firearms — is unlikely to pass, given Republicans’ temporary one-seat majority in the House, and dissent within the Democratic-Farmer-Labor party over gun control bills. The House is expected to return to a tie after a Sept. 16 special election in Brooklyn Park to fill the seat left vacant by the murder of Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman. 
The working group heard testimony from five parents of Annunciation students who were hurt in the shooting, and from doctors who treated the injured students, all in support of a bill that would ban civilian ownership of “semiautomatic military-style assault weapons” and high-capacity magazines — those that hold more than ten rounds. 
“It is up to our lawmakers to decide which weapon our next mass shooter is armed with,” said Malia Kimbrell, the parent of a third-grade student at Annunciation who was injured in the shooting.
Dr. Tim Kummer, medical director of community outreach for Hennepin EMS, responded to Annunciation in the minutes after the shooting. A 12-year-old girl had what appeared to be a small graze wound on her head — but below the surface, the bullet’s velocity created a shockwave, causing the child’s brain to bleed. Doctors had to remove a section of her skull. 
“From a handgun, that wound would likely have only been a graze wound, but from a high powered rifle, it became a life threatening brain injury,” Kummer said. “Assault rifles turn survivable injuries into fatal ones.”
The working group also heard proposals that would do the following:


Establish an Office of Gun Violence Prevention within the Minnesota Department of Health.
Require gun buyers to complete a firearm safety course before purchasing a gun.
Create a public awareness campaign for Minnesota’s new “red flag” law, which allows judges to order the confiscation of weapons from a person deemed a danger to their own safety or others’. 
Create a Civil Commitment Coordinating Division within the Office of the Attorney General, tasked with streamlining the civil commitment process and collecting data on outcomes for those who are civilly committed. 
Re-establish a ban on binary triggers, which increase the rate of fire of a gun. (A judge struck down Minnesota’s binary trigger ban in August, ruling that the megabill that contained the ban was too broad in scope.)
Require serial numbers on all firearms, including those that are 3-D printed or assembled at home. 
Allow local governments to ban firearms from city-owned or leased buildings. 
Require all gun owners to store their weapons unloaded and equipped with a locking device; or loaded or unloaded in a locked firearm storage unit or gun room.

Sen. John Hoffman, DFL-Champlin, did not attend the meeting but submitted a bill to increase penalties on people convicted of impersonating a law enforcement officer. A man impersonating a police officer shot Hoffman and his wife Yvette before murdering Hortman and her husband Mark in the early morning hours of June 14. 
Sen. Glenn Gruenhagen, R-Glencoe, submitted to the working group an article he co-authored in 2019 with a natural medicine doctor who spread false information about COVID-19 before dying of the virus in 2021. The article attributes the rise in mass shootings to the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs,  a common type of antidepressant. That claim has been repeated by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, but psychiatrists and other experts have debunked a causal link between SSRIs and violence.

A week later, Florida formally applied for federal funds.
The state’s request for reimbursement for its spending on the migrant detention facility in the heart of the Everglades came just days after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit hit pause on a federal judge’s order shutting down the center over environmental concerns. The 2-1 vote claimed that federal environmental laws don’t apply because Florida officials haven’t used any federal money.
But less than eight days after the ruling — which stayed all aspects of the case — the Florida Division of Emergency Management asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency to be reimbursed, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told the Florida Phoenix in an email.
“The State of Florida submitted an application for reimbursement to [FEMA],” the spokesperson said. Although they didn’t comment on what day the application was made nor for how much money, this confirmed Politico’s reporting that FDEM’s executive director, Kevin Guthrie, said the state had applied for federal money.
Gov. Ron DeSantis has long promised that Florida would be reimbursed for its detention center spending, although neither his office nor FDEM ever clarified when they planned to ask for the money. Federal authorities similarly lauded the facility as a joint effort, but showed no signs of chipping in until last week.
“Under President Trump’s leadership, we are working at turbo speed on cost-effective and innovative ways to deliver on the American people’s mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens,” the DHS official said. “These new facilities are in large part to be funded by FEMA’s Shelter and Services Program.”
The Shelter and Services program allocated $608.4 million toward FEMA’s new Detention Support Grant Program, specifically designed to expedite Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s mass detention and deportation agenda. If FEMA approves Florida’s request, the money will be awarded by Sep. 30. The Everglades facility is estimated to cost around $450 million for the year.
The attorney general’s office redirected questions to FDEM, which did not respond to questions about the application’s timeline.
 ‘So what do you say, judges?’
In a 2-1 decision on Sep. 4, the Eleventh Circuit both paused federal trial judge Kathleen Williams’ order to shut down the facility and fully stayed the case. The lawsuit was brought against the state by the Miccosukee Tribe and environmental groups Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biodiversity.
They claimed the center, located within the Everglades and Big Cypress National Preserve, was harming the environment and violating the National Environmental Policy Act.
But judges Barbara Lagoa and Elizabeth Branch, both Trump appointees, ruled that Williams had erred by applying the federal law to a center that had exclusively received state funds. Florida hadn’t even applied for federal reimbursement, they argued. The activists have since asked the appeals court to reconsider their decision to halt the lawsuit.
If the judges don’t, Miami attorney Joseph DeMaria, said, the plaintiffs would be stymied unless they can “un-stay” the case — even though the majority opinion was largely predicated on the lack of federal ties.
“Unless they can get the case unstuck, there’s nothing they can do,” said DeMaria, who once worked as a prosecutor with the Justice Department’s Miami Organized Crime Strike Force. [The state] played it cute by saying, ‘We haven’t formally agreed yet, so federal law doesn’t apply.'”
He posed a rhetorical question the appellate judges on the case: “You said that the feds haven’t agreed to pay, so there’s no jurisdiction to enforce the federal environmental law, but then almost immediately after you said that, they went and agreed to pay. So what do you say, judges?”
Attorneys for the Friends of the Everglades declined to comment, while the governor’s office, the Miccosukee Tribe, and the Center for Biodiversity did not respond to requests for comment.

The Delaware Office of the Marijuana Commissioner (OMC) has announced the implementation of the Social Equity Financial Assistance (SEFA) Grant Program, an initiative aimed at advancing equitable participation in the state’s adult-use marijuana industry.
The program is designed to reduce barriers that have historically limited opportunities for individuals and communities disproportionately affected by previous marijuana laws. Through milestone-based grant funding, eligible licensees will receive support for key business needs such as facility build-out, equipment acquisition, and other start-up expenses.
RELATED STORY: Strong start to rec. marijuana sales, nearly hitting $1M in first weekend
“By launching the SEFA Grant Program, Delaware is taking a significant step toward ensuring that the state’s adult-use marijuana industry develops in a manner that is inclusive, diverse, and sustainable,” said Commissioner Joshua Sanderlin. 
“This program is an essential component of our broader effort to build a regulated market that both protects public health and promotes equitable economic opportunity.”
Program details

Eligibility is limited to approved social equity marijuana licensees in Delaware.

Funding amounts vary depending on license type.

Grants will be disbursed in phases as operational milestones are met.

Funds are restricted to approved business expenses and will be subject to oversight.


The first distribution of SEFA funding is expected to begin in the coming weeks as licensees reach their required operational milestones.

David Morales speaks at an Aug. 6, 2025, ""Save RIPTA"" rally in Kennedy Plaza in Providence. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)On the day before his 27th birthday, Providence Democratic Rep. David Morales announced Monday morning he will challenge Mayor Brett Smiley to lead the capital city in the September 2026 primary.
Morales pledged to tackle rising rents, expand affordable housing, and invest in Rhode Island’s struggling public transit system when he made the news official in a campaign launch video posted on social media at 8 a.m.
“This is our home, and it’s time City Hall worked for us,” Morales said. “Politicians like Brett Smiley have asked us to trust their experience while working families are struggling to get by.”
Born in Soledad, California, Morales was raised by his single mother who worked in the fields to help support his sister and her special needs nephew. He graduated from Soledad High School in 2016 and went on to earn his bachelor’s in urban studies from the University of California Irvine in 2018. 
Morales came to Rhode Island to pursue a Master’s in Public Affairs at Brown University, which he completed in 2019.
Since 2021, Morales has represented Providence’s House District 7 — which covers Providence’s Mount Pleasant, Valley, and Elmhurst neighborhoods. At the time he was elected, Morales was the youngest Latino state legislator in the nation.
Now in his third term on Smith Hill, Morales is still the state’s youngest legislator.
In the General Assembly, Morales has emerged as one of its most progressive and outspoken members, particularly in protecting Rhode Island’s renters. 
“We don’t ask for much, we just want a life we can afford in the city we love,” Morales said in the launch video.
Rental costs are certainly high in Rhode Island’s capital city. A report published in July by the National Low Income Housing Coalition found that renters in the Providence metro area would need to make $31.04 an hour to afford the average rent of $1,614 for a two-bedroom unit.
In his first interview after his announcement on Spanish-language Poder 102.1 radio Monday morning, Morales said he would propose a 4% cap on rent increases. Smiley has resisted rent caps, instead prioritizing the construction of more housing units.
Smiley, 46, was first elected mayor in 2022 after winning a three-way primary with 42% of the vote. He faced no Republican or independent opposition in the general election.
Smiley served as the director of administration and chief-of-staff for former Gov. Gina Raimondo. He previously ran for mayor in 2014, before pulling out of the race to join Jorge Elorza’s administration as the chief operating officer at City Hall.
Josh Block, a spokesperson for Smiley’s campaign, didn’t directly address Morales’ challenge when reached for comment Monday morning.
“The election is still a year away, and Mayor Smiley is focused on governing here in Providence and protecting residents from the harmful policies of the Trump administration,” Block said in an emailed statement. “There are serious challenges ahead, and we need someone with Mayor Smiley’s decades of experience in finance, management, and government to continue navigating Providence through this critical time in our city’s and our country’s history.”
The progressive challenger does face a significant uphill battle heading into 2026, as Smiley boasts a little over $1 million in his campaign account as of the state’s most recent reporting deadline in June. Morales’ account had about $68,000 on hand.
Smiley also holds the advantage of incumbency in a city that has not ousted a sitting mayor since Republican Buddy Cianci beat Democrat Joe Doorley in 1974. Smiley also lives on the East Side, known for its high primary voter turnout and affluent campaign donors.
“The East Side has an outsized role to play in the primary,” Wendy J. Schiller, a Brown University political science professor, said. 
But Schiller said Morales has the potential to rally a base of voters seeking a change, citing the example of New York State Assemblymember and Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani’s victory in New York City’s Democratic mayoral primary this summer.
But the odds don’t appear to faze Morales, who moonlights as a professional wrestler with the Renegade Wrestling Alliance.
“There are a lot of people in our community that are frustrated and upset with the current administration,” he told Rhode Island Current in a phone interview Monday. “There is a desire within our city for a change.”
Morales said he’s not leaving his life as a professional heel, but said he’s holding his last match “for a while” on Saturday.
The Democratic primary is scheduled for Sept. 8, 2026. Approximately 57% of Providence’s 100,316 registered voters on the state’s active roster are Democrats.

Idaho 4th District Judge Jonathan Medema on Friday granted summary judgement in favor of the Attorney General’s Office in the lawsuit brought by former deputy attorney general Daphne Huang, who had represented the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. 
Huang’s lawsuit focused on several alleged conflicts between Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador with the state health agency, including his investigation into millions of dollars of child care grants the agency distributed.
“The Court finds that viewing the evidence in the record in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, no rational juror could find Plaintiff had proven any of her claims,” the judge ruled.
Idaho Attorney General’s Office asks judge to dismiss fired attorney’s whistleblower lawsuit

The ruling, in response to the Attorney General’s Office’s request to dismiss the lawsuit on a motion for summary judgement, came before the case was set for a two-week jury trial in October. 
Her lawsuit was filed in September 2023 under the state’s whistleblower law, called Idaho’s Protection of Public Employees Act. The Attorney General’s Office has argued Huang was fired for misconduct — not whistleblowing.
In a statement Monday, Labrador said he will “continue protecting Idaho families and ensuring government accountability.”
“Idahoans elected me to protect families, uphold the Constitution, and ensure government follows the law,” the attorney general said. “The people of Idaho sent a message that they wanted to change the direction of the Attorney General’s office. When I took office, we began advising state agencies on legal compliance and setting our policies in place. While this former employee may have disagreed with our policy directions, the court found no basis for her claims.”
Guy Hallam, an attorney for Huang, said she was “surprised and disappointed that the court would not allow a jury to decide whether Mr. Labrador violated the law.”
“We believe that the ethical rules which govern the actions of attorneys in the state also apply to Mr. Labrador and the Office of the Attorney General,” Hallam said in a statement Friday. “It seems that the Idaho Supreme Court is going to have to decide whether that is true.”

 Labrador’s subpoenas to Health and Welfare ‘were legally unenforceable,’ but not a conflict of interest, judge rules

In March 2023, months after Labrador became Idaho’s attorney general, Huang was fired hours after expressing concerns about the ethics of the Idaho Attorney General’s Office’s new management.
Much of her lawsuit’s claims revolved around Labrador’s investigation into $72 million of child care grants distributed by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare.
As an attorney representing the agency, Huang provided legal guidance twice to Health and Welfare saying the agency’s grant distribution was legally sound. Labrador’s office later revoked the advice. 
The judge found that civil subpoenas Labrador served on employees of the Department of Health and Welfare “were legally unenforceable.”

But Medema departed from a separate Idaho judge’s past ruling that the subpoenas amounted to a conflict of interest between the Idaho Attorney General’s Office and its own client, the Department of Health and Welfare. 
The civil subpoenas, formally called civil investigative demands, were “the State of Idaho trying to subpoena itself,” Medema wrote. “… Thus, the Court fails to understand how Ms. Huang reached the opinion that the service of the (subpoenas) created some conflict of interest.”
“It is entirely irrational to conclude that the Attorney General of the State of Idaho, when he is investigating compliance with state law by state employees, now has an interest that conflicts with the interests of other officials of the State of Idaho … in their official capacities,” Medema wrote. “To accept that premise, one must logically conclude that those executive branch officials, acting in their official capacities, have a legally protected and enforceable interest in violating state law.”
But the attorney general doesn’t need to use the power of the courts “to stop some other executive agency from acting contrary to the law,” the judge wrote.
“The Attorney General does not need to resort to a power granted him by the Legislature and enforceable in the judicial branch to get information from the Department of Health and Welfare, the way he must in order to get information from private charitable organizations,” Medema wrote. “He does not need to resort to the power of the courts to stop some other executive agency from acting contrary to state law. He does not need to do so because both the Attorney General and the Director of the Department of Health and Welfare serve at the pleasure of the Governor.”
In Idaho, the state’s attorneys general and governors are elected in separate races. Before becoming Idaho’s attorney general, Labrador in 2018 lost a gubernatorial primary election challenge against Idaho Gov. Brad Little.
 Former Health and Welfare director approved sharing phone with data with AG’s Office, judge wrote

Part of the case centered around Huang allegedly giving the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare the cell phone of her former supervisor, who was asked to resign days before Huang was fired. 
The phone had data that Health and Welfare allegedly claimed privilege over and was deleted from the phone before it was returned to the Attorney General’s Office, court documents show. That was despite a request from the Attorney General’s Office to return the phone with the data preserved, the records show.
Health and Welfare’s then director, Dave Jeppesen, had told Huang he was “‘fine’ having the phone physically returned” to the Attorney General’s Office’s then-Chief Deputy, David Dewhirst, “with the data intact,” the judge wrote. But days before Huang planned to give the phone to the office’s Dewhirst, Huang gave the phone to a Health and Welfare staffer after they asked for it, the judge wrote. 
“Assuming she was fired for her decision to hand the phone to (the Health and Welfare staffer), and assuming, without deciding, that handing the phone to (the staffer) was the only way in which she could have complied” with ethical rules for attorneys, “her claim still fails as a matter of law,” Medema wrote. “Director Jeppesen had previously given express consent to revealing the data on the phone to Chief Deputy Dewhirst.”

Those challenges have skyrocketed since the pandemic.
In 2024, 38% of the nationwide book challenges were in school libraries, and 5% were in schools themselves, according to the American Library Association’s (ALA) Office for Intellectual Freedom.
Under the new Connecticut law, a school board has to adopt three policies: a collection, development and maintenance policy, a library display and program policy and a library material review policy.
The law, which also contains provisions for public libraries’ collection and review policies, passed after lawmakers folded the language into this year’s state budget. The language was similar to the Senate Bill considered by the Children’s Committee.

Ellen Paul, the executive director of Connecticut Library Consortium (CLC) estimated that about half of the state’s school districts have some degree of library policies, though some haven’t been updated since the ’90s.
“I have a feeling that there’s going to be a lot of schools, and a lot of boards of education, that need to start doing work on this,” Paul said.
CLC and the Connecticut Association of School Librarians have been holding online information sessions since August for school library staff to learn the new law.
The policies must abide by certain parameters, such as following the state’s non-discrimination statutes. But the rules must be approved by the board of education in consultation with the superintendent, the director of curriculum and a librarian from the district.
“We are not prescribing a standard policy, because we know that what works in Norwich, might not work in Norwalk,” Paul said.
The law also states that a “school library media specialist is professionally trained to curate and develop a collection that provides students with access to the widest array of age-appropriate and grade-level-appropriate library and other educational material.”
The policies are to allow thoughtfulness to the reconsideration request, so materials are “not just being pulled off the shelf because one person doesn’t want their child to read the book, that we think of all of the children in the community,” Paul said.
The law also states that school material reconsideration requests are only limited to “the parents and guardians of students and eligible students currently enrolled in the school or school district.”
Nationwide, only 16% of book challenges last year came from parents, the ALA report found. Much of the rest came from special interest groups, government officials and a board or administration.
Some opponents to the Connecticut bill said in public testimony they feared it would have a chilling factor on the ability to challenge books. The bill’s supporters emphasized creating a fair process to review material was vital to preserving the freedom to read.
“School libraries have always been spaces where students can explore the world and begin to understand themselves,” Val DiLorenzo, president of Connecticut Association of School Librarians, said in a joint statement with other library organizations after the bill’s passage.
“That doesn’t mean every book is right for every reader, but it does mean students deserve the chance to choose with guidance, not censorship.”
‘Decisions aren’t being made in a back room’
Connecticut’s not the only New England state that’s codified “freedom to read” policies into its laws. Rhode Island passed a similar effort this year, and Vermont’s law, which passed last year, took effect this July.
ALA’s Office for Intellectual Freedom said in Connecticut there were 29 title challenges in 2022, and 117 in 2023. Last year there were only 17, a downward trend that mirrored the national data. But the group said it is likely an undercount, and Paul echoed that sentiment.
“When you’re relying on people to just self-report that, you’re not going to get the full scope of the issue,” Paul said.
The ALA said that legislative restrictions in states, such as schools being required to limit or remove library materials with themes about race or racism, LGBTQ+ issues or more broadly containing “sexual content” has also likely led to the drop in documented challenges.
This year, New Hampshire’s legislature passed a school book bill largely along party lines that would have prohibited materials showing nudity or sexual content if it “lacks serious literary, scientific, medical, artistic, or political value for minors.” The measure would have also created a process for challenging library materials. The governor vetoed it.
Connecticut has not passed such laws regarding the content of library materials. But some state legislators unsuccessfully attempted this past legislative session to broadly ban sexual content in books. This included a bill that did not make it out of the education committee, and an amendment to a measure surrounding electronic book contracts for libraries.
Paul said she hopes that the new law can give reassurance to people that book challenges are handled with care, “being reviewed by people who live and work in the community, people who send their children to these schools, and that decisions aren’t being made in a back room by one or two individuals.”

In the restaurant, the server was pleased, thanking them for coming. Because these days, tariffs and White House rhetoric have left Canadians a rare breed of visitors in New England, usually a hotspot vacation destination from the nearby province of Quebec.
“There’s a lot of people staying in Canada because of that,” said Dave Gingras, a 35-year-old biker from Saguenay, about two hours north of Quebec City.
While other Canadians are avoiding buying American products or traveling to the States, the group of 11 decided to leave politics behind on their road trip through New England.
“We are just keeping it neutral and trying to enjoy,” Gingras told Stateline.
After breakfast, they donned helmets and mounted an assortment of dusty Yamaha, BMW and Triumph bikes.
“We drive and when we’re tired, we stop and raise up a tent and relax with a beer,” Gingras said before pulling into a line of crawling traffic on the White Mountain Highway, the scenic byway dotted with quaint inns, old-timey stores and Colonial and Victorian homes.
Across Northeastern states, business owners and state officials have labored to maintain key economic connections with Canada despite the rhetoric coming out of the White House. President Donald Trump’s trade war, aggressive immigration enforcement and talk of making their country the 51st state has offended many Canadians. While concerns are acute in New England, tourism hubs from Hawaii to New York are reeling from a decrease in Canadian visitors.
To quell tensions, Maine leaders erected signs in French to welcome Canadian visitors and New Hampshire’s governor just returned from a Canadian trip she took to strengthen trade and tourism.
But hospitality businesses this summer reported a sharp decline in visitors from the North — Canadian travel to New Hampshire is down about 30% this year, according to state officials. Border crossings into Vermont hit their lowest levels since 2021, according to federal data, as the Canadian government reported a 34% drop in the number of August car visits into the U.S. compared with the same month last year.
New England businesses remain concerned as the region turns the page on the summer vacation season to its vibrant autumn, known for luring leaf-peeping travelers from across the globe.

Tourism is vital for White Mountain Valley communities like North Conway. While it’s home to only about 2,300 people, the village is a historic travel hotspot known for outdoor activities, tax-free shopping and family-friendly theme parks.
While many people think of the area as a winter ski destination, summers are actually the largest travel draw, said Chris Proulx, executive director of the Mt. Washington Valley Chamber of Commerce.
The drop in Canadian tourism has been especially evident during less popular travel times for Americans. For example, Canada’s Victoria Day, a late May holiday celebrating that queen’s birthday, has traditionally brought big crowds to the Northeast.
“Our retail outlets are a very, very popular destination for them during that time,” Proulx said. “And our retail outlets have reported that it was basically nonexistent this year.”
Proulx said local businesses have tried to lure travelers from close-by regions like the Boston area to help make up for the loss of Canadian tourists, “so it’s not an unrecoverable loss.” But the absence of visitors from parts North is hard to ignore.
“It almost feels like a birder might feel if they find a rare species,” he said. “If you see someone with a Canadian license plate, you notice it right away. It gives you a little bit of a smile.”
Aside from the economic loss, Proulx said he worries about longstanding relationships.
This scenic valley is nostalgic for many visitors from the U.S. and Canada alike. He said many people return again and again, sharing fond memories of their first camping trip along the Saco River, childhood trips to the Santa’s Village amusement park and picturesque rides on the Conway Scenic Railroad.
“So we just don’t want anybody thinking that they’re not welcomed here. That’s our biggest thing,” he said. “We want everybody to be able to call this their second home, to be able to visit and reconnect and feel welcomed.”
‘Towns are quieter’
In the heart of North Conway, tourists picnic on the grass in Schouler Park, look into the 1874-era train station and meander into shops selling hokey souvenirs and homemade fudge. Framing the village is the imposing Mount Washington, which at 6,288 feet boasts the tallest peak in the Northeast.
At one of the town’s busiest intersections, the crowds come in waves to the North Conway 5&10 Store. But even as families line up, employee Polly Howe said she hadn’t seen many Canadians this summer.
“It’s a shame,” she said, bouncing between the cash register, the candy counter and stocking staples like toys and hats.
In a building listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the souvenir shop has been around for 86 years and features a false-front facade, the kind made famous in boomtowns of the Old West. Manager Terri Johnson said she had encountered a good number of Canadians inside the shop, but said she didn’t blame any who felt put off by the political climate.
“I’m thankful they still come after all that,” she said.
It’s not just international relations that have changed tourism here.
A rainy start to the summer season didn’t help, and business owners say anxiety over the domestic economy and inflation have pinched travel budgets.

Mark Lahood says family travel has dipped at the three hotels he operates in the area.
“Towns are quieter,” he said this summer. “They’re not quiet, but they’re much quieter than years’ past.”
Some summer weekends, which traditionally sell out entirely, the three hotels had 30% vacancies, he said. And travelers are more keen for weekend trips than their weeklong road trips of previous seasons.
“With a seven-day trip, by the time they were all in, it’s a lot of driving, it’s a lot of gas money, it’s a lot of meals, it’s a lot of hotels,” he said. “And I think it’s just too much.”
To help with rising costs, he ran a free breakfast promotion for kids earlier in the summer. And he increased an existing international discount for Canadian guests.
“Did it help anything? Probably not. But you know, when you view it from a Canadian traveler, at least you made an effort.”
The decline in Canadian visitors has allowed for more local, spontaneous travel, said Genn Anzaldi, who owns J-Town Deli & Country Store in Jackson, New Hampshire.
“More day trippers for sure,” she said. “So maybe not as many people spending the night or as many nights.”
The scent of sizzling bacon and toasting panini fills her shop, which offers hot meals along with handmade gifts and convenience store staples.
Anzaldi, who also runs a cooperative marketing effort for a group of independent restaurants, said the local restaurant business was down, but not significantly.
The reason?
“Canadians,” she said. “I wouldn’t say it’s the economy. That seems to be going well.”
About nine miles away from North Conway, things are a bit quieter in Jackson, home to a famed one-lane covered bridge. With its spas and boutique hotels, Anzaldi said the community is more known as a destination for weddings, romantic stays and outdoor getaways.
While Anzaldi said she hopes Canadian tensions settle soon, she noted that the matter lies in the political domain and there’s little business owners can do but carry on.
“We have to run, right?” she said. “We’re not personally going to go up and advertise.”
States try to ease federal tension
To maintain tourism and trade, Democratic and Republican politicians in the Northeast have made overtures to their counterparts in Canada.
Since Trump’s inauguration, Maine Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has met with Maine businesses near the border, embarked on a diplomatic Canadian tour and even installed “Bienvenue Canadiens” welcome signs near border crossings. But on her trip this summer, she was reminded that it’s not just tariffs that have irked Canadians — many are also worried about the Trump administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement.
“Lots of people don’t feel safe in the U.S. right now and for good reason,” Susan Holt, the premier of the New Brunswick province, told Mills, according to local news accounts. Holt has encouraged her constituents to avoid traveling to the United States.
Last year, the state said some 800,000 Canadians visited Maine. On her June trip, Mills asked Canadians to remember those who rely on the tourism industry.
“To the extent people feel angst about coming to Maine, just remember that if they aren’t coming to Maine, the ones that they’re hurting are the small mom and pop businesses,” the governor told News Center Maine while in Halifax.
Mills’ office did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment.
Similarly, New Hampshire Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte said ahead of a trade mission that she aimed to welcome Canadians to the Granite State, the New Hampshire Bulletin reported.
“That’s one of the things I’m going to just continue to promote on behalf of New Hampshire,” Ayotte said last month. “Not only that they’re welcome here — the Canadians — but we have open arms to them.”
Ayotte’s office did not respond to Stateline’s requests for comment about her trip.
René Sylvestre, the Quebec province’s delegate to New England, said those gestures are appreciated. He spends much of his time meeting with state and business leaders. Last month, he met numerous state lawmakers at the annual meeting of the National Conference of State Legislatures in Boston, where he is posted.
But he said calming federal tensions will be key to seeing a rebound in tourism.
“What we can see right now is people in Quebec are really sad with the whole situation,” he told Stateline. “But they’re saying, ‘Maybe we should stay and spend more time in Canada these days.’ So this is really the impact that we’ve seen, and we think that it’s going to take a while before it’s back to normal.”
A decline in international travel has hit border communities across the country — from New York state to Washington state. North Dakota estimated that Canadian visitors spent about $14.4 million less in the first half of the year compared with last year, as the number of personal vehicles crossing the border from Canada declined by 30%. Other hubs for international visitors, including Las Vegas and Hawaii, are also seeing significant declines.
“Right now, it’s hard to turn back federal policy,” Hawaii state Sen. Ron Kouchi told Stateline in August.
Kouchi, a Democrat and president of the state Senate, said Canada has traditionally been among Hawaii’s top five travel markets. The state has sent tourism officials to trade shows and is trying to show Canadians, like all visitors, the Aloha State’s iconic hospitality. But he said that message hasn’t been persuasive, even coming from leaders of the solidly liberal state.
“While we argue about Republicans or Democrats, in other nations they simply look at Americans and they don’t see it as an R or a D thing,” he said. “It’s an American thing.”
A stormy beach season
Old Orchard Beach in Maine is a favorite of New Englanders and Canadians alike.
Part of the Portland metropolitan area, the vacation town sports a seaside amusement park and seven miles of sandy beaches. But some Canadians started to cancel their summer reservations to the area early on in Trump’s term.
Sean Nickless, who co-owns the 30-room Crest Motel with his family, said Canadians began calling off trips in January and February,
Those cancellations and poor weather foretold a slower summer. “It’s not as steady,” Nickless said, noting business had been inconsistent with shorter stays.

Like many of the other beachfront properties here, the retro Crest Motel relies heavily on repeat customers, filled out by the occasional road tripper who ducks in from the angled carport to ask about an available room.
“The best you can do is let Canadians know they’re still welcome here,” he said from the motel’s small lobby scented with the aroma of a drip coffeemaker and a bright popcorn machine.
At the height of summer, rain ushered in what should have been a booming weekend along the Atlantic’s Saco Bay. Crest Motel guests swam, but only under the cover of the pool’s rolling roof.
Down the way, five teenagers stood listlessly inside a walkup Dairy Queen with no customers to serve. On the pier, arcade games, $1-per-visit restrooms and barstools sat idle. Few took up heavily advertised offers for pizza by the slice, $15 lobster rolls or fried clam cakes.
“I’ve never driven around Old Orchard Beach in the summer and seen ‘vacancy signs.’ I  have this year,” said state Sen. Donna Bailey, who represents the community. “I mean, you just never see that in the middle of July — all you see is ‘no vacancy’ signs.” A Democrat, Bailey emphasized that Canada isn’t some far-off destination for Mainers. People routinely cross the border for health care and work. They have friends and family on both sides.
“I mean, there’s some places up in northern Maine that the nearest hospital is in Canada, as opposed to in the United States. You know, some people have their babies over in Canada.”
But aside from emphasizing existing bonds, Bailey said Maine residents and officials were largely at the mercy of the federal government’s actions.
“I think it’s helpful to remind the Canadians of our personal relationship and that we are Maine and we’re Mainers, and so we’re not necessarily the same as the federal government,” she said. “But, yeah, it does only go so far.”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Gov. Josh Stein is asking Congress and the Trump administration to send an additional $13.5 billion to North Carolina, his latest ask for federal aid as recovery from Hurricane Helene continues one year later.
Included in that request is $8 billion in additional grants to rebuild homes and businesses, $2 billion in community loans from FEMA, $2 billion to repair roads and bridges and $400 million for forgivable loans to small businesses.
“The next stage in recovery is going to require a new commitment from Congress and from the administration,” Stein said during a news conference outlining the request in Flat Rock. “Western North Carolina has not received anywhere near what it needs, nor our fair share.”
The governor’s latest request comes while the federal government lags in paying for recovery compared to previous disasters. Federal funding thus far accounts for about 9% of total damage caused by Helene, Stein said Monday.
Typically, states receiving federal aid from major storms receive in the range of 40-50% of total damage, he said. States similarly impacted by major hurricanes like Katrina, Maria and Sandy saw around 70%.
Stein has previously said that the administration and Congress have “not met the moment” as North Carolina works to recover from the storm.
An already-slow of trickle of funds from Washington has slowed even further due to new regulations on spending. All expenditures more than $100,000 must now be approved by FEMA, Homeland Security secretary Kristin Noem and a committee that is part of the White House’s DOGE efforts.
“It’s taking way too long,” Stein said.
In total, Stein’s request for Congress and the White House encompasses $22.8 billion. That includes billions that have already been appropriated but require action by federal agencies.
Delays in funding have frustrated even North Carolina’s U.S. Sen. Ted Budd, a close ally of President Trump. He voted against advancing a DHS nominee in what was described as a warning shot to Noem, who must personally sign off on funding decisions.
“I’m trying to get the attention of those at DHS that are being slow to reimburse North Carolina for funds already spent,” Budd told the Raleigh News & Observer last week.
Still, the state has received several key pools of money in recent weeks.
A backlog of more than $160 million in public assistance money from FEMA was recently released. The EPA has sent $746 million to fund drinking water and sewer system repairs. And a new pool of $221 million from USDA will cover agricultural losses.
Trump has also separately approved a disaster declaration for Tropical Storm Chantal earlier this summer, allowing the state to access additional resources and aid.

(Leah Romero for Source NM)While early childhood program funding levels are “sufficient,” implementation of programs is an issue across the board, according to the most recent Early Childhood Accountability Report.
The report is released every two years and evaluates programs that “are intended to improve outcomes for children and families,” Allegra Hernandez, a Legislative Finance Committee fiscal analyst, explained to members of the Legislative Health and Human Services Committee Friday. Programs are directed at families starting at the prenatal stage up to to children 5 years of age, including Child Care Assistance; prekindergarten; the Family, Infant, Toddler Program; Home Visiting; and child welfare.
Hernandez pointed out that all indicators for healthy, safe children and their learning abilities by kindergarten and third grade were almost all worse than the previous report, despite state funding increasing from less than $200 million in Fiscal Year 2012 to $918 million in Fiscal Year 2026.
The report comes as the state gears up to begin offering universal child care on Nov. 1, following a recent announcement by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.
According to the New Mexico Early Childhood Education and Care Department, the Child Care Assistance Program assists families at 400% of the federal poverty level or below by subsidizing the cost of child care, increasing the family’s earnings. These families are either working, looking for work or in school. 
The accountability report states that participating families at 100% or less than the federal poverty level have declined since 2019, as well as the capacity to assist these specific families. Hernandez said that while expanding eligibility “means that more families have access to child care assistance than ever before, the additional capacity disproportionately serves higher-income families.” 
She suggested state policies should focus on “low-income, at-risk families” going forward. She also noted that the decreased capacity was largely due to a loss of registered childcare homes between 2019 and 2023.
According to the report, children enrolled in PreK have higher assessment scores and high school graduation rates compared to children enrolled in child care. LFC Program Evaluator Garrett Moseley told committee members that enrollment included about 15,000 3- and 4-year-olds in the 2024-2025 school year, or 10 times the enrollment when the program started in 2005.
“LFC staff estimates that if 5,000 more low-income students participated in one of the highest performing prekindergartens, approximately 10% more students would enter kindergarten proficient in reading,” Moseley said. 
However, the LFC report also found significant disparities in teacher preparation between school-based and community-based programs, and Moseley said higher teacher preparation has been shown to improve educational outcomes. 
Moseley also explained that participation in the state’s Family, Infant, Toddler Program — which provides early intervention for children 3 and under with developmental delays and disabilities — has increased since 2022. He said this could mean more eligible children are enrolling, or that more New Mexico children are at risk for delays. The program is expected to serve about 17,000 children this current fiscal year, and Moseley said it is a program that would ideally see decreased enrollment over time. The report noted that more analysis is needed to understand the program’s growth and “what population” it should be serving.
State Rep. Kathleen Cates (D-Rio Rancho) said she found Moseley and the report’s interpretation of the program problem, and pointed out that FIT has received national recognition for identifying children with developmental delays.
Moseley went on to explain that participation in the state’s various Home Visiting programs, which provide education and support for expecting families and those with children under 5 years old, is “significantly lower” than national participation rates, which are low to begin with. 
“Child maltreatment rates for families enrolled in Home Visiting increased from 0.62% in fiscal year 2021 to 1% in fiscal year 2024,” he said. “Although there are several factors that may contribute to this increase, it is important the state continues to monitor how providers deliver Home Visiting to ensure it is delivered as intended.”
Hailey Heinz, director of policy, research and quality initiatives at ECECD, told lawmakers that she appreciates the accountability report and that while the “vision” of the department is to create a “universal, family-centered, high quality and community-based early childhood system,” it is still a work in progress.
She emphasized the department’s recent announcement of free universal child care beginning Nov. 1. The department’s proposed rule changes involve waiving income eligibility requirements for families.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/LHHS-Friday3-1-1024x683.png,,,2025-09-15 13:01:00.120542

Sandy Pickert, shown here at Gov. Laura Kelly's State of the State address on Jan. 15, 2025, used her experience as a nurse to advise a House oversight committee in September on changes to the Kansas State Board of Nursing. (Grace Hills/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas lawmakers skewered the state agency that oversees nursing licenses, alleging it has contributed to the state’s nursing shortage and demanding action before the next legislative session.
At a Sept. 8 meeting of the House Select Committee on Government Oversight, legislators urged the Kansas State Board of Nursing to make substantial changes to policies, procedures and regulations that govern the state’s relicensing and disciplinary processes.
Legislators used words such as “perplexed,” “horrified,” and “egregious” to describe their feelings about the state nursing board and its leadership. They passed resolutions that are likely to guide future changes.
Rep. Sean Tarwater, a Stilwell Republican, hurled jabs at the board, which he described as having “no regard for human life.”
He accused the agency of being filled with “power-hungry individuals that are ruining people’s lives,” and he favored extracting some of the board’s $4 million budget to share with those he thinks have been wronged by the board.
Over months of hearings, the committee has listened to hours of testimony from health care professionals. The testimony detailed the nursing board’s delays in licensing, inadequate communication, leadership issues, dated technology, inconsistent fees for the same infractions, clerical errors, coercion, conflicts of interest, flawed investigations and an approach to discipline with “an attitude of guilty until proven innocent,” said Rep. Sandy Pickert, a Wichita Republican.
Pickert does not sit on the oversight committee. She is a nurse and has followed the committee’s hearings.
“Pandora’s box is open,” she said.
Brenda Sharpe, a board member, said the board agrees with some recommendations for change.
“This board would like more tools in its toolbox,” she said.
She also strongly encouraged the committee to consider facts and circumstances not available in an open forum, referencing the long list of testimony about individual disciplinary cases. She maintained the board has acted in good faith, taking into account facts and circumstances “that may appear one way to this group but, in fact, we believe are another.”
“I would never say we follow everything perfectly,” Sharpe said. “We’re human beings. The licensees are human beings. This is a human process. That’s where we’re at.”
Michael Schommer told the committee about his 23-year-old son, Connor, who is on the autism spectrum and was diagnosed with depression. Connor attempted suicide twice, Schommer said. It wasn’t until the family found a nurse, Ana Ahrens, and a therapist who discovered the perfect combination of medication and counseling that stabilized Connor, he said.
“You know, she has a unique, no-nonsense, stern yet compassionate method of getting his attention, and he would look her in the eye and respond to the questions she was asking him,” Schommer said. “She held him accountable for what he was doing and started to get through to him.”
But then Ahrens made an error while renewing her licenses online. The state nursing board revoked her prescribing privileges, and Ahrens couldn’t refill Connor Schommer’s medication.
Michael Schommer and his wife frantically tried to find another prescriber.
“It went about two weeks too far, unfortunately,” Schommer said. “And, I just — one day he got up and there he was walking through the house talking to the ceiling again for eight hours nonstop.”
That could have been prevented, Schommer said, expressing confusion about the nursing board’s procedures.
“Thank God we still have him today, and he’s doing much better,” Schommer said.
Schommer’s story was one of dozens, but its gravity struck legislators and underscored their crusade for change.
“He could’ve lost his son, and that’s serious,” said Rep. Barbara Ballard, a Lawrence Democrat.
The committee deliberated two resolutions that encouraged considering a grace period for nurses who are late to apply for relicensing, IT updates and regular digital notifications leading up to a nurse’s relicensing deadline. The committee also discussed changing the makeup of the state board, favoring a mix of legislative and gubernatorial appointments.
The resolutions allude to a bill for the 2026 session, but lawmakers urged the board to review its policies without legislative action. The committee also discussed the possibility of a future subcommittee that could provide further recommendations.
The nursing board is responsible for more than 70,000 Kansas nurses.
Maggie Ortiz, a nurse from Texas who advocates across the country for changing nursing regulations, said the issues Kansas is facing are not unique.
“The elephant in the room is the investigative process,” she said.
House lawmakers expressed frustration with the lack of oversight of the board. Complaints about the board are investigated by the board, leading to concerns about conflicts of interest.
Rep. Susan Humphries, a Wichita Republican, said disciplinary processes seem inconsistent, which many legislators on the committee find egregious.

Catherine Cortez Masto)When Linda Wadleigh was a forestry major at Utah State University she came upon her first summer job as a firefighter, a role that led to a 30-year career in wildland fire management with the U.S. Forest Service.
After years in the field, she and a handful of other women firefighters decided to create a boot camp to recruit and prepare other women to become firefighters through hands-on training and classroom learning opportunities.
Trump administration advances plan to reverse federal rule that limits logging in national forests

“I didn’t see many other women, and I just wanted them to have the same chance that I did, to see what a great career this is,” Wadleigh said.
The Women in Wildfire Boot Camp program was established in 2011 and continued for more than a decade before it was terminated in February because of President Donald Trump’s executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government.
As part of Trump’s sweeping plan to eliminate all DEI programs from the federal government, his administration has issued dozens of orders cutting support from government initiatives to promote more diversity.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 About 84% of federal wildland firefighters are men, according to U.S. Government Accountability Office

At a July 10 U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing, U.S. Forest Service Acting Chief Tom Schultz was asked to explain why the boot camp program was eliminated. He responded, “there are still ample opportunities for all firefighters to be trained without singling out solely women.”
About 84% of federal wildland firefighters are men, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The U.S. Forest Service boot camp was launched to bring new firefighters, especially women, into a field that has historically struggled with worker retention.
The boot camp provides a structured path to becoming a wildland firefighter, but graduates still need to apply and once hired all new recruits receive the same fire training and must meet the same physical standards.
After the program’s success in Arizona and New Mexico, it expanded into 14 national forests across several Western states. It was also adopted by the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service. At the program’s height, it trained and recruited over 200 people a year.
“We’ve recruited hundreds of applicants, that’s a great number to work with. We don’t want to lose that when we have trouble filling all our jobs,” said Wadleigh, who hired firefighters in her position as a district ranger at the Coconino National Forest in northern Arizona before retiring last year.
Those recruits went on to fight wildfires in surrounding states, including Nevada, as U.S. wildfires have grown more severe in recent years.
 Women firefighters urge Trump administration to reinstate training program

Linda Chappell, another firefighter who helped run boot camps, said she knew the program had legs by the third year when it started regularly receiving more applicants than available slots.
“Women don’t know they can have this job, or women are hesitant to jump in for an entire fire season. After getting them in for a week of training they knew if they loved it or didn’t,” Chappell said, who retired in 2021 as an intermountain regional fuels program manager.
Both women are working with several members of Congress to urge the Trump administration to reinstate the program, saying its elimination will exacerbate the shortage of federal firefighters.
The Forest Service has lost more than 1,400 fire-certified federal workers since February as part of the Trump administration’s work to reduce the size of government. The agency has also recently asked firefighters to work more hours amid the staffing cuts.
U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nevada, and six other senators on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee sent a letter to the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior on Friday requesting an explanation for the elimination of the boot camp program and its immediate reinstatement.
Idaho Department of Lands seeks to balance pending budget cuts with firefighting needs

“Thousands of firings at land management agencies across the country have already left land managers understaffed for upcoming fire seasons. We are concerned the elimination of this program will exacerbate this issue,” reads the letter.
The National Interagency Fire Center reports the U.S. has experienced more than 48,000 wildfires that have burned through more than four million acres across dozens of states this year.
“Eliminating a successful outreach program such as the [Women in Wildfire Boot Camp] unnecessarily limits recruitment to a smaller pool of potential trainees when there is already a shortage of skilled and willing potential workers,” the letter continues.
Chappell, the firefighter who helped run boot camps, said she believes the program was caught up in a sweeping DEI ban without reason.
“We think it may be just an unintended consequence. We’re not convinced that’s what they intended when the executive order was signed. So let’s go ask, is that really what was intended?” Chappell said.
However, announcements about the boot camp that are still online warn “any previously issued diversity, equity, inclusion or gender-related guidance on this webpage should be considered rescinded.”
The letter requesting an explanation for the elimination of the boot camp was also signed by U.S. Sens. Martin Heinrich (D-New Mexico), John Hickenlooper (D-Colorado), Alex Padilla (D-California), Ruben Gallego (D-Arizona), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) and Angus King (I-Maine).

(Photo courtesy Elevatus Architecture)The Indiana Department of Correction is seeking $15.79 million in capital funding from the State Budget Committee to ready the Miami Correctional Facility for use under a proposed federal immigration and law enforcement agreement.
The budget committee is scheduled to meet Wednesday to consider, and possibly approve, the request.
DOC officials requested funding for “capital improvements necessary to operate a proposed detention facility at Miami Correctional Facility in order to facilitate the federal immigration and law enforcement activity,” according to the committee’s agenda.
The request would cover a series of infrastructure upgrades and equipment acquisitions, including “enhancements to perimeter fencing and lighting, temporary housing structures, modifications to the intake and processing areas, installation of drug detection and drone prevention systems, and x-ray screening equipment.”
No new construction: Feds to use 1K empty Indiana prison beds to house immigration detainees

Earlier this summer, DOC announced that the federal government plans to use up to 1,000 empty beds at Miami Correctional Facility — existing but unused capacity — to house immigration detainees.
DOC spokeswoman Annie Goeller previously said there will be no new construction or expansion of the existing Miami Correctional Facility in Bunker Hill and that the north-central Indiana prison is simply making 1,000 existing, but unused, beds available to the federal government to increase its detention capacity.
DOC’s latest figures for August showed that Miami Correctional Facility was housing 1,845 inmates in 1,862 available beds, putting it at about 99% of its capacity.
Goeller said the prison site has a total capacity of more than 3,100 beds when fully operational.
Gov. Mike Braun acknowledged concerns about potential costs to the state when he spoke about the issue last month — but he said his “goal” is that “anything we’re doing for (federal immigration officials), that we get compensated for it.”
The budget committee agenda notes that the upgrades are needed “upon execution of the agreement with the Federal Government.” It’s not clear, however, if that agreement has already been finalized, however.
In addition to DOC’s deal to provide detention space, state police and other agencies have also entered agreements with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to collaborate on enforcement efforts across the state.
DOC also revised its long-term prison consolidation plans. Officials confirmed last month that the Indiana State Prison in Michigan City will remain open “for some time” after the new $1.2 billion Northwest Indiana Correctional Facility opens in 2027, backing away from earlier plans to shutter it.
Westville Correctional Facility, located just 14 miles south, will still close as originally planned.

(Photo by Cornell Watson for KFF Health News)Devon Price, a 15-year-old boy with autism, has attended the largest school district in North Carolina for 10 years, but he cannot read or write. His twin sister, Danielle, who is also autistic, was bullied by classmates and became suicidal.
Under federal law, public schools must provide children with disabilities a “free appropriate public education,” to give them the same opportunity to learn as other kids.
The twins’ mother, Emma Miller, and tens of thousands of other parents in the U.S. have elevated complaints to the Education Department alleging that schools and states have ignored mistreatment of their children. Those complaints are in limbo as President Donald Trump’s administration has set about dismantling the federal agency.
Trump once mocked a reporter with a disability. Earlier this year, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s inaccurate remarks about people with autism were criticized as perpetuating offensive stereotypes.
Now people like Miller are worried their children will be left behind.
“I want justice for my twins, and to sound the alarm so other special needs children are not suffering or being deprived,” said Miller, 53, who lives with her twins in Wake Forest, North Carolina.

The Education Department, which was created in 1979 and helps oversee schools and colleges in the U.S., has the authority to protect students from discrimination based on race, sex, religion, or disability. Its Office for Civil Rights investigates allegations at schools and negotiates corrective actions.
As the school year begins, families throughout the country are unsure what authority will be left to intervene on their behalf if the office is shuttered, said Hannah Russell, an advocate who works with parents in North Carolina trying to obtain educational services for their children with disabilities.
“Without the Department of Education there is no accountability,” said Russell, a former special education teacher. “Everybody is scared.”
Miller described her twins as her “miracle babies” who survived despite each weighing 1 pound at birth. Danielle Price spent the first five months of her life in a neonatal intensive care unit, and her brother, Devon, the first seven months.
She has spent years fighting for them, repeatedly taking on local and state school officials. But even when she notched victories, she said, her children did not get the help they were promised.
Miller said her children are high-functioning and verbal. She said they could have thrived academically if the school system had given them proper services.
“My children have suffered,” Miller wrote in a complaint she filed in September 2024. “The most vulnerable group of children [is] being denied a basic education.”
‘Unusual and unprecedented’
Miller says her daughter began to self-harm after classmates teased and tormented her and staff secluded her away from her bullies. The Wake County Public School System assigned Devon to a classroom with an instructional assistant who was not a licensed teacher, a violation of policy, according to state documents.
Last year, Miller filed a complaint against Wake County schools with the federal Office for Civil Rights. She alleged the district did not reevaluate her kids to determine their special education needs, did not respond for months to her records requests, and retaliated against her by wrongly withdrawing the twins from the school district.
Wake County schools violated policy when staff did not address the effects of bullying on Danielle, says an April 2024 letter from the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction.
The school system’s education plan for Danielle “was not appropriate considering the student’s unmet social-emotional needs, which resulted in the student’s increased anxiety,” the letter says.
State officials concluded in June 2024 that the school system failed to develop, review, and revise an education plan for Devon, assigned him to a teacher assistant instead of a licensed teacher, and did not provide technology that could help him learn, according to documents.
While the decisions validated Miller’s concerns, she said that the district continues to violate her children’s rights and that the state is now ignoring her pleas for help.
“No one is taking responsibility,” she told KFF Health News. “It has been a nightmare.”
But after she appealed to the federal government last year, the Education Department sent her a letter in March saying it would not look into the complaint.
For decades, parents and advocates for people with disabilities have said the system makes it difficult for them to win against school districts, because the process is often time-consuming, confusing, and, if a family hires a lawyer, expensive. Now they say families could soon face even bigger hurdles.
On March 11, the day the Education Department sent Miller’s denial letter, the agency announced it was firing nearly half its 4,133 employees. Education Secretary Linda McMahon said the move was “a significant step toward restoring the greatness of the United States education system.”
Officials shuttered seven of the 12 regional offices of the agency’s Office for Civil Rights, leaving a skeleton staff to investigate thousands of complaints filed each year, according to attorneys and advocates for the disabled.
Trump, acting on a campaign promise to shrink the federal government, later signed an executive order to eliminate the Education Department, which he said had failed children and built a bloated bureaucracy.
The president instructed officials to “return authority over education to the States and local communities while ensuring the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Parents and advocacy groups say that would allow local authorities to police themselves at a time when schools remain racially segregated, some selective colleges accept male applicants at higher rates than female applicants, and students with disabilities are struggling to recover academically from the covid pandemic, more so than their peers. Also, they note, the federal laws protecting disabled and disadvantaged children emerged because of state-level failures.
Under North Carolina law, children with disabilities should be reevaluated by schools every three years to help determine their individual needs. But Miller said Wake County officials for nearly a decade refused her requests to have her kids reevaluated. She said it finally happened in late 2024.
“I never expected getting an education for my children would be such a problem,” Miller said.
The Education Law Center, the NAACP, and other advocacy groups have sued to stop Trump’s plans, alleging the changes are illegal and pose a threat to the education of students from vulnerable groups. Some 20 states and the District of Columbia sued to halt the plan, but the Supreme Court ruled in July that the Trump administration could move ahead while the case proceeded through the courts.
Russell said she has heard North Carolina school districts are promising to provide accommodations for students with disabilities, such as extra time on tests.
But families who cannot afford to hire an attorney could find themselves at a disadvantage when disagreements arise over services that cost districts more money, Russell said.
The Trump administration has decimated the Office for Civil Rights’ ability to properly investigate a backlog of thousands of complaints, said Robert Kim, who leads the Education Law Center.
The office reported receiving nearly 23,000 complaints in fiscal 2024, the highest number ever. About 8,400, or 37%, involved allegations of disability discrimination.

Black children and those with disabilities may suffer the worst consequences, since they disproportionately face harsh discipline at school, including physical restraint and isolation in seclusion rooms, Kim said.
The Education Department says children with disabilities make up 14% of students but 75% of those secluded and 81% of those physically restrained.
Black children constitute about 15% of students but 42% of those who are mechanically restrained using a device or equipment.
“Something unusual and unprecedented is happening,” Kim said about what he sees as a shift in the federal government’s responsibility to keep children safe and provide a high-quality education.
The Education Department’s press office declined an interview request for this story in an unsigned email that was copied to agency officials Madison Biedermann, Savannah Newhouse, Julie Hartman, and Ellen Keast.
White House spokesperson Kush Desai did not respond to a request for comment.
In a July statement, McMahon said her agency is performing all of its duties: “We will carry out the reduction in force to promote efficiency and accountability and to ensure resources are directed where they matter most — to students, parents, and teachers.”
‘Nothing but problems’
Danielle and Devon Price entered 10th grade at Wake Forest High School in August. Their mother said she is uncertain what will happen to them.
Danielle wants to go to college, but her math skills are at a fourth-grade level, school records show.
Like many youths with autism, Danielle struggles with changes in routine, and her mother said she became despondent when school officials repeatedly changed her classes to keep her away from a boy who bullied her. Soon after that, Danielle started to self-harm, Miller said, adding that her daughter receives intensive therapy.
“It has been nothing but problems” with Wake County schools, she said. “It is like no one cares.”
Wake County school officials declined to answer questions about Miller’s complaints, citing privacy laws.
In a written statement, district spokesperson Matthew Dees said that “the school district has worked hard to reach agreement with Ms. Miller on many issues” and remedied complaints that were substantiated.
“The district disputes the remaining allegations in the various complaints she has raised, including the many accusations against various staff,” Dees added.
Under federal law, parents have 180 days from the time of the last alleged violation to file a complaint with the Education Department. Miller submitted her complaint Sept. 12, 2024, exactly 180 days after she says her twins were last denied a “free appropriate public education.”

But the Office for Civil Rights said that was too late. Officials declined to waive the time limit for Miller, who had asked for an exception, according to its March denial letter.
She said she spent months fighting with Wake County school officials and did not turn to federal government sooner because she hoped she could resolve the issues locally.
Miller fears for her children’s future unless something changes at school.
“I’m a single parent, and one day I won’t be here,” she said. “My kids are going to be adults soon, yet my son doesn’t know how to read and write. I’m like, ‘Wow.’ There really is no help here.”

In January 2025, the Iowa Board of Nursing charged registered nurse Lorraine Anderson of Salix with falsification of records and with failing to evaluate or report the status of a patient as required.
According to board records, Anderson was employed by Sioux City’s Park View Homes, a 45-bed intermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities, for approximately 17 years, most recently as the facility’s director of nursing.

State records show that in February 2024, the state agency that inspects nursing homes, the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, determined that a physician’s orders for several of the facility residents’ medications were missing. A DIAL inspector found that the last orders on file for the residents, which were good for 90 days, had been signed in October 2023 and were expired.
According to board records, the inspector was informed two days later that Anderson had found more recent orders for 14 residents of the home. The inspector noted the newly discovered orders appeared to have been signed by Dr. Brianna Brownlee in November 2023 — which was odd given that the October 2023 orders would not have expired at that point.
DIAL did not cite Park View Homes for any violations related to the records, but in March 2024, the Board of Nursing began to investigate. According to the board, one of its investigators spoke to Dr. Brownlee, who allegedly denied signing the 14 orders and said she suspected Anderson had forged her signature on the documents.
The board investigator then spoke to Anderson, who allegedly denied forging Brownlee’s signature. According to board records, Anderson asserted the 14 orders had been found in a locked storage room, and she reportedly suggested that a resident of the home must have accessed the documents somehow and forged the signatures.
Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Anderson.
At a subsequent disciplinary hearing on the matter, Administrative Law Judge Kristine Dreckman concluded there was sufficient evidence to show Anderson was the individual who had forged the physician’s signature on residents’ medication orders.
At the hearing, the state offered no argument or evidence to support the board’s charge that Anderson had also failed to evaluate or report the status of a patient as required, and that charge was dismissed.
Dreckman then issued a proposed decision, later approved by the board, suspending Anderson’s nursing license and stipulating that she cannot apply for reinstatement for at least one year.
The order stipulates that at the time of her application for reinstatement, Anderson must show it is in the public interest for her license to be reinstated and provide evidence that she has completed 12 hours of educational coursework related to professional ethics and medical documentation.

Casey Crabtree, R-Madison, speaks on the South Dakota Senate floor on March 3, 2025. (Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Madison Republican state Sen. Casey Crabtree formally announced Monday that he is running for South Dakota’s lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives next year, pledging to carry out President Donald Trump’s “America First” agenda.
“I am the only conservative Republican in this race who has always delivered on an ‘America First,’ ‘South Dakota Always’ agenda,” Crabtree said in an interview with South Dakota Searchlight.
Crabtree works in economic development for Heartland Energy, a wholesale electrical power provider. He said his background in energy development, creating jobs and helping “rural communities thrive” is what President Trump is looking for.
Jackley calls for improved legal immigration policy while launching his campaign for Congress

Other declared candidates include Republican Attorney General Marty Jackley, Democratic nonprofit executive Billy Mawhiney, of Sioux Falls, and Democratic former U.S. Department of Agriculture employee Nikki Gronli, of rural Dell Rapids. Another Democrat, Scott Schlagel, of Dell Rapids, has filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission.
The House seat is up for grabs next year because U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, is running for governor.
Crabtree said he is the best fit for the job, pointing to legislation he has helped enact in South Dakota. The list includes a temporary sales tax reduction, a ban on sanctuary policies for unauthorized immigration, a tax refund for gas stations to incentivize ethanol use, a $200 million fund for housing infrastructure, and several annual freezes on state university tuition.
“When you look at that huge list of things, that is the America First agenda, and that is us delivering on that,” Crabtree said.
Crabtree was appointed to the state Senate in 2020 by then-Gov. Kristi Noem, and he served as majority leader in 2023 and 2024. He lost his leadership position following his prime sponsorship of Senate Bill 201 in 2024.
The bill would have implemented new protections for landowners and counties impacted by the construction of a proposed carbon dioxide pipeline, but would have stopped short of preventing pipeline companies from using a legal process known as eminent domain to gain land access from unwilling landowners. Opponents of the pipeline referred the legislation to the ballot, where voters rejected it, and a divide in the Republican Party over the bill played a role in 14 incumbent Republicans losing their seats during the June 2024 primary election. The winners of those races helped enact a ban on eminent domain for carbon pipelines earlier this year.
“I’ll never apologize for fighting for farmers and ranchers,” Crabtree said when asked about the 2024 bill’s potential impact on his campaign. “It’s something that I’ve always done and I will always continue to do.”

The carbon pipeline project would capture and sequester some of the corn-based ethanol industry’s CO2 emissions in an attempt to gain tax credits and access markets demanding less carbon-intensive fuels. Crabtree has said the effort supports President Trump’s agenda of ensuring energy dominance while creating more demand for corn.
When asked about Trump’s tariff policies, which some in agriculture have criticized, Crabtree defended them.
“For far too long, countries like China haven’t held up their end of the deal and they hurt American businesses, American workers, and certainly hurt our family farmers,” he said. “The president is the ultimate deal maker, and I’m confident that he’s going to use tariffs in the short term to negotiate better trade deals for American workers and our family farmers.”
When asked if Trump is hard enough on Russia and whether he should do more to aid Ukraine, Crabtree said Trump is handling the situation “perfectly.” He said Trump is trying to end the war,  something “Biden never did.”
“He needs strong allies like myself who will be serving in Congress to make sure he can deliver on that America First Agenda,” Crabtree said.
Crabtree grew up in Arlington, graduated from Northern State University in Aberdeen, and lives in Madison with his wife, Ashley, and their two sons. Ashley owns an optometry practice.
The Republican primary for the congressional seat, which would pit Crabtree against Jackley and any other Republican candidates who arise, is June 2, 2026. The general election will be Nov. 3, 2026.

Tony Evers is suing the Wisconsin State Legislature for clarification on administrative rulemaking powers after a state Supreme Court decision earlier this year found that lawmakers were unconstitutionally blocking administrative rules indefinitely. 
Since the Wisconsin Supreme Court’s Evers v. Marklein II decision in July, Evers has taken steps to implement 12 administrative rules that were approved by him, but without getting the sign off from committees. His administration has said the additional approval isn’t needed. 
However, Republican lawmakers have objected to Evers implementing the rules without going through the legislative committees, instructing the Legislative Reference Bureau not to publish any rule that hasn’t gone through a review by the Legislature in accordance with Wisconsin law. 
“The Legislature cannot continue to indefinitely obstruct my administration from doing the people’s work — and the Wisconsin Supreme Court agrees, but Republican lawmakers are continuing their unlawful behavior anyway,” Evers said in a statement about the court filing. “At the end of the day, this lawsuit is about following the law and making sure there’s accountability for elected officials if they fail to do so. It shouldn’t take going to court to get Republican lawmakers to comply with state law and Supreme Court decisions, but it seems like that’s what it’s going to take, unfortunately.” 
Evers argues in the filing in Dane County Circuit Court that the state law that barred agencies from publishing rules that hadn’t gone through the Joint Committee on the Review of Administrative Rules was invalidated under the state Supreme Court ruling. 
“No statute bars agencies from promulgating final administrative rules pending a legislative committee’s review,” the filing argued. “And even if any such statute existed, it would be facially unconstitutional under Evers II… a legislative committee cannot have discretion over a pre-promulgation pause without violating constitutional bicameralism and presentment procedures. Such a statute would also unconstitutionally intrude on the executive branch’s authority to execute statutes that authorize administrative rulemaking.”
Evers is asking for a declaration and an injunction that orders the Legislative Reference Bureau must publish the nine rules the Evers Administration has already submitted and all administrative rules that have completed all preceding rulemaking procedures and been approved by the governor. 
Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said in a statement that Evers is directing agencies to violate “valid” parts of Wisconsin law that “no court has ever questioned, let alone found to be invalid in any respect.”
“Just because Governor Evers is now a lame duck who no longer believes he is accountable to the people, it does not give him the right to ignore laws that the Legislature enacted, and a prior occupant of his office signed,” the Republican leaders said. “That’s not how the rule of law works.”

(Courtesy of Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office)Preliminary investigation into the suspect who shot and injured two fellow students at Evergreen High School Wednesday found that he was “radicalized by some extremist network,” according to Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson Jacki Kelley.
“The details of that will be (released) down the road, but we wanted to at least give you that much about mindset for him,” Kelley said in a press conference outside of the school Thursday.
Students hospitalized after Evergreen High School shooting; suspected shooter dead

Officials have identified the shooting suspect as 16-year-old Desmond Holly, who died at a Lakewood hospital on Wednesday from a self-inflicted gunshot wound he sustained after the shooting. The suspect’s family has been cooperative with authorities as they investigate and plan to search his home, phone and school locker, Kelley said.
The Denver Post reported later Thursday that social media accounts apparently belonging to the suspect were filled with white supremacist content, posts exhibiting a fascination with mass shootings and reposted videos that “were explicitly antisemitic or depicted people in Nazi uniforms.”
The two victims of the shooting — 18-year-old Matthew Silverstone and another student who has not yet been identified — remained in critical condition at local hospitals, where Kelley said there is security present.
The suspect used a revolver handgun that he repeatedly fired and reloaded, which Kelley said “went on and on.” As the shooting went on, he was unable to access areas of the school that had gone into lockdown.
“He tried to find new targets, and he came up against a roadblock on many of those doors,” Kelley said. “He couldn’t get to those kids.”

Silverstone’s family released a brief statement through the sheriff’s office on Thursday.
“The family appreciates the community’s concern and support, but as we remain focused on our loved one’s recovery, we respectfully request privacy as we continue to heal and navigate the road ahead,” the statement said.
The name of the second victim has not yet been released.
Students and staff at the school “did their job, they did it well, and lives were saved yesterday because of the actions they took” during the lockdown, Kelley said. Many students ran and fled the scene while others remained locked down in the school.
Kelley had no information on how the suspect obtained the weapon.
Multiple agencies are supporting the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office in the investigation “because there’s so many crime scenes within the school and outside the school,” Kelley said. Many windows and lockers within the school were shot.
The high school will not reopen this week.

(Photo by Getty Images)About a third of the parking lot of the Pheasant Lane Mall in Nashua spills over into Tyngsborough, Massachusetts. It’s a geographical quirk that means if shoppers park in the southern lot near the JCPenny or Buffalo Wild Wings, they could find themselves crossing state lines multiple times during their visit.
But for the attorneys general of New Hampshire and 24 other Republican-led states, it’s a novelty that highlights what they say is a problem with Massachusetts’ gun laws.
A New Hampshire resident who might be legally carrying a firearm on the New Hampshire side of the parking lot might find that same firearm illegal to carry to the Massachusetts side without a permit.
The 25 states say that arrangement is unconstitutional. This month, they’re taking that argument to the U.S. Supreme Court.
“If that person is carrying a firearm without a Massachusetts license — which would be constitutionally protected activity in most of the mall — that person risks being charged as a felon and facing mandatory incarceration in Massachusetts,” reads a brief from the New Hampshire Attorney General’s Office to the U.S. Supreme Court, speaking about a visitor to the Pheasant Lane Mall.
Led by New Hampshire, the states have come together to support the efforts of Philip Marquis, of Rochester, New Hampshire, to ask the U.S. Supreme Court to protect non-Massachusetts residents from the Bay State’s firearms regulations. In an amici — or “friend of the court” — brief, lawyers at the New Hampshire Department of Justice say Massachusetts’ firearms permitting law should not apply to travelers from other states passing through.
Also joining the amici brief are the attorneys general of Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.
The Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office, meanwhile, asserts the law can apply to visitors and is constitutional. And the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has agreed.
If the U.S. Supreme Court takes up the case, the conservative majority could apply a landmark 2022 decision that limited state firearms regulations to rule in favor of Marquis. And the result could dramatically change relations between gun-owning New Hampshire residents and those of its southern neighbor.
But the Supreme Court has been hesitant to take up challenges to gun laws in recent years that could help clarify its 2022 decision. And that has meant a backlog of cases against state firearm restrictions — and potentially the Marquis case — have been left unresolved recently, according to Joseph Blocher, a law professor and co-founder of the Duke Center for Firearms Law.
“I think the pressure is high on the Supreme Court to weigh in again. But they have not,” Blocher said in an interview. “They did not show much of an appetite for it for most of the last 20 years.”
Marquis previously brought a lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts in the state’s court system, arguing that the state’s concealed carry firearms permit law is unnecessarily burdensome to out-of-state visitors. In March, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court denied his claims and ruled that the state law passed constitutional muster.
Now, Marquis is requesting the U.S. Supreme Court to overrule the Massachusetts high court’s decision on federal constitutional grounds. In order for that to happen, the federal court must grant Marquis a “writ of certiorari,” which would allow them to accept arguments and hold an oral hearing.
For Marquis, the effort is personal; he is trying to overturn a conviction. In 2022, Marquis was driving on Interstate 495 when he got into an accident and pulled his car into the breakdown lane, according to his legal petition. At the time, he had an unloaded pistol in his pocket. When state police officers arrived to talk to him, Marquis announced that he had the pistol and removed it from his pocket.
He told police officers that he did not have a Massachusetts firearm license, but that he is legally allowed to carry a concealed firearm in New Hampshire because he has not been disqualified under federal law. New Hampshire state law allows the automatic concealed carry of firearms for anyone not federally disqualified; Massachusetts requires residents and non-residents to obtain a license by paying $100 and receiving approval from the colonel of the state police.
Because he was carrying the gun without a license, police charged Marquis with unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition under Massachusetts state law, and a lower court convicted him.
Marquis has appealed that decision all the way to the highest Massachusetts court, and in doing so he’s invoked a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that has upended state firearms laws. In New York State Rifle & Police Association, Inc. v. Bruen, the court struck down a New York law that required residents to show “proper cause” in order to obtain a concealed carry permit.
In that decision, the court held that any state law that awards firearms permits on a discretionary basis, known as a “may issue” permitting law, is unconstitutional; only a law that awards permits on strict criteria — a “shall issue” permitting law — could be constitutional under the Second Amendment. And Bruen established that any state firearms restriction must adhere to the historical tradition of firearms regulation dating back to the passage of the Constitution — or be explicitly covered by the Second Amendment itself.
Now, as Marquis attempts to bring his case to the U.S. Supreme Court, his challenge of the Massachusetts law could represent an opportunity for the court to expand the range of gun rights in the wake of the Bruen decision and limit Massachusetts’ regulatory power.
Neither Marquis nor the Republican attorneys general supporting his lawsuit are attempting to overturn Massachusetts’ firearms permitting law as it applies to Massachusetts residents. But they are seeking to establish that the law should not apply to out-of-state residents whose home states have less restrictive regulations.
And to do it, they are attempting to show that the state law violated Marquis’ Second Amendment right to bear arms and 14th Amendment right to travel and equal protection — and that, following Bruen, no historical reading of those amendments justifies applying Massachusetts’ law to out-of-state residents.
In their briefs, attorneys for Marquis and attorneys for the Republican states argue the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court was wrong to decide that the state’s concealed carry permit law qualifies as a “shall issue” permitting law under Bruen. In reality, they say, the decision-making by the state police colonel makes the process a “may issue,” and thus unconstitutional.
In its March ruling, the Supreme Judicial Court held that Marquis did not have standing to sue in Massachusetts court, but that even if he did, his challenge of the state law would not succeed. The court found that the state law passed the Bruen test because it attempts to restrict dangerous people from obtaining firearms, which it held follows historical tradition.
“To the extent that the Commonwealth restricts the ability of law-abiding citizens to carry firearms within its borders, the justification for so doing is credible, individualized evidence that the person in question would pose a danger if armed,” the state court’s decision read. “Both case law and the historical record unequivocally indicate that this justification is consistent with ‘the Nation’s historical tradition of firearm regulation.’”
Clark Neily, the senior vice president for legal studies of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, disagrees. The Cato Institute, a staunch supporter of Second Amendment rights, has also filed an amicus brief in Marquis’ petition to the U.S. Supreme Court, in which it argues that a contextual reading of the 14th Amendment, which was ratified after the Civil War, indicates that its framers would have intended it to protect the firearms rights of freed slaves traveling to safer states.
“If you’ve been enslaved in Alabama, you sure want to get out of there and go and look for better economic opportunities in other states,” he said in an interview Thursday. “Now, you’re most certainly going to encounter the (Ku Klux Klan) at some point while you’re looking for work in other states. And guess what? You’re going to want to be able to be able to protect yourself, and not have to encounter some state regulation like they have in Massachusetts.”
It is not clear whether the court will take up Marquis’ appeal, nor when it might make its decision. Despite its decision in Bruen, the conservative court has held back from dramatically expanding the scope of the Second Amendment. In 2024, it narrowed the scope of Bruen‘s in U.S. v. Rahimi, which affirmed the constitutionality of firearm restrictions for defendants in domestic violence case. But it has declined to take up a number of attempts to challenge state firearms restrictions in Democratic-led states, including two cases in Massachusetts, Commonwealth v. Crowder and Zemene v. Commonwealth.
To Blocher, of the Center for Firearms Law, the question of whether Bruen negates out-of-state firearms license requirements is just one of many legal questions that have emerged in caselaw across the country since the 2022 decision. Federal lower courts are grappling with what Bruen means for gun possession by felons; location-based firearm restriction laws such as gun-free school zones; age restrictions; caps on high-capacity magazines; state bans on assault-style rifles; and more. The historical contextual test Bruen requires has at times provided more uncertainty than clarity, he says. And circuit courts are more likely than ever to split along partisan lines.
“It kind of looks like there’s some real confusion and disagreement,” he said. “Some lower courts are even saying, ‘Look, we’re just not equipped to do this kind of historical analysis. We’ve got busy dockets. We’re not like the Supreme Court. We have to decide more than 70 cases every year, and we don’t have the benefits of experts and friend of court briefs, and this is just impossible for us.’”
With scant action from the Supreme Court, the result has been something of a backlog.
Some Second Amendment advocates, like Neily, say the current John Roberts court has failed to follow through on necessary corrections to firearms laws.
“The court has not manifested a serious commitment to vindicating the right to keep and bear arms, and one of the ways we can see that is in the numerous cases that it has turned away,” Neily said.
But the string of denials have given hope to supporters of gun restrictions, for whom Bruen had struck a blow in 2022.
“Even after Bruen, courts are upholding state, federal, and local gun laws against Second Amendment challenges,” a 2023 legal memo from the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence states. “Most courts have recognized that, when properly applied, Bruen allows for a wide range of gun violence prevention laws.”

(Kansas Reflector screen capture)TOPEKA — An intensive look at the Kansas substance abuse disorder system reveals gaps in services that can be addressed to provide better care and support statewide, university researchers said.
The University of Kansas Center for Public Partnerships and Research gathered data, talked to 2,000 Kansans and explored evidence-based tactics that could change the substance abuse system.
The result was the United to Transform report, a needs assessment that was shared with the Kansas Fights Addiction Board after being commissioned by the Sunflower Foundation.
“Substance use disorder actually encompasses a range of substances, from alcohol, tobacco to opioids, amphetamines, the whole package,” said Silke von Esenwein, research lead for the project, on the Kansas Reflector podcast.
The funds from Kansas Fights Addiction were from the opioid settlement, so there was a strong focus on that class of drugs.
“But the truth is that people use a lot of things at the same time,” von Esenwein said. “It usually goes hand-in-hand with mental health issues and so we made it a point to be pretty inclusive of all the substances that people are using out there, because they’re part of the context and they’re part of what’s happening in Kansas.”


Janine Hron, co-principle investigator on the project, said she was shocked at the prevalence of substance use in Kansas. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported that one in five Kansans meets the clinical criteria for substance use disorder, she said.
In addition, 95% of those people do not believe they need to change their behavior or need support in doing so, the research found.
“In that way, substance use disorder really is a factor affecting the lives of all Kansans because those one in five are people that you know,” Hron said. “They are a part of our family, they’re in our workplace, the general community structures, our faith communities, our social networks. It’s an everyday part of everybody’s life.”
The estimate of use may be an underestimate, von Esenwein said, because the survey doesn’t include people who are unhoused or incarcerated.
A needs assessment is a comprehensive look at the substance use disorder throughout the state, von Esenwein said.
“You try to identify gaps and weaknesses, but you also try to identify strengths in a system, what you can build on,” she said. “You see where do people fall through the cracks? What are the big burning fires? What are rising issues? We added a component, which is called futures work. We’d not only ask what is happening now, but we also did a lot of work (on) what do people want to see in the future.”
Data and information gathering were critical to the process, and the report also explored potential strategies and priorities, von Esenwein said.
Gathering information from multiple networks in communities throughout Kansas wasn’t as simple as creating focus groups, Hron said. They used strategies that allowed communities, through exercises and activities, to interpret for themselves what is happening, she said.
“We’re gathering the information about the ‘what,’ but we’re also understanding deeper about the ‘how does this manifest’ in the community,” Hron said. “For me, that was reinforcement for the exceptionally important local level kinds of look that we needed to take and how we would marry that with the very important systems-level initiatives that were going to be required.”
The substance use disorder system is large, Hron said, and involves many different players.
“That’s our challenge,” she said. “It’s the wild west right now. We, very early on, started looking at both the systems level and the local levels, and the interdependencies between those.”
 
Strengths
Hron and von Esenwein said strengths in the Kansas system showed up throughout their work. For instance, they found that while there still can be stigma around having a substance use disorder, that opinion is shifting.
“People are talking about this topic,” von Esenwein said. “There’s a really vibrant peer movement going on in Kansas that took it to the streets. They literally took it to the streets and said, ‘We are dying, and nobody cares.’ And they’re very vocal. The advocacy is much stronger.”
They also talked to clinicians who said it used to be a “‘party conversation stopper” to talk about their profession and now people respond positively, she said.
Hron said insights from a group of eight people — they called them the “accountability cohort” — who had lived experience with substance use were helpful in shaping questions and how researchers looked at the individual experience and community-level supports.
“They were the ones who really articulated for us what that individual journey looks like, and this lack of mattering, it was really heartbreaking to me,” she said, referring to individuals who felt like they didn’t matter to anyone.
“They also talked about the point where something clicks and the process of change started, and what that took, the hope, the connection, the community that is required to do that successfully,” Hron said.
 
Challenges
The report highlights key findings, including:
Most (93 of 101) hospitals in frontier and rural Kansas communities are financially unstable, and they offer opportunities to meet substance use disorder (SUD) needs. In 2023, 29% of all SUD patients required emergency or crisis services.
There is a severe lack of access to medical detoxification and Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD). These medications are essential and are considered gold standard for treatment. Kansas 2023 medical claims data show treatment including medical detoxification in less than 1% of all people receiving care, and use of MOUD occurring in fewer than 4% of cases.
Pharmacies operate in 103 out of 105 counties, making them one of the most accessible health care points for individuals seeking care.
“The role of our hospitals, particularly in the rural parts of the state, is absolutely essential,” Hron said. “Right now, they are triaging and dealing with emergencies and that sort of thing, but there’s a much bigger role that they could be playing.”
Hospitals and pharmacies could be touchpoints for people with SUD, but in general, the system is fragmented, von Esenwein said.
“That’s not news, right? Like, people know that, but we were able to find much more details that give us kind of entry points,” she said. “We know, for instance, that youth and the elderly population, over 85, have a particularly hard time finding care. We also were able to identify where care breaks down after people come out of treatment, and what is not there right now to make people successful.”
Von Esenwein said the lack of evidence-based practices being used and failure to use medical detoxification drugs in Kansas was “stunning” to the team.
“That kind of evidence-based practice — we know what works — isn’t really happening in Kansas,” she said. “We know medications for opioid use disorder are the No. 1 way to save lives. We know it’s very effective. Less than 5% of people that are in treatment are getting it.”
Medication-assisted withdrawal can make all the difference for someone trying to stop using drugs, and von Esenwein said that’s not happening in the state. Instead, social withdrawal, meaning stopping use without medication supports, is typically what occurs.
“That might be in a medical setting, but without a medication that we know makes it easier to come out of it,” she said.
 
Community matters
Every community is different, and the people and systems there have different needs, Hron and von Esenwein said.
The Kansas Fights Addiction board will have numerous opportunities to meet needs in Kansas based on what researchers found, she said.
“I think the board has a chance to really support what we know works, which is strong prevention efforts, medications for treatment, treatments that are not in residential settings for three months that nobody can afford, that are way too expensive, and people can’t just leave their children, parents, whatever, behind to go,” von Esenwein said.
Creating a continuum of care that supports people with substance use disorder is possible, she said.
“We are really pleasantly surprised by the energy and the readiness of people throughout the state to do something about this,” von Esenwein said. “This is usually a topic people kind of shy away from and are reluctant to talk about, but people are fired up and they’re ready to talk.”
Webinars pulling together people in the SUD system from across the state were a special highlight of the process, Hron said. People were excited to share information and to compare what was happening in other communities.
“Kansans are resourceful and they’re practical,” von Esenwein said. “I think that we can really capitalize on that. I think people are ready. We talked to lots of people with lots of connections, and we’re in a pretty good position to actually move forward and do something. It made us very optimistic.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SUDresearch16x9-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-09-15 10:57:08.861233

(Photo courtesy of NBC12)Major flooding that battered the commonwealth last year after Hurricane Helene and the Presidents Day flooding earlier this year, showed that communities across the state — not just on the coast — need to know the potential impact of storms. As a result and because of recent legislation, the state is working to update its flood protection plan, 20 years after the last update to it, for how communities can tackle flooding.
The first iteration of the Virginia Flood Protection Master Plan is due by the end of next year. The Flood Resiliency Advisory Committee was created through recent legislation and is made up of representatives focused on housing, environmental quality, emergency management, and transportation. The committee’s aim is to fill in gaps in data between federal and local agencies to help localities make long-term plans for flood resilience.
“The risk is managed across multiple programs and policies, and a lot of that then flows down to local governments to implement,” said Matt Dalon, program manager for the Office of Resilience Planning. “We’re looking for opportunities to coordinate and enhance our work so we’re more efficient and effective in our policies and programs to manage the flood risk across the Commonwealth.”
This work is being done in tandem with the second phase of the Coastal Resilience Master Plan to use future rainfall projections to aid in long range plans. The first phase of the coastal plan was released in 2021. Over 70% of Virginia’s population calls the coastal region home.
FEMA currently does not take into account future rainfall projections when formulating its flood maps, according to Dalon. On the local level there is often not enough resources or funding to conduct rainfall projections when making city or county resiliency plans.
“But historically, precipitation and rainfall driven flooding has been absent from a lot of the planning process because it’s not included entirely in the FEMA data. So there’s been kind of this gap,” Dalon said.
The plan will not have directives or specific projects laid out for flood mitigation. It will focus on connecting agencies, training on how to respond to flooding, and reliable data for localities to use in their own planning. 
“I mean, it’s just not realistic to think we’re going to have zero flood risk. But start making changes now and sticking to it and continue to build that momentum so that we are seeing these long term reductions while also dealing with the more immediate items that come up,” Dolan said.
State agencies are currently working with stakeholders and communities who are heavily impacted by flooding, or are projected to be in the future, to gain ideas of how localities can look at how other areas of the state are mitigating flood risks that may be similar to what they may face in the future.

Intentionally lying about elections could draw a fine under a new bill proposed by Michigan Senate Democrats.
A bill reintroduced by Sen. Mary Cavanagh, a Democrat from Redford Township, would impose a $1,000 fine on anyone who knowingly lies about elections or a voter’s eligibility. Employers who had someone working for them “for election-related purposes” violate the provision — such as a lobbyist who suggests certain groups aren’t eligible to vote early — could face a fine of up to $10,000.
The goal is to deter election-related misinformation in a critical swing state, Cavanagh said during a Senate Elections and Ethics Committee hearing Wednesday. Such efforts “can cause confusion, reduce voter turnout, and ultimately undermine the legitimacy of our electoral system,” she said.
Last fall, activists including Elon Musk seized on a misleading claim that Michigan has more voters than eligible residents to suggest that something was wrong with the state’s voter rolls. The claim made significant ripples on social media, but it’s the same claim that has been debunked extensively by the state as well as independent experts.
Cavanagh’s proposal would target only those who “maliciously” spread false information, she said.
“We worked very closely with the ACLU as well as the Secretary of State’s office, the AG and municipal government to make sure we’re not infringing on anyone’s rights or someone just passing information to their neighbor,” Cavanagh said.
But others fear how such a law would be enforced. Sen. Ruth Johnson, a Republican from Holly and the minority vice chair of the Senate Elections and Ethics Committee, said she applauded the intent but that she didn’t feel “it represents really a good solution.” Johnson, a former secretary of state, said in the hearing that she believes the legislation “could be enforced in a very partisan, politically motivated way.”
Additional bills heard by the Elections Committee on Wednesday included two from Sen. Jeremy Moss, a Democrat from Southfield, aimed at people who circulate petitions and collect signatures on them for prospective ballot proposals. The bills would ban the practice of paying circulators for each signature, and would require circulators to read a summary of petitions to would-be signers or allow them to read it themselves.
“Ballot proposals should be able to stand on their own merit instead of a misleading description or another deceptive tactic to gain support,” Moss said. “Other states have put similar markers out there to restore honesty when petition circulators are talking about their ballot proposal.”
Another bill, from Democratic Sen. Jeff Irwin of Ann Arbor, would allow people who sign the same petition twice to have their signature counted — but only once — toward the minimum requirement.
Each of the four bills is identical to legislation introduced late last year. Those bills passed the Senate in December, but they stalled in the House during a lame duck session that saw little progress on any issue.
The bills passed this year with support from the five Democrats on the committee. Johnson voted against each bill, while Sen. Ed McBroom, a Republican from Waucedah Township, voted “pass” on each. The bills now move to the full Senate, where they are likely to pass again.

(Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)A panel of state lawmakers voted 9-2 on Wednesday to approve spending up to $100,000 on a lawsuit against Gov. Mike Dunleavy.
The lawsuit, if filed, would challenge the governor’s decision to press ahead with plans to create a cabinet-level Alaska Department of Agriculture via executive order.
The governor issued an executive order in January, but lawmakers rejected it in a 32-28 vote in March, saying they preferred to create it through legislation instead. Creating the department through legislation, legislative leaders said, would allow lawmakers to debate and structure the department how they wish, instead of relying on the governor’s plans alone.
Dunleavy disagrees with that approach and in August filed a new executive order during a 30-day special session.
The leaders of the House and Senate refused to accept the filing, saying that it was not within the governor’s power to issue an executive order during a special session, or to reintroduce an already-rejected order.
The governor’s office has said that lawmakers’ failure to vote down the new order means that it will take effect and allow the executive branch to create the cabinet-level department at the start of 2026.



Why does the Legislature’s failure to vote on the executive order matter?
Article III, section 23 of the Alaska Constitution says that executive orders automatically take effect “unless disapproved by resolution concurred in by a majority of the members in joint session.”
The question that could be decided in court is whether lawmakers need to take that vote if an order is issued during a special session. Is issuing an order in a special session even legal? And does it matter if the order is identical to one that’s already been issued and voted upon?



Under Article III, section 23 of the Alaska Constitution, the “legislature shall have sixty days of a regular session, or a full session if of shorter duration, to disapprove” executive orders that would make a change to the functions of the executive branch.
For almost two hours on Wednesday, members of the joint House-Senate Legislative Council — a committee that makes decisions for the Legislature when it is out of session — heard about the dispute behind closed doors, then debated it briefly in open session before voting.
“It’s a disagreement between the Legislature and the governor about whether or not the governor has the authority under the Alaska Constitution to introduce an executive order during a special session,” said Emily Nauman, director of Legislative Legal Services, the legal department for Alaska’s legislative branch.
Because the House and Senate’s presiding officers returned the order to the governor without taking action, “the governor is asserting that he will give effect to the executive order because it was not specifically rejected or disapproved by the legislature, thus causing a conflict in the interpretation of the Constitution between the Legislature and executive branch.”
Rep. Louise Stutes, R-Kodiak, voted in favor of authorizing the Legislature to prepare and, if necessary, file a pre-emptive lawsuit to keep the governor from enacting the executive order.
“It’s just a question, to me, of, we said, ‘No. Don’t you understand what no means?’”
Rep. Calvin Schrage, I-Anchorage, also voted in favor of moving forward with a lawsuit. He said that while there is still time for the governor to back away from his position, “I really see it as our prerogative to protect ourselves procedurally, and for us to do that, I believe we need to file litigation.”
The two votes against Wednesday’s proposal came from Reps. Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, and Mike Prax, R-North Pole.
Prax said he feels as if it could set a precedent that could allow lawmakers to disapprove of a future governor’s actions in a “more urgent” situation by simply not taking action.
“We would establish a precedent that the Legislature can do something by doing nothing, and that just does not seem like a very good practice to have established for any organization,” Prax said.
Sen. Jesse Kiehl, D-Juneau, said he doesn’t think that’s a correct interpretation of the lawsuit.
“With great respect to Representative Prax, no one is asserting here that the Legislature may act by inaction. What is before us is the question of whether the second shot at an executive order came in a way that the Constitution allows. I am convinced it did not.”
Kopp said he believes the governor may be prepared to change course on his executive action, and he’s reluctant to approve a lawsuit unless the governor attempts to take action and actually create the department.
“I would like to see us not initiate this until there’s some overt action by the administration that clearly indicates their intent to move unilaterally on this issue outside of the legislative process,” he said.
As of Friday, there was no estimate as to when a lawsuit might be filed.
Under the Alaska Constitution, the executive branch may not sue the legislative branch. Lawsuits by the Legislature against the governor are rare; this would be the fourth against Dunleavy during his two terms in office beginning in 2018. 
In 2019, lawmakers sued the governor over a school funding issue. The governor won that case in the Alaska Supreme Court. The following year, legislators sued Dunleavy over their failure to consider some of his appointees during the COVID-19 pandemic emergency. The Alaska Supreme Court again ruled in Dunleavy’s favor.
In 2022, lawmakers filed a ‘friendly’ lawsuit against the governor in a dispute over the proper handling of oil and gas tax settlements. That dispute, which dates to the administration of Gov. Bill Walker, has yet to be decided by the Alaska Supreme Court.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/20250519_092422-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-09-15 10:57:08.861233

When the ambulance doors opened Mike Lovecchio watched as one of his former students stepped out.
The student had graduated just weeks earlier and already had a job with Beaufort County Emergency Services as an emergency medical technician. He’d earned his certification his senior year and was able to walk into a career with a $60,000 starting salary.

As South Carolina’s governor’s race heats up, these are the types of programs gubernatorial candidates have called for on the campaign trail.
It’s a familiar refrain among the state’s political leadership dating back at least two decades. It’s also something state law already requires school districts to offer, though the opportunities available vary from one school district to the next.
A ‘pathway to success’
In announcing her run for the Governor’s Mansion last month, U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., told supporters she would push to create two tracks for high school students — one for the traditional student who is going to go on to a two-year or four-year degree and a second, if a student isn’t going to college, that certifies them in a vocation.
“Whether that’s plumbing, carpentry, as an electrician or a welder or getting their (commercial drivers license) or getting their cosmetology degree,” Mace said. “If you are certified in a trade and you are ready for work the day after you graduate from high school, you should be qualified to get a high school diploma equivalent to your vocational training and certification.”
But a 2005 law, known as the Education and Economic Development Act, already requires public school districts to help students identify career interests as early as middle school. Those students then enter high school with a four-year plan designed to prepare them for college or a particular job. That plan is meant to include job-training opportunities, such as internships.
Business groups tout tax credit as way to expand high-paying job opportunities in SC

By 2007, every high school was supposed to offer courses clustered around at least three different careers.
Even so, funding cuts amid the Great Recession meant even requirements for a guidance counselor in every school weren’t fully funded until 2016. The special commission formed to monitor these efforts had been dissolved for several years by that time.
“South Carolina has long been focused on preparing students for their personal post-secondary pathway to success, whether that be college, career, or the military,” according to a statement from the state Department of Education.
Graduating with credentials
More and more, schools are doing this through what is known as career and technical education, according to the K-12 education agency. Those students who complete an area of study graduate with a series of certifications that, in some career fields, can immediately land them a job.
For the 2018-19 school year, just over 19,000 students earned a nationally or state-recognized credential. By the 2023-24 school year, that number more than doubled to over 48,000 students statewide.
Still, courses of study and job-training opportunities can be lacking, especially at small rural high schools that can’t afford a wide variety.
Here’s how many are graduating from SC colleges with in-demand degrees. It’s not enough.

For example large, county-wide school districts in the major metro areas around Charleston and Myrtle Beach both had more than 1,000 students complete certifications last school year. In Greenville County, that number topped 2,500 students, according to report cards issued by the state.
Each district had 13 to 14 so-called career clusters for students to choose from representing between 25 and 50 different jobs, the district’s websites show.
But rural districts in Bamberg, Marion and Fairfield counties had fewer than 100 students earn certificates. Each district had seven clusters or less, representing about 10 jobs.
Paying off
According to the Education Department, the state is revamping its certification efforts to “ensure students aren’t just earning credentials, they’re earning the right ones: credentials that lead directly to high-demand careers where skilled workers are needed most in South Carolina.”
A student may earn a  CPR certification in 10th grade, certified nursing assistant credential by graduation and then pursue a practical nursing degree at one of the state’s technical schools, the agency gives as an example.
“Each step builds on the last, opening doors for students and giving employers candidates who are ready to contribute right away,” according to the agency.
It’s something Lovecchio said he’s already been doing at his academy teaching students in the state’s two the southernmost counties.
High school juniors and seniors enrolled in the program all start out earning more general certifications, such as the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s main workplace safety certification. Then students can pick from four career clusters representing 13 different jobs to earn more specialized credentials.
Those that complete their programs can graduate high school as licensed cosmetologists, licensed welders, ServSafe certified restaurant managers and more, Lovecchio said.
The effort pays off.
Lovecchio has two seniors in his automotive collision repair program who already have standing job offers with Boeing in North Charleston after they graduate. The summer after their junior year, the aerospace giant accepted the two into paid internships in its paint shop, even covering their housing costs for the roughly three months they were working there.

In the tourism-heavy counties of Beaufort and Jasper, which include vacation destinations such as Hilton Head, culinary workers and cosmetologists are in high demand to work at the area’s upscale resorts and restaurants.
And students in the marine tech program often get snatched up to work part time at the marinas while they’re pursuing their certifications.
Lovecchio said, even with the high cost of living in these coastal communities, students with these certifications can earn a livable starting wage without the worry of having to pay back a student loan.
And those that do choose to go on to college have a skill set they can fall back on or use to earn extra cash.
“If plan A goes wrong, you have a plan B,” he said.
Popular programs
One of the most popular certifications statewide is in the auto repair industry. Those that earn their automotive credentials are sought out by car dealerships to work in their shops, often changing oil and tires to start, said Courtney Kenyon of the S.C. Auto Dealers Association.
The auto dealers have even built on the effort with programs of their own.
Like many industries following the COVID-19 pandemic, dealerships were struggling to find enough workers.
The organization had long offered scholarship programs for students pursuing a technical college degree. Then, in 2022, the group took it a step further with its Auto Tech Development Program, Kenyon said.
Participants who sign on for the two-year program can land a paid apprenticeship with dealerships around the state, earning certifications with each of the major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Toyota and Nissan. The auto dealers also supply these students with the tool sets they need, supplies that can cost upwards of $10,000.
Since the program’s start, the auto dealers have signed on 125 apprentices. And the organization has about 250 more young technicians in the queue to participate, Kenyon said.
The homebuilding industry also places a lot of weight on the certifications high schoolers can earn in areas like heating and cooling, plumbing and electric, said Home Builders Association of South Carolina President Mark Nix.

While graduating with these credentials already in hand gives students a leg up, Nix added that the construction industry also offers on-the-job training with paid apprenticeships shadowing a licensed plumber or electrician, all without the need for a college degree.
The fast-growing industry has such a strong need for workers “no one is going to turn away anyone who wants to learn,” Nix said.
State testing
While the availability of these specialized certification programs differ from district to district, the state does test all high school juniors in the state for career readiness. Through that test, students can earn a certificate to take to potential employers.
Starting with the class of 2015, South Carolina replaced its high school exit exam with these career readiness tests, pitched as being more useful to students’ future success.
When then Gov. Nikki Haley signed the law ending the states three-decade-old exit exam requirement to graduate, supporters said students would be able to list their career ready scores on work resumes or college admissions applications.
In the test’s first year, about 88% of South Carolina’s 11th-graders scored high enough to earn certificates.
The state continues to administer the test, though it has since switched to a different testing company. Last year, 55% of high school seniors graduated with a career readiness credential.
Under that test, designed by WIN Learning, students who score at least a Level 3 earn a credential. A Level 3 indicates students have the skills necessary to pursue about 59% of jobs listed by the U.S. Department of Labor.
Those positions include bookkeepers, dental assistants, firefighters, correctional officers, machinists, medical assistants, message therapists and pharmacy technicians. While the credential shows these students may have an aptitude, many jobs on the list require extra licenses and certificates.
Students are tested in four areas: math, reading, the ability to analyze data in charts and diagrams, and soft skills such as effective communication, promoting teamwork and thinking critically, according to the WIN website.
Some employers also use the test as a way to pre-screen job applicants for entry level positions.
Tire-maker Michelin requires it for its Lexington County plant, job listings show. And contractors operating the Savannah River Nuclear Site near Aiken also announced in February it would be using the test for certain, unnamed jobs.
Still, the prevalence of the test has faded.
Ready SC, an arm of the technical college system that runs worker trainings and hiring events for large companies opening operations in the state, said major manufacturers used to ask for the test more often. However, many have shifted away from it the last couple years, spokeswoman Kelly Steinhilper said.

Meanwhile, a referendum campaign seeking to repeal the map got a major financial boost over the weekend — a $500,000 donation from a national dark-money organization. 
And a lawsuit filed last week by the Missouri NAACP claiming the governor illegally called lawmakers into a special legislative session to pass the map is scheduled for a hearing Monday afternoon in Cole County Court.
The all-out assault on the congressional map in the courtroom and ballot box is the next phase of the ugly partisan war that’s raged in Missouri for weeks — with Republicans determined to follow President Trump’s instructions to create a new GOP district before the 2026 midterms and Democrats denouncing the move as an unconstitutional power grab.

Both of the lawsuits filed after the map passed Friday — one in Jackson County and the other in Cole County — argue the Missouri Constitution prohibits the legislature from redrawing congressional districts more than once a decade. 
“In a blatant illegal and unconstitutional power grab, the governor bowed to the whims of Washington while sacrificing representation in both urban and rural populations of Missouri,” said Gillian Wilcox, director of litigation for the ACLU of Missouri, which is representing plaintiffs in the Jackson County lawsuit. 
Missouri has eight congressional districts, with six currently represented by Republicans. 
The 5th District, based in Kansas City and represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver since 2005, is carved up under the new map with portions attached to the 4th and 6th Districts. Heavily Republican areas stretching along the Missouri River to Boone County would be added to the remaining Kansas City portions.
The intended result is a map where Republicans hold seven of the state’s eight seats. 
Revising congressional district lines occurs every 10 years, after the allocation of seats following the federal census. The Missouri Constitution mandates it but is silent on whether lawmakers have the power to do so at other times, and the lawsuits challenging the map point to the lack of any mention of mid-decade redistricting as evidence that it is not permitted. 
Republican lawmakers dismissed these arguments as they were approving the maps, saying this type of interpretation of the constitution would leave lawmakers unable to make any adjustments in between censuses, even if ordered by a court.
The last time lines were redrawn between censuses in Missouri was in the 1960s, following the 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision that districts had to be drawn as closely as possible in population to preserve equal representation, known as the one person, one vote decision.
 Referendum

A group called People NOT Politicians Missouri attempted to file a citizen referendum on Friday shortly after the new map cleared the state Senate. The goal is to put the map on the 2026 ballot for voters to decide whether or not to implement it. 
But the group’s attempt to get its campaign started — they must collect 100,000 signatures in 90 days to put the map on the November 2026 ballot — ran into an administrative hurdle when the secretary of state’s office refused to certify it until the governor signs the bill into law. 
Kehoe has 45 days to sign the bill. 
Over the weekend, however, the secretary of state’s office slightly backtracked, sending a letter to People NOT Politicians Missouri explaining that it would begin the process of certifying the referendum petition sample sheet that would be used to gather signatures. 
The office has sent a copy to the Missouri Attorney General’s Office for legal review and the State Auditor for preparation of a cost estimate. 
“Only after the Attorney General has rendered an opinion on legal sufficiency and the secretary of state has reviewed those comments can this office make a final determination regarding the approval or rejection of the form of the petition,” the letter states. 
The secretary of state, the letter added, “has not yet made a final determination whether your referendum petition may be accepted for processing or circulation.”
Protesters gather in the Missouri Capitol rotunda in opposition to a proposed congressional district map that passed the House (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
In 2019, the secretary of state’s office used procedural maneuvers to derail a referendum campaign that sought to overturn newly-passed restrictions on abortion. The move sparked a lawsuit, and in 2022 the Missouri Supreme Court ruled the laws the secretary of state used to obstruct the citizen-initiated referendum process were unconstitutional.
A spokeswoman for Secretary of State Denny Hoskins agreed on Friday that the 2022 court ruling means signatures can be counted as valid even if they are collected prior to the certification of a ballot title, “since otherwise the full process could eat up over half of their available gathering time.”
On Saturday, the political action committee supporting the referendum received a $500,000 check from Global Impact Social Welfare Fund, a 501c4 nonprofit that is not required to disclose its donors. 
Based in Washington, D.C., Global Impact Social Welfare Fund is a liberal advocacy organization that has spent millions in support of ballot initiatives across the country. Last year, the group donated more than $1 million to the successful campaign to enshrine abortion rights in Missouri’s constitution. 
In addition to the gerrymandered congressional map, Republican lawmakers also approved a proposal to require any changes to the state constitution through the initiative petition process to be approved by a majority of voters statewide and in each of the state’s eight congressional districts. 
Based on last year’s election results, that change would mean as few as 5% of voters could defeat any ballot measure. The new requirements would only apply to citizen-led initiative petitions, not amendments placed on the ballot by the legislature.
GOP lawmakers pointed specifically at last year’s abortion amendment — and the campaign contributions of out-of-state advocacy organizations like Global  Impact Social Welfare Fund — to justify the change. 
A referendum was last deployed in Missouri seven years ago, when labor unions collected 300,000 signatures in 90 days — more than three times the amount required — to put a question on the statewide ballot repealing a GOP-backed right-to-work law.
The repeal push was ultimately successful, with 67% of voters rejecting the right-to-work law. In fact, of the 27 times a referendum has been placed on the ballot, voters have rejected actions by the General Assembly all but twice.
The AFL-CIO, which led the 2018 referendum campaign, has indicated it will support the push to put the congressional map on the ballot next year. Over the weekend, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union donated $50,000 to People NOT Politicians Missouri for the campaign. 
Elsa Rainey, a spokeswoman for People NOT Politicians Missouri, called Missouri’s new map “an unconstitutional power grab” and a “blatant attempt to rig the 2026 elections before a single vote is cast.”
“It violates Missouri law,” she said, “slices apart communities and strikes at the core of our democratic system.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/091025_rally2-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-09-15 09:56:13.809369

Such efforts have recently drawn interest from a politically-diverse group of figures such as Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont as well as Republican President Donald J. Trump and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, all of whom view natural gas as a way of reducing the region’s cost-of-energy burden.
Opponents, meanwhile, argue that building a new pipeline will only worsen pollution and the release of climate-altering greenhouse gases, while doing little to bring down prices.
 What is the Constitution Pipeline?

The Constitution Pipeline is being developed by Williams Companies, a large operator of pipelines across the United States. The pipeline would have the ability to carry up to 650 million cubic feet of gas a day, according to the company, enough to serve about 3 million homes.
Williams first received federal approvals to build the pipeline more than a decade ago, but the project hit a snag when the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation declined to issue a water quality permit in 2016.
The project continued to languish until the developers resubmitted applications to state and federal regulators earlier this year.
“Williams remains committed to advancing the Constitution Pipeline project and has submitted permit applications,” to regulators in New York and Pennsylvania, the company said in a statement this month. “We are also continuing to work with the states, Congress, and the Administration to strengthen U.S. energy markets, lower costs for American families, and support long-term economic growth.”
Pending those approvals, Williams estimates that the pipeline should begin construction next year and enter service near the end of 2027.
 Is Connecticut involved?

While the Constitution Pipeline itself will not carry gas into Connecticut, its terminus in New York will link up with two existing pipelines — the Tennessee and Iroquois systems — that serve both the state and the wider region.
Those pipelines already operate at or near capacity, officials say, creating a supply bottleneck particularly during winter months when gas is used to both heat homes and fuel the power plants that produce the bulk of the region’s electricity.
In order to reduce that bottleneck, pipeline operators in Connecticut are pursuing their own expansion projects.
Iroquois pipeline’s owners, for example, are seeking to build a series of compressors that would push an additional 125 million cubic feet of gas through the each day, an increase of 8.3% over its existing capacity. Meanwhile, Canadian energy company Enbridge has its own plans to expand its regional pipeline, the Algonquin, by 2029.
Carolina Kulbeth, a spokesperson for Tennessee Pipeline operator Kinder Morgan, said in a statement that expanding pipeline capacity is “critical” to eliminating existing constraints on gas supply.
“New pipeline infrastructure is the only way to ensure reliability and affordability in the New England region, as demand continues to rise among residential, commercial, and industrial customers,” Kulbeth said.
Trump himself has touted the pipeline’s benefits, saying that it would lower energy prices by up to $5,000 per family in the Northeast — figures that critics say are wildly inflated.
“I can tell you Connecticut wants it and all of New England wants it,” Trump said in March. “And who wouldn’t it?”
 What does it have to do with wind?

In May, the Wall Street Journal reported that the resurrection of the Constitution Pipeline was linked to negotiations between the Trump administration and New York over the fate of another project, Empire Wind.
Federal authorities had pulled permits for the wind project in April, only to reverse course around the same time that Williams resubmitted its pipeline applications.
While New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has denied making any explicit promises to approve the pipeline, she has expressed a willingness to work with the administration and developers on unnamed “new energy projects” that comply with state law.
Lamont, however, has strongly suggested that the two projects are intertwined.
After the Trump administration last week ordered a halt in construction on another wind project being staged in New London, Lamont expressed surprise at the decision given his prior support for the development of new pipelines.
“We’re already having very productive conversations with Williams pipeline company and [the secretaries] of Energy and Interior regarding how we can get additional sources of power here to this region, including American natural gas,” Lamont said. “So I don’t think there’s a conflict there.”
 What do opponents say?

Critics of pipeline expansion argue that projects such as Constitution are at odds with the commitments made by local elected officials to slowly wean the region off of its reliance on fossil fuels. Connecticut, for example, has laws pledging to get all of the state’s power needs from carbon-free sources no later than 2040 and achieving economy-wide net-zero emissions 10 years after that.
In addition, they point to the region’s already sky-high energy prices to argue that importing more natural gas is not an effective solution.
“This is not about what’s better for the climate, or air or energy costs,” said Samantha Dynowski, the Connecticut state director for the Sierra Club. “This is about, you know, Trump’s buddies, his fossil fuel buddies.”
During his presidential campaign last year, Trump pledged to ease environmental restrictions and approve new drilling, pipeline and other fossil fuel projects. At the same time, he attempted to solicit $1 billion in campaign donations from the oil and gas industry.
Pipeline projects such as the Iroquois and Algonquin expansion projects have also faced local opposition in Connecticut, particularly in Brookfield where residents have complained about plans to build a new compressor station in close proximity to a middle school.
The Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection announced its tentative approval of the compressor on July 31.

Beginning Dec. 4, 2025, residents can use a Transfer on Death (TOD) deed to leave real estate directly to chosen beneficiaries—without the delays, expense, or uncertainty of probate.
“This is a major victory for Delaware families,” said Mike Kozikowski, New Castle County Recorder of Deeds. “With the new Transfer on Death Act, you can designate a beneficiary for your home or other real estate, and when you pass, that property goes directly to them without having to go through probate. That means no waiting, no legal fees, and no question about who owns the property.”
Kozikowski highlighted the breakthrough as a featured guest on “A Better Discussion,” a weekly webcast of A Better Delaware hosted by former state attorney general M. Jane Brady. “We are now the 34th state to have this option,” he said. “It’s a simple document that can spare loved ones months or even years of legal headaches.”
How TOD Works
The law—House Bill 147, Substitute 1—creates a legal document called a Transfer on Death deed. Homeowners can record a TOD deed naming one or more beneficiaries. Upon the owner’s death, title to the property automatically transfers to those beneficiaries, bypassing probate altogether.
“You still control your property,” Kozikowski explained. “You can sell it, refinance it, even revoke the TOD deed at any time. The beneficiary has no rights until you pass. It’s revocable, it’s flexible, and it protects your loved ones.”
To be valid, the deed must:


Name the beneficiary or beneficiaries.


State that the transfer takes effect at the owner’s death.


Be signed before two independent witnesses who are not beneficiaries.


Be notarized and recorded with the Recorder of Deeds before the owner dies.


A Lifeline for Families Without Wills
Kozikowski said the new law is especially valuable for families who do not have a will. “When the AARP did their study, they found that a large segment of Black, Hispanic and low-income white homeowners never filed a will,” he said. “This law helps those families keep their property intact and out of a lengthy probate proceeding. Instead of getting only a percentage of what’s left after probate, the beneficiary receives the full property right away.”
Timing and Cautions
Although the bill was signed by Gov. John Carney on Sept. 5, it includes a 90-day implementation period, making Dec. 4 the first day TOD deeds can be recorded. “If someone is terminally ill and wants to act right away, I recommend they meet with an attorney and prepare a will,” Kozikowski advised. “A TOD deed filed before that date will not be valid if the person passes before December 4.”
He also noted that a TOD deed will override any conflicting instructions in a will once it is in effect. “The Transfer on Death deed supersedes a will because it takes effect immediately upon death,” Kozikowski said.
Part of a Broader Modernization
The TOD legislation caps more than two decades of modernization under Kozikowski. Since taking office in 2002, he has expanded electronic recording—now used for about 70 percent of documents—added online access to deeds and mortgages, and created educational videos explaining the recording process.
“Our job is to receive, record, process and deliver documents that protect property rights,” he said. “Whether it’s new technology or new legislation, everything we do is about customer service and making life easier for the public.”
Where to Learn More
Property owners can find information, sample TOD forms and recording instructions at NCCDE.org or by contacting the New Castle County Recorder of Deeds office.
“This is all about giving people control,” Kozikowski said. “If you’ve worked hard to own your home, you should have a simple, cost-effective way to pass it on to the people you love—without letting the courts decide.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-14-194931.jpg,,,2025-09-15 09:56:13.809369

This story was originally reported by Grace Panetta of The 19th.  Meet Grace and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
The divisions in American politics are usually obvious, often nowhere more than in the House of Representatives. But there are also glimmers of bipartisanship, and, lately, many of those have been driven by women.
At the start of this year, Reps. Brittany Pettersen, a Democrat, and Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican, united forces to challenge House leadership with a push to make the House friendlier for new mothers. In the past few weeks, three of the most outspoken House Republican women broke ranks with their party — and bucked President Donald Trump — in an effort to release more files related to the case of the late disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
And this week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers led by Republican Rep. Kat Cammack of Florida and Democratic Rep. Sydney Kamlager-Dove of California came together on a House resolution calling for expanded early screening for Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APS), a blood-clotting disorder that can cause miscarriages and stillbirths in pregnant people.
They credited their cooperation to singer Christina Perri, who learned she had APS after losing her daughter Rosie late in pregnancy in 2020. Perri is now channeling her grief into advocacy. She said in an interview that it was “a privilege” to see lawmakers like Kamlager-Dove and Cammack putting their party affiliations to the side and uniting on an issue so important to her.
“What matters is that we’re women, we’re moms, we just want other women and moms to be okay,” she said. “And I find that really inspiring at a time where everything is just so messy, and I feel grateful to be a part of something like this.”
Women make up half of the U.S. population but hold just 28 percent of seats in Congress. Research has not backed up the notion that women lawmakers are, overall, more bipartisan than men at the federal level. But select instances so far in this Congress show how unlikely coalitions of women lawmakers have united across party lines, challenged party leadership or both.
A major news conference at the Capitol with Epstein survivors last week yielded what four years ago would have been an all but unthinkable scene: Rep. Ro Khanna of California, a progressive Democrat, defending and embracing Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a conservative firebrand and staunch Trump ally.
“She has shown so much courage on this issue, so much leadership,” Khanna said of Greene, who was met with an uneven reception by the crowd. “I saw some people, when I was coming here, calling her names. We’ve got to stop that. We’ve got to stop the partisanship on this issue.”
Khanna and Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky are attempting to force a House floor vote on the Epstein files resolution with a procedural measure known as a discharge petition, which enables members to circumvent House leadership to get a measure to the floor. Every sitting House Democrat and just three Republicans other than Massie — Greene, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado and Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina — have signed the discharge petition, leaving it just one signature short of the 218 required to force a vote.










Never underestimate a woman. We all came here to do work. We all made promises, and some of us live up to them.


All three women have maintained their support for the measure despite fierce opposition from Trump and the White House. At the news conference, Massie called Greene “the bravest woman in Congress.” He also posed the question: “Where are the men?”
“Never underestimate a woman,” Boebert said at the Capitol on Tuesday. “We all came here to do work. We all made promises, and some of us live up to them.”
Shared experiences around pregnancy, childbirth and parenthood have united some House members to work across the aisle.
“I think I can say very candidly now, as a new mom, moms just know how to multitask and learn how to get things done,” said Cammack, who welcomed her daughter Auggie last month. “And that might be why you see more bipartisan efforts coming out of the women, even though we represent a minority in Congress.”
At Tuesday’s news conference, Kamlager-Dove, Cammack and Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman of Ohio all spoke about their experiences with pregnancy losses while building their families.
“What unites us is far deeper than what may appear on the surface,” Kamlager-Dove said. “Many of us share journeys to parenthood that are marked by hope, loss and eventually, resilience.”
Luna, the Florida Republican, and Pettersen, the Colorado Democrat, are also among the handful of House members to give birth while in office — and both missed votes after giving birth. They teamed up on a measure to allow new parents in the House to temporarily designate another member to vote for them, also known as proxy voting. House Speaker Mike Johnson vigorously opposed the effort, leading the duo to turn to a discharge petition. They succeeded in getting 218 votes on their discharge petition and overcame Johnson’s effort to quash the measure on the floor, temporarily grinding House business to a halt. Luna later struck a deal with Johnson, standing down on the proxy voting push in exchange for other concessions (Pettersen and other Democrats criticized the deal as insufficient).
Now, Luna is a member of another bipartisan coalition, this one backing a proposed ban on stock trading for members of Congress. Another member of the group, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a progressive Democrat, said at a September 3 news conference that, unlike in other legislative negotiations, lawmakers turned around a better product than the one they started with.
“It is one of those rare moments where I feel like Washington is working the way it’s supposed to work,” Ocasio-Cortez said. “And it feels foreign. And it feels alien … but I also think it is proof that things can work here.”
Women lawmakers “are better communicators,” Luna told The 19th while leaving House votes on Tuesday. At the September 3 stock trading ban news conference, she indicated she’s prepared to challenge House leadership again if necessary.
“I often feel like an adjudicator in this job,” she said. “And so I guess I’ll be the one to say that we’ve asked nicely for leadership to put this on the floor. If they don’t, I say timeline is end of month: There’s a discharge petition that is ready to go.”










It is one of those rare moments where I feel like Washington is working the way it’s supposed to work.


The most consequential legislation passed by Congress this year has been muscled through without Democratic support, and there have been plenty of moments of acrimony on the floor.
Much of it has been clearly gendered: On Wednesday, as the House considered its annual defense spending bill, Mace erupted at Rep. Sara Jacobs, a California Democrat, during debate over Mace’s proposed anti-transgender amendments to the legislation. Rep. Sarah McBride, a Delaware Democrat who this year became the first openly transgender lawmaker to serve in Congress, has faced repeated attacks and misgendering from some of her Republican colleagues.
High-profile but not expressly political public figures have, in many cases, been the catalysts for bipartisan congressional action.
Years of tireless lobbying by Paris Hilton led to Congress passing a bipartisan bill aimed at preventing child abuse and neglect in youth residential facilities last December. Engineer, author and science TV host Emily Calandrelli’s personal story of being hassled by TSA as a new parent led to the Senate and a House committee passing bipartisan legislation making it easier for parents to travel with breast milk and breastfeeding equipment through airport security. The legislation has not received a vote on the House floor.
And Epstein’s survivors, Khanna said, are “helping us come together as a country.”
“I’ve never done a press conference with Marjorie Taylor Greene before,” he joked at the September 3 news conference.
Both Cammack and Kamlager-Dove credited Perri with using her platform to raise awareness about APS — and bringing them together on a mission to promote the adoption of what they said is a simple test that could spare so many the heartache of pregnancy loss.
“We bonded over a common story of having a miscarriage and wanting answers to questions that were not easy to come by,” Kamlager-Dove said.
“Without her advocacy, without her courage to come forward, this wouldn’t be happening, and so she has been the driver in really bringing us together to make this a reality,” Cammack said.
Cammack said she’s “very confident” about the resolution on APS testing moving forward and getting a vote on the House floor. Perri said the measure’s passing would be “a win for everybody,” and a victory “that feels kind of rare right now.”
“My hope and goal is to have this changed forever, for women to not need to even know about it,” she said. “But until then, I will always speak about it, and I will help move the needle forward.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/uscapitolmiranda_0-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-09-15 09:56:13.809369

The California Legislature’s long, busy and contentious session drew to a close this weekend. Here’s what you need to know: 

Lawmakers delivered Gov. Gavin Newsom one of the most sweeping overhauls of California’s energy and climate policies in decades. The six-bill package that passed over the weekend was framed as a way to ease gas and electricity bills while preserving the state’s signature climate programs. “Ratepayers are expected to get some relief through measures to cut the cost of building transmission lines, and an expanded cap-and-trade energy credit aimed at blunting rising energy bills,” Alejandro Lazo and Jeanne Kuang report. 


Lawmakers paved the way for a building boom near transit stations in many of the state’s most populous areas. The new bill overrides local development decisions, allowing apartment developers to construct residential buildings as tall as 75 feet regardless of local zoning maps or outcry. “In a legislative year teeming with controversial housing bills designed to kick-start more construction in California,” Ben Christopher writes, this new bill “has been among the most controversial.” Like the energy package, Newsom is expected to sign the legislation into law.


The effort to regulate when AI makes consequential decisions about your life will have to wait yet another year. The three-year-old campaign would have required businesses and government agencies to tell you when AI is used to make important decisions about you, such as housing approvals, school admissions, hiring and firing and a host of other decision on things like health, criminal justice, government benefits and others. Khari Johnson reports that while California has passed more AI regulation than any other state, the European Union and Colorado have already passed these kinds of disclosure laws. 

The Legislature is now out of session until January.

Some 75,000 homes remain standing where the Eaton and Palisades fires left so much destruction. While they appear safe, they are embedded with toxic residue that can make you seriously sick, writes Nicole Kolinsky, the executive director of the Coalition for Insurance Accountability. Yet insurers are telling families it is safe to reinhabit the homes, she says.
