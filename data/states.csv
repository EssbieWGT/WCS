(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)It’s pumpkin season – from spiced lattes to Halloween decorations on the porch – and chances are it was grown in Illinois.
Just over a third of all pumpkins in the United States – 485 million pounds – come from Illinois, according to annual USDA surveys.
Much of that production centers on Morton, a village in Tazewell County that proudly calls itself the “Pumpkin Capital of the World.” About 85% of the world’s canned pumpkin is packed at the Nestlé/Libby’s plant in the middle of town.
Indiana ranks second in production, but Illinois grows roughly three times as many pumpkins, even after its production fell by 30% last year. That decline came even though the harvested acres remained steady; acreage had already dropped by nearly 18% in 2023 compared to the previous year.
Despite their hard exterior, pumpkins are highly susceptible to adverse weather conditions.
Depending on the location, farmers typically begin planting between late May and early July, allowing the pumpkins approximately four months to mature for a fall harvest.
A late spring frost can wipe out young plants before they have a chance to take root. At the same time, extreme summer heat can cause blossoms to fall before they are pollinated, according to a 2024 publication from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). Excessive rainfall can also delay planting in spring or harvesting in autumn, and leave crops more vulnerable to disease.
According to USDA Economic Research Service data, Illinois not only leads the nation in pumpkin production acreage but also devotes most of its fields to processing varieties, the kind used in pies and canned filling.
Nearly 70% of Illinois’ pumpkin acres are dedicated to pie filling and other processing uses, compared with just 3% in Pennsylvania and even less in Washington, Indiana, and California. This focus helps explain why Illinois outpaces other states in both yield and price.
Other states are catching up, though. In 2024, New York, Wisconsin and Michigan reported the most significant gains, with production increasing by 49%, 43%, and 33%, respectively.

This story was originally reported by Mel Leonor Barclay and Jasmine Mithani of The 19th. Meet Mel  and Jasmine and read more of their reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Nonprofits working to combat domestic violence and sexual assault have notched a string of legal wins as they push back against efforts by the Trump administration to put restrictions on work that goes against the administration’s views.
A series of lawsuits has, at least temporarily, blocked the administration from enforcing restrictions on millions of dollars of funding for upcoming grants and forced it to return grants it took away from some nonprofits working with LGBTQ+ victims.
Domestic violence groups and the broader network of gender-based violence nonprofits have been on high alert since the Trump administration issued a series of executive orders — followed by a temporary federal freeze in late January — to end federal funding for programs or organizations out of step with the administration’s ideology. The funding, advocates say, is essential to providing life-saving services to vulnerable victims, who are more likely to be women.

Through agency rules, the administration is actively trying to restrict the use of federal grants to fund what it calls “illegal” diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility activities and “gender ideology extremism.” It is also trying to restrict federal grants from organizations that in any way express support for abortion and that serve immigrants without permanent legal status in the country.
The restrictions go even further: Nonprofits that want to continue to receive federal funding from the Office on Violence Against Women, part of the U.S. Department of Justice, are not allowed to “frame domestic violence or sexual assault as systemic social justice issues rather than criminal offenses.”
Trump, who has been found liable for sexual assault, last month downplayed the seriousness of domestic violence crimes in a speech. “If a man has a little fight with the wife, they say this was a crime,” Trump said.

The lawsuits

In June, 17 state-level coalitions that support victims of domestic and sexual violence, represented by Democracy Forward and the National Women’s Law Center, sued the administration over such restrictions on Violence Against Women Act grants awarded by the Justice Department. The following month, in a separate lawsuit filed by Democracy Forward, many of the same state coalitions sued over similar rules attached to grants from the departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
In early August, Judge William Smith of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island issued a preliminary injunction blocking the administration from enforcing the new restrictions on Justice Department grants as the case progresses.
The judge agreed that the nonprofits face an impossible choice between accepting conditions that will harm the core services they provide or going without essential funding. The judge cited two examples: Complying with the rules would bar the organizations from providing the same quality of services to transgender victims and could also prevent organizations counseling victims from doing anything other than calling law enforcement.
“These examples are simply two of many activities that the coalitions engage in that they reasonably fear will now subject them to loss of grant funding,” Smith wrote. “The Office’s assurances that … the office will be reasonable in its interpretation of the conditions is cold comfort.”
A similar preliminary injunction came down in mid-October in the HHS and HUD case, blocking the rollout of restrictions on those agencies’ grants as the case continues. In her ruling, District Judge Melissa DuBose, also of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, said the administration didn’t provide a “satisfactory explanation” the new slew of restrictions, finding that Trump officials “engaged in a baseless and arbitrary process” that didn’t consider the “harmful impact their decision would have on the coalitions and the vulnerable populations they serve.”
Litigation in both cases will likely stretch into 2026.
Advocates against domestic violence and sexual assault celebrated the two rulings, which are part of a broader effort that also includes challenges to rules trying to strip funding from groups that work with LGBTQ+ and immigrant victims.
“This injunction provides immediate relief to survivors, and it allows us and our programs to continue our life-saving work without the threat of restrictive, harmful policies that would have undermined our ability to support those who need it most,” Mike Waterloo of the Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence said of the August ruling.
“This is not a permanent solution, and we still have work to do.”
A coalition of states working with Democracy Forward called the ruling on health and housing grants “a relief and a win that gives us breathing room to continue this vital work.”

LGBTQ+ victims

One of the Trump administration’s first targets was funding that supported groups working with LGBTQ+ people. Lambda Legal, an LGBTQ+ civil rights advocacy group, helmed an early lawsuit on behalf of nine nonprofits that receive federal funding, several working in the intimate partner violence field.
The organizations argue that the Trump administration’s executive orders, including the order calling for the end of federal funding for activities that promote “gender ideology extremism,” amount to “an existential threat to transgender people.” Forcing the organizations to comply violates the groups’ free speech, due process and equal protection rights, they say.
In June, a federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a preliminary injunction in the case that favored the nonprofits, saying that their case was likely to succeed in court. The judge’s ruling reinstated canceled grants and voided instructions hindering new applications and instructions for funding, including one from the Office of Violence Against Women stating that “that no LGBTQ+ related content should be submitted.”
The administration appealed the decision to the U.S Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in August. The case continues to move through the courts.
LGBTQ+ Americans, with the exception of gay men, are more likely to have experienced domestic violence, partner abuse or dating violence than cisgender and heterosexual people. Queer women are significantly more likely to have experienced intimate partner violence in their lifetime than straight women, according to an analysis of federal survey data by the Human Rights Campaign. Fifty-four percent of respondents to the 2015 U.S. Trans Survey said they have experienced intimate partner violence, and 47 percent reported being sexually assaulted.
FORGE, one of the plaintiffs, is among the only organizations in the country focused specifically on transgender victims of violence. The 30-year-old organization relies on federal grants for 90 percent of its funding.

Legal services for immigrant victims
 

A coalition of Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit in early October challenging a new rule from the Justice Department that could restrict the use of federal grants to pay for legal services for immigrant victims of domestic and sexual violence.
The upcoming rule says states and the local nonprofits they fund are barred from providing some legal services to survivors who don’t have legal status to be in the country. The lawsuit argues that the Violence Against Women Act — which authorized a part of the funding in question — includes a broad list of allowable legal services that include divorce, parental rights, child support, employment-related lawsuits, housing, civil rights and more.
The Justice Department’s new rule does allow states to pay for restraining and custody orders, legal action dealing with human trafficking and legal services to obtain U and T visas, as required by other laws.
The states argue that it’s unclear how exactly they and the organizations that use the funding will be able to comply with the order: Which immigrants are restricted? What legal services are not allowed?
They also argue that the order would force them to violate the law, including the Violence Against Women Act, which says that services for victims are “not dependent on the victim’s immigration status.”
“With this cruel attempt to dictate which survivors deserve access to legal supports, DOJ is endangering families, silencing survivors, and threatening public safety. I will not stand idly by while the federal government unjustly attacks people seeking protection from violence,” said New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose office is taking the lead on the lawsuit. (James, who has led more than a dozen lawsuits against the Trump administration, is a political target of Trump; the president’s Justice Department is pursuing federal mortgage fraud charges against James related to a house she owns in Virginia.)
“We are asking the court to block this illegal rule before it takes effect, immeasurably harming survivors.”
The administration notified states of the new rule in August. It is expected to take effect in November.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Domestic-violence-nonprofit-illustration-for-Oct-26-2025-story-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-10-26 08:16:43.929694

Let’s first work within our existing supervisory unions to not just “imagine” but create effective change that would serve everyone’s best interests
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Peggy Stevens: Act 73 needs to go back to the drawing board.","This commentary is by Peggy Stevens of Charleston.


Act 73 of 2025 “establishes a process for Vermont to transition to a reimagined system of public education” — that’s according to the state’s website explaining the law. The legislation is supposedly designed to streamline Vermont’s education system and alleviate the burden of education expenses on property tax payers.
I attended an informational meeting put on by the North Country Supervisory Union school board chair and superintendent in an effort to answer questions and concerns  community members have about the impacts of Act 73 in our supervisory union.
I came away astonished that this legislation was ever passed, especially by legislators who claim to be fiscally conservative. The bill has “reimagined” a funding system that is uncertain about what the ultimate cost will be. If you ask me, it is a pig in a poke, something that is bought or accepted without knowing its value or seeing it first.
The 17-page handout from the Joint Fiscal Office provided at the meeting included many “estimates” for various projected costs. There are instances of “unknown” and “yet to be determined” and “impact is unclear” in those 17 pages that could have severe unintended negative consequences for our schools and students, especially in rural Vermont. People need to know they were being sold an idea that makes it look like something is being done to help taxpayers when it can’t be proven! Many communities are actually likely to see an increase in taxes! So, potentially no gain and lots of pain
Of course, any piece of legislation cannot be absolutely certain what final costs may be, but this act seems to be chock full of uncertainty. Worse, in addition to financial repercussions, is the loss of local control. Our area schools will not have local boards and representation, in a school district potentially spanning from Canaan to Lowell to Glover that will have one school board of five to seven individuals chosen in “voting wards.” Folks will no longer vote on town school budgets, instead the boards of these “mega districts” will determine how the money is spent. 
I am sure there are many areas where education costs could be shared, streamlined and trimmed without leaving the future of our education funding system in jeopardy. Let’s first work within our existing supervisory unions to not just “imagine” but create effective change that would serve everyone’s best interests, especially our rural community schools, their students and teachers, and our taxpayers.
Talk to your legislators. Act 73 would best be repealed and brought back to the drawing board. We deserve a better process, and our students and taxpayers deserve a better future.

While President Donald Trump is demolishing the East Wing of the White House and no one is stopping him, there is a state law that prevents Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves from acting on his own to make major changes to the Governor’s Mansion. And to be clear, Gov. Reeves is not planning any major renovations to Mississippi’s version of the White House, though he does attempt to emulate President Trump.
This past week work began to remove, according to news reports, the entire East Wing of the White House – arguably the nation’s most recognizable building – to prepare for the construction of President Trump’s one big beautiful ballroom.
Who knew in America one person could tear down a portion of what we fondly called the people’s house and construct a massive structure that based on drawings will dwarf the original building and overwhelm the iconic White House grounds? For comparison, the original White House, situated on 18 acres, is 55,000 square feet while it is anticipated the ballroom will be 90,000 square feet.
Based on state law, one person cannot undertake similar activities to public buildings in Mississippi.

The guidelines established by the long-standing Antiquities Law of Mississippi govern work of many historic buildings in the state, including the Governor’s Mansion and the Capitol.
Under the law, any action involving “excavation, property transfer, excavation or ground disturbing activities of any nature, demolition or significant alteration” of a building or property designated as a Mississippi Landmark must be approved by the Department of Archives and History Board of Trustees. Mississippi landmarks could be state or local public buildings, including those found at education entities.
Granted, nearly every president makes changes to the White House. For instance, former President Barack Obama incorporated a basketball goal into the tennis court. And his wife, Michelle, had the nerve to add an organic vegetable garden.
Before Trump was inaugurated for his first term, conservative personality Ann Coulter posted on social media, “I respectfully suggest a new name for Michelle’s White House vegetable garden: ‘Putting green.’”
Trump already has made significant modifications to the White House, replacing one of its most legendary features – the Rose Garden – with a concrete patio. And he has incorporated enough gold features in the Oval Office to make envious Tony Montana, the drug-dealing kingpin in the movie “Scarface.”
Various groups, including the congressionally created National Trust for Historic Preservation and the Society of Architectural Historians, have urged a delay on the ballroom construction to gather more information and to allow input.
Who has been silent on the issue are congressional Republicans, including Mississippi U.S. Sens. Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde-Smith who previously served in the state Legislature where the Mississippi Antiquities Law was created. And Wicker was a vocal supporter of the designation of the Jackson home of civil rights leaders Medgar and Myrlie Evers as a national monument under the supervision of the National Park Service.
The National Capitol Planning Commission does have some authority over changes made to the White House. But Will Scharf, a Trump appointee and chair of the commission, said the president can do demolition at the White House on his own.

“Demolition and site preparation work can certainly occur, but if you’re talking about actually building anything, then, yeah, it should go through our approval process,” he said during an early September meeting, according to The Associated Press.
So, what does that mean? How much of the White House can the president demolish on his own? 
Scharf said there is nothing to worry about.
”Given the president’s history as a builder, and given the plans that we’ve seen publicly I think this will be a tremendous addition to the White House complex, a sorely needed addition,” he said.
Reports have said the ballroom will cost $250 million or more and private funds will be raised to pay for the structure.
Little else is known. If the funds are not raised, will Trump turn to Congress for taxpayer money to complete the project?
Or will he depend on Mexico to pay for it just as he said Mexico would pay for a border wall?
Incidentally, Trump is seeking money from American taxpayers to compensate himself for criminal investigations he has been subject to. He is asking for $230 million – almost enough to pay for one big beautiful ballroom.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/22140226/AP25295630685369-1.jpg,,,2025-10-26 07:16:31.680576

In a video called Investing In Place: Increasing the Impact of Land Conservation, a cartoonish red push pin hovers over a map of the United States, directing viewers to Norwich Farm, a small dairy operation along the border of Vermont and New Hampshire.
The scene here is quintessential New England. A red barn peeps out from snow while a few people in boots and barn coats crunch toward the barn’s big sliding door. Cows moo somewhere off screen. The camera pans to cheesemaker Chris Gray, his wife, and their five-year-old daughter, sandwiched between them, who calls herself “the cheese monster.” 
The family is at the center of a decade-long saga over a contested piece of farmland. The promotional video highlighted what appeared then to be a mutually beneficial partnership between a cheese maker, a state school, and a land trust headquartered in nearby New Hampshire. They were working together to conserve land and begin a new agricultural education program on a property called Norwich Farm. 
“I hope that Norwich Farms is a place that contributes to the wellbeing of the community as a whole,” Jeanie McIntyre, president of the Upper Valley Land Trust, the land conservation group involved in the partnership, said at the time.
Perhaps the fact that the promotional video was released on April Fool’s Day should have been a clue that the rosy vision would falter in the ensuing years. A decade and many media reports later, the Grays say the story of the partnership could end in the foreclosure of the farm and bankruptcy for their business. 
There were strong personalities on all sides, reluctant to compromise. There were millions of dollars at stake in beloved Vermont industries — agriculture and farming — which have continued to confront enormous losses. Today, the saga is reminiscent of parties trying to reclaim the narrative after a nasty break up. It’s also a singular example of how difficult it can be to sustainably finance a farm-based business without additional levers of support.
The land trust
The idea for the Upper Valley Land Trust came about in the 1980s. It evolved from a question that a pestering neighbor asked Dana Meadows, who became the first chair of the board of trustees of the land trust.


“How are we going to keep our farms in farming?” Meadows recalled the  neighbor asking in the trust’s 1987 annual report. 
Together with her community, Meadows thought community land trusts could be an answer, and in 1985, the land trust was born. 
Their goal was to keep agricultural land affordably in agriculture. Agreements between farmers and trusts could protect land and provide money or tax benefits to farmers in exchange for the sale of developmental rights and environmental protections. 
Land trusts around the country were originally formed to conserve land for the local community. Conservation was big federal business under President Theodore Roosevelt in the 20th century. Roosevelt launched land protections including the growth of the national parks system.

Things changed in the 1980s, when the federal government drastically scaled back its conservation of public lands. The gap was filled by land trusts and their donors, who receive federal tax incentives. Meanwhile, the global food system was shifting. International trade and technological innovation mutated U.S. farms, increasing consolidation and corporate control while access to affordable land decreased. 
More than 61 million acres have been conserved through land trusts across the U.S., according to the Land Trust Alliance, an advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. That includes more than 1.3 million acres conserved through dozens of active trusts in Vermont. They account for more than a fifth of the state’s total acreage. 
The scale of these operations vary. While town-based land trusts in Vermont, including ones in Charlotte, Richmond and South Hero, have protected hundreds of acres, massive national conservation groups like The Nature Conservancy and The Conservation Fund have protected hundreds of thousands. By far the biggest holder of state lands is the Vermont Land Trust, which has conserved more than 721,000 acres, according to the alliance, or more than a tenth of state land since 1977. 
The Upper Valley Land Trust falls somewhere in the middle of these groups in the size of its holdings. Based in Hanover, New Hampshire, the trust has conserved almost 35,000 acres in Vermont, according to the Land Trust Alliance, and almost 20,000 acres in the Granite State. In 2024, the Upper Valley Land Trust was worth more than $23 million in assets.
In the summer of 2015, the land trust paid $300,000 for 352 acres of farmland now called Brookmead Conservation Area in Norwich. The trust’s intent was to keep the Brookmead Conservation Area’s meadows and pastures conserved and to continue as a working farm, according to a 2018 brochure.
The trust bought the land from Vermont Technical College, which has since become Vermont State University. The land was donated to the college in 2015 by a millionaire named Andrew Sigler, a Dartmouth College graduate who had owned a forestry business, according to court records. Sigler bought the land from the Somerville family, once a Vermont Farm Bureau Farm Family of the Year. The property, where the family raised cows for generations, was the last remaining farm selling milk in Norwich. Before they sold it to the Siglers, it was called Brookmead Farm.

At the time, the trust persuaded the Norwich Conservation Commission, a local municipal group, to provide $30,000 to preserve the agricultural land for conservation and recreation, according to the trust’s request for assistance and subsequent emails. 
“Protection of this parcel will ensure that the land remains available for agricultural endeavors in the future,” with possible future site activities like cheese-making and animal husbandry classes, McIntrye wrote in a 2015 funding request.
At the time, the trust’s leaders knew that the state college planned to move its dairy herd to Norwich as part of a new program to educate students about the dairy industry. The purchase would provide the college with enough funds to launch the education program and provide a new opportunity for the trust to pursue its mission of land conservation.
Beyond the transaction, the college retained two parcels on an island cut out from Brookmead Conservation Area. This included roughly six acres of farm buildings, including a top of the line dairy barn built by Sigler, who had a penchant for Holstein genetics. There was also a house on two acres of land.
Under the vision of the college and the cheesemaker, these parcels would host a state-of-the-art dairy, a dormitory, and a small herd of cows that would have access to the surrounding pastures of Brookmead.
“The fact that we’ll be able to really inspire people to pursue an experience in agriculture or at the very least just understand the intimate connection between the food we make and the landscape that surrounds us is a really exciting thing,” Dan Smith, then president of the state college, said at the time. 

The creamery
Chris Gray met his wife, Laura Brown, working in the music industry. They began their family in Brooklyn, New York, but dreamt of getting out of the hustle and into food production.
So in 2010, just after their daughter was born, they bought a house and moved their family to southwestern Vermont. With business partners, they began a cheese making company in West Pawlet called Consider Bardwell Farm. (The business closed last year.) 
But when the Grays found out about the Norwich property, they decided to uproot again. 
“I took one look at this place, and I was like, ‘Oh my god, when do we start?’” Gray said. Over the years, it was overbuilt and underused, he said, but it was the only one like it in New England, with capabilities for a state-of-the-art, value-added dairy. He and Brown named their nascent business Lucky Us Ranch, LLC.

The Grays enrolled their daughter at a nearby school. Gray signed a temporary, one-year lease with the college in 2015. He helped the college design the property’s micro-dairy, and invested $150,000 in the buildout, he said. (According to a 2023 business plan, improvements to the farm since 2015 have cost $1 million; the creamery itself cost $650,000, largely paid for in grants and loans orchestrated by the college.)
By 2016, all the parties were still friendly, sometimes exchanging pleasantries over email. But then, the creamery started losing advocates at the college to job transitions. One of the first to leave was Chris Dutton, the chair of the college’s agricultural department who had championed the project, Gray said. Soon after, Dan Smith, the president of the college, moved to a position at the Vermont Community Fund. 
During the transition, the Grays signed a five-year lease with the college that included two options for ten-year extensions. 
Smith did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Emma Allen, the executive coordinator for the Vermont Community Fund, said Smith was on an unplugged sabbatical until early November and Allen was unable to get in touch with him.
The first semester of the on-farm dairy program was rocky from the start. Brown was hired as a residence director to help manage the six students in the dorm and buy groceries for the group. Gray worked as the cheese maker and a teacher on contract. The family paid $500 a month in subsidized rent for the three-bedroom farmhouse. 
Brown said that “a lot has been made” about the family’s low rent. “I want to qualify that we were teaching students,” she said.

Conflicts began to snowball. Gray and the former herd manager disagreed over the care of the cows and the quality of the milk. The creamery got a late start due to a delayed construction process. The students were disappointed in the program. They felt isolated in the small town of Norwich, according to a 2021 testimony from the college to state lawmakers, and they were unhappy being so far from the campus in Randolph. 
“I had three students come to speak with me, quite impassioned, of the six we had, saying, ‘This just isn’t working,’” said Patricia Moulton, then president of the college, in the 2021 testimony.
When the fall semester ended, the college planned to take the spring off and reassess the program, Gray said, before bringing students back in the fall of 2017. That spring, after conflicts with the herd manager, the cows left. The college helped pay for Gray to haul in milk. Gray began selling dairy products like ricotta cheese, yogurt, ice cream and bottled milk. 
But then the college, facing its own financial crisis, decided to end the program. Moulton, in an email response to questions this October, said the former agricultural program at the college’s Randolph campus later closed but parts of a new agricultural program could launch in the fall of 2026. Moulton did not agree to an interview because she said years had passed and her role at the campus had ended. Moulton is now the state’s flood recovery officer for central Vermont.

Ending the agricultural program in Norwich triggered an option the college had signed when they sold the land to the land trust. This option allowed the land trust to buy the six acre sliver that the college had retained when it sold the land back in 2015 — the pocket where the Grays lived. 
The option had set the price the land trust would pay at $50,000, a fraction of its actual market value in the affluent town of about 3,600 people. The median home value in Norwich exceeded $750,000 in Dec. 2024, according to Forbes, making it one of the priciest zip codes in the state. 
The dissolution of the partnership could have been less litigious if the Grays had cut their losses and tried to move their business to another property. But affordable farms are hard to come by. The average value of a farm has almost doubled in the last decade and a half, according to data published by the United States Department of Agriculture’s National Agricultural Statistics Service in August. In Vermont, land costs slightly more than the national average, about  $4,400 per acre. While farms are getting bigger in Vermont, largely due to consolidation, the number of farms has shrunk, according to a 2022 USDA agricultural census of the state.

“Everything that you read about us is that we’re horrible people,” Brown said while crying at her table in June. “That we’re tenants that won’t leave. That we’re planning an intensive dairy operation.”
“I feel like the truth needs to come out,” Brown said. 
“There’s many layers to this story,” said Anson Tebbetts, the state’s agricultural secretary, in an August interview. “You’ve got land agreements, you’ve got leases, you’ve got a state college going through a very difficult financial situation and that kind of unraveled in the middle. So a lot of things didn’t go as hoped and sometimes things just happen that way.” 
The Grays say they sunk roughly half a million dollars into their value-added agricultural business over the last decade. They say the land trust’s refusal to help a working farm sent them spiraling into debt, and now foreclosure could evict them from their home. They continue lobbing accusations against the land trust, claiming the organization orchestrated the debacle facing their small business. 
“A lot of people think we should have quit or given up but why would you? It’s literally a $50,000 problem that’s been turned into a million dollar situation,” Brown said.
McIntyre, president of the land trust during the entire saga, called the issue “ancient history,” and said she doesn’t want any part in the debate. Instead, according to McIntyre, it’s the land trust that lost out in the debacle, deprived of the opportunity to permanently protect the six-acre parcel of land. 
When asked about the damages that McIntyre claimed the land trust suffered on an August phone call, McIntyre’s voice rose in frustration. 
“We would own the building,” McIntyre said. “We would own the property where the Grays are currently located. I’m sorry to be short with you, but what is happening here is the Grays are attempting to create a story about something that isn’t a story anymore. This is done.”

The lawsuit
The Grays realized things were taking a turn for the worse when they met with the land trust in the fall of 2017, after the college’s education program shut down. As the land trust prepared to exercise its $50,000 legal option, they began to feel less confident in the future of their business. 
“It became clear immediately that they did not want to work with us,” Gray said. 
Part of that legal arrangement between the college and the land trust required the college to deliver the six-acres of land “unencumbered.” This meant that, if the land trust did not make a new deal with the creamery, the Gray family would need to leave. 
But the Grays refused to leave. Instead, the couple sent the land trust business plans outlining their proposals to stay in response to a request for proposals the land trust sent out.
In January 2018, as the land trust looked at business opportunities for the property including the one shared by the Grays, they offered the Gray family an estimate for a new lease rate. The proposed rate of $58,941 annually, or nearly $5,000 a month, included capital costs, real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance, and utilities for the farmhouse and surrounding barn properties. It was about ten times the lease rate that the family was paying at the time. Later, the trust offered a lease rate for only the farm house for $2,500 plus utilities. Neither offer included the use of the adjacent farm land.
“No agricultural business could operate at Norwich retail market rates,” Gray said in an email this summer. “They are essentially creating conditions so bad that we would have no choice but to leave.”
McIntyre sees the situation differently. She said the land trust was doing its due diligence to determine whether they could afford to exercise the legal option and manage the property, including its carrying costs.
“We’re a land conservancy, so we can’t have our operating budget distorted or get into an untenable situation,” McIntyre said in an interview in October. “The Grays provided UVLT with a business plan at that time that demonstrated their business would not be able to meet those carrying costs, and they disparaged UVLT publicly for not being willing to let them stay on the property for $500 a month. They didn’t join us in figuring out how to pay for those carrying costs, they just showed us that they couldn’t.”
Although the Upper Valley Land Trust has long promised to maintain the agricultural value of these parcels, the trust didn’t allow the Grays to raise a herd of cattle on the adjoining pastureland. Instead, the trust has leased parcels for grazing to at least two other farmers. 
The Grays went on the offensive and rallied their neighbors for support. The neighbors, eager to retain local farm products, eventually formed a foundation to support the creamery.
Even the college tried to advocate for the Grays’ business. Moulton, in a March 2018 email, said she would like to speak face-to-face or by phone with McIntyre. Moulton said she was sending an email outlining plans for the farm because McIntyre “requested that I do so in writing.” Moulton noted that the college did not intend to operate a degree program at the farm but wanted to continue holding workshops with Gray, who in turn wanted to stay on the farm and expand his business.
“Their proposal seems to enable each of us to continue to operate within our preferred areas AND to enable agriculture and value added dairy to remain on the farm which seems to be what folks in Norwich and the neighborhood would like to see happen,” Moulton wrote. 
In emails, she asked McIntyre to assign its option to purchase the property from the college to the creamery instead, in exchange for being reimbursed for the expenses incurred to date. The land trust would be able to purchase the property from the creamery for $50,000 in the future if the creamery ceased agricultural operations at the site. The creamery would be able to negotiate with the land trust on using the conserved land for agricultural operations. 
Moulton said keeping the site a working farm was “consistent with the spirit of the gift from the Siglers.” (Sigler, who died in 2021, apparently wanted nothing to do with the controversy. “Not my problem,” he told Jim Kenyon, a Valley News Columnist, according to a 2021 obituary.)
The proposal appeared to be a three-way win. It gave the land trust the option to purchase the property in the future while avoiding landlord responsibilities for the creamery. It gave the college the opportunity to divest but continue to conduct workshops and educational operations on the farm. The Grays would own their own farm, and if they decided to leave, the option would again transfer to the trust. Moulton asked for the three parties to get together as soon as possible. 
The land trust said such an arrangement wasn’t possible. McIntyre told VTDigger that, as a 501(c)(3) non-profit, the trust couldn’t legally provide public benefits to private individuals like the Grays. In the 2018 emails, McIntyre wrote that she’d previously explained “the legal, ethical and strategic reasons why we felt it was unlikely UVLT’s Board would accept.” (In a 2025 email, Stan Williams, board chair, told Brown that the trust had a “fiduciary duty” to exercise the option to purchase the land after the college withdrew.)
Moulton said she was “very sorry to hear this.” A little more than a week later, Moulton wrote another email reminding McIntyre that the college supported the creamery remaining on the farm. She mentioned a recent post on the land trust’s website called “Bringing the Cows Back” that stated: “We hope that the increased visibility for the Norwich Farm Creamery and the growing public awareness of operating complexities at the site will help the Grays strengthen the Creamery finances and, if viable, bring back the cows!”
Moulton offered to clear her calendar to make time in the next week for a resolution and suggested finding a mediator to advance the process. But McIntyre said the land trust’s attorneys didn’t want them having direct contact with Chris Gray.
Brown said officials at the college fought for the creamery and offered a long-term lease because they knew the business was never going to own land in Vermont. “The reality is we’re not wealthy people,” Gray added. “We don’t have money to burn to create some fantasy.”
A value-added dairy business is hard to make a go of in New England, according to Lee Robie, a 76-year-old, fifth generation former dairy farmer at New Hampshire’s Robie Farm. His family transitioned years ago from a conventional dairy into a value-added dairy business with cheese making, raw milk and a farm store.
“I can’t say we’re rolling in the dough, but we do sell a lot of products in New Hampshire and Vermont and we employ quite a few people on the farm,” Robie said in an interview. Years ago, he sold some of his farm’s lease rights to a land trust. While his family considered the Upper Valley Land Trust, they eventually went with Ammonoosuc Conservation Trust because it encouraged the family to keep farming and develop its agritourism business, Robie said.
By May 2018, after a spat over the use of a classroom on the farm for a celebration of Dale Somerville’s life, the former owner of the farm, to which the Grays say they were not invited, McIntyre told Moulton in an email that the trust’s “goodwill in this matter is nearly exhausted.” In a later email, McIntyre noted that the land trust had twice extended the closing of the option to benefit the college. “It is increasingly difficult for me to respond to VTC requests for goodwill, as these delays damage UVLT,” McIntyre wrote. 
The settlement
Representatives of the college and the land trust spoke with a mediator in June 2018, but the proposal put forward by Moulton ultimately failed. Almost a year later, the college still hadn’t delivered the land without the Grays. So the land trust sued the college.
The lawsuit appeared to change the way the college approached the Grays. A settlement was reached in 2020, after which the college listed the property for sale. The Grays would need to vacate the property when their five-year lease terminated on June 30, 2021.
McIntyre said the lawsuit in April 2019 only came after discussing for a year how to resolve the situation. The land trust never had any legal obligation or legal ability to help the Grays, according to McIntyre, and she said she didn’t know why the college claimed that the land trust could transfer the option. 
“We’re a private charity, it’s not the same thing as a publicly funded institution, so maybe they just didn’t know we’d have these constraints because it’s not the world they live in,” McIntyre said. 
But the Grays remained convinced that the land trust could have done more. While the college and the land trust negotiated their lawsuit, the Grays mobilized their neighbors into forming the Norwich Farm Foundation, a nonprofit with goals of maintaining local food security, creating affordable farmer housing, preserving the working landscape and restoring regenerative agriculture. The group submitted a ten-year business plan for the creamery to the land trust that included producing 350,000 pounds of dairy products each year. It hinged on grazing cattle on the surrounding pastureland in the Brookmead Conservation Area, owned by the land trust. 
But McIntyre said, by that point, the land trust didn’t need to see a plan, because it wasn’t going to own the six-acre property. The plan the trust did receive in May 2020 was very similar to the initial 2018 plan it received from the Grays, McIntyre said, except this time the Grays wouldn’t pay rent and would receive a salary. 
As McIntyre repeatedly told the creamery and said in public commentary, the land was not available to the Grays’ business. The college listed the six-acre property for $1.25 million. The Grays, bolstered by the enormous wealth of the Norwich community and desperate to maintain their business, managed to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy the property through the foundation. 
It took months, but finally, in the spring of 2020, the foundation submitted an unsolicited offer through email to buy the property for $300,000, according to Omer Trajman, then treasurer of the Norwich Farm Foundation, who spoke to lawmakers during a March 2021 Senate Agriculture Committee meeting that was held on Zoom and included the parties involved in the dispute. When that failed, the foundation raised an additional $180,000 and doubled its offer to $610,000. The college again rejected the offer. (Trajman did not respond to requests for comment.)
“We all sort of had high hopes and great ideas about that operation and know that the people in Norwich certainly enjoy having that farm there,” Sen. Robert Starr, D-Orleans, said during the 2021 committee meeting.
But Moulton, also in attendance, no longer appeared interested in supporting the Grays. She told lawmakers that the college had been clear with the Grays that their plan to make Norwich Farm their dairy operation was no longer going to work. The barn was not ideally set up for milking, and was instead better positioned to raise prize Holsteins, she said. Because they didn’t have access to surrounding pastures, feed would have to be trucked in and manure trucked out, she said.
“That’s not the way you typically do dairy farming,” Moulton said as McIntyre nodded along to her comments on the Zoom screen. 
Gray put in over half a million dollars in the dairy he told lawmakers in 2021. He told VTDigger his family paid over $80,000 in legal bills to maintain their rights on the property. (Gray later said that he received pro bono representation and saved money from ballooning legal costs by working with the Vermont Legal Food Hub at the Vermont Law and Graduate School.) 
The tension on the Zoom call was palpable. Gray shook his head and looked appalled at McIntyre and Moulton’s statements. McIntyre shook her head and appeared to laugh at Gray. 
Moulton said the only offer on the farm as of March 2021 was from the Norwich Farm Foundation, but that it was far below fair market value. She said the college spent around $70,000 a year subsidizing the farm’s operating expenses, which came from the students’ tuition. The college plowed the driveway, mowed the fields, and emptied the grey water produced by the creamery, Moulton said. In the last several years, between renovation and operation, the college system had spent “several million dollars” on the property, Moulton said.
If the college sold the property, asked Sen. Brian Collamore, R-Rutland, would the money go directly to the college system’s budget?
“Yes,” Moulton said, nodding. The sale could provide 25-50 student scholarships, she added.
Between the foundation’s first offer in 2020 and the end of 2021, the Norwich Farm Foundation made at least five offers for the property to the college, which rejected them all, according to the Grays. In May of 2021, the Grays sued the college for $500,000. The lawsuit was settled in mediation, the Grays said. By early September, the college filed an eviction notice against the Grays. The family contested it, and in April 2022, settled with the college for $10,000.
But in the middle of the fight over the eviction, the foundation raised $400,000 from the community, according to the Grays. In December 2021, the foundation was finally able to buy the property from the college for $1,065,000. The foundation bought the property so the Grays could continue operating the Norwich Farm Creamery, making an operating dairy again viable in the community. 
But much of the money the foundation spent on the property did not go to the college system or to student scholarships, as the Grays and their neighbors had assumed after the 2021 Senate testimony. The details of the private settlement between the college and the land trust became unredacted after the sale went through. Under that settlement, the trust had earned $849,674. Those hundreds of thousands of dollars would “advance UVLT’s conservation and stewardship missions,” according to a 2022 annual report.
The purchase left the Norwich Farm Foundation with an almost equivalent $850,000 mortgage debt. 
“The Upper Valley Land Trust took all the money,” Gray said. “In the end, UVLT created $850,000 in debt and profited from a farm that was originally given away.” 
Moulton confirmed in an email that “money from the sale of the Norwich Farm did not go into scholarships” or students at the college. She said she couldn’t speak to where the money ultimately ended up because she left the college in 2023. 
The settlement, unsealed and then unredacted through multiple public records requests, showed that the land trust received an initial $75,000 and then played a role in the sale, choosing the broker for the sale who would recommend the pricing. 
McIntyre told VTDigger that the $75,000 was compensation for “real out-of-pocket costs we incurred,” including the staff time reaching out to potential tenants and the analyses of business plans for the property. 
But the Grays brought up other issues: The land trust was able to reject offers for the six-acre property under $500,000 and match any offer less than $450,000 after a three-month veto period, according to the settlement. In 2021, the Norwich Farm Foundation alleged that the trust had been involved in the sale and driven up the costs.
McIntyre stands by a claim she’s made for years that she never saw or evaluated any of the offers the college received: “UVLT had absolutely nothing to do with whatever offers the college rejected,” McIntyre said in October. While who saw what remains an open question, the settlement makes clear that the land trust received 100% of the first $450,000 and 70% of any net sale proceeds over $450,000.
That means the land trust — with a stated mission to permanently protect land in the Upper Valley, including working farms — reaped more than 18 times the original $50,000 trigger option it would have paid the college for the six-acre property. But McIntyre said this settlement was just about recouping financial losses for the failure of the college to deliver the property as initially promised. 
“UVLT did not make money,” McIntyre told VTDigger, adding that the trust was  only paid 80 percent of the value of the property that should’ve been conveyed to the trust by the college. “We were damaged, and we were compensated for the loss of opportunity caused by the school’s default.”
“We have nothing to do with the property where the Grays are located now,” McIntyre said in August. “Their business, from what I gather, is not working out.” 
The debt
From his kitchen table in June, Gray said his family was “crushed financially” by the debacle. The foundation’s debt is more than a million dollars, according to foreclosure documents. The foundation can’t make enough money from the creamery, which relies on hauling in milk instead of milking dairy cows, to pay back the debt without access to the land or larger donors, Gray said. 
The Grays’ faced another defeat in 2023 when they tried and failed to get a property tax exemption for the property valued at $1.239 million, according to the property’s town tax bill. The town of Norwich decided the for-profit business operation within the non-profit status of the Norwich Farm Foundation didn’t meet the standard of the land used for a charitable purpose. The annual taxes on the property are more than $34,000.
The foundation disbanded after realizing the debt for the property they purchased was untenable. None responded to a request for comment or agreed to speak on the record. Kate Barlow, the former president of the foundation, said in a September email that it had been more than three years since she was on the board and requested not to be contacted.
The foundation listed the property a year ago for $1.275 million. Failing to secure any offers, let alone a buyer, the foundation took it off the market Sept. 1.
That was more than a month after the foreclosure began. 
The $850,000 mortgage has been held by Iroquois Valley Farmland REIT, a farmland finance company out of Illinois, since May 2022. In July, the company filed a foreclosure notice against the foundation, Norwich Farm Creamery and Brown and Gray themselves, according to court records. The notice says the parties now owe $1,065,000, or roughly what the foundation initially paid for the property with accumulated taxes, interest and attorney fees, according to court records. 
After a foreclosure notice, defendants can often work to pay off the debt during a redemption period. In Vermont, that period is typically six months for farms, but Iroquois Valley argued last month that the property was not actually farmland, but rather a commercial property taxed by the town of Norwich. Therefore, the finance company requested a redemption period of one day. 
Eventually, the foreclosure could mean bankruptcy and eviction, according to Gray. He said the couple could close their value-added dairy business by the end of the year. 
“We do not know at this point exactly how long that process will take or ultimately what will be the outcome for our business and our family,” Gray said in August.

The Grays continue to place most of the blame on UVLT for subdividing the working farm – hewing the working land from the working infrastructure. They’d fundraised to buy the property on the presumption that the money they were spending would support the state college, the Grays said, and according to the Senate agricultural committee meeting, go to student scholarships. They blamed the realization that the money had instead gone to the land trust on sidelining much of their fundraising efforts.
“All the money we raised, and all the money we continued to raise, just went to servicing the debt and keeping the lights on, so zero money went back to growing the system and getting it to a sustainable level. It’s what happens to all farms. They just get in so much debt, then they can’t grow and be sustainable,” Gray said. 
Brown now works a second job in retail at King Arthur Baking Company. The farm is currently processing about 175 gallons of milk a week purchased from Billings Farm and Museum in Woodstock, according to Gray. Their gross revenues are about $200,000 a year, according to their farm plan.
The couple has stopped paying the mortgage and taxes on the property. Gray said the creamery is still in production but the finances are week to week while the family looks for a new backer for the business.
“The situation is so complicated,” Gray said from his kitchen, looking grim. “And the money has become so big that it’s hard to get anyone to pay attention. And you have no access to the land.”
When asked about UVLT not allowing the Grays to use the surrounding 350 acres for agriculture, McIntyre said the land was always intended for conservation purposes and had never been available to the Grays’ private business.
“The Grays have known for years that it won’t be available to their operation. They knew that before they got there. Before the foundation bought it for them,” McIntyre said. “UVLT was not going to subsidize a business or tie up our property in an unsustainable plan.” 
The Grays’ daughter, Eugenia, five years old at the start of this saga, is now 15 and in high school near Norwich. The couple said they want to stay in the community for her education and because the farm is important to their family. 
“We don’t have any other options,” Brown said. “We don’t have any place to go.” 
So the creamery is making a last ditch effort to bring in another partner: Dartmouth College.
The couple is asking for an investment of about $2.5 million for ownership of the property. They’ve shared a five-year growth plan that involves returning cows to the farm, hiring two herd managers, tripling production and becoming financially self-sustaining after five years. 
They said they’ve received positive feedback, but the college’s real estate office isn’t yet interested in buying the property. Dartmouth College declined to comment.
But they’re not giving up: They pitched rebranding the business as Dartmouth Farm Creamery.

This story by Aaron Calvin was first published in the News & Citizen on Oct. 23, 2025.
The Vermont Public Utility Commission officially opened an investigation into Hyde Park Electric on Monday after the village utility admitted to the state last month that it was experiencing “significant financial distress.”
Hyde Park Electric, which serves 1,400 ratepayers, has failed to cover expenses as it struggles under the weight of its $1.5 million debt, and is “essentially not solvent,” according to correspondence between the state and the utility.
The Department of Public Service, which advocates on behalf of Vermont ratepayers, learned about the severity of the village utility’s situation only after another state program informed  commissioner Kerrick Johnson that Hyde Park Electric had not been paying its bills.
After a meeting in Montpelier held Sept. 9, Johnson laid out his directives for addressing the situation in a letter to Hyde Park village manager Brian Evans-Mongeon on how to proceed in addressing a catastrophic situation that was “entirely of its own making.” Kerrick admonished the utility for failing to inform the state of its dire situation “months if not years ago.”
Johnson outlined concerns including the utility’s use of loans taken out by the village to cover losses incurred by the electric department; various loans that the utility had fallen behind on; and the handling of energy efficiency charge collections, which the utility had been using to cover other costs, rather than sending them on to the state as required.
“The Department continues to weigh all options relative to our view on whether Hyde Park Electric’s continued operation is the most efficient means of ensuring reliable, affordable and sustainable electric service to its ratepayers,” Johnson wrote. He later clarified that it is still his department’s position that the existence of a solvent village utility would be the best outcome for ratepayers.
In a subsequent letter to the Public Utility Commission filed on Sept. 29 at the behest of the Department of Public Service, Evans-Mongeon and village trustees chair Fredericka French told regulators that the department had unpaid transmission bills outstanding, along with other suspect financially unsound transactions that had resulted in a “negative retained earnings and a negative net income position.”
They promised that the utility, after contracting with the Vermont Public Power Supply Authority, would be cooperating fully with the state to right the ship.
“(Hyde Park Electric) understands the gravity of this situation and is endeavoring to restore (the utility’s) financial footing and assuring that its public service obligations are fully met,” the letter from the Hyde Park officials said.
In a follow-up interview, French pledged that there would be no interruption to electricity access in Hyde Park village, an assertion that Johnson corroborated.
Johnson said his department’s first priority was to work with Hyde Park Electric to propose a new rate increase that would allow the utility to stabilize itself financially while his department maintains strict financial surveillance going forward. But how, exactly, the Hyde Park board of trustees got itself into this mess remains a mystery.
French said that this was purely a matter of financial mismanagement, not fraud, while Johnson awaits the result of a VPPSA audit to adequately apportion blame, to “untangle in terms of responsibility and how and when we got here.”
Johnson said he had seen other municipal utilities face financial struggles, but Hyde Park’s insolvency is extraordinary.
“There’s been nothing like this where there’s been a series of utility management decisions over a period of time, especially the legally questionable, regulatory questionable, practices and measures and strategies undertaken,” he said. “This is not just doubling down; this is quadrupling down of debt and mismanagement that have brought the utility to its current position.”
Crisis unveiled
Shortly after Johnson was appointed to the Department of Public Service, he attended a regular February meeting of the Hyde Park village board of trustees with an offer of collaboration with the utility, with which he had concerns, but received no interest from the village.
As laid out in the public utility commission’s filing on Monday, Hyde Park Electric had been requesting rate increases that the commission believed “were insufficient to meet its operating needs.” The utility last filed for a rate increase of 2% in October 2023 and promised to return with another increase request the following spring, but didn’t.
In September, representatives from Efficiency Vermont reached out to Johnson for guidance when Hyde Park Electric, in what they say was an unprecedented situation, had not paid the remittance the utilities regularly pay the program.
Evans-Mongeon and the trustees met with Johnson in Montpelier in a “tense” meeting during which the utility ultimately admitted to being insolvent. According to Johnson, it took some discussion to get to that point.
“There was evasiveness, evasiveness and finger-pointing to anyone but themselves at first, and that was dismissed summarily, and (we) started to get, at last, an acknowledgement of the depth of the problem,” he said.
According to Johnson, along with being behind on various payments and in serious debt, the village had been covering the debt with loans it had taken out and had been commingling electric utility funds with its water and sewer utility.
In 2022, Lamoille County sued Hyde Park village for changing its water and sewer rate structure to protect residential customers while increasing the rate for state and county-owned buildings like the courthouse and elementary school from a $15 flat fee to $1,418 base charge. The county and village eventually settled on a slightly lesser fee.
This water and sewer rate adjustment was presided over by former Hyde Park village manager Carol Robertson. Robertson suddenly left her position in the spring of 2023 after developing serious medical issues and died that April, according to an announcement made by French. Evans-Mongeon took the job that same year.
Johnson said it’s unclear at this time how far back the mismanagement of Hyde Park Electric’s resources goes. French said past and current management practices would be scrutinized in the ongoing VPPSA audit.
A separate independent audit conducted by a St. Albans-based accounting firm Kittell Branagan & Sargent submitted to the village on Oct. 10 included comments complaining of significant delays in the auditing process due to a lack of documentation and accused management of not possessing “the expertise in financial accounting and reporting in order to prepare financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.”
State takes charge
Hyde Park Electric was already being investigated by the Public Utility Commission after implementing a new rate tariff for infrastructure upgrade costs that the commission felt it needed to better explain. The Department of Public Service pushed Hyde Park to abandon this request, filing a scathing motion to dismiss, instead of waiting for the trustees to make a decision.
It was a move that one of Hyde Park’s lawyers with Stackpole & French said, in an email to department lawyers, felt like the department was “just trying to kick HPE while they are down and took an opportunity to take another shot at them.” Ed French, senior partner at the law firm, is Fredericka French’s husband.
Johnson said the tenor of that initial meeting and Hyde Park Electric’s record of resisting cooperation with the state caused him to grow impatient.
“There’s fundamental cracks in the foundation of your house, and you’re doing new window treatments,” Johnson said of the rate tariff. “Stop it. Concentrate on the financial fundamentals. That’s where you should be concentrating on re-earning trust for your management team with the Department of Public Service.”
On Oct. 16, the Department of Public Service sent a proposed two-phase rate case process to Hyde Park, a plan that, as enacted, will stabilize the utility in the short-term.
The next part of the process will require the utility, under surveillance by the department and with the support of VPPSA, to submit a rate increase proposal that will allow it to achieve some form of long-term financial stability. Johnson said the rate increase will be substantial, but not “the most expensive rates in the state.”
A solvent Hyde Park Electric is still what Johnson believes will ultimately be best for its ratepayers, but dissolution is still on the table.
“It shouldn’t have taken a third party knocking on the department door that tipped us off to exactly the depth of the financial challenges that (they) are facing,” he said, “but the village and the leadership there have a responsibility towards its own rate payers as well as to the rest of the state’s rate-payers, to look for assistance when they need it.”

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)The 19 proposals advanced on Wednesday by a legislative task force aiming to reduce property taxes for South Dakota homeowners are a mix of ideas including spending cuts, increases in other taxes and tapping into other funds.
In addition to recommendations by the task force, lawmakers will likely have to contend with other property tax proposals when they convene for the annual legislative session in January. That could include a revival of a state sales tax rate increase from 4.2% to 5% and the governor’s proposed optional half-percent sales tax for counties, which currently don’t have authority to tax sales (only the state and cities have that power).
Lawmakers on the task force expressed a hope in June to propose legislation that will significantly cut the average South Dakota homeowner’s property taxes. South Dakota property taxes paid by homeowners increased 38.8% between 2020 and 2024.
The proposals include cutting state spending and applying the savings to property tax relief, replacing some property tax revenue with sales tax increases, using one-time tax credits for temporary relief, and reserving a portion of future state revenue increases each year to reduce property taxes.
Chair of the task force and Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, said details need to be hashed out with some of the proposals. Task force member and Sen. Randy Deibert, R-Spearfish, cautioned lawmakers at the end of the meeting.
“We need to be very careful about what we wish for,” Deibert said. “If we lower our property taxes so much, we’ll have more people moving here and have a big impact on that. We have to be very careful on that balance, to keep our quality of life and not be overrun by people moving here because we have such a great tax environment.”
Cut state spending by 5%
The most contentious proposal to make it through the task force is cutting state government general fund spending by 5%, or about $123 million — with cooperation from Gov. Larry Rhoden’s administration to identify where potential cuts could be made. The cuts themselves wouldn’t reduce property taxes, because the state doesn’t receive any property tax revenue (only counties, schools, cities and other local governments do). The state would have to dedicate the savings toward property tax relief.
Task force Vice Chair and House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, said the executive branch’s cooperation is needed to “cut state government in this fashion.” 
“I think the fundamental reason for this request is because, if we want real tax relief, it must come from cuts to government spending,” said Hansen, who is running for governor next year. “Otherwise, we’re just shifting the burden onto other taxpayers.”
Other members of the task force and the public warned task force members against state cuts. Jim Terwilliger, commissioner of the South Dakota Bureau of Finance and Management, said many of the budget cuts proposed by the Rhoden administration for this fiscal year were unpopular with lawmakers, and some of them were restored.
“It’s pretty easy to say, ‘Oh, let’s go cut 5%,’” Terwilliger said, adding, “I think it’s going to be very, very difficult to do that at the end of the day.”
Reserve some future revenue growth for property tax relief
Another recommendation would create a new property tax relief fund by depositing 25% of the annual increase in ongoing state revenue into the fund each year.
The idea, proposed by Karr, would be a long-term investment in property tax relief, he said.
Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City, said it would be a new line item in the state budget and grow each year. Karr compared the idea to annual increases in state employee salaries, education and Medicaid reimbursements. 
“Even with an average of 4% growth, we can have a significant buildup,” Karr said, adding, “Maybe this is the seed we plant for future growth in property tax relief.”
Sales tax increase used for property tax relief
The task force also advanced a proposal to use a sales tax increase from 4.2% to 4.5% to create a fund to replace a portion of property taxes collected by school districts. A temporary sales tax reduction from 4.5% to 4.2%, adopted in 2023, is already scheduled to expire in 2027 unless lawmakers make it permanent.
South Dakota Retailers Association Executive Director Nathan Sanderson encouraged lawmakers to support the idea, saying that his organization has been advocating for the “relatively simple” proposal since 2022.
One-time $500 tax credits
A $500 property tax credit for owner-occupied properties would be funded by remaining Housing and Infrastructure Financing program money and budget reserve funding, totaling $120 million.

Lawmakers used a combination of state and federal funding in 2023 to create a $200 million Housing and Infrastructure Financing program, meant to spur housing developments across South Dakota. Much of that money has been spent as grants, but just under $65 million in loans remain untouched. The Legislature earlier this year dipped into the fund to spend $15 million on a loan for the Douglas School District, serving the Ellsworth Air  Force Base, to help build an elementary school.
Hansen proposed spending the remaining funds on property tax relief. On Friday, the governor unveiled a rival proposal to spend some of the the remaining housing infrastructure money on airport expansions in Sioux Falls and Rapid City.
Julie Johnson, a lobbyist who represents various housing groups, said many organizations have proposals in the works to use the remainder of the Housing and Infrastructure Financing money.
“I would urge your avoidance of that fund,” Johnson said. “It’s filled incredible niches in the housing infrastructure economy and allowed a lot of communities to take the next steps into building their own opportunities.”
Tax increment financing regulations
One of the most controversial proposals related to property taxes is Howard’s tax increment financing district regulation package.
Local tax increment financing districts provide upfront financing to build streets, water pipes and other infrastructure for development, while capturing the higher property taxes generated by the development to pay off the financing over time. TIFs, as they are known, have become controversial in some areas, including Rapid City, where critics including Howard allege they’ve become handouts for wealthy developers.

If passed, Howard’s proposal would restrict TIFs by reducing the percentage of a city or county’s overall assessed value that can be part of a TIF, requiring that at least 50% of the area within a proposed TIF district be blighted, redefining “blight,” requiring counties to approve TIF districts established by a city, requiring an independent evaluation that a project would not be built unless a TIF was established, and requiring a special election for TIF districts totaling $10 million or more.
Howard called the changes “common sense” as TIFs become a more commonly used tool, especially in urban counties, to “reign it back.”
Other task force members, including Deibert, were concerned the package is too restrictive and would harm communities. Deibert and other critics conceded that TIFs could be further regulated in the state, but without “punishing people who really need” them.
The impact of TIFs on local property taxpayers is a subject of debate, with critics saying the capturing of a project’s property taxes to pay off TIF financing temporarily burdens other taxpayers, while TIF proponents say TIFs spur development that broadens the tax base over time.
Other proposals
Other proposals advanced by the task force:

Expanding the state’s property assessment freeze program income limit for older and disabled South Dakotans.
Requiring counties to include a QR code on property tax bills to direct taxpayers to the state’s property tax website, in an effort to increase transparency about how property taxes are used.
Setting school districts’ annual increase for property tax revenue at the same level as all other taxing districts, since school districts are currently exempt.
Allowing property owners applying for tax relief programs to fill out forms online, rather than at the county office.
Raising the minimum value of a new structure or addition that qualifies for the discretionary formula, a property tax incentive to promote economic development in the state, from $30,000 to $100,000. 
Creating a new fund directing all state lottery revenues to state aid for education, rather than placing the revenues into the state general fund.
Prohibiting a school district from transferring money from its capital outlay fund to its general fund, as well as limiting annual increases in a school district’s capital outlay property taxes to 3% or inflation, whichever is less, and removing additional increases allowed from growth.
Expanding the state’s property tax relief program for disabled veterans by increasing the maximum exempt assessed value to the entire assessed value of the property, and offering a refund of property taxes to eligible South Dakotans who qualify but did not apply in the last five years of eligibility.
Allowing more cities to implement a property tax rebate program for owner-occupied properties, such as the one in Sioux Falls, which has such a program in place because it has a unique charter, called home rule, allowing more autonomy in its governance.
Restricting school district opt outs (decisions to exceed state-imposed limits on property tax revenue growth), by making it easier to bring an opt out to a vote of the people by automatic referral, decreasing signature requirements for referral, requiring 60% approval, or increasing the number of days opponents have to gather petition signatures to force a referral.
Creating a fund to replace a portion of property taxes collected by school districts, using any sources of revenue lawmakers put toward the fund.

This story by Patrick Bilow was first published in the Stowe Reporter on Oct. 23, 2025.
Stowe’s Visitor Center was a foliage hotspot this season.
More than 10,000 people have entered the visitor center so far in October, compared with 6,500 for the entire month last year, according to guest services coordinator Adrianne Johnson, who said visits have been up all year. The visitor center also doubled its previous one-day visitation record — 581 last year to 1,148 this year.
Those visitors traveled from nearly every continent, with people coming from the United Kingdom, Denmark, Australia, Germany, France, Italy, Russia, Greenland, China, Japan, India and Sudan, according to Johnson.
Dispelling notions that Canadian visitors aren’t visiting Stowe, Johnson said the visitor center has seen many tourists from Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal, as well as a few first-time visitors from the western provinces.
On any given weekend this month, a line of leaf peepers has snaked through the visitor center toward the bathroom and front desk, behind which Johnson and her colleagues have done their best to answer a litany of questions about Stowe. While the questions may seem similar, each set of guests is unique, according to Johnson.
“They want to know the best photo spots, where they should shop, which of the trails they should hike for the best colors and best views, or the most accessible ways to experience Stowe beyond scenic drives and shopping downtown,” Johnson said. “Sometimes they have no idea what they should do and other times they aren’t sure they can do all they have planned.”
The gondola skyride and auto toll road at Stowe Mountain Resort and the von Trapp Family Lodge are among the most popular destinations for people who pass through the visitor center, Johnson said.
This time of year, roadways and trails with foliage views are also popular. A lot of people are interested in traveling Smugglers Notch, or Stowe’s gravel roads with covered bridges. The Stowe Recreation Path and Cady Hill mountain bike trails attract recreationists.

According to Johnson, Stowe history was another popular topic this foliage season.
The visitor center sends history buffs over to Stowe Historical Society, the Vermont Ski and Snowboard Museum, Stowe at Night Lantern Tours and the self-guided hiking tour of historic sites in Sterling Forest.
Johnson and her colleagues give food and beverage recommendations as well. They keep menus at the visitor center and can describe to guests how many crosswalks it takes to reach a restaurant, or where on the rec path it’s located. They regularly receive phone calls from people who get lost on their adventure and frequently give directions over the phone.
“Sometimes guests will come back to tell us how much they enjoyed their time in Stowe, which stands as a testament to how everyone does such a great job welcoming visitors,” Johnson said. “The only real complaints we hear are that they wish there was a little less traffic, a little more parking and a few more public restrooms.”

From frontline service providers to statewide advocacy groups, many organizations that anchor our communities are now fighting to survive. And while headlines often focus on executive leadership, we should be equally attentive to the role of governing boards.
2025 is a historically challenging year for nonprofits, and the road ahead looks far from easy. A combination of federal funding cuts, rising costs fueled by tariffs, and continued attacks on diversity and inclusion initiatives have created a perfect storm of instability. Here in Colorado, where nonprofits generate more than $62 billion in revenue, employ 182,000 Coloradans, and support 80,000 contractors, the stakes couldn’t be higher.
The numbers tell a sobering story.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the Nonprofit Finance Fund, 52% of nonprofits have three months or less of cash on hand, and 36% ended 2024 operating at a deficit — the highest rate in a decade. Candid data warns that more than 14,000 organizations could run out of cash within months if funding continues to dry up, threatening millions of jobs and countless services.
In moments like these, attention often turns to the executive director or CEO. Exceptional leaders can unite teams, weather uncertainty, and even help their organizations thrive under pressure. But sustaining mission-driven work in a turbulent environment requires more than strong executives — it demands exceptional boards.
Too often, the nonprofit sector overlooks how critical strong boards are to long-term success. Board performance varies widely, and two issues tend to drive that variation:


Recruiting and retaining directors with the right mix of skills, lived experience, and resources


Building governance systems that actually harness those strengths to set direction, oversee performance, and ensure accountability


Finding board members who bring that balance can feel like hunting for unicorns. Many boards overemphasize one area — like fundraising — while neglecting community representation or relevant expertise. On top of that, nonprofits must fill unpaid roles, often expecting personal contributions, while operating on limited budgets and minimal staff support. It’s no surprise that even high-functioning organizations struggle to assemble “best-in-class” boards.
And even when nonprofits recruit talented directors, ideal composition doesn’t always translate to effective governance. As governance expert Dr. John Carver once observed, “Nonprofit boards are often groups of highly competent and responsible people who, as a group, are neither competent nor responsible.”
That paradox points to a deeper need: building systems that promote group competence. Boards need clear standards for performance, transparent accountability to the communities they serve, and structures that empower — not micromanage — staff.
The takeaway is simple but urgent: Nonprofits must approach board recruitment and engagement with far greater intentionality. With the right mix of skills, representation and training, boards can transform from passive fiduciaries into strategic partners helping organizations navigate this moment of volatility.
There’s also good news. Adversity breeds opportunity, and Colorado is filled with talented, civic-minded professionals who want to make a difference. Serving on a nonprofit board offers a chance to address real-world challenges — from housing affordability to early childhood education to climate resilience — while developing leadership skills and broadening one’s perspective.
For nonprofits, this is the moment to take a hard look at how their boards operate. Revisiting officer and committee roles, clarifying expectations, and strengthening the board’s role as both a strategic visionary and a hands-on partner can turn governance into a true engine of resilience.
Colorado has always prided itself on community — neighbors stepping up for one another, across divides and across the mountains. As the nonprofit sector faces one of its most challenging chapters in decades, that spirit of service and collaboration must extend to the boardroom.
The way forward may not be easy, but it is clear: We need more Coloradans to step into governance, strategy and stewardship — and we need to equip them to lead effectively together. Nonprofits that do will be the ones that not only survive the current turbulence, but emerge stronger, more inclusive, and better prepared to serve the people who count on them most.

And since the 1990s, with the start of the effort to close the “sooty six” coal and oil plants, cleaning up the air for health and climate reasons has figured equally with saving money by using free renewable sources like sun and wind.
The Trump administration has now made that a lot harder, if not impossible, to do, leaving Connecticut and the entire region with the question: Now what?
Since his first day in office, Trump has set about eliminating future development of onshore and offshore wind on federal property, which effectively means all offshore wind, a form of renewable power Trump openly despises. So far, his administration has issued stop-work orders for two northeast offshore wind installations already under construction, including one for Connecticut. Each resumed construction after about a month, losing millions of dollars in the process.

Gov. Ned Lamont walks with New London Mayor Michael Passero, right, and state Rep. Anthony Nolan, D-New London, toward a press conference to celebrate the resumption of work on the Revolution Wind project. But there’s no guarantee the project will be completed, and the region is unlikely to get anything close to the amount of offshore wind it had been counting on. Credit: JOHN MORITZ/ CT MIRROR
Trump has also succeeded getting a law on the books to end the widely popular and effective federal tax credits for wind, solar and energy efficiency projects. The administration also threw its weight behind keeping old and dirty coal plants operating longer than previously planned, as well as subsidizing more coal mining. And it is ramping up oil and gas drilling, all in the name of an “energy emergency” that Trump claims exists, even though the country is the largest producer of oil and gas in the world.
“Singling out and disfavoring renewable resources while many other resources continue to enjoy favorable tax treatment, including fossil resources — this is not leveling the playing field. This is definitely putting a finger on the scale to disadvantage clean renewable energy resources,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. She called the end of the tax credit “really challenging,” noting the state had a pipeline of projects it had hoped to bring forward, and warned that power prices would likely increase.
“We are doing what we can within our state jurisdictional programs to try to fill in some of the gaps. Obviously, we can’t fill all the gaps,” Dykes said. The state is urging residents, businesses, governmental entities and energy developers to take advantage of the tax credits before many of them disappear at the end of the year. To that end, DEEP issued an expedited request for proposals for solar and onshore wind. Proposals were due Oct. 10. Energy efficiency, especially useful to lower income and environmental justice communities, may feel the impact most acutely.
But it is offshore wind and the massive amount of carbon-free power it can generate, that Connecticut, and really the entire Northeast, had been counting on.
DEEP must sort through all of this uncertainty as it devises its new Integrated Resource Plan, a 10-year look ahead at energy needs and how to meet them, in keeping with the energy and climate policies the state has in place.
But in addition to the federal government’s energy policies, DEEP now has to reckon with the administration’s tariffs, policies on imported critical minerals, supply chain concerns and environmental about-faces. And it risks the potential for retribution if the state defies Trump’s wishes on anything, not just climate policy.
“We are undertaking planning efforts that are intended to try to assess as best we can what some of the different future scenarios will look like in terms of electricity needs, but also climate planning, and to do our best to identify the types of investments that might make sense, on what time horizon, given the change in the federal landscape, but also demand growth and reliability needs and so on,” Dykes said.
The actions from the federal administration against offshore winds have been targeted and very calculated.Stephanie Francoeur, senior vice president, Oceantic
Dan Dolan is also thinking about what to do now. He’s president of the New England Power Generators Association, a trade organization that represents about 95% of the generating capacity in the region.
“Where we stand right now is this muddled middle period,” he said. 
Demand isn’t rising quite as fast as anticipated due to the impacts of solar and energy efficiency on the grid. But there’s also uncertainty about whether that trend will continue without tax credits and whether planned large power source additions will come online on time or at all.
“In terms of new supply sources, I am not seeing meaningful, large-scale new developments happening anytime soon in the region,” Dolan said. “If demand continues to be more muted in its growth, we can handle that.“ 
But he said if demand does go up significantly, despite individual state commitments to transition from fossil fuel power sources to clean and renewable ones, the region might have to look at keeping older, dirtier power sources operating for longer than planned, and that might mean spending more than a little money to upgrade them.
“I’m seeing a lot of investors watching but staying on the sidelines for the moment,” Dolan said.
Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport, is co-chair of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee. He has been a member of the committee since entering the legislature in 2011, so he has seen the twists, turns and growing pains as the state endeavored to create and implement its first short- and long-term strategies toward renewable energy while addressing climate change, health of citizens and high energy rates.
 “We had, in our procurement planning and our capacity analysis, obviously — in conjunction with (grid operator) ISO-New England — counted on the availability of renewable energy sources to meet our needs,” he said. With the federal government now undermining those supply plans, “That is now a crisis that might have been 10 years away. It is now moving closer and closer to being an actual, impending crisis.
“We’re really low on options, but renewables were a critical part of that picture going forward.”

After many years of delay, a transmission line for hydropower from Canada — the Northeast Clean Energy Connect, NECEC — is months from completion. The power is being purchased by Massachusetts, but it provides a relief valve for the entire New England grid. Breath-holding is underway that the Trump administration will not sabotage it, given the administration’s fraught relationship with Canada as well as the blue-state northeast.
If that and the two offshore wind projects under construction off New England are finished, Dykes said, it will add about 13% of supply.
But any offshore wind beyond that, including projects approved by the Biden administration? ‘Unlikely’ would be a generous assessment of its future.
How dead is offshore wind?
Offshore wind was the big prize. At the end of the Biden administration, 11 projects had been approved nationally that would have provided the power equivalent of nearly 10 Millstone power stations and gotten the U.S. about two-thirds of the way to the Biden goal of 30 gigawatts of offshore wind by 2030.
Today, five are under construction. A sixth, South Fork Wind off the eastern tip of Long Island, is completed and began operating about a year ago. The remaining five have been stopped either at early stages or through efforts by the Trump administration to review or outright rescind already-issued federal permits. The administration ended all new lease-area designations and permits.

Of the two under construction that faced stop-work orders, one is Revolution Wind, a joint Connecticut and Rhode Island project that is already 80% complete. While it and the other project — New York’s Empire Wind — have restarted, it’s unclear what might happen to the other three. In the case of Revolution, a legal dispute is still underway.
“I think there’s no question that East Coast states, particularly from the mid-Atlantic up, have to continue to fight for offshore wind,” said Elizabeth Klein, who served as the final Biden administration director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, BOEM, the entity within the Interior Department responsible for offshore wind.
“There’s no question that what the current administration is doing is damaging to the industry and causing a great deal of harm,” she said. “The looming question is whether or not these companies who are involved will be able to essentially wait it out and invest their time and resources in parts of developing offshore wind that aren’t directly about getting permits and approvals to move forward with new projects.”
Ørsted, the company developing Revolution Wind and other projects, declined to comment on the situation. Avangrid, the company developing Vineyard Wind 1, the only other New England project under construction, did not respond to inquiries.
Klein said the Trump administration claim that it was concerned about national security issues with Revolution Wind is “specious.” She said national security is reviewed in conjunction with several departments throughout every stage of the offshore wind process, beginning with the basic identification of offshore areas that might be suitable for leasing.
“All of those things are considered throughout the process, starting with where these sales first take place,” she said. “This is arbitrary and capricious decision-making. There’s no evidence that there’s something new or unusual or that had not been considered.”
Trump himself has circulated a host of falsehoods about offshore wind — that it causes cancer and kills an outsized number of birds and whales, and that it only runs some of the time. Offshore wind is a technology that is a quarter-of-a-century old, during which time it has operated successfully in Europe. Onshore wind is far older.
A one-year assessment of South Fork Wind by its developer, Ørsted, showed the turbines operated every month of the year. The data, which came from U.S. government’s Energy Information Administration, EIA, showed some of South Fork’s highest outputs were during the winter, when the power is needed most, due to natural gas being used for heating as well electricity. The wind power can prevent electricity price spikes. 

The company also found the turbine foundations were already operating as artificial reefs that supported marine life.
The waters off the northeast U.S. are considered among the country’s best for offshore wind, given the area’s wind speeds and other factors. And since the region doesn’t have any fossil fuel resources, even with steep up-front costs, offshore wind is likely to quickly become cost effective, given the fuel is free.
A recent analysis by Politico of EIA data showed that adding wind and solar to the electricity mix tended to lower the cost of electricity, not increase it, as the Trump administration claims. The Politico analysis said: “Among the 22 states that drew higher-than-average shares of their power from wind and solar, 17 had below-average electricity prices in June, according to EIA data.”
“Undermining viable sources of energy is inconsistent with the objective of addressing an energy ‘emergency’ and will instead exacerbate energy supply challenges in the Northeast,” said Peter Shattuck, a director at Power Advisory LLC., a joint Canada/U.S.-based energy consultant. Shattuck also is an energy and grid expert with long experience in New England.
He said that, in something of a tarnished silver lining, the Trump blockage will give long-term projects such as transmission extra time to plan. But trying to strategize through all the Trump executive orders, other policy changes and legal battles is bound to make projects more expensive.
“It will likely raise the risk profile and risk premiums that are included in projects,” he said.
“The actions from the federal administration against offshore winds have been targeted and very calculated. In our view, it’s holding back a huge source of power that is so desperately needed,” said Stephanie Francoeur, senior vice president of communications and external affairs for the educational nonprofit Oceantic, which supports marine renewable energy world-wide including offshore wind.
“The administration talks about an all-of-the-above energy strategy and unleashing American energy dominance. We advocate that offshore wind is a critical component to that strategy.” She said energy needs to be depoliticized so the market, not the government, can pick the winners and losers.
“They’re looking to take apart an entire industry that could support energy demand in the U.S., address national security issues actually, because there is nothing better from a national security perspective on energy supply than generating it yourself at home, here in the U.S.,” Klein said.
Those concerns are not lost on the region’s grid operator, ISO-New England, which released an uncharacteristically blunt warning a couple of days after work stopped on Revolution Wind.
“The ISO is expecting this project to come online and it is included in our analyses of near-term and future grid reliability. Delaying the project will increase risks to reliability,” the statement read. “Unpredictable risks and threats to resources —regardless of technology — that have made significant capital investments, secured necessary permits, and are close to completion will stifle future investments, increase costs to consumers, and undermine the power grid’s reliability and the region’s economy now and in the future,” it continued.

The Revolution shutdown, along with the tax credit eliminations, unpredictability of Trump energy policies and mandates come just as the ISO was beginning its next 10-year energy forecast. The ISO has already said it expects demand to begin to increase after years of flat or even declining energy needs.
“I think in the short term we still expect to be OK, but it’s kind of in that longer-term and the uncertainty that’s brought into this that’s challenging from a grid planning standpoint,” said ISO spokesman Matt Kakley.
The ISO’s most recent estimates are that region’s annual electricity consumption will increase by about 11% over the next decade. On one hand, the removal of tax credits for electric vehicles and heat pumps could shrink that demand. On the other, their removal for solar systems and energy efficiency could increase it.
In addition to the offshore wind and the NECEC transmission line, the ISO is also expecting the six New England states to move ahead with their first joint development of transmission that, after more than a decade of delay, would finally get onshore wind from northern Maine onto the southern part of the New England grid.
Kakley said six proposals from four different developers were submitted by the Sept. 30 deadline.
Now there is the concern that the need for any federal signoffs could mean further delay, or worse.
Kakley said the ISO always deals with uncertainty when predicting power needs in the face of the complexities of long-term power and transmission projects. “This is a different sort of uncertainty than what we’ve seen,” he said. “We’re really looking at what we can do to enhance our ability to forecast and synthesize all the different factors that are coming in – adding resources, taking resources out, and seeing what that does to the region’s risk profile.”
What about solar?
Solar’s outlook is a little squishier than offshore wind’s. Yes, the coveted 30% tax credits are slated to disappear — for purchased residential systems at the end of this year and in another year for leased and commercial ones.
But costs for solar have come down dramatically over time, making it one of the cheapest forms of power to purchase. It’s also the fastest to install. So it’s possible residential consumers and commercial investors will still consider it a cost effective option.
Another unknown factor is the effect of tariffs and other restrictions on imported components on that low price and availability, as well as to storage systems that can be paired with it.
Solar is not only an industry here in the state, it is part of the solution for us.Rep. Jonathan Steinberg, D-Westport
New England has never been a hotbed for huge commercial installations the way the desert southwest and other parts of the country, with large sunny expanses, can be. But rooftop solar for homeowners and on municipal and commercial buildings still has huge potential in the region and can be extremely useful to grid reliability.
It is already more useful than the ISO ever imagined it would be. The ISO says it has prevented brownouts and worse on hot summer days with air conditioning cranked up around the region. It has sent spot market prices into negative territory, especially on sunny days when neither heat nor air conditioning is needed.
“I think there’s capital out there that’s willing to invest,” said DEEP Commissioner Dykes. “I think the question is, what’s the price of solar without federal support, and with tariffs, all these other things coming into play? How does that affect the cost benefit for investment, and how much can we bring those costs down?”
Dykes has a few ideas. One is to look into swapping out solar panels in older systems for new, more efficient panels as a means to increase power output. Another is to use — in her words — already disturbed sites, such as the site of a retired oil-fired generator, for grid-scale storage for excess solar power. Using a preexisting power site would mean there’s already connections to the distribution system.

The biggest open question for Connecticut is what might change in state policy to help make up for the lost tax credit. The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority will be weighing that as part of its reconsideration of the rules for the solar program it established. That reconsideration was already planned and underway, with recommendations due in March.
Another policy aspect involves what the state might do legislatively. Unlike most of its neighbors, Connecticut has kept caps on the amount of solar allowed, only loosening some of them in the last few years.
It’s also an open question whether state money would be authorized to make up some of the tax credit shortfall, or whether the state might do as Canada already does and establish an infrastructure bank to leverage private and public money into the financing pipeline, or create a Transmission Infrastructure Accelerator like California recently enacted to access low-cost public financing for such projects as a way to save money overall. The northeast-based advocacy group Acadia Center is helping the six New England states explore financing models.
“My only priority for next session is to set the stage for some extension or enhancement of our solar incentives,” said energy co-chair Steinberg. “This is very important to me as the godfather of solar, as Katie Dykes once called me, and that will be very hard.
“Everybody says it’s over; federal government has killed solar, game over, there’s nothing Connecticut can do. I cannot accept that,” he said. “Solar is not only an industry here in the state, it is part of the solution for us. To abandon it and not offer any incentives, or to backtrack to the point where the incentives don’t stimulate actual implementation — shame on us.”

But there are other ways to indirectly reduce costs for solar; specifically by streamling permitting, the regulatory process and siting – soft costs, as they are sometimes called.
Massachusetts is already doing that.
“We’re going to have to throw everything we can at permitting, streamlining and reducing soft costs in order to support the affordability of more solar investment for grid-scale projects,” Dykes said.
Kat Burnham, senior principal at the consulting and policy group Advanced Energy United and the state lead for all three southern New England states, said Connecticut and other states need to step up and put some financial skin as well as policy in the game. She pointed to financial tools like the Green Bank. 
“I think what’s important is to make sure that we’re looking at a range of different options and trying to find the right one that fits the particular need or situation,” she said. “What are the tools in our kit, and how do we use those so that we minimize our risk?”
She said there’s a cost to building things. And she said there’s “a cost to inaction … We can’t just sit on our hands and hope for the best.”
DEEP is also in the final throes of accepting bids for innovative energy efficiency and energy upgrade proposals designed to help lower energy bills.
In Massachusetts, for instance, all three major utilities — one of which is Eversource — have agreed to discount electric rates in the winter for people who use heat pumps. While they run on electricity, aside from being efficient, they free up other fuels like natural gas to run power plants. In Connecticut, DEEP is continuing with its focus of lowering the upfront installation costs for heat pumps.
Solutions
Barbara Kates-Garnick, a former Massachusetts energy official, now a professor of practice at Tufts University’s Fletcher School, said the path forward she sees is bringing together utilities, regulators, policy makers, other stakeholders and system participants to explore some of the out-of-the-box solutions. 
“The answers aren’t clear, but I think we have to look at how we regulate, what we regulate, and come to some conversations with the utilities so that we come to a bigger grand bargain,” she said.
She noted, however, the Biden idea of promoting clean energy by providing incentives, funding and jobs — especially in red states — “when push comes to shove, it didn’t work.”
Dykes is not ruling out increasing fossil fuel-run power as part of Connecticut’s solution to the Trump anti-renewables effort.
“It’s a possibility,” she said, noting that Lamont has talked about the need to be open to natural gas as part of a solution.   
If the offshore wind and other projects do not come online, she said, “that will certainly put us into a very challenging place in terms of having an adequate reserve margin and ability to maintain reliability even under some normal weather conditions.
“In light of that, we have to consider what are the alternatives that make the most sense to ensure we can continue to have an affordable, reliable grid in the early 2030s, and natural gas is part of that. Retaining those oil units — is that a solution that we’ll have to rely on?” Dykes said.
Dolan of the Power Generators Association, while also advocating continued use of the region’s gas and oil fleet, doesn’t have specific facilities he’d like to see targeted for reinvestment.
“I think there needs to be a refocus around the meat and potatoes about what is operating today and making sure it continues to operate tomorrow. Now the replacement energy supplies are not coming or not coming anytime soon, and for these power plants to be able to continue operating and operating at higher capacity, reinvestment is going to be necessary,” Dolan said, taking a thinly-veiled swipe at Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, which all plan to have net-zero grids in the next 20 to 25 years.
For offshore wind proponents, it’s a rebuilding and refocusing period for the industry, said Oceantic’s Francoeur, who added that more than 100 turbine foundations and towers had been installed in the active offshore wind projects since construction season opened in May.
“The industry is going to weather this administration. Who knows what the next will bring,” she said. “But I think it won’t be the orderly advancement that it once could have been.”
Former BOEM Director Klein said she thinks it’s important for states to keep supporting the offshore wind projects that are underway. 
“It’ll demonstrate to the project developers that there are important entities in the U.S. that are still supportive and want to find a path forward,” she said. “Folks aren’t building this for kicks, because it’s fun. This is about actual energy supply needs … and actually communities, when presented with alternatives, are likely to see that offshore wind is the best of the bunch.”
In the meantime, some of the wind focus may shift to Canada, where the provinces of Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador are exploring the development of huge amounts of offshore and onshore wind. Whether New England will be able to access some of that is years and likely many diplomatic twists away.
The Trump administration’s pivot away from wind and solar in particular and back toward fossil fuels is already taking the U.S. globally out of step. Recent data from the European clean energy think tank, data and policy tracker Ember showed that worldwide, in the first six months of 2025, renewables overtook coal power for the first time. And it showed that the growth in solar and wind power outpaced the growth of demand in the same time period. But while fossil fuel generation and its emissions dropped in China and India, the world’s most populated countries, fossil fuel generation and emissions increased in the U.S. Clean generation growth did not keep pace with demand growth in the U.S.

“For a bunch of largely economic reasons, we do still think that solar and wind are going to out-compete fossil fuels,” said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at the New England-based Conservation Law Foundation, though she admitted the Trump actions are slowing down their adoption.
But she wondered whether the industry would be able to pivot enough in the face of multiple challenges to keep investors confident enough to continue. 
“That, I guess, is the big question mark,” she said.
Dykes sees the same challenge. 
“Investors need to know that after a multiyear permitting process, when you have a project that’s 80% constructed, that you can bring it online, sell your power and get your money back,” she said. “And if we can’t guarantee that in the Northeast or in the U.S. anymore, I think that affects the investment climate for all types of resources at a time when we can least afford to increase investor perception of risk.”
The energy committee’s Steinberg added a warning. “That’s an excuse to be paralyzed. That’s an excuse to basically throw up our hands and say, ‘we just have to wait out the feds,’” he said. “That’s going to mean that the ramping up stage is going to be even more complicated on the other side, assuming there is another side.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Wind-Turbine-Towers-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-26 05:16:39.133693

That should have been enough to alert the 71-year-old retired Kansas farmer that things were not as they seemed, but love does […]","A 1905 double exposure ""spirit"" photograph shows a girl surrounded by spectral figures. It was made by G.S. Smallwood of Chicago. (Library of Congress)When it came time for John Seybold to place the ring on his bride’s finger, he was given a warning: he must not touch any other part of her body or risk death.
That should have been enough to alert the 71-year-old retired Kansas farmer that things were not as they seemed, but love does weird things to people. He proceeded with the ceremony, held in a darkened séance room, and later sat during a festive wedding dinner next to an empty chair reserved for his spectral bride.
Seybold was in love with “Sarah,” the ghost of a girl he had known in his youth back in Ohio, and he trusted the spirit medium who had summoned her from the great beyond.
The medium, 36-year-old Nellie Moore, had been holding classes in spiritualism in Wichita for the curious and the credulous. She had introduced others to their ethereal soulmates, but being matchmaker to Seybold and his gossamer love had been a singular achievement.
She had enjoyed material benefits from her association with the lonely farmer, who had come to her two years before from Liberal and asked to make contact with his long-dead son. In a darkened room with black curtains and a wardrobe that produced such wonders as spirit photos and floating luminous stars, Moore had done just that.
Or at least Seybold thought she had.
Soon, Moore had a new car and furniture and even deeds to the farms Seybold owned, one near Liberal, a couple of hundred miles away in southwestern Kansas, and another across the state line in Oklahoma.
When it finally dawned on Seybold that he’d been taken for his life savings, he did what many disappointed spouses do: He sued. The case must have been one of the strangest ever to come before a Wichita judge, and it made headlines across the country.
“She was really after his money,” author and historian of the strange Tim Shepard told me. “When it was all over, she got him for $7,500.”
Because I’m a diurnal skeptic when it comes to paranormal activity — my answer changes according to how often things go bump in the night — I asked Shepard for his take on Wichita’s “ghost bride” case.
Shepard is the author of two books of Kansas ghost stories, the most recent of which is “Return to the Prairie: More Tales of History and Hauntings.” He’s working on a forthcoming book about hauntings along Route 66, and as research for that book he drove the length of the mother road in a 1934 Hudson Terraplane. He’s given ghost tours across the state, worked at the Red Rocks State Historic Site at Emporia, and at 52 says he’s considered the grandfather of ghost hunting in Kansas.
“Moore’s tactics were very similar to what most spiritualists were doing in the late 1800s,” Shepard said. “The room she held her séances in was painted black, with black curtains, a large wardrobe, and a couple of chairs. She actually told him not to touch the spirits because if he did both he and she would die. Based on the details he gave of meeting Sarah, there was probably somebody hidden in the cabinet.”
At one séance, Moore was instructed to write a $500 check to an organization for wayward girls. He did so, Shepard said, and an otherworldly hand took the check.
While Seybold’s actions may seem foolish now, he seems to have had a serious interest in spiritualism, a belief system that holds the soul survives death and spirits of the dead can communicate with the living.
It all began with the Fox Sisters in western New York in the 1840s, who claimed they could communicate through raps and knocks with the spirit of a murdered peddler. The sisters were soon demonstrating spirit communication at public events that drew hundreds, dividing the press and the public on whether they were genuinely in touch with the spirit world or youthful hoaxers seeking money and attention.
During and after the Civil War, spiritualism surged in popularity. The bloodiest conflict in American history drove many to the comforting belief that they could communicate with their beloved dead. Even Mary Todd Lincoln held séances at the White House. Years after the war, the last photograph taken of Mrs. Lincoln contributed to another spiritualist-related craze, spirit photography. A photo by Boston photographer William Mumler purports to show the ghost of Abraham Lincoln looking kindly down upon her, hands on her shoulders. But it was a cheap photographic trick relying on a double exposure.
Spiritualism was not just a fad in Victorian American, but a serious societal and political movement. The first woman to run for president was Victoria Woodhull, a trance medium and “free love” radical. Kate Bender, of the murderous Bender Family of Kansas, also claimed to be one. While some mediums were perpetrating hoaxes on their credulous victims, often with the use of mechanical tricks such as the magic slate tablet, there were millions of Americans who embraced spiritualism as proof of life after death.
After the First World War, the movement gained renewed popularity. Its chief proponent was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes. Despite having created the epitome of the rational detective and being trained as a medical doctor, Doyle was gullible and proclaimed his belief in spirits, including the now-debunked Cottingley Fairies photos.
If Doyle was the champion of mediumship, Harry Houdini was its nemesis. The world-famous magician and escape artist (and friend of Doyle’s) spent much of his career campaigning against charlatanism. He devoted himself to exposing the tricks used by fake mediums. Houdini was an expert in those tricks, because he and his wife Bess had started their careers by using them.
In November 1897, they had appeared at the opera house in Garnett, Kansas, promising to name the killer of a recently murdered local woman. Houdini had already demonstrated an escape from the local jail, according to “The Secret Life of Houdini” by William Kalush and Larry Sloman. Bess had been promoted as a “psychometric clairvoyant” and her séances with Houdini were a hit. But it was all trickery, and in Garnett, according to the authors, Bess feigned a swoon at the climactic moment to avoid actually naming the murderer.
In addition to tricks like the spirit slates, charlatans used rhetorical sleight-of-hand. If a medium failed to materialize a spirit it was because there were unbelievers present. Some, like Nellie Moore, claimed they couldn’t remember anything while under control of spirits. If Seybold’s dead son or the ghost of “Sarah” told the old farmer to do things, such as take $3,000 out of the bank to give to her, she would just have to take other people’s word for it.
“During the wedding ceremony,” Shepard said, “he actually places a diamond ring on the ghost’s finger. And he said it felt solid.” But the old man was so fearful of dying from touching the ghost that he dared not embrace his bride.
Seybold, who had two previous marriages to living women, moved from Liberal to Wichita to be close to his medium and was directed to deed all of his property to her. When the aging farmer said he wanted to consult an attorney, Moore produced the ghost of Samuel B. Amidon, a recently deceased Wichita lawyer. But it seems unlikely the famous jurist would have advised him to trust Moore.
“In the very first séance, Mrs. Moore, in a semi-trance, told the Kansan his son had come to her and was telling her what to say,” reported the San Francisco Examiner in July 1927. He was cautioned that turning on the lights, or otherwise interfering with the spirits, would result in immediate death.
Like many of us, Seybold was susceptible to flattery. He was called “doctor” by those in his medium’s orbit, apparently after healing somebody of a headache, and was told he could quickly become proficient at piano if only he bought one for Moore’s home.
“Here’s a lonely old man,” Shepard said. “He believed he was really in love with a ghost. At trial, he pondered whether he was really married to her or did he need to get a divorce?”
The only time “Sarah” visited him in his bedroom, according to Shepard, Seybold became suspicious. “All he saw of her was her hands,” he said. “But instead of just fading away, she backed out of his room and around the corner. Ghosts don’t do that, do they?”
The case went to trial in November 1927.
Moore claimed that Seybold came to establish a “spiritualistic class room,” but that he soon began claiming healing powers of his own. She admitted she had been the recipient of gifts and loans secured by mortgages, but denied having hoodwinked Seybold. Witnesses testified, however, that Moore had shown them devices used in her séances, including a speaking trumpet with a rubber hose and a star that glowed with luminous paint.
“An Aged Farmer Loses his Battle with the Spooks,” the Wichita Eagle reported Nov. 17. “Superlative advice might come from the trusted sources of the spirit world, but all of Seybold’s business transactions were drawn in black and white.”
The judge, J.E. Alexander, ruled Seybold had no case because he had reached a compromise settlement with Moore before bringing his suit. Any question of spectral evidence was not considered. Even if fraud had been involved in summoning “Sarah,” it was not for the court to decide whether spirit communication was possible or had been practiced by Moore.
While Seybold’s faith in Moore was shattered, he remained an ardent spiritualist. He later married again, this time to a woman named Dollie who was an ordained spiritualist minister.
“He was looking for something,” Shepard said. “I think we all desire to connect with something beyond ourselves.”
In the years he’s been investigating the paranormal, Shepard said, he’s run into only three people he considered true mediums. One of them is a woman in Topeka, and when she does her readings for groups of 30 or 50 people, she doesn’t turn the lights off.
“Real paranormal research isn’t done in the dark,” he said. “They want the lights on. They want to see what’s happening around them. They’re trying to answer the questions we’re still searching for. Where do we go when we die? Is there life after death?”
Shepard said he was both a believer and a skeptic. He says he believes there are spirits out there, but that he doesn’t necessarily believe every story that’s told to him.
But there is still mystery to the “ghost bride” case, he said.
What was Seybold’s son’s name, and how did he die? What was Sarah’s last name? Seybold said he knew her during his youth in Dayton, but there’s no evidence from him of how she crossed over — or whether she existed at all.
We may never know.
Seybold died in 1941, aged 85, of lingering injuries suffered when he was struck by a car a year earlier at Third and Broadway in Wichita. Moore moved to California, where she died in 1974, at San Diego. She was 83.
A century after Seybold attended that first séance in Wichita, it might be easy for us to dismiss him as a fool. Here in the modern and allegedly rational age, we would never fall for such tricks. Right?
But there are people who fall in love with their AI chatbots. This year, a Colorado man “married” his digital companion, with the approval of his real-world wife. And the MIT Technology Review cautions that it’s easy to stumble into an emotional relationship with a digital assistant.
We’re all looking for something, whether it’s “Sarah” or “Siri.”
Perhaps in a hundred years, some cyber columnist will look back and be incredulous that any chatbot could ever fall for an ephemeral something made of meat and bone.

But I hate the leaves!
Sure, they look pretty as they change colors, but when those leaves are spent and fall to the ground, they present real problems for travelers.
Whether you rake your leaves yourself or have someone “blow” them for you, disposing of leaves is a hassle.
Growing up (many years ago) I remember we used to burn our leaves, heedless to the air pollution and health effects. A better alternative is to use a mulching-mower and just grind up the leaves on your lawn, providing much-needed nutrients to your soil. Or try composting them on your own property.


In most towns leaves must be bagged and left curbside for pick-up. In other towns, like Stamford, Middletown and Farmington, you can just rake the leaves into a pile at the curb, loose, and the town will vacuum them up… eventually. Often however, the piles of leaves left curbside get rained on, creating a giant soggy mess, blocking parking and leading to slippery roads. At speeds of 40–45mph, it can take up to three times longer to stop on wet leaves compared to dry pavement, with stopping distance increasing from about 80 feet to over 200–250feet.
But the slippery, almost winter-like driving conditions caused by wet leaves also affect our trains. Their wheels also slip on wet leaves and the trains’ “brains” sense it and go into emergency braking. You’ll know this is happening when the trains suddenly “dump their air”, and brake quickly.
Usually it’s just a minute or so to reset the computer and you carry on. But as in a real emergency, braking and stopping distance are quickly diminished. Which is why railroads take a number of defensive steps to literally clear the tracks.
So bad was the leaf slime problem in years past that Metro-North would have 25% of its fleet out of service as the trains’ brakes locked the wheels to a stop, grinding flat spots on the wheels, requiring repairs.
This is especially a problem on the Danbury branch, a 397-foot uphill climb from Norwalk to “The Hat City”.  Often, locomotive-pulled trains couldn’t get enough traction so that they had to skip stations like Cannondale just to keep momentum to climb uphill.
You see, on a diesel locomotive there are only eight traction wheels making contact with the rails.  But on the electric M8 cars, every car is a locomotive, so contact with the wheels is spread across the entire train, increasing traction…another good reason to re-electrify the Danbury branch.

In years past the railroad used high-pressure water jets to blast the slippery leaf pectin from the rails. But now they have resorted to lasers.
Metro-North’s Laser Train uses high-intensity lasers to remove this contaminated layer in a single pass at speeds up to 60 mph, allowing Metro-North to clean the entire network at least once a day. The train is a rare sight, usually operating overnight to clear the tracks in time for the morning rush hour.
Last year the Laser Train saw a 40% reduction in leaf-related “slip slide” events, leading to the lowest wheel-regrinding costs on record.  
So enjoy the fall and the beauty of the foliage. But beware the dangers, whether driving or training, of “slip sliding away”.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201020_CatHollowPark_KIM_09.jpg,,,2025-10-26 04:16:31.946391

Healey’s mixed message on housing for those most in need,Katherine Gergen Barnett,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/gov-healeys-mixed-message-on-housing-for-those-most-in-need/,"AS A FAMILY medicine physician at Boston Medical Center, I have cared for hundreds of individuals and families experiencing homelessness over the last 20 years. The landscape of housing services […]","AS A FAMILY medicine physician at Boston Medical Center, I have cared for hundreds of individuals and families experiencing homelessness over the last 20 years. The landscape of housing services that I can offer them continues to change, sometimes leaving me with a great sense of hope and possibility and, at other times, more hopeless than ever for my patients’ restoration to health.  
Recently, this seesaw from hope to hopelessness has become more extreme, as decisions by our state leaders seem to be simultaneously pulling in opposite directions when it comes to housing help for those most in need. Two families for whom I provide medical care illustrate the mixed messages of our state’s recent housing policies affecting the state’s most vulnerable residents. 
The first is a husband-and-wife couple in their seventies. I have cared for them both for over 10 years, and while they have both suffered a litany of medical concerns, the husband has been particularly unwell. He came to me with a history of long, uncontrolled high blood pressure and diabetes with an ensuing heart attack and stroke. He also was suffering from an untreated substance use disorder, which helped him paper over his years of untreated anxiety and depression.  
One saving grace when I met him was that he had a safe and stable place to live. From that fundamental base, we could begin to build back his health — delivering medications to his doorstep, connecting him to community services, and treating both his behavioral health concerns and substance use.  
Seven years ago, however, this fundamental base disappeared when he lost his housing. Three years into retirement, he no longer had enough savings for a home. Ironically, he was a retired construction foreman from Boston, where throughout his 30-year career, he had poured his talent into building homes in Roxbury and Dorchester.  
Despite years of working with incredible housing advocates, my patient and his wife have not been able to find a stable place to live and continue to sleep on loved ones’ couches in a distant Boston suburb. As a result, his health has begun to rapidly deteriorate again. It is harder to come in for appointments, to receive his medications when he does not know where he will next be sleeping, and to keep his diabetes medications in the fridge or his diet filled with fresh fruits and vegetables. 
However, in the last few months, things have begun to look at least a little more hopeful for this gentleman and patients like him. Early this year, Gov. Healey released “A Home for Everyone,” the state’s first comprehensive plan to address Massachusetts’s housing challenge. The plan aims to build 200,000 new housing units by 2030. This ambitious goal came a year after the governor signed the Affordable Homes Act, which authorized more than $5 billion in spending and included nearly 50 policy initiatives to spur more housing. In addition, three new commissions have been established to prioritize the residents of these future homes: elderly, extremely low income (earning less than 30 percent of the median income), and individuals with disabilities (physical, sensory, intellectual, mental health or neurodivergent).  
My patient and his wife fit squarely into all three of these categories. Though the housing needs among these groups far outstrip the available supply, since the launch of these state initiatives, I have begun writing letters advocating that, given his medical conditions, he cannot be living with unstable housing — this time with greater hope that these letters will make an impact.  
For another family in my care struggling to find stable housing, the situation has not turned hopeful, but is, in fact, more grim as a result of recent actions by state government.  
They first came to me for a prenatal visit. New to Massachusetts, nobody in the family had a primary care provider and, seeing their complex social needs, I agreed to have all family members (the mother, father, older sibling, and soon to be infant) establish care with me that day.   
When they moved to Massachusetts, this family was able to benefit from our strong 40-year precedent of the “right to shelter” law, signed by Gov. Dukakis in 1983, that mandated shelter services for parents with children and pregnant women.  
Partnering with incredible organizations such FamilyAid, homeless families have been able to find shelter and transition to housing. Through the safety of stable shelter, the mother in this family was able to expend her energy finding and receiving adequate prenatal care — yielding the best possible outcomes for both the newborn and her future health.  
The parents were also able to start securing employment resources as well as educational support and starting to get back on their financial feet. Like many families living in Boston, this one was living on meager wages (though did not qualify as extremely low income).  
Boston, surprisingly perhaps for some, carries the unenviable statistic of having the fifth largest number of families living in poverty among 30 of the largest US cities, with poverty levels 65 percent higher than the national average. This translates to the third highest rate and the fifth highest number of homeless families among comparable large cities. However, the “right to shelter” has now been dismantled through a recent set of mandates from the Healey  administration, limiting the number of shelters available (from a high of 7,500 family shelter units in 2023 to 4,000 units by 2026) as well as imposing a six-month maximum stay in shelters.  
These new rules place this family, and thousands of families like them, at dire risk. In addition to the devastating health outcomes for adults experiencing homelessness, children who are homeless are also at high risk for a myriad of downstream health outcomes. These include such concerns as higher adverse childhood events, higher risk of future behavioral health illness such as depression and suicide attempts, higher rates of future substance use, lower levels of educational attainment, and higher risk of homelessness as an adult.  
The current fiscal constraints of the state and the high cost of shelter services are legitimate concerns. But turning our backs on families in need is not just wrong; it’s shortsighted and works against the long-range goals the governor has set. Children experiencing homelessness are at high risk of becoming the next generation of homeless individuals that Gov. Healey and her team are trying to help in her laudable “Home for Everyone” plan.  
As I bear witness to the housing journeys of these two families and countless others like them, I cannot help but wonder if Massachusetts leaders have lost sight of the whole picture. If we are truly to address the housing crisis in our state, we cannot only work to find housing for our elderly and disabled while simultaneously giving up on our children and families.  
Our health as a Commonwealth depends upon the current and future health of each of us.

Dan Glickman of Wichita proposes Kansas Democrats deepen ties to rural Kansas with economic messages and a dose of self-deprecating humor.,"Former U.S. Rep. Dan Glickman urges Kansas Democrats to expand the party's base into rural communities with messages tied to meat-and-potatoes economic issues that delve into leadership shortcomings of President Donald Trump. (Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)WICHITA — Fifty years ago, Wichita school board member Dan Glickman turned to his wife and declared interest in running for the U.S. House.
“She said, ‘You don’t have a chance. You don’t have a shot,’ ” he said, recounting a campaign that would precede his 18 years of service in Congress representing the Wichita region.
The Kansas Democrat defeated eight-term incumbent Garner Shriver, a low-key Republican with the misfortune of running for reelection in the post-Watergate era. Glickman’s rookie run for Congress didn’t feature a mountain of cash — he raised a mere $100,000. He attributed success, in part, to relentless shoe-leather campaigning and knocking on 45,000 homes in the district.
“I don’t know if that could happen today, because you need a message, you need money, you need time and you need luck,” he said at an event Saturday sponsored by the Sedgwick County Democratic Party and Wichita State University Young Democrats.
Fast forward 50 years, Glickman said, and the imperative was for Democrats to win control of the U.S. House in 2026. Three of Kansas four congressional seats are held by Republicans, but the Kansas Legislature could redraw maps to make it difficult for Democratic U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids to win reelection next year.
Glickman said Democratic control of the House would bring more balance to the federal government because the GOP currently had simultaneous hold of the House and Senate in the second term of President Donald Trump.
“We’ve got to elect a Democratic Congress,” Glickman said. “I’m not going to tell you it’s going to be easy. One of the reasons why is because, perhaps, our messaging isn’t right.”
 
Appeal to rural voters
Glickman said Democrats shouldn’t be a party of culture warriors. The agenda should reflect meat-and-potatoes economic issues that included health care, education and employment, he said. The objective in Kansas, he said, must be to expand Democrats’ base from population centers such as Johnson County and nominate candidates more relevant to interests of rural Kansans.
“We cannot win without appealing to rural, small-town America,” said Glickman, who served as secretary of agriculture under President Bill Clinton. “There’s a lot of raw material there. I don’t know if they’re going to go through with this, but the president is proposing to give … $25 billion to the government of Argentina so they can sell more beef into the United States.”
Trump’s proposal has been condemned by U.S. livestock producers who earned solid returns on beef sales at the same time domestic grain farmers suffered a period of low market prices and high input costs.
The president’s plan to lower grocery prices with imports could be an opportunity for Democratic candidates to speak with rural voters about a topic central to survival of their communities, Glickman said.
“Focus on issues that people care about — economic issues, inflation, cost of health care, research and America’s role in the world,” he said.
 
Negotiation and humor
Glickman, who held his seat in the U.S. House from 1977 to 1995, when ousted by GOP nominee Todd Tiahrt, said debate about fixing what ailed Washington, D.C., shouldn’t be an exclusively partisan conversation. He said there were “loads of good Republicans who don’t like what’s happening either.”
He said the government shutdown should be resolved through negotiation. But the messages Americans see each night on television have been dominated by partisan attacks. Trump should be a key player in working out a deal, he said.
“That’s what the American political system is all about,” Glickman said. “It’s really difficult with a president who doesn’t want to get his hands dirty when getting in there to solve the problem.”
Glickman, who also worked as chief executive officer of the Motion Picture Association of America, said Democrats could better connect with voters by deploying a sense of humor. The idea isn’t to be stand-up comedians, he said, but to offer voters a slice of self-deprecating humor that illustrates personal life lessons.
He pointed to Presidents Ronald Reagan and Franklin Roosevelt as role models in this regard, and criticized the current array of national politicians as humorless.
“I have found that almost every successful person — every leader that is successful in politics or whatever field — has a decent sense of humor,” Glickman said. “They could laugh at themselves. I have never seen (Trump) laugh at himself. Only at other people.”
He said recent No Kings rallies across the United States successfully brought unity among people frustrated by Trump. His praise elicited a round of applause from more than 100 people at the luncheon on the Wichita State University campus.
“Are you going to follow up? If you don’t, they’re a total waste of time,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Dan-Glickman-1-wichita-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-25 17:56:47.694699

Republicans expect to craft political districts more to their liking if they receive a favorable ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court later this year.,"The Louisiana Senate voted along party lines to move state election dates in 2026 back by about a month. (Photo by Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)The Louisiana Senate voted along political party lines Saturday to push back 2026 election dates in an effort to leave as much time as possible to redraw Louisiana’s congressional map. Republicans expect to craft political districts more to their liking if they receive a favorable ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court later this year. 
The GOP Senate majority, made up entirely of white senators, outvoted the Democrats, all but one of whom are Black, 27-9, on Senate Bill 1. The legislation moves the political candidate qualifying period and two spring election dates for congressional primary contests back by approximately one month. 
Elections scheduled for April 18 and May 30 would move to May 16 and June 27 respectively.
The delayed election timeline will create more opportunity for the Republican-controlled legislature to draw new U.S. House districts where Black voters, who overwhelmingly vote for Democrats, have less influence over who gets elected.  
Louisiana’s current congressional map, passed in early 2024, is made up of six House seats, including two districts with a majority Black electorate. Those two seats are held by Black Democrats, Troy Carter of New Orleans and Cleo Fields of Baton Rouge. 
Should the Supreme Court allow it, state lawmakers will likely approve a new congressional map that includes one or zero majority-Black districts, even though the state’s population is approximately one-third Black. This would make it harder for Black officials and Democrats to be elected to Congress.

Republicans are hopeful the Supreme Court will hand down a ruling in the Callais v. Louisiana case that not only allows them to draw new maps but on an expedited schedule. 

While Supreme Court decisions typically come out in late spring or early summer, Louisiana Republican officials want justices to issue a ruling in this case by the end of December. 

The accelerated timeline would allow state lawmakers to draw new U.S. House seats in time for the next congressional election in November. If the decision comes out later, lawmakers would likely have to wait another two years — the length of a term in the U.S. House — to use new political districts.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

The Supreme Court will not necessarily rule by the end of the year, however. Even if it does, Louisiana would probably not be obligated to change its political map in time for the November election contests. 
Previously, when the Supreme Court has struck down election maps as unconstitutional, it has not required that new maps be drawn and used if the election process is already underway or about to start. The court has permitted – even required – states to wait to use their newly compliant maps in the next cycle, which would be 2028 for Louisiana’s U.S. House seats.
But President Donald Trump has urged Republican officials in states across the country to redraw their congressional districts to favor the GOP ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. More Republican districts would increase the chances the U.S. House would remain under Republican control and aligned with Trump. 
In Louisiana, GOP lawmakers have tried to downplay arguments from Democrats that their efforts to push back the election dates are related to Trump’s push to have more Republican seats. 

Republicans have said the moving of the election dates is simply allowing more time to get clarity from the Supreme Court over redistricting requirements. 

“We could draw a 6-0 map. We could draw a 5-0 map [that removes majority-Black districts]. That’s not what we’re here doing,” said Sen. Caleb Kleinpeter, a white Republican from Port Allen and sponsor of the legislation, ahead of the Senate floor vote Saturday. 
Democrats countered that the election dates were being moved for no other reason than to accommodate the Republicans’ desires to pass a map with fewer majority-Black districts faster. 
“Remember when President Trump so boldly stated to the state legislatures to go and get me more Republican congressional districts?” Sen. Katrina Jackson, a Black Democrat from Monroe, said Saturday. “We’re not here for drawing districts, but it seems like we’re here in the hopes that the Supreme Court will rule a certain way.”
Moving election dates will affect more than just next year’s congressional races. 

Municipal elections and ballot initiatives that were supposed to be voted on at the same time as the congressional primaries will also be pushed back in anticipation of the Supreme Court ruling. 

Depending on what the Supreme Court decides, it’s possible that some municipalities could also redraw their political districts ahead of elections to provide Black voters with less influence at the local level too, Sen. Gerald Boudreaux of Lafayette, who is the head of the Senate Democratic Caucus, said in an interview this week. 
Lawmakers also had to write an exception into Senate Bill 1 that allows for local ballot measures concerning bonds, debt and taxes to move forward on the newly proposed election dates in May and June if those measures were initially pegged to current election dates that could be eliminated. 
On Saturday, the Senate also voted to push back the election dates of five proposed constitutional amendments from April 18 to May 16  through Senate Bill 2. These amendments include those that affect public school teacher compensation, the mandatory retirement age for state judges and a reworking of state civil service. 
Democrats argued that these adjustments are evidence the legislature is acting too swiftly to adjust elections. 
“I wish that this debate was as simple as what some people are trying to fashion – saying this is about moving dates,” Sen. Sam Jenkins, a Black Democrat from Shreveport, told his colleagues. “It’s really not that simple.”
Republicans said the changes they are to making are not consequential.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/electionday2022-009-1-1024x6831742327334-1.jpg,,,2025-10-25 16:01:34.157887

The Eagles offense performed well in the passing game and the running game amassing over 200 yards on the ground and through the air. It was the passing game that got their offense going in the first quarter.
Junior quarterback Drew Marks and senior receiver Phoenix Henriquez connected four times on Smyrna’s opening drive as the offense traversed 64 yards down the field. Henriquez’s final catch of the drive was a nine yard touchdown that scored the game’s first points. 
The Eagles scored on their subsequent possession on a diving effort from senior Kahmaj Kearney at the goal line. Henriquez completed Smyrna’s first half scoring with a rushing touchdown right before halftime.
The Hawks scored once in the first half cutting the Eagles lead down to ten with less than six minutes remaining until halftime. 
Quarterback Jayden Goffigan and receiver Jordan Triplett connected on a 33-yard throw down the right side of the field that brought the offense to the Smyrna 16 yard line. Junior running back Joel Buck finished the drive with a two yard touchdown run off a direct snap, cutting into Smyrna’s lead. 
The Hawks scored again on their first possession after halftime driving 68 yards down the field. Junior running back Derek Foxmoor scored the touchdown with a two yard run up the middle from the shotgun formation. 
Smyrna scored the final three touchdowns of the second half all of which came on the ground. Henriquez, Marks and freshman Terrell Ingram all ran for a touchdown in the second half helping Smyrna to its second highest point total this season. 
The Eagles have two more games remaining in the regular season with a home matchup against Dover scheduled for November 1 and a road matchup against Sussex Central on November 7.

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The South Dakota Department of Social Services plans to revamp its opioid treatment and prevention grants, with a three-tiered system including “transformative” grants up to $2 million.
Department officials announced the new grant structure using opioid settlement funds at Tuesday’s Board of Social Services meeting.
“Just trying to put some of the same window dressing on some of the same old methodologies isn’t what we’re after,” Secretary Matt Althoff said. “We’re looking for true innovation, a true effort to earnestly fill the gaps that exist today.”
South Dakota is projected to receive just under $99 million in settlement funds by 2038, based on the department’s settlement dashboard. The money comes from a series of nationwide settlements with the makers and sellers of the opioid painkillers that contributed to a spike in drug addiction and overdoses.
The majority of that funding will be distributed and spent by the state, while 30% will be used by local governments.
The state has received about $23 million in its share of the funds so far, with about $11.7 million uncommitted. The department plans to reserve about $12 million in a trust fund to sustain the state’s opioid abatement plan, in case federal funding for other substance use-related grants ends. That equates to about 25% of each disbursement received over the life of the settlement.

Most spent funds have gone toward the community grant program, with the state using part of its share to give additional money to local entities and organizations, followed by the prescription drug monitoring program, naloxone distribution (naloxone is a medication used to reverse the effects of an opioid overdose) and overdose follow-up programs.
Brenna Koedam, behavior health division chief, said there is an increased number of referrals for opioid use and other substance use disorder treatment services, increased understanding in how to handle substance use among providers, reduced burnout among first responders and law enforcement, and reduced stigma surrounding opioid use disorder in the last few years. She did not explain to the board how most of those achievements were calculated or measured, though she attributed them to programming assisted by the settlement fund.
Opioid related deaths in South Dakota decreased to 39 in 2024, compared to 2023’s peak of 47. According to the state’s Drug Overdose Surveillance and Epidemiology data, 844 South Dakotans visited emergency departments for suspected drug overdoses — opioid and other — in the first six months of this year. That’s down by one visit compared to the same timeframe in 2024 and up by 44 compared to 2023. 
Attorney General Marty Jackley criticized the department in August for not spending the opioid settlement funds as quickly as he wanted, and not sending enough of the money to the city governments of Sioux Falls and Rapid City. Althoff said at the Tuesday meeting, and in response to Jackley’s comments in August, that the department needed to spend COVID-19 relief funds that were expiring before they spent more settlement dollars.

Koedam announced Tuesday that the department will restructure its community grants into three tiers:

Small grants of up to $5,000 for immediate or short-term projects, offered on an ongoing basis and focused on prevention, such as funding a speaker on opioid use and risks at a school district.
Mid-size grants of up to $50,000, offered twice a year, intended for projects that can be completed in a year.
“Transformative” grants of up to $2 million intended for regional innovation, which could include workforce development to attract more workers to the behavioral health field, based on a letter of interest from potential grant recipients.

Althoff said South Dakota’s substance use problems extend beyond opioids, citing meth and alcohol as other examples.
“The opioid dollars will not necessarily be able to just solve the opioid problem,” Althoff said. “We’re trying to be very creative about how we do this in ways that — even if opioid isn’t the first level of addiction, it might be even tertiary involvement — it’s all bridged and interrelated.”
Koedam added that the department signed contracts with Colorado-based Steadman Group and the University of South Dakota totaling just under $325,000 to conduct a statewide opioid needs assessment, which will identify gaps in South Dakota’s treatment and prevention infrastructure. The needs assessment is expected to be completed by spring 2026.

A visit to The Grove and LSU’s Cajun feasts,"Maura Carey and Brett Martel, Associated Press",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/25/tailgating-traditions-college-football-the-grove-lsu-cajun-feasts/,"Tailgating is a beloved tradition in the South, rivaling college football itself. Fans at Ole Miss gather at The Grove for elaborate setups and the Walk of Champions. At LSU, tailgates feature Cajun cuisine.","In the South, there is only one thing that can rival college football itself: the party before kickoff.
Pinpointing the exact origins of tailgating is near impossible. Some trace it to Nov. 6, 1869, when Rutgers and New Jersey (later Princeton) played in the first college football game. Others credit Green Bay Packers fans, who folded down pickup truck tailgates for makeshift pregame seating during the team’s inaugural season in 1919.
Arguments over who has the best tailgating traditions are as old as the sport itself and the creativity is as varied as the fans themselves. From Bevo Boulevard (Texas) and the Tiger Walk (Clemson) to the Vol Navy (Tennessee) and the sailgating on boats outside Husky Stadium (Washington), the options are endless.
The tradition runs deep in the South, and few do it like Ole Miss and LSU.
It’s hours before kickoff. Ole Miss is hosting LSU in its biggest game of the season so far, and tens of thousands of fans gather at The Grove, a 10-acre plot in the center of campus surrounded by oak trees. The grassy area has transformed into a sea of red and blue tents decked out with chandeliers and elaborate spreads.

Anticipation builds for The Walk of Champions – one of the program’s longest-standing traditions where coaches and players are met with applause and “Hotty Toddy” cheers as they exit the buses and pass under the archway en route to the stadium.
Elizabeth Heiskell, a caterer from Oxford, is at the center of it all. She’s become a Grove regular since marrying into the fan base, and she wouldn’t want it any other way.
“It is a beautiful space right in the middle of campus with gorgeous trees that have been here forever,” Heiskell said. “There’s just really no place like it. It’s not like we’re, you know, dropping a tailgate in some parking lot. I mean, it is so green and so beautiful.”
Like most Grove goers, Heiskell is dressed for the occasion. She’s wearing a red and white blouse, gold jewelry and a fabulous pair of red sunglasses that tie the whole look together. This isn’t an outfit she just threw together; gameday getups are carefully curated.
“Of course everybody gets dressed up. I mean, we shop all year long for our game clothes,” she said. “When they say it’s a red game, honey, we’re all gonna wear red.”
The pregame buzz carries into Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, where nearly 68,000 fans watch Ole Miss hold off LSU for a 24-19 victory.
Two weeks later, crawfish boils and Cajun spices replace the chandeliers and elegance of The Grove as the party moves 330 miles South to Baton Rouge.
Fresh off a bye week, LSU is hosting South Carolina in Death Valley, where home-field advantage is alive and well, thanks to a passionate fan base of their own.

Gameday preparation begins early for Wayne Breaux, a fisherman from New Iberia, Louisiana. He drives up to his condo near campus on Thursday night, reserves his spot on Friday and begins the setup early Saturday. After 35 years, his tailgate has become quite the attraction. Breaux regularly welcomes football, basketball and softball coaches and recruits.
“Tailgating is an event in itself. A lot of people, even if they don’t have tickets to the game, they’ll come out and enjoy the atmosphere, the friendship and the camaraderie,” Breaux said. “I love the football game itself, but tailgating is a very close second.”
Like every good tailgate, Breaux’s setup centers around the menu. His spread features speckled trout, red fish, steak tips, pork loin, and of course, jambalaya and boudin.
“We got one rule,” Breaux said. “If you leave here thirsty or hungry, it’s your fault. It’s not mine.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/21135351/AP25290045208644.jpg,,,2025-10-25 08:16:40.899223

“Hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go,” protestors chanted in the middle of Times Square, among a sea of signs that read “love reigns not kings,” “gays against faux-king Trump,” “we stand with … our trans family,” and “the future is coming.”
On Saturday, Oct. 18, independent analysts estimated that the No Kings March drew between
5 and 8 million people, and organizers say over 7 million people attended 2,700 events across all 50 states. The event, which was organized to push against the rise of authoritarianism in the U.S., was the largest single-day protest in America since 1970.

Among the crowd were countless LGBTQ people, fighting back against an administration that has introduced a litany of anti-LGBTQ executive orders and used vile rhetoric to denigrate queer people.
This backsliding of LGBTQ rights, according to experts, has a deep connection to authoritarianism, with research showing that when governments weaken protections for queer and trans people, they often turn to broader democratic institutions next.
“Threats to democratic institutions and threats to LGBTQ rights are mutually reinforcing, generating a vicious cycle that strengthens authoritarian control,” said Ari Shaw, director of International Programs at the Williams Institute. “Increased persecution of minority groups, including LGBTI people, is itself evidence of democratic backsliding by indicating the erosion of liberal democratic norms meant to protect minority rights.”
 Legal Abuse of Power

One of the ways the Trump administration’s abuse of power has been most evident is through its legal actions.
On Jan. 20, Trump signed 26 executive orders, the most signed by any president on their first day. Since then, he’s penned hundreds more—more than President Joe Biden signed during his entire four-year term. In many cases, he bypassed Congress in the process, leaving elected legislators on the sidelines.
Many of these actions have targeted LGBTQ rights. Trump has used executive orders to ban transgender people from serving in the military, limit participation of transgender students in school sports, and direct federal agencies to recognize only two sexes.
He’s also slashed HIV funding at a staggering rate. Uncloseted Media estimates that the National Institutes of Health has terminated more than $1 billion worth of grants to HIV-related research, including 71% of all global HIV grants.
“The specific reason that I’m protesting is actually on the shirt I’m wearing,” said Brooklynite Jeffrey Cipriano. “My best friend works for an organization called AIDS United. … His job is to travel the country and help people get AIDS medication, specifically trans and unhoused community members. But his job is at risk.”
Executive orders are meant to direct how existing laws are implemented—but Trump has ignored democratic norms, filling agencies with loyalists, using orders to go after opponents, and pushing the limits of what the law allows.
“The President is directing various executive branch officials to adopt policy that has either not yet been adopted by Congress or is in violation of existing statutory law,” said Jodi Short, professor of law at UC Law San Francisco. “The analogy to a king … is the sheer consolidation of executive branch power in one individual.”
“Illegality has been rampant,” added Dave Owen, Short’s colleague. “People are often cynical about government … but most of the time, the executive branch takes the law seriously. This administration has broken with those traditions.”
 Revolt Against Executive Orders

Many Americans have recognized this. A survey from April found that 85% of Americans agreed that the president should obey federal court rulings even if he doesn’t like them.
In response to Trump’s overreach, more than 460 legal challenges have been filed across the country challenging his executive actions. One is a federal lawsuit by Lambda Legal and the Human Rights Campaign Foundation that challenges the constitutionality of the transgender military ban. Another lawsuit challenges Trump’s order withholding funds from medical providers offering gender-affirming care to minors.

Both lawsuits are why 17-year-old Zoe Boik joined the protest with her dad. “Obviously, I’m disappointed and kind of helpless because there’s nothing I can directly do to change or impact anything that’s going on,” said Boik, who identifies as pansexual and gender fluid.
 LGBTQ Rights and Democratic Backsliding

This type of blatant discrimination is often a key sign of a country moving closer to authoritarianism. A 2023 research paper by Shaw and colleagues found that anti-LGBTQ stigma may contribute “to the erosion of democratic norms and institutions.”
“The level of acceptance of LGBTQ people is closely associated with the strength of democracy in a country,” said Shaw. “In some cases, rising anti-LGBTQ rhetoric or policies preceded a broader decline in democracy.”
Examples include Brazil under Bolsonaro and Poland under the Law and Justice Party, both of which saw LGBTQ rights regress alongside democratic erosion.
When it comes to LGBTQ rights, Trump has mirrored these leaders—even though most Americans don’t support it. A 2022 survey found that 80% of Americans favor laws protecting LGBTQ people against discrimination.
“The definition of an authoritarian system is a system where power is consolidated in one individual whose power is unchecked by any other institution,” said Short. “And I fear that’s the direction this administration is trying to move us.”
 Attacks on Higher Education

Another common tool in the authoritarian playbook is attacking higher education.
Trump has pressured top universities to eliminate DEI programs and inclusive policies for transgender athletes, calling them “ideological capture.”

“I’m here because I’m angry and I feel that we aren’t angry enough,” said Maddy Everlith, a gender studies major at Pace University. “Being a woman of color in America and having so many intersectional identities … I want to stand up and advocate for other people.”
 Scapegoating Transgender People

Beyond laws and policies lies a vile rhetoric used to scapegoat trans Americans. During the 2024 campaign, Trump spent roughly $215 million on anti-trans ads—more than five times what he spent on the economy.
“What Trump has done is he’s taken people that haven’t done anything wrong and has turned them into scapegoats,” said Lars Kindem, a retired pilot. “His language is hateful, petty, mean and hurtful.”
 Christian Nationalism

This scapegoating has fueled Trump’s alliance with white evangelical Protestants—the only major denomination in which most believe society has gone too far in accepting transgender people.
“For Christian nationalists, attacking LGBTQ rights is the first pillar in destroying civil rights for all,” said Heidi Beirich of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. “This has happened in countries like Hungary and Poland, and now it’s happening here.”
 Moving Forward

As the country bleeds toward authoritarianism, LGBTQ protestors are encouraging people to use their voice—something the queer community knows well. A 2012 survey found that queer folks are 20 times more likely to be active in liberal social movements than their straight, cis counterparts.
“It is imperative that people continue to pay attention,” said Short. “We have to engage in political action and resist inappropriate assertions of authority and continue to show up and vote for our democracy.”
Seventeen-year-old Zoe Boik is ready. She remembers crying the day after Trump won in 2016. Now, she’s eager to vote in the next election.
“My fears about Trump don’t stem specifically from me being queer, but from his authoritarianism as a whole,” she said. “I am scared about how far he will move into dictatorship, and my biggest fear is that our right to vote will be compromised.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-8-1024x737.png,,,2025-10-25 07:16:56.258027

Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said the decision left him feeling “extremely disappointed.” Crowley spoke from his office at the Milwaukee County Courthouse Friday, saying that the funds would go towards repairing parks, government buildings, and other public infrastructure damaged by the so-called flooding which swept communities two months ago. 
When the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) initially sent disaster relief after the floods, Crowley said he “commended the Trump administration,” and that “I thought that we were putting politics behind us in making sure that communities can recover.” Crowley said that by Friday over $123 million in financial assistance has been distributed to county residents for home repairs.

But it’s not just local businesses and homes that were damaged. The rainfall, which fell in a torrential downpour on the weekend of Aug. 9, left Hart Park in Wauwatosa underwater. Downed trees and other debris were strewn along roadways. Cars, swept away by the overnight flooding, were abandoned in the street for days. 
Over 1,800 homes were left damaged or destroyed, with an estimated $34 million in damage to public infrastructure. “The preliminary damage assessments show that the damage that we saw throughout all six counties is more than significant,” said Crowley. “Roads and bridges that our residents rely on sustained substantial damage. Public buildings and facilities were not only washed away, but in some cases had significant mold contamination that will also impact the public health and safety of our residents. Our parks and our trails, they were damaged, which will harm our quality of life in the short term, as well as the long term, and the list goes on.”
Crowley pointed to Hart Park as a prime example of an area with lingering damage additional funds could remedy. As the disaster relief is denied, Milwaukee County is also in the middle of crafting a budget which will not be padded by COVID-era federal funds. County supervisors are currently debating amendments to Crowley’s proposed $1.4 billion budget, which carries cuts to transit services and eviction legal defense programs and increases property taxes by 4.1%.
“We’re already making challenging decisions about funding not only programs and services, but future infrastructure spending, and capital projects that are needed not only now, but in the years ahead. Today’s action by the Trump administration will send us back even further. It will delay progress in our recovery efforts from this natural disaster, and it will place a financial burden solely on local taxpayers who have already had to sacrifice so much as a result of these floods.”

Gov. Tony Evers issued a statement Friday saying he filed an appeal asking the Trump administration to release more than $26.5 million in public assistance for infrastructure repair  it has denied. “Denying federal assistance doesn’t just delay recovery, it sends a message to our communities that they are on their own, and that the Trump administration doesn’t think over $26 million in damages to public infrastructure is worthy of their help,” Evers said in a press statement. “I couldn’t disagree more. The federal government should not expect our communities to go through this alone, and we are going to fight tooth and nail to ensure they get every possible resource to rebuild and recover. We are hopeful that the Trump administration will reconsider this decision, so we can make sure folks have the resources and support they need.”
The denial comes during a federal government shutdown that has lasted nearly a month. In a letter to Evers, FEMA said that while the flood damage was significant, assessments determined that “the public assistance program is not warranted.” 
The storm and flooding was dubbed a “thousand year storm” and dumped record-breaking amounts of rain essentially overnight. Wisconsin now has 30 days to send an appeal. 
“Turning your back on families facing washed-out roads, damaged schools, and flooded homes because they’re not seen as political allies is unconscionable,” said Kerry Schumann, executive director of Wisconsin Conservation Voters in a statement. “These communities didn’t cause this crisis, but they’re living through it. They deserve leadership that helps them recover and protects them from the next flood, not one that deepens the damage.”

“By denying federal assistance, the Trump Administration is leaving Wisconsin communities to fend for themselves,” said U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin. “No community can pick up these pieces alone, and Wisconsinites need support so they can rebuild and be on the road to recovery. I hope my Republican colleagues will join me in calling on the Trump administration to step up to the plate and be here for Wisconsin communities left in the lurch.
U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, Democrat of Milwaukee, also expressed  frustration. “Our state was forced to wait nearly two months for the Trump administration’s ill-advised and disappointing decision,” Moore said in a statement. “Communities in Milwaukee, which are still recovering, are counting on federal assistance to help fund critical repairs to public roadways, buildings, vehicles, and equipment that were severely damaged.” Nevertheless, Moore said, “Wisconsinites do not give up.” 
Rep. Kalan Haywood (D-Milwaukee) also issued a statement condemning the denial. Haywood said that the Trump administration “is sending a clear message to the people of Wisconsin – ‘we do not care about you’.” Haywood added that, “these funds are so badly needed to repair infrastructure, businesses, and schools. These are all essential to reverse the trend of President Trump’s faltering economy. Our residents pay millions in federal taxes and they should not face these hardships alone.” 
Haywood added  that Wisconsin’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) “is on the verge of drying up.” while  “communities are left to rebuild major infrastructure on their own, it is disappointing that the White House is choosing a $300 million ballroom ego-project over the well-being of the people of our state. It is my hope that FEMA reconsiders this decision to ensure that Wisconsin residents have a chance to recover and prosper. Wisconsinites deserve better and should demand better.”
Two bills related to disaster relief (AB-580 and AB-581) have been introduced to the Wisconsin Legislature as communities process the news. One bill would require the Department of Military Affairs to create a program to award grants to individuals and businesses severely impacted by disasters related to a state of emergency declared by the governor. Grants of no more than $25,000 could be awarded under the bill to an individual to help repair a residence, and grants of no more than $50,000 would go to businesses. The other bill would also work through the Department of Military Affairs, and would appropriate $10 million in  disaster assistance grants for individuals, and $20 million in grants for businesses in the 2025-26 fiscal year.

John Jagler (L) and Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R). Republicans scolded State Superintendent Jill Underly for not appearing at a hearing prompted by a Cap Times investigation of teacher sexual misconductU.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, the leading Republican candidate for governor of Wisconsin, held a press conference on the steps of the state Capitol Thursday to declare his outrage over a Cap Times investigation that tracked more than 200 cases of alleged child sexual abuse by Wisconsin teachers and suggested a lack of accountability and transparency by the state Department of Public Instruction. 
Bolstering Tiffany’s case, State Superintendent Jill Underly decided to skip Thursday’s Senate hearing on the controversy. Instead, Underly traveled to Indiana to accept an award from her alma mater, leaving DPI staff to endure questioning by members of a state Senate committee eager to hang child sex abuse allegations around the necks of DPI, Gov. Tony Evers and other Democrats.
Recognizing an opportunity, Tiffany parachuted in to add his voice to the chorus. “You will never have to wonder if I will show up,” Tiffany declared. “I will always be there for Wisconsin and our children, even when state Democrat leaders fail to do so.” He drew a tenuous connection between the accusation that DPI has provided insufficient oversight of predatory teachers to bashing the state agency for “lower standards” in schools and for embracing diversity, equity and inclusion. ”DPI spent two hours a week creating a DEI plan, but couldn’t find the time to investigate these cases,” Tiffany declared. He promised that if he’s elected governor he will ensure proper misconduct investigations of teachers and create a public dashboard showing why they lost their licenses, “most of all,” he added, “we’re going to educate kids, not indoctrinate.” 
As soon as Tiffany finished converting the story about abuse by teachers into red meat for his campaign, state Democrats jumped into the mosh pit, accusing him of hypocrisy because he voted against releasing the Epstein files. 
None of this mud-slinging sheds any light on what’s happening to kids in Wisconsin schools or how the state can better protect them.
Several of my daughters’ friends at Madison East High School were targeted by David Krutchen, a popular teacher who had close relationships with many of his students and who, it turned out, spent years spying on girls during overnight field trips, placing hidden cameras in hotel bathrooms and bedrooms. The Krutchen case took a heavy toll on those kids and their families. It was a shocking, disgusting betrayal of the students by a trusted adult. For years the court hearings dragged on, and traumatized students had to keep showing up to testify. Finally, Krutchen went to prison.
According to the Cap Times story, which includes interviews with some of Krutchen’s victims, DPI “shielded” more than 200 cases of teacher sexual misconduct from the public. That frame could lead you to believe that DPI was protecting pedophile teachers the same way the Catholic Church spent years shuffling pedophile priests around to avoid. But that’s not the impression I got from DPI’s testimony. In a video Underly posted on Facebook, and in her deputies’ testimony to legislators, the agency insisted that allowing teachers to voluntarily give up their licenses is not a “loophole” to end embarrassing investigations but ensures teachers who face misconduct charges are entered into a national database that can be accessed by other state education departments.
The Cap Times story, aided by a successful open records request, does give the sense that DPI has a slipshod system for keeping track of misconduct investigations, with just two staff people in charge of hundreds of cases, information stored on a Google spreadsheet, and 20% of cases where it’s unclear what type of misconduct was investigated. 
In its defense, DPI points out that the Legislature cut the agency’s budget by millions of dollars and they are doing their best. That point would have sounded better coming from Underly herself, instead of her deputies who had to fill in because she couldn’t bother to appear in person to demonstrate she actually cares about these horrible cases. 
Underly’s failure to show up and address the repercussions of the story is inexcusable. As the top educator in the state, she needs to reassure students and their parents that she cares about them and is on their side.
But the Republicans rushing to connect Underly’s weak leadership to all of their talking points about schools are equally unhelpful.
Ever since former Gov. Scott Walker began heaping scorn on teachers, painting them as lazy, overpaid and incompetent while ramming through his explosively controversial union-busting Act 10 law, the GOP has weaponized divisive distrust of teachers and public schools. Aided by a powerful private school choice lobby, they’ve hammered away on the idea that private schools are better and siphoned millions of dollars in taxpayer support for public education out of public classrooms and into the private sphere.
“We are going to make sure that Wisconsin goes back to the top of the game,” Tiffany declared Thursday, adding, “We are behind Mississippi in educational attainment. Less than one in three kids can read at grade level in the fourth grade in the state of Wisconsin. Is that not a disaster? That will not be the case if I’m elected as governor, we will have accountability and we will have higher standards.”
But the defunding of Wisconsin public schools that began under Walker and continues today is directly tied to the decline in quality. It’s not laziness or pedophilia that plague our school system. It’s deliberate neglect.
Republican calls for “higher standards” and “accountability” have, over the past two decades, been accompanied by disinvestment and the steady expansion of a publicly funded private voucher school system.
Ironically, the private schools Republicans champion in the school choice program have no teacher licensing requirements and DPI has no way to oversee or investigate their employees. Nor are private schools subject to Wisconsin’s open records laws. We will never get to see how they handle cases of employee misconduct.
There’s a reason it’s a big story when adults abuse the trust of children. It’s despicable behavior. Politicians who ignore or capitalize on that crime for political gain do us no good.

(Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)As the regulatory conservation associate for the Idaho Conservation League, I have reviewed hundreds of pollution control permits for industrial facilities across Idaho. These permits allow facilities like factories and mines to conduct operations while being protective of public health, clean water and clean air. In particular, I have closely followed and pushed back against the development of Perpetua Resource’s Stibnite Gold Project. 
At central Idaho’s Stibnite Gold Mine, crews start initial construction 

I was encouraged by my colleague Dr. Ian von Lindern’s informative and expert-based commentary regarding the troubling health effects this mega-mine presents. I was surprised to see former Environmental Protection Agency Administrator, Andrew Wheeler, join the debate and directly address Dr. von Lindern’s comments in a rebuttal commentary. 
While engaging in tit for tat op-ed commentary might normally be unproductive, I feel it’s important to address the hypocrisy of his conclusion that “Idaho families deserve decisions grounded in science, transparency and truth,” as his opinion is neither scientific, transparent nor truthful. 
Mr. Wheeler’s “science” comments echo Perpetua’s testimony before the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality. I heard these same arguments as both Dr. von Lindern and I testified during the same administrative hearing process Mr. Wheeler references. While I am unsure how much Mr. Wheeler familiarized himself with the complex air quality “science” of the issue, I am sure Idaho families should not trust Mr. Wheeler’s opinion on this matter. 
Mr. Wheeler’s claims are startling coming from an EPA director who consistently undermined science and transparency. As the Union of Concerned Scientists outlined back in 2019, during his time as EPA director, Mr. Wheeler sidelined and ignored scientists, proposed restricting scientific data, recommended unsafe levels of drinking water contaminants, and rolled back environmental protections. His rebuttal commentary is simply a continuation of uninformed and misleading attacks on science and the health of Americans in the interest of industry. 
Within his commentary, Mr. Wheeler touts his former work as the head of the EPA in “protecting Americans from toxic exposures” but fails to mention his current connection to Perpetua Resources. In 2024 Mr. Wheeler joined the west coast law firm, Holland and Hart as an expert in regulatory affairs. Holland and Hart currently represents Perpetua Resources and their proposed mine in no less than four environmental permit appeals including three brought by ICL and our partners. 
One involves a Clean Water Act permit under Idaho DEQ administrative appeal (Agency case number. 0102-24-02), one involves the U.S. Forest Service’s Record of Decision in federal court (see case number 1:25-cv-00086-AKB), one involves the same air permit referenced in Mr. Wheeler’s and Dr. von Lindern’s commentary that is now being appealed within state court (see case number CV01-25-13306). The fourth major litigation is an appeal of the same U.S. Forest Service Record of Decision by the Nez Perce Tribe of Idaho in federal court (see case number 3:25-cv-00498-AKB). 
With four active legal cases, it’s fair to question if Mr. Wheeler is acting on behalf of the public, Holland and Hart or Perpetua Resources. 
While Perpetua Resources has recently announced it has started on initial construction of its mine, it’s important to note that the above permit appeals present serious unsettled questions regarding the environmental impact of the mine. Until these appeals are concluded, the outcome of the mine is far from certain.
As Dr. von Lindern and I both testified during the administrative hearing process, the special concessions that Idaho DEQ granted to Perpetua have never been provided to any other Idaho air quality permit. They create a precedent that represents legitimate threats to air quality and human health for all Idahoans moving forward. 
There is no dispute that Idaho DEQ’s Stibnite Project Specific Adjustment factor increases cancer risk to any children exposed to arsenic from operations at the Stibnite Gold Project, the question is whether that insult will “average out” over the remainder of the child’s life.

(Emma Davis/Maine Morning Star)Flags will be flying at half-staff across Maine Saturday in remembrance of the victims of the October 2023 mass shooting in Lewiston. 
Saturday marks two years since the state’s deadliest mass shooting at Just-In-Time Recreation and Schemengees Bar and Grille that killed 18 people and injured 13 others. 
“Although nothing can lessen their loss, we grieve with the families of the victims and the survivors of the Lewiston tragedy so that no one feels alone,” said Gov. Janet Mills. “We open our hearts to those who were injured and to those who are still struggling with the aftermath of that night. And we offer unending gratitude to the people whose heroic actions saved lives and set us on the long and winding road to healing.”
There are several events planned in Lewiston to mark the anniversary.
On Friday, community members gathered on Longley Bridge, where many held homemade signs on posters that said, “We Remember.”
“By leaning on our collective love for Lewiston, we will build a safer, more connected, and resilient future,” said Lewiston Mayor Carl Sheline in a statement.
On Saturday afternoon, the Yes on Question 2 campaign, which is backing a statewide ballot initiative to adopt a red flag law, is hosting an interfaith event at 3 p.m. at the Trinity Episcopal Church in Lewiston. 
In addition to faith community leaders, Arthur Barnard, the father of Lewiston victim Artie Strout, and Joe Anderson, a doctor who worked in the emergency room the night of the shooting, will speak at the event. 
In early September, survivors and victims’ family members filed a lawsuit against the United States for negligence in failing to respond to warning signs and an explicit threat to commit a mass shooting. The lawsuit points to many of the findings of state and Army investigations, which concluded multi-agency failures related to the handling of perpetrator Robert Card II’s deteriorating mental health in the months leading up to the shooting.

(Zhang Mingming/VCG via Getty Images)The high-profile heist at the Louvre in Paris on Oct 19, 2025, played out like a scene from a Hollywood movie: a gang of thieves steal an assortment of dazzling royal jewels on display at one of the world’s most famous museums.
But with the authorities hot in pursuit, the robbers still have more work to do: How can they capitalize on their haul?
Most stolen works are never found. In the art crime courses I teach, I often point out that the recovery rate is below 10%. This is particularly disturbing when you consider that between 50,000 and 100,000 artworks are stolen each year globally — the actual number may be higher due to underreporting — with the majority stolen from Europe.
That said, it’s quite difficult to actually make money off stolen works of art. Yet the types of objects stolen from the Louvre — eight pieces of priceless jewelry — could give these thieves an upper hand.
At 9:30 a.m. local time on Oct. 19, 2025, four thieves reportedly used a lift mounted on a vehicle to enter the Louvre’s Apollo Gallery. (Murat Usubali/Anadolu via Getty Images)
 
A narrow market of buyers
Pilfered paintings can’t be sold on the art market because thieves can’t convey what’s known as “good title,” the ownership rights that belong to a legal owner. Furthermore, no reputable auction house or dealer would knowingly sell stolen art, nor would responsible collectors purchase stolen property.
But that doesn’t mean stolen paintings don’t have value.
In 2002, thieves broke into Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum through the roof and departed with “View of the Sea at Scheveningen” and “Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church in Nuenen” in tow. In 2016, Italian police recovered the relatively unscathed artworks from a Mafia safehouse in Naples. It isn’t clear whether the Mafia actually purchased the works, but it’s common for criminal syndicates to hold onto valuable assets as collateral of some sort.
Other times, stolen works do unwittingly end up in the hands of collectors.
In the 1960s in New York City, an employee of the Guggenheim Museum stole a Marc Chagall painting from storage. But the crime wasn’t even discovered until an inventory was taken years later. Unable to locate the work, the museum simply removed it from its records.
In the meantime, collectors Jules and Rachel Lubell bought the piece for US$17,000 from a gallery. When the couple requested that an auction house review the work for an estimate, a former Guggenheim employee at Sotheby’s recognized it as the missing painting.
Guggenheim demanded that the painting be returned, and a contentious court battle ensued. In the end, the parties settled the case, and the painting was returned to the museum after an undisclosed sum was paid to the collectors.
Some people do knowingly buy stolen art. After World War II, stolen works circulated on the market, with buyers fully aware of the widespread plunder that had just taken place across Europe.
Eventually, international laws were developed that gave the original owners the opportunity to recover looted property, even decades after the fact. In the U.S., for example, the law even allows descendants of the original owners to regain ownership of stolen works, provided they can offer enough evidence to prove their claims.
 
Jewels and gold easier to monetize
The Louvre theft didn’t involve paintings, though. The thieves came away with bejeweled property: a sapphire diadem; a necklace and single earring from a matching set linked to 19th-century French queens Marie-Amélie and Hortense; an opulent matching set of earrings and a necklace that belonged to Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon Bonaparte’s second wife; a diamond brooch; and Empress Eugénie’s diadem and her corsage-bow brooch.
These centuries-old, exquisitely crafted works have unique historic and cultural value. But even if each one were broken to bits and sold for parts, they would still be worth a lot of money. Thieves can peddle the precious gemstones and metals to unscrupulous dealers and jewelers, who could reshape and sell them. Even at a fraction of their value — the price received for looted art is always far lower than that received for legitimately sourced art — the gems are worth millions of dollars.

While difficult to sell stolen goods on the legitimate market, there is an underground market for looted artworks. The pieces may be sold in backrooms, in private meetings or even on the dark web, where participants cannot be identified. Studies have also revealed that stolen — and sometimes forged — art and antiquities often appear on mainstream e-commerce sites like Facebook and eBay. After making a sale, the vendor may delete his or her online store and disappear.
 
A heist’s sensational allure
While films like “The Thomas Crown Affair” feature dramatic heists pulled off by impossibly attractive bandits, most art crimes are far more mundane.
Art theft is usually a crime of opportunity, and it tends to take place not in the heavily guarded halls of cultural institutions, but in storage units or while works are in transit.
Most large museums and cultural institutions do not display all the objects within their care. Instead, they sit in storage. Less than 10% of the Louvre’s collection is ever on display at one time — only about 35,000 of the museum’s 600,000 objects. The rest can remain unseen for years, even decades.
Works in storage can be unintentionally misplaced — like Andy Warhol’s rare silkscreen “Princess Beatrix,” which was likely accidentally discarded, along with 45 other works, during the renovation of a Dutch town hall — or simply pilfered by employees. According to the FBI, about 90% of museum heists are inside jobs.
In fact, days before the Louvre crime, a Picasso work valued at $650,000, “Still Life with Guitar,” went missing during its journey from Madrid to Granada. The painting was part of a shipment including other works by the Spanish master, but when the shipping packages were opened, the piece was missing. The incident received much less public attention.
To me, the biggest mistake the thieves made wasn’t abandoning the crown they dropped or the vest they discarded, essentially leaving clues for the authorities.
Rather, it was the brazen nature of the heist itself — one that captured the world’s attention, all but ensuring that French detectives, independent sleuths and international law enforcement will be on the lookout for new pieces of gold, gems and royal bling being offered up for sale in the years to come.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)As farmers say at the Hedgeapple cattle farm in Frederick County, their cows live a good life, with one bad day.
All day, the cows graze on the Buckeystown farm’s grassy hills: Two herds with 45 pairs of heifers and steers, plus their calves. And even as autumn settles in and cold temperatures arrive, the cows still have months of grazing in front of them. Their pastures will stay grassy — by design.
The farm uses a practice called rotational grazing — moving the herds from pasture to pasture, then allowing grazed areas to re-grow over a period of 30 days or more.
The practice allows the farm to continue cattle grazing through January, said farm manager Chris Zook, saving them about $200 a day that would be needed to buy bales of hay to feed their hundreds of Black Angus and red/Akaushi Wagyu cattle.
“Take care of your grasses, and they will take care of you,” Zook says.
The practice was highlighted during a tour of the farm Thursday, one of several farm visits in the region led by the nonprofits Chesapeake Bay Foundation and Mobilize Frederick. The tour, focused on regenerative agriculture, attracted a combination of farmers, elected officials and environmentalists.

That’s because in addition to the economic benefits cited by Zook, the practice has a host of ecological perks, too.
By allowing the grass to regrow, quadrant by quadrant, the farm anchors its soil in place, reducing the amount of runoff during rainstorms from its fields into the nearby Monocacy River, which flows into the Potomac, which empties into the Chesapeake Bay.
So the farm is just one of many cogs in the overall effort to reduce the flow of harmful pollutants — including the nitrogen and phosphorus from manure — into the nation’s largest estuary.
Reducing agricultural pollution was one of the more stubborn pieces of the multistate plan to improve the bay by 2025, which fell short. The agreement is currently undergoing a reconstruction process that some have maligned as unambitious. Discussions are ongoing, and the leaders of the bay states are expected to sign off on a finalized agreement in December.
Policymakers have found success in other areas, including updating sewage treatment plants and planting thousands of filtering oysters. But as the population of people and animals in the bay’s watershed expands, slowing pollution from city streets and farm fields has proven to be a challenge
Though they may sound simple, regenerative practices like rotational grazing can actually require considerable extra labor — and capital. For example, Hedgeapple Farms had to ensure that it could transport water to all of the pastures used for grazing, either using water lines or portable tanks.
Hedgeapple largely funded the changes itself, but there are some funds that farmers can tap into, including from state and federal government sources, like the USDA’s Natural Resource Conservation Service.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Farmers also have a host of other worries, including drought conditions and rising costs for fuel, equipment and animal feed. Many have side jobs that make additional work too cumbersome, Zook said.
But a big challenge is also spreading the word, said assistant farm manager Seth Young.
“A lot of people, they’re told about it. But they never actually show the results,” Young said.
Some farmers also struggle to adopt new practices because of an adherence to tradition. They farm just as their grandparents or great-grandparents did, said Mark Townsend, a farmer who also serves as treasurer for the Maryland-Delaware Forage Council. Maybe that means they follow an old adage: “plant in the dust, and your bins will bust,” which urged farmers to plant seeds during dry, dusty conditions.
But conservationists urge farmers to plant “cover crops” during the off season. In Maryland, the Department of Agriculture provides compensatory payments to farmers to plant barley, rye and clover after they harvest their crops, to hold their fields in place during the off-season. It can be an intimidating change, Townsend said.
“To drive your planter through 8-foot tall rye? It’s like, ‘Oh my God.’ It’s horrifying,” Townsend said. “You’re like: ‘This is so against everything that I’ve ever known. And so, there’s a huge mental barrier, rightfully so.”
The farm’s commitment to sustainability runs deeper than just the rotational grazing. The farm also used grants from the Chesapeake Bay Foundation to plant more than 2,400 trees around the pastures, which will also help to reduce runoff into the Monocacy.

Initially, Zook said he feared that the perimeter of trees would cut the amount of space in each pasture, but ultimately they did not. Now, he’s more focused on the benefits, including the opportunities for cattle to seek shade during hot summer days. The farm’s practices are also a benefit to other living creatures, such as honeybees, said John Gardner, a local resident who cares for six hives on the property.
Hedgeapple is a quality home for the bees, who frequently venture from their hive boxes to forage, because its fields have more plant diversity than other farms.
“I tell people, when I see huge, golden, vast acres of corn, from the bee’s standpoint, I’m looking at a desert,” Gardner said.
Corn is wind-pollinated, and doesn’t need to attract pollinators. And pesticides and herbicides used on corn fields also endanger bees’ efforts to collect pollen, Gardner said.
The gangly tall grasses on the fields at Hedgeapple also are an ideal habitat for grassland birds, which rely on pasture habitats but are threatened by urban sprawl and changing farming practices, said Gabriel Foley of the Maryland Bird Conservation Partnership.
The Partnership uses nesting boxes to attract both American kestrels and barn owls to these habitats, where they can feed on insects and small mammals, Foley said.
Perhaps the most popular tool to show off the value of regenerative practices like cover crops and reduced grazing is a rain simulator: essentially, a shower head pointed at a variety of soil samples to show the effects of plantings on runoff.
Glass jars hang from each sample area, so viewers can see just how muddy the rainwater runoff becomes. Thursday’s selections included tilled soil, soil that hadn’t been tilled, allowing a small amount of vegetation to grow, and soil with cover crop planted.

But the winner was, perhaps unsurprisingly, the patch of dirt and long grasses dug up from a corner of Hedgeapple Farm that morning. The water in that jar was nearly clear.
When the simulator runs, rain spews from the spigot, sending about an inch of rain onto the small plots in a matter of minutes. It’s an outlandish — but not impossible– rate. Yet, it still shows the importance of snaring soils with a diverse array of plant life, Townsend said.
“If you weren’t necessarily prepared to take in all that water at that one time, you’re kind of left sitting — irony intended — high and dry, right?” Townsend said. “You’re not getting the water that you actually need into that soil, because you don’t have the mechanisms by which to absorb it.”
Amanda Grev, a forage and pasture specialist at the University of Maryland Extension, said that the practices aren’t just meant to save the bay, but to save farmers money, including on fertilizer, that would otherwise wash away during intense storms.
“The goal of these practices is, in the long run, to save you money, right? We’re not trying to spend thousands and thousands of dollars purely for the sake of being regenerative,” Grev said. “We may have a little bit of expense initially, but how much are we saving in terms of soil and nutrients?”

(Photo by SimpleImages/Getty Stock Images)Thirty-four people died from heat-related causes in Maryland during the late April to early October “heat season” this year, the second-highest number of heat-related deaths since records became publicly available in 2012.
Since deaths hit 46 in 2012 — when a July storm disrupted the power and air conditioning to many Maryland homes for days as a heat wave hit — the number had never been above 30, and has been as low as five in a year.
Of the 34 people who suffered heat-related deaths this summer, 24, or about 71%, were 65 or older, according to state data. Six people who died from heat-related causes were between ages 45-64, two were 18-44 and two were under age 18.
“Older adults often have chronic medical conditions, such as cardiovascular or respiratory, that can increase their susceptibility to excessive heat,” according to a statement from the Maryland Department of Health.
Despite that, 18- to 44-year-olds had the highest number of emergency department and urgent care visits this year, accounting for 688 of the total 1,672 this summer. Those 65 and older recorded 416 emergency room visits, followed by the 399 for the 44-65 age group, as of the Oct. 8 report.

Emergency department visits were significantly higher than the 1,206 recorded last year. The number of calls for emergency medical service was also up sharply this year, from 1,502 in 2024 to 1,645 this year.
The number of heat-related emergency room visits spiked during a heat wave in late June that saw 379 emergency department or urgent care visits and 400 EMS calls, according to state data. Almost two-thirds of the deaths, 21 of them, occurred over a two-week period in June and July that saw extremely high temperatures and heat indices, according to the health department’s statement.
“Daily heat indices during this time exceeded 100 degrees with some areas exceeding 110 degrees,” the statement said.
The region that includes Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford and Howard counties and Baltimore City had the most emergency department or urgent care visits this season. Their total of 688 surpasses other regions’ totals by at least 250 visits and past years’ totals by at least 200.
Of the 34 deaths, half were reported to be indoors. Some of the indoor deaths were related to non-functioning or non-existent cooling systems, such as fans or air conditioning units. Other reports indicated “hoarding or cluttered living conditions which can cause a decrease in air flow reducing the effectiveness of cooling systems,” according to the health department’s statement.
The other eight and nine deaths were in vehicles and outdoors, respectively.
Baltimore City and Baltimore County had the highest number of heat-related deaths this season, reaching eight and six, respectively. Montgomery and Prince George’s counties both had three heat-related deaths, and the 10 other counties that recorded heat-deaths had one or two each this heat season.
The Baltimore City Health Department issued four extreme heat alerts during this heat season — with one late July alert lasting almost a week after two extensions, according to department statements The press releases reference multiple instances of daily high temperatures that reach over 100 degrees, and “dangerously high temperatures and high humidity.”

“The sustained heat wave continues to pose a serious threat to public health, particularly for our most vulnerable residents,” Mary Beth Haller, Baltimore City’s interim health commissioner, said in a July 30 press release concerning the second extension of an extreme heat alert.
Montgomery County issued two heat emergency alerts during this heat season, warning citizens of high “feels-like” temperatures and heat indexes.
“Extreme heat affects the body’s ability to regulate temperature, which can create dangerous conditions if appropriate safety measures are not taken,” a July 24 Montgomery County press release said. “Heat may affect air quality, especially in urban areas, and may have a stronger impact on the elderly, children and sick persons.”

WASHINGTON – The sounds of destruction echoed around the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue Wednesday afternoon.
“Where is the outrage?” asked Nadine Seiler, a Waldorf, Maryland, resident and activist. “There is no way that … Republican voters would have been OK … with Obama or Biden or Clinton demolishing part of this building.”
“I’m like, really really angry,” she said.
Despite President Donald Trump’s promise that his plans for a massive, $300 million ballroom would not “interfere with the current building,” demolition of the East Wing began Monday and was largely complete by Friday. The destruction has sparked widespread alarm from the public, Democratic lawmakers and historic preservationists.
The first lady’s offices and a visitors’ entrance were located in the East Wing. Originally, the space of a terrace during Thomas Jefferson’s presidency, the East Wing was built in 1902 under President Theodore Roosevelt and expanded in 1942 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, providing both office space and housing for staff.
Trump’s ballroom, which is intended as an entertaining space that he claims will be able to host 999 people, is planned to be 90,000 square feet. The White House itself is currently an estimated 55,000 square feet.
The National Trust for Historic Preservation on Tuesday urged the Trump administration and the National Park Service “to pause demolition until plans for the proposed ballroom go through the legally required public review processes.”

“We acknowledge the utility of a larger meeting space at the White House, but we are deeply concerned that the massing and height of the proposed new construction will overwhelm the White House itself…and may also permanently disrupt the carefully balanced classical design of the White House with its two smaller, and lower, East and West Wings,” Carol Quillen, president and CEO of the organization, said in a statement.
Seiler, a former employee of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, said that it is not possible to get approvals to do any renovations on a historic building such as the White House in fewer than nine months.
“The fact that he could come … and demolish this building, he is number two-ing and peeing all over the Constitution,” Seiler said.
John Sentena, a Colorado resident, views the president’s actions as “pushing the boundaries,” which is what he said he believes the president should do. He also commented on the lack of legal pushback, saying that nobody has pursued legal action over the demolition.
“If someone sues him for it, then there’s probably something to it,” Sentena said.
He said he has supported Trump’s presidency thus far and especially appreciates the impact of his actions.
“It’s only been not even a year … and all these people that are riled up. I wonder how long it can last,” he said.
But Cathy Raines, a Washington resident, said that the “president of the country should be a role model for following protocols.”
Raines said that Trump’s actions are unsurprising because she believes that every department of his administration has failed to follow legal guidelines.
“The White House is a longstanding symbol of our country, meant to be the people’s house,” Raines said.
Sen. Angus King, I-Maine, blistered Trump Wednesday for the destruction of the East Wing.
“President Trump’s desecration of the White House is an insult to the American people and a betrayal of his obligation to safeguard our history and heritage,” King said in a statement.

The senator is the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee’s national parks subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over, among other things, national historic sites and historic preservation.
“The White House does not belong to President Trump; it belongs to the American people – he is but a temporary resident with no right to despoil this iconic landmark on his personal whim,” King said. “The house was purposefully never intended to be a palace, but rather a residence befitting a democratically elected leader, and an important symbol of our rejection of the trappings of royalty.”

Don’t get your bipartisan hopes up: Each side announced its own coalition, with completely different strategies.
One, announced by Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery), wants to shield consumers from power infrastructure costs associated with the rising number of data centers in the region. The group convened its inaugural meeting this week, featuring legislators from many of the 13 states, including Maryland, that are part of the electric grid operated by PJM Interconnection.
It comes as PJM is in the midst of a consequential process to decide how to handle projections that the grid’s “peak load” could grow by 32 gigawatts from 2024 to 2030, with about 30 gigawatts of that total attributable to data center demand.
Costs from increased demand could be near $100 billion, Hester said. The current default setting is for all ratepayers to share the burden of new transmission lines and upsets in the balance of supply and demand, said Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D- Montgomery).
“You have to have a proposal that explicitly protects ratepayers in order for ratepayers not to bear the brunt,” Charkoudian said. “So, if a proposal is silent on who’s paying, then it is our residential ratepayers.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The other coalition, announced this week by House members in the Maryland Freedom Caucus, seems focused instead on bolstering energy supply to address high bills, which Del. Brian Chisholm (R-Anne Arundel) blames on “a delusional climate cultist ideology” for shuttering Maryland fossil fuel power plants.
The group, which currently includes legislators from Pennsylvania, said it will host a series of “Powering the Mid-Atlantic” hearings across Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland and Virginia, according to a Wednesday news release.
Del. Robin Grammer (R-Baltimore County), another member of the coalition, called on the Democratic majority in the General Assembly to ditch policies focused on reducing greenhouse gases in the face of the state’s energy challenges. He also urged leaders to end the EmPOWER Maryland surcharge on ratepayers’ bills, which funds energy efficiency programs for Maryland households and efforts to transition away from fossil fuel heating.
“We’re trying to fill this gap of leadership, where, frankly, we’re seeing absolute silence,” Grammer said. “The legislature should be stepping up and saying: ‘We all care about sustainability, but we’re at the point where we’re seeing blackouts.'”
Hawley takes charge at MABE
Cecil County Board of Education President Diana Hawley was sworn in Monday as the new president of the Maryland Association of Boards of Education.
Hawley, who will lead the organization for the 2025-26 term, took the helm during MABE’s annual conference this week in Annapolis. She replaces Karin M. Bailey, who currently serves as chair of the St. Mary’s County Board of Education.
Hawley has served on the Cecil County school board since 2018 and served on MABEs board of directors since 2021.

“At MABE, we’ve seen up close Diana’s rock-solid commitment to Maryland students and public schools,” MABE Executive Director Milt Nagel said in a statement released Wednesday. “Her extensive experience in Maryland’s education community means she brings a valuable first-hand perspective to MABE members’ collective work championing excellence in Maryland public education. Despite such challenging times for public education as a whole, we see great things ahead under her collaborative, innovative leadership.”
Besides selecting a new president, the conference also elected new officers with Brenda Wolff of Montgomery County as president-elect, Karen Yoho of Frederick County as the new treasurer and Jolene Mosley of Howard County as the new secretary. The nonprofit organization founded in 1957 advocates on behalf of the state’s 24 local school boards.
State Superintendent Carey Wright took the opportunity of this week’s MABE conference to provide school leaders with updates on literacy and math policies, nearly $21 million in philanthropic support for various programs and initiatives and a summary on test results.
According to a PowerPoint document from Wright at the conference, she also highlighted a plan to request funding for instructional coaching from the General Assembly during the 2026 legislative session. The legislature did approve what educators call a “coaching program” within the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act, but without the funds.
Teachers choose from among their own for board
The Maryland State Department of Education and the state school board will hold a two-week election to choose a new educator to serve on the board.
Twenty educators are seeking the teacher position on the board that came open when Rachel McCusker stepped down in August, after she became an assistant principal in Carroll County. McCusker was the board’s first official teacher member after being chosen by educators in December 2019.
Voting is open to any teacher who has an active state educator certificate or license in at least one teacher area as of Oct. 10. Voting will take place from Nov. 3 through Nov. 17, with a second round of voting Dec. 1-15 if there’s a tie.

Notre Dame president to step down
Notre Dame of Maryland University President Marylou Yam will step down June 30, 2026, after 12 years in the job, the university announced this week.
“Over the past decade, we have faced some difficult challenges, including a global pandemic, but together with a spirit of innovation and resilience, we stayed steadfast in our mission and values; and in doing so we were able to advance our strategic goals and priorities forward successfully,” Yam said in a statement from the school.

During her time as president, Yam saw the university through the COVID-19 pandemic and oversaw a $52.6 million fundraising campaign, the school’s largest, to support students, increased NDMU’s endowment by 40% and the renovation or construction of several campus facilities.
Her tenure also saw the launch of NDMU Online, a doctoral program in higher education, and the state’s first bachelor’s and master’s programs in art therapy. NDMU also started the state’s first doctorate in occupational therapy at a private institution and the first master’s degree in physician assistant studies at a private institution. She also led the launch of a new School of Integrative Health after a recent merger with the former Maryland University of Integrative Health.
“President Yam has worked 24/7 to put NDMU on a path of success – whether it be in increasing the endowment, creating new programs and schools, creating a new energy and growth in the school through taking the university all-gender, raising our visibility in the city and state and increasing our rankings in so many categories,” said Cathryn Curia ’69, chair of the NDMU Board of Trustees.
“Her goal has always been the financial stability and the growth of Notre Dame, while caring for the campus community and respecting the school’s heritage with the SSNDs,” she said, referring to the School Sisters of Notre Dame, the founding order of the university.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-182385810-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-25 10:56:53.388598

(Alaska National Guard photo by Alejandro Peña)The State of Alaska has begun distributing disaster relief payments, totaling over $217,000 as of Friday, to residents of western Alaska impacted by storm damage from ex-Typhoon Halong. 
The state has received more than 940 applications for state individual assistance, according to a statement from the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management. Applications are open on the state’s website, through Nov. 9. 
As many storm evacuees left or lost identification or essential documents, the Alaska Department of Motor Vehicles and the Department of Health have booths at emergency evacuation shelters in Anchorage to assist with replacements. The Association of Village Council Presidents is offering tribal IDs in the shelters. State caseworkers and a Yup’ik speaking public notary are helping with documentation, the state update said.
Residents must prove they are from the designated disaster area, and provide proof of identification and a mailing address where checks can be mailed. 
As of Thursday night, there were 302 evacuees staying in emergency shelters in Anchorage, with 178 at the Egan Center and 124 at the Alaska Airlines Center. 
The state’s assistance program provides financial assistance for storm damage to homes, vehicles, essential personal property and medical, dental or funeral needs directly related to the disaster. Applicants will be eligible for $21,250 in home repairs and another $21,250 for “other needs.”
The state’s individual assistance program also includes a housing assistance program that provides renters with up to three months and homeowners with 18 months of financial assistance, according to the state’s website. 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced Friday that he amended the state’s disaster declaration to waive state fees associated with replacing documents, including licenses and registrations. It also waives late fees for state-administered loan and payment programs.”
Federal disaster assistance approved
On Wednesday, the Trump administration authorized a federal disaster declaration for the Western Alaska storm. The president said that he has authorized an immediate $25 million in federal aid for the state to cover costs as the recovery effort is underway.

Trump also approved the state’s request for federal assistance, including federal individual assistance, public assistance and the hazard mitigation grant program. 
Residents can apply on the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s website at DisasterAssistance.gov or on the FEMA app. Applicants must file a claim and are required to go through a FEMA inspection to qualify. 
Federal disaster assistance provides up to  $42,500 for home repairs and up to $42,500 for other items.
The U.S. Small Business Administration is also offering low interest loans to small businesses, non-profits and individuals impacted by the storm, to help pay for losses not covered by insurance. Applications can be submitted on their federal website. 
Financial donations pour in for Western Alaska communities
Individual and business donations have come pouring in for the families and communities devastated by ex-Typhoon Halong, including food, supplies, and financial assistance.
The state has a list of resources and links to assistance on its website.
The Western Alaska Disaster Relief Fund has raised $2.5 million to date, said Ashley Ellingson, director of communications with the Alaska Community Foundation, with mostly corporate donors pledging an additional $1.5 million more. She said an advisory committee of regional and state leaders meets at least weekly to consider requests and how to best allocate funding. 
The Alaska Community Foundation has already distributed roughly $575,000 to five organizations: the Association of Village Council Presidents, the Maniilaq Association, the tribal councils of Kipnuk and Kwigillingok — the communities hardest-hit by the storm — and the Alaska Native Heritage Center. Ellingson said that is to ensure funding goes to immediate needs.

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune)Just as the second and final day of complicated map-drawing expert testimony came to an end late Friday, another twist cropped up in Utah’s court-ordered redistricting legal battle. 
An attorney for Utah’s top election official, the lieutenant governor, told Third District Judge Dianna Gibson that the bid for an indirect initiative to repeal Proposition 4 — the 2018 voter-approved law that calls for an independent redistricting process — had been withdrawn. 
“We are withdrawing this effort prior to initiating a direct initiative effort on the same issue,” Utah Republican Party Chair Rob Axson wrote in an email to the state’s elections director, Ryan Cowley sent at 4:15 p.m., just as Friday’s evidentiary hearing was wrapping up.
Now, rather than seeking about 70,000 signatures to require the Legislature take an up or down vote on repealing Proposition 4 — an approach the plaintiffs in the state’s anti-gerrymandering lawsuit have challenged in court as unable to undue Proposition 4, which was approved by more than 500,000 votes in 2018 — Axson and other members of the group Utahns for Representative Government are shifting gears. 
Utah lawmakers and plaintiffs accuse each other of gerrymandering with dueling redistricting experts

Instead, they’ve submitted an application to pursue the same method that the group Better Boundaries successfully pursued to get Proposition 4 on the ballot in 2018 and look to repeal that law by another statewide vote. 
In a statement issued Friday evening, Utahns for Representative Government — the group supporting Proposition 4’s repeal — said legal filings opposed to their effort “made it clear that the Lt. Governor’s Office would likely be forced to deny the indirect initiative application.” 
“While we would have preferred to continue under the process provided by law, the time required to defend our rights and appeal flawed judicial decisions would have made it impossible to meet statutory deadlines,” the group said. “The Utah Constitution is clear: the authority to draw congressional districts rests with the people’s elected representatives — not with the courts and not with an unaccountable commission. We again call on all Utahns to stand against judicial overreach and defend the separation of powers outlined in our state constitution.”
Elizabeth Rasmussen, executive director of Better Boundaries, issued a statement Friday characterizing the withdrawal of the indirect initiative as a victory — for the time being. 
“Once again, political insiders’ attempts to undermine the people’s voice and repeal Proposition 4 have fallen flat, at least for now,” she said. “This is a win in our ongoing fight to give Utahns the reforms they voted for in 2018. Proposition 4 remains the law of the land. Moving forward, we will continue to strongly oppose any and all efforts to undermine fair maps and the ability of voters to choose their politicians.”
Katharine Biele, president of the Utah League of Women Voters, one of the redistricting case’s plaintiffs, told reporters outside Gibson’s courtroom Friday that it was “wise” of Proposition 4’s opponents to abandon their indirect initiative effort — but she warned pursuing a ballot initiative is no easy task. 
“They will find out just how difficult a real initiative is,” she said. “We went through that in 2018, and it was hard.”  
Utah Legislature picks congressional map supported by Republican party

In order to successfully get their repeal on the ballot, the GOP group will need to collect at least 140,748 valid signatures from registered voters across Utah while meeting specific thresholds in at least 26 of Utah’s 29 Senate districts. 
Utah Democratic Party Chair Brian King, in a statement, called the group’s withdrawal an “embarrassing end to a pathetic last-ditch effort by the Utah GOP to create chaos.” 
“Even with millions of dollars, the backing of Donald Trump, Jr., and support from high-profile elected Utah Republicans, they realized they still didn’t have the competence nor the public support to pull this off,” King said. 
King was referring to Trump Jr., in a post on X earlier this week, urging people to sign up as signature gatherers for the indirect initiative effort. 
“The Utah Republican Party may continue to try to ignore the will of the voters next year using other tricks. But Utahns will continue to see through the corruption, abuse of power, and overall disrespect,” King added. “We will be there to support everyday Utahns when it is time for that particular fight, but today we celebrate another win for voters.” 
The GOP’s strategy shift comes as the state’s Republican leaders continue to protest Gibson’s earlier ruling that determined the 2021 Utah Legislature overstepped when it undid Proposition 4. As a result, she struck down the congressional map lawmakers adopted that year as a product of an unconstitutional process and she ordered a process to pick a “remedial” map in 2026.

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune)
In court, the Legislature’s attorneys and the redistricting lawsuit’s plaintiffs have submitted to Gibson their preferred maps — one known as map C that the Legislature advanced in a special session earlier this month, and two submitted by plaintiffs as alternatives. The judge faces a Nov. 10 deadline to pick a map in order for it to be ready in time for the 2026 elections. 
In the courtroom, experts clash over mapping methods
Thursday and Friday, attorneys grilled each other’s redistricting experts while building their cases for why Gibson should pick their preferred maps.
Plaintiffs have argued in court documents that the Legislature’s retained map-drawing experts used methods unfit for a state like Utah that is dominated by the Republican Party while Democrats are concentrated in the densely populated area of Salt Lake County.

The Legislature’s experts, however, defended their methods during hours of testimony and cross examination on Friday — while also questioning the plaintiffs’ experts’ methods and whether they were evaluated for partisan slant with tests that favored allowing a Democratic-leaning district. 
Friday, the Legislature’s attorneys called three experts to testify: Michael Barber, political science professor at Brigham Young University and director of the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy; Sean Trende, senior elections analyst for Real Clear Politics; and Jonathan Katz, professor of social sciences and statistics at the California Institute of Technology. 
Trende explained how he drew the Legislature’s map C, saying he based it on the 2021 map’s original boundaries but he sought to correct it to bring it more in line with Proposition 4’s neutral redistricting criteria. 
However, because he said Proposition 4’s language explicitly calls for “measures of partisan symmetry” to be considered among the “best available” scientific methods, he said he felt he had no choice but to use what he sees as the only way to measure partisan symmetry: the partisan bias test.

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune)
The plaintiffs argue the partisan bias test is among the worst methods to use to measure fairness in a “lopsided” state like Utah where statewide races are won by Republicans with wide margins. 
Trende anticipated there would be controversy over the method — saying he wished Proposition 4’s language didn’t call for it because he knew it would inevitably lead to a challenge and he didn’t want to end up in a courtroom like he has for many other redistricting legal battles. He went as far as calling it a “tragic addendum.”
Plaintiffs’ expert in Utah redistricting case calls Legislature’s map an ‘extreme partisan outlier’

“This is a trainwreck I saw coming the moment I read (Proposition 4),” Trende said. “I think the person who drafted this should be put in a cage and paraded around Salt Lake City.” 
Nevertheless, Trende and another one of the Legislature’s experts, Barber, argued that their analysis of map C compared to thousands of map simulations showed the map wasn’t an “extreme partisan outlier,” as the plaintiffs’ expert Jowei Chen testified Friday. Instead, they argued it passed multiple tests analyzing for partisan fairness, while they said plaintiffs’ maps appeared to be the true outliers. 
Barber said his analysis of Chen’s map simulations showed that “his algorithm is almost always producing a very Democratic district located in the northern half of Salt Lake County.” He said his own simulations produced comparatively more variety while using data that’s publicly available and peer reviewed, while Chen’s isn’t. 
“To me this is a tell-tale sign of a biased algorithm,” Barber said. “The algorithm should be producing a representative sample of maps. We’re seeing a single orientation over and over and over again.”
While the plaintiffs have accused Trende of using a map simulation set that wasn’t programmed to prioritize Proposition 4’s neutral criteria, Trende argued he did his best to follow Proposition 4 while creating map C’s boundaries. 
“I didn’t want to be here (in court),” he said with a laugh. “I was trying to draw maps that would easily comply with at least the structural requirements of Utah law.”

But while cross examining Trende, the plaintiffs’ attorney, Mark Gaber with the Campaign Legal Center, pointed out that multiple times Republican legislators expressed misgivings with accepting maps drawn on a platform called Dave’s Redistricting Tool with a partisan data view turned on. 
During questioning, Trende acknowledged he drew maps using the tool, but he said the political data was “set to a useless composite” with data from 2012 to 2020. 
What’s next?
The judge now has hundreds of pages of court documents with extremely complicated statistical analysis to wade through before picking a new map sometime before Nov. 10. 
She has scheduled another hearing to consider oral arguments in the case on Nov. 4, Election Day. 
That day, the parties are scheduled to debate another complaint filed by the plaintiffs urging the judge to block a law that lawmakers passed alongside their map submission that requires the use of three specific statistical tests that the plaintiffs argue lead to maps that favor Republicans over Democrats. 
Another hearing scheduled for Nov. 5 was previously expected to debate the plaintiff’s legal challenge of the GOP’s indirect initiative, but given that issue is now moot, it’s likely that hearing will be canceled.

Mariannette Miller-Meeks, speaking to supporters at a fundraiser Friday, claimed credit for her involvement in the firing of an Oskaloosa teacher over remarks about slain conservative activist Charlie Kirk.
Miller-Meeks, speaking at her fifth annual tailgate fundraiser, said there’s “a lot at stake” in the upcoming election.
To show voters why they should support her, she brought up her involvement in a case where an Oskaloosa school teacher was fired after making a controversial social media post in response to Kirk’s assassination. When the post was brought to her attention, Miller-Meeks said she contacted the principal and superintendent of the school district and told them to investigate the situation.
“People need to know that we are working for them, that we are looking out for them, and that we are protecting children,” Miller-Meeks said. “… That teacher was fired after an investigation, after the board met, they had due process, they were terminated. That’s what your congresswoman, who’s working for you, does.
“Our state Legislature decided to have a Center for Intellectual Freedom here at the University of Iowa campus. Your congresswoman made a suggestion that they name that Center of Intellectual Freedom after Charlie Kirk. So it matters who’s in this office, it matters who has this seat.”
‘You are not leverage’
As the federal government shutdown hit day 24, the Iowa Republican also blamed Democrats and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer for the impasse and said Iowans need to elect Republicans to Congress again in 2026. While the U.S. House passed a short-term federal funding bill in September, Senate Democrats have blocked such a measure from passing unless Republicans agree to extend enhanced Affordable Care Act tax credits set to expire at the end of the year.
Miller-Meeks told supporters about things she doesn’t like, such as “the Chinese Communist Party buying up Iowa farmland” and “California telling us how to raise hogs in Iowa.” She said she also does not like Democrats making demands through a shutdown after they lost control in the 2024 election.
“I don’t like Democrats shutting down the government over something that they could not get done when they had the House, the Senate and the White House, and now they expect us to do their job for them,” Miller-Meeks said. “They expect us to extend something that they couldn’t do themselves.”
Miller-Meeks referenced a comment made by House Minority Whip Katherine Clark, a Massachusetts Democrat, who said Thursday there will be negative impacts from the shutdown. Clark said in an interview with Fox News the shutdown was the only “leverage” available for Democrats to get Republicans to negotiate.
“I mean, shutdowns are terrible and, of course, there will be, you know, families that are going to suffer,” Clark said in the interview. “We take that responsibility very seriously. But it is one of the few leverage times we have.”
Miller-Meeks said as she meets with Iowans across the state and in D.C., she wants to tell voters, “you are not leverage.”
“That’s disgusting and revolting,” she said. “So we’re going to work hard to open this government. We’re going to work hard to have people have their needs met. And we are not going to do the Democrats’ dirty work for them.”
Miller-Meeks has also taken other steps criticizing Democrats on the impacts of the shutdown, like leading a letter Monday from the all-GOP Iowa U.S. House delegation to Schumer calling for an end to the shutdown, and introducing legislation earlier Friday to allow the U.S. secretary of Agriculture to access emergency funds to maintain Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) operations during the shutdown.

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota joined Miller-Meeks at the fundraiser Friday, as did fellow Iowa Republicans including U.S. Reps. Ashley Hinson, running for U.S. Senate in 2026, U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra who has an “exploratory” committee for Iowa governor, state House Majority Leader Bobby Kaufmann and Attorney General Brenna Bird.
Emmer told the crowd Democrats were disingenuous by framing the shutdown as being about health care, claiming the minority party wants to provide health care for undocumented immigrants and would remove funding included in the “big, beautiful” budget reconciliation law for rural health care providers.
“It’s not above health care,” Emmer said. “How do we know? Because they filed a counter-proposal in the Senate. You know what? It says, they want us to spend $1.5 trillion more, and they want to put illegals on taxpayer-funded health care, while at the same time gutting the $50 billion fund that we all created in the bill that we passed in July for rural health care. This ain’t about health care.”
Democrats have proposed reversing some cuts made for “lawfully present” immigrants available through federal health care programs. The minority party’s funding proposal would not change federal law that prohibits undocumented immigrants from receiving taxpayer-funded health coverage.
The race for Iowa’s 1st Congressional District is expected to be one of the most contentious matches in the 2026 election season, with Cook Political Report rating the district as a “toss-up.” The race for Iowa’s 3rd District represented by Republican Rep. Zach Nunn is also predicted to be competitive in 2026.
Miller-Meeks won her initial election to Congress in the 2020 by a margin of six votes. She won reelection in 2022 and 2024 against Democratic challenger Christina Bohannan, who is running for the seat again in the upcoming election. Miller-Meeks’ margin of victory in 2024 was by 798 votes after Bohannan requested a recount.
Alongside Bohannan, there are two other Democrats running to become the 1st District party nominee: Travis Terrell, a University of Iowa Health Care employee, and Taylor Wettach, a former attorney. Miller-Meeks also faces a primary challenge from David Pautsch, who also ran against her in 2024.
Though Republicans have seen major victories in recent election cycles, the GOP speakers called for Iowa Republican voters at the fundraiser to stay engaged heading into the 2026 election season. Emmer called Miller-Meeks “the key” for Republicans’ victory across the country in 2026.
“Mariannette Miller-Meeks winning means we’re winning everything that you’re fighting for in Iowa,” he said.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)As the U.S. Supreme Court considers whether to block President Donald Trump’s plans to deploy National Guard soldiers to Chicago, Trump’s attorneys are arguing that federal personnel are needed to prevent crime.
But an analysis of federal and state crime data by the Alaska Beacon, building upon a larger analysis by Stateline, shows almost all of Trump’s deployments have targeted cities with lower violent crime rates than Anchorage and other places in Alaska.
Among large American cities — those with 250,000 or more residents — Trump has ordered soldiers deployed to just one whose violent crime rate is among the 15 worst in the United States. 
Anchorage’s 2024 violent crime rate, 1,015 per 100,000 residents, is the 15th worst in the United States, according to figures published by the FBI in an annual report.  
Under the FBI’s definitions, violent crimes include murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault.
When considering Trump-targeted cities, only Memphis, Tennessee, which has a worst-in-the-nation 2024 violent crime rate of 2,501 per 100,000 residents, is worse than Anchorage. 
Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and Chicago all have lower crime rates than Anchorage.
They have the 19th, 32nd and 54th highest violent crime rates among large cities, respectively.
Statewide, the FBI tallied 5,392 violent crimes within Alaska in 2024, giving the state an overall violent crime rate of 728 crimes per 100,000 residents. That’s almost exactly the same rate as Los Angeles. 
The Alaska Department of Public Safety has yet to publish its 2024 report on crime within the state of Alaska, but a spokesperson for the department said its report will mirror statistics already published by the FBI in its online data system.
Using those FBI-published statistics and population estimates published by the state of Alaska, Fairbanks had a violent crime rate of 730 per 100,000 residents in 2024, higher than Los Angeles or Chicago. 
That applies only within city limits, because it’s based upon statistics reported by the Fairbanks Police Department, which operates within the city and not in the whole Fairbanks North Star Borough.
In Juneau, which has an almost identical population to Fairbanks city, the violent crime rate in 2024 was 519 per 100,000 residents.
The Bethel Police Department reported 104 violent crimes to the FBI in 2024, enough for that town’s violent crime rate to stand at 1,727 per 100,000 residents, slightly worse than Detroit, which had the third-highest violent crime rate in the nation in 2024.
Within the Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the Wasilla Police Department reported 52 violent crimes in 2024, a rate of 541 — almost exactly Chicago’s rate. The Palmer Police Department tallied 10 violent crimes during the same time period, a rate of 169 per 100,000 residents, the lowest among Alaska towns and cities examined by the Beacon.
The North Slope Borough Police Department reported 63 violent crimes last year, a rate of 595 per 100,000. In Ketchikan, where the police department recorded 32 violent crimes, the rate was 418 per 100,000.
Spokespeople for Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy have repeatedly said that the governor has not requested a crime-fighting National Guard deployment for Alaska and has not approved the use of Alaska National Guardsmen for crime-fighting deployments in other states.
They reiterated those positions on Friday, a day when dozens of Alaska National Guardsmen were actively aiding in relief efforts following the arrival of Typhoon Halong in western Alaska.
Nationally, the state of Alaska has joined other Republican-led states in backing Trump’s claim that he has the legal authority to deploy the National Guard, even in cases when states and local governments oppose the deployment.
In September, Attorney General-designee Stephen Cox signed a brief alongside other Republican-led states in support of Trump’s ability to deploy the National Guard to Washington, D.C.
Alaska didn’t sign briefs in support of deployments to Los Angeles, Portland or Chicago.
Asked whether that absence represented a change in viewpoint or a nuance between the rights of states and the District of Columbia, Cox said no — it was simply a matter of timing.
“We have a process to review state amicus briefs and we receive dozens of requests every week, typically with several days to review them and make decisions, but on these two briefs,” he said, referring to ones related to Illinois, “we had less than 24 hours’ notice and not enough time. Had we had more time, we would’ve signed on.”
Meanwhile, former Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles joined a bipartisan group of more than a dozen former state governors in arguing against the Trump administration’s deployment to Chicago.
In a friend-of-the-court brief, they wrote that allowing the federal government to deploy soldiers to states for police purposes violates the U.S. Constitution.
“The present deployment of military resources, based on an assertion of nearly unfettered federal authority, is unlawful,” they wrote.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/National-Guard-DC.jpg,,,2025-10-24 21:01:15.727297

(Photo by SageElyse/Getty Images)Instead of getting paid as they normally would on Friday, many of Utah’s federal employees were figuring out how to stretch their budgets for as long as it takes Congress to reopen the government. 
“The anxiety is starting to really rise in a lot of people,” said Robert Lawrence, president of the union representing Ogden’s IRS employees. “They’re starting to wonder, you know, how they’re going to pay their bills, how they’re going to pay their mortgage.” 
Lawrence said many of his colleagues did not get a full paycheck earlier this month and some have applied for unemployment, but those benefits probably won’t meet their needs. The IRS employs about 6,500 people in Ogden, Lawrence estimated, and the majority are furloughed because of the shutdown — unable to work or get paid.

The possibility of layoffs has exacerbated their stress. Roughly 100 were among thousands of U.S. government workers across the country who received notices earlier this month saying they’d be laid off, Lawrence said. A judge temporarily blocked the terminations, which were set to happen in December. 
Lawrence said the shutdown is holding up the agency’s work ahead of the coming tax season, all while it’s still trying to recover from a slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“What makes it so frustrating is that, you know, we have nothing to do with what’s going on in D.C. We have a job to do. We do that job. We do it proudly, and we expect to get paid for it,” Lawrence said. “I’m not siding with either side. Change has to come from both sides.”
Some of the agency’s employees in Ogden are longtime staffers who moved up the ranks, but the majority are getting paid somewhere near $15 per hour, said Lawrence, president of the National Treasury Employees’ Union chapter 67.  
“You can’t support a family on that,” Lawrence said. “So to miss a paycheck is potentially devastating.”

Rangers at Zion National Park are also feeling the pressure of another week without pay, according to the Zion Forever Project, a nonprofit supporting the park and its workers. 
“On a typical day, you would see rangers kind of everywhere, and that’s not the case anymore,” said Tiffany Stouffer, the organization’s development director. “Very few of them are working, and even less of those who are working are working with pay.”
The organization launched a push Friday to raise more money for a fund helping to cover counseling and mental health support for the park’s employees and its own staff. Stouffer said many park rangers fear that they’ll be called back to work when the government reopens, only to be laid off a short time later. 
“These are career professionals with sometimes multiple degrees, or lifetimes of knowledge and experience,” she said. 
At the nonprofit Switchpoint, which operates a food pantry in St. George, spokesperson Zachary Almaguer said four federal employees — two working for public lands agencies — have gotten in touch about food assistance, expressing concern about making ends meet. 
Stouffer fought tears as she thought about Zion employees in similar situations. 
Said Stouffer: “They’re Utahns, they’re part of the fabric of our communities, and they’re suffering.”

Melanie Stansbury, as a state official says NM is ""evaluating the USDA's ever-changing guidance.""","Food bank officials said they intend to increase distribution sites—as they did during the COVID-19-pandemic—in response to lost Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits expected on Nov. 1, 2025. (Courtesy The Food Depot)Federal and state officials said Friday they are working on a plan to shield 450,000 New Mexicans from pending lost federal food assistance benefits.
The United States Department of Agriculture informed states earlier this month that due to the federal shutdown, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program had insufficient funding to run after this month, and ordered states not to submit SNAP recipient info to state vendors.
U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury (D-NM) said an “emergency food plan” is emerging that tasks charitable organizations and schools with counteracting the expected loss of $90 million in SNAP benefits for 250,000 New Mexico households.
“As I understand it, it’s a combination of looking at opportunities to scale up food deliveries through school lunch and breakfast programs, as well as increasing the food supply through our food banks and food pantries,” she said. 
USDA won’t shuffle funds to extend SNAP during shutdown, in about-face from earlier plan

She directed reporters at a virtual news conference Friday afternoon to contact state officials for more details.
Late Friday, Jodi McGinnis Porter, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s deputy communications director, told Source New Mexico in an emailed statement that the state is “closely evaluating the USDA’s ever-changing guidance and exploring every available option to maintain food assistance for New Mexicans.”
While she did not provide full details of an emergency food plan, she offered a few more details about what will and won’t happen Nov. 1. 
For example, she said recipients who have existing balances on their electronic benefit cards from previous months can still use their cards on Nov. 1 or after. 
But she said the state is limited in its ability to use its own funds to pay for November SNAP benefits. The $16.6 million lawmakers recently passed during the special legislative session to offset SNAP cuts “cannot be used,” she said, “because most of the funding was appropriated for specific purposes rather than replacing federal SNAP benefits.”
The state is also expediting the delivery of $8 million to food banks the Legislature passed during the special session, she said, but that is only a fraction of the estimated $90 million the benefits are expected to cost, McGinnis Porter noted.
Members of the state’s congressional delegation wrote to USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins this week contending the agency could use contingency funds to make up the shortfall. The USDA in a memo on Friday discounted that idea and also said states would not be reimbursed if they funded the benefits themselves.
Stansbury also said Friday that because the USDA’s Oct. 10 order prohibited states from sending recipient information to vendors, “many states” have interpreted the order to mean they can’t use state funds to refill the Electronic Benefit Transfer cards used by SNAP recipients. 
That means, supplemental SNAP funding New Mexico lawmakers passed earlier this month can “flow to our food banks, but it will not be funding that can get loaded on to individual EBT cards,” she said. 
NM food banks say they have no time to prepare for Nov. 1 SNAP stoppage 

To prepare for the loss of SNAP, New Mexico food banks say they are purchasing extra food and gearing up for additional food distributions that resemble those during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stansbury also compared the expected demand on food banks to what they saw in early 2020. 
“I do anticipate this is going to be very similar to the beginning of the pandemic, where you saw thousands of families having to line up at food banks and food pantries to get access to food,” she said. “It is a full scale crisis that the White House is manufacturing that is going to affect millions and millions of children.”
Along with members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez on Friday joined a group of 23 attorneys general denouncing the impending SNAP halt in a letter to USDA Secretary Rollins.
The letter calls on the USDA to account for any contingency funds it has available, what plans it has for those funds and how states should regard the Oct. 10 letter ordering states not to submit SNAP recipient info to state vendors.
The letter also says states have already taken steps to delay November benefits, “which will significantly harm millions of people who depend on SNAP to put food on the table, including children, seniors, veterans, disabled persons, and other vulnerable individuals struggling to meet their basic food needs.” 
The letter also argues USDA has no legal basis to prohibit states from sending already-calculated November benefits to EBT vendors, and it says contingency funds remain available to keep benefits flowing. 
“It is irresponsible to direct states to withhold this contingency funding, a decision which, if upheld, will devastate and cause irreparable harm to families,” Torrez said in a statement. “My office will do everything in its power to ensure these funds continue to be distributed and keep meals on the table for New Mexicans.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Client-food-basket-Santa-Fe-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 19:57:02.359480

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Hundreds gathered outside the federal Whipple Building at Fort Snelling Friday to protest the presence of Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, who is leading the Trump administration’s efforts to detain and deport millions of immigrants. 
Noem held a press conference to tout the administration’s arrests of immigrants who have committed crimes. She spoke behind a table piled with seized firearms and bags of marijuana, meth and fentanyl. 
Many protesters feared Noem’s presence signaled the beginning of a large-scale immigration enforcement effort like the one launched in Chicago last month.
But Noem’s appearance focused instead on celebrating arrests made by Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s St. Paul field office.  
“I’m here today to ask all of the people in Minnesota, all of the people in the Midwest and throughout our country, to support your law enforcement officers, to support them and help protect them as they go out and do their job,” Noem said. 
Dozens of clergy members attended the protest, leading demonstrators through songs like “This Little Light of Mine” and “We Shall Not Be Moved.” 
Craig Loya, a bishop at Episcopal Church in Minnesota, preached a message of inclusion.
“As long as I have breath, I will continue to preach and proclaim that diversity makes us stronger and that there is no clearer moral imperative than standing with the immigrant and the outsider, because that is how God has embraced every single one of us,” Loya said.

Protesters demonstrated right up to the Whipple Building’s glass doors, with many holding signs and shouting anti-ICE chants.
“No more Minnesota nice. We won’t want your fascist ICE,” the protesters chanted.
The chants did not reach the windowless room of the Whipple Building where Noem spoke. 
When asked whether President Donald Trump would deploy the National Guard or other federal law enforcement to the Twin Cities, Noem said “it’s up to the president.” 
But thousands of newly-trained ICE officers are expected to join field offices in the coming weeks, including in St. Paul, paid for by funding approved in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed in July, Noem said.
Under Noem, DHS has bucked precedent by requesting troves of personal data from states and other federal agencies to assist in deportation efforts; arresting people at courthouses; sending immigrants to countries they have no ties to and in some cases known for human rights abuses; and ignoring court orders.
Immigration agents detained a roofing crew in St. Paul on Oct. 3. The officers arrived in unmarked vehicles and refused to show their identification, according to advocates. Some wore masks. 
Asked about the incident, Noem said “our agents always follow exactly what the law is and what the regulation and the protocol is for every single operation that they’re out on, so they are always identifying themselves and making sure that people know who they are.”
A handful of Minnesota Democratic lawmakers also attended the protest, including DFL state Rep. Samantha Sencer-Mura, who said she was at the protest to send a message to Noem that she and ICE weren’t welcome in Minnesota.
“We know a lot of what they do — the point is just fear,” Sencer-Mura said. “Always trying to combat that with love and community is a good way to just show up.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MG_5354-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 19:17:29.934396

(Photo by John Sykes/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ third-largest school district asked a federal court Friday to let it intervene in a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the state’s school voucher program.
In a motion filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas, the Little Rock School District also argued that the Educational Freedom Account program hurts public schools by diverting public funds “to support a separate system of private sectarian schools to the detriment of LRSD and other Arkansas public school districts.”
The district’s motion says that “for each student who leaves LRSD for a private school, or who is home schooled, because of the Voucher Program, LRSD loses resources necessary to educate its remaining students.” The district’s enrollment this school year is 18,964, according to the state education department’s website.
The EFA program was created by the LEARNS Act of 2023, a wide-ranging overhaul of the state’s public education laws that also raised annual teacher salaries to a minimum $50,000 and prohibited so-called “indoctrination” of students.
The LRSD motion supports arguments made in the original complaint filed by parents in June that the EFA program violates both the First Amendment’s provision prohibiting establishment of a state religion and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection clause.
The EFA program became available to all students this school year after being phased in two years ago. A recent estimate put the total cost in the 2025-26 school year at $326.1 million, more than the $277.4 million budgeted by the Legislature this spring.
“The provision of such significant sums of public money to support a system of private, mostly sectarian schools, violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution,” the motion argues.
The voucher program also discriminates against low-income families who can’t pay private school costs, students in rural areas who have no access to private schools and children with disabilities who “are not acceptable to many private schools,” in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, the motion adds.

The school district also argues that instead of maintaining a robust system of free public schools as required by the Arkansas constitution, “the state has violated that obligation by creating a separate and competing system of publicly funded private religious schools, and providing vouchers to encourage students to attend those schools.”
In supporting its argument to intervene, the district says it “enrolls, on average, students with greater educational needs than the students in the private, sectarian school [system] supported by the LEARNS Act Voucher Program. LRSD has an interest in this case because the outcome will significantly impact these students and educators.”
“An outcome which allows the state to continue to invest in a separate private school system for more affluent students will inevitably work to the detriment of the constitutionally required free public school system,” the district argues.
Sam Dubke, a spokesperson for Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, directed the Advocate to a statement issued in June when parents and guardians of public school students — Gwen Faulkenberry, Special Sanders, Anika Whitfield and Kimberly Crutchfield — filed the lawsuit against Sanders, Education Secretary Jacob Oliva, the Arkansas State Board of Education and Department of Finance and Administration Secretary Jim Hudson.
“This suit has no merit. More than 44,000 [now 51,000] students have applied for EFAs for next school year and far-left activists are playing politics with those kids’ futures to try and protect a failed status quo.”
Jeff LeMaster, a spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin, said, “We are reviewing the filing and will continue to proudly defend the LEARNS Act.”
The Little Rock district is being represented by Christopher Heller, Khayyam M. Eddings and Liz K. Harris of the Friday, Eldredge & Clark firm in Little Rock.

The Idaho Land Use and Housing Study Committee on Friday discussed its priorities for a final report on recommendations to improve housing affordability and availability in the state. The report is expected within the next month or two, and the committee will likely not meet again, according to one of the co-chairs. 
Idaho Sen. Alison “Ali” Rabe, D-Boise, listens to debate at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise on Jan. 9, 2023. (Otto Kitsinger for the Idaho Capital Sun)
The  committee, which is co-chaired by Sen. Jim Woodward, R-Sagle, and Rep. Jordan Redman, R-Coeur d’Alene, met five times since May to discuss subjects such as high land costs, permitting delays, zoning, building regulations and solutions from other states as it prepares to recommend legislation to address the issue in the 2026 legislative session, which begins in January. 
The group — created through legislation sponsored by Boise Democrat Sen. Ali Rabe — comprises lawmakers, building officials, local government representatives, and developers. 
 Committee members underscore high cost of infrastructure to support housing growth 

Discussion for the group’s top priorities repeatedly emphasized the need for funding for water and sewer infrastructure, so communities can absorb the high growth, especially in smaller communities. 
“Sewer, water infrastructure is massive,” said Trevor Chadwick, of the Association of Idaho Cities and the mayor of Star. “We’ve got several communities just in this valley that are struggling right now.” 
Many Idaho cities must ask voters to approve bonds to pay for water or sewer upgrades, which can be difficult to pass. Valley County Commissioner Sherry Maupin, of the Idaho Association of Counties, said the requirement to achieve a supermajority of 66.67% of the vote to pass bonds for construction can create hardship when those fail to pass but the need for the service remains. 
Rabe emphasized a need for “gentle density,” to avoid urban sprawl, which she said would cause even more expensive infrastructure investments to expand and maintain. She said less-restrictive zoning that may allow for smaller starter homes on smaller lots and infill in existing lots rather than expanding outside developed city areas. 
Sen. Ben Toews, R-Coeur d’Alene, also said it was his understanding that infilling in undeveloped or underdeveloped areas within cities that are already attached to water and sewer lines, is less expensive on infrastructure than expanding those services to suburban areas through sprawl. He, Redman, and others on the committee expressed support for expanding the rights of property owners to build accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, which are smaller, independent housing units on the same property as an existing home. 
Chadwick, of the Association for Idaho Cities, said he would caution against giving every property owner the right to create an ADU, as it could add strain on utility systems if too many additional users are added. 
“It’s the amount of sewage and stuff that goes into the system, regardless of where it comes from, it only can handle so much,” Chadwick said. “And so your systems, if you can’t expand those systems, we’re always going to be behind, and we will never be able to service and add the additional housing that we need.” 
City of Boise Building Official Jason Blais said the city’s public works department has not had issues with tying in smaller dwelling units to existing infrastructure. He highlighted that after Boise updated its zoning code in 2023 to allow for more ADUs, the city has seen permits for them go from 30 to 35 a year up to around 80 per year. 
 Many say tax incentives and ‘gap funding’ are needed to complete truly affordable housing 

Some members of the committee, such as Toews, argued that they mostly support free-market solutions to the housing issues. 
Others said that current high costs for land and construction made it impossible for developers to build housing that low and middle-income households could afford. 
“Developers, they build what the market can support, and then they build what’s feasible,” said Caleb Roope, CEO and president of the Eagle-based housing development company Pacific Companies. “… absent incentives, absent support from localities, those kinds of homes just won’t get built.” 
He and other committee members highlighted the state’s Workforce Housing Fund, which was created in 1992 but not funded until 2022, when the Idaho Legislature added $50 million. Rabe said it helped finance 1,200 units across the state. 
She and others expressed support for the state to make another investment in the fund.

Woodward, who also highlighted previous state investments in rural water and sewer infrastructure projects, said the state faced a “different budget picture” this year. In wake of back-to-back years of tax cuts, and increasing use of sales tax revenue, an October state budget report showed Idaho facing a projected $56.6 million deficit by the end of the fiscal year, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
Committee members highlighted other ways to make affordable developments more financially feasible, such as property tax incentives or moral obligation bonds, which are tax-exempt government bonds with a moral but not legal obligation to pay back. 
Maupin, of the Idaho Association of Counties, said existing tax breaks for affordable housing came with too many restrictions to make them usable for many projects. 
Jason Kreizenbeck, a lobbyist representing a large workforce housing developer, said the firm plans to bring another version of House Bill 406 — a bill that it proposed during the 2025 session that would amend the property tax exemption for low-income units. The bill did not receive a public hearing. 
 Cities and counties still feeling damage from 2021 property tax bill House Bill 389 

Multiple representatives of city and county government said budgets continued to be hampered by 2021 legislation House Bill 389 — which capped the growth of local governments’ budgets and reduced how much they could collect from taxes related to new construction. The bill was meant to ease the property tax burden on residents. 
Chadwick said as a result of the bill, the Star region’s budget has been limited to a point where it can’t keep up with growth, leading to issues such as an empty fire station that’s been left unstaffed since local fire districts failed to pass levies to pay for the additional fire and emergency personnel needed to keep up with population growth, the Idaho Press reported previously. 
Rabe said that continuing to work on the legislation should remain a priority. 
“We do need to tackle the challenges that House Bill 389 has created for our cities, and not allowing growth to pay for itself,” Rabe said. “I think that has really been what I’ve heard as the root of the problem in all of this related to infrastructure. And I love the ideas that we have here, but I think because of House Bill 389, we are trying to plug holes in a sinking ship, essentially.”

A Bureau of Land Management auction planned for next summer could test the state’s migration policy to an unprecedented degree.
The post ‘Energy dominance’ meets migration: All Wyoming corridors overlap with proposed oil and gas leases appeared first on WyoFile .","A federal auction scheduled for June proposes leasing tracts of all three protected Wyoming migration corridors to oil and gas drilling, and it also opens the door to rigs within a now-unprotected pronghorn corridor that’s eyed for protections of its own. 
The potential for industrial incursion into habitats that prized ungulate populations depend on to reach their seasonal ranges in the Platte, Little Snake and Green River basins comes via the Bureau of Land Management’s lease sale of more than 250,000 acres in Wyoming. It’s a sale that’s now in the early “scoping” phase and could still change, but what’s been proposed is to auction more than five dozen parcels totalling 88,000 acres that overlap the state’s first three deer migration corridors and its in-the-works pronghorn corridor. 
The possibility of well pads and industrial infrastructure on the horizon within Wyoming’s most famous migration paths has environmental advocacy groups calling on the BLM to make responsible leasing decisions. 
“We simply can’t lease and allow development in our big game migration corridors if we want our kids and grandkids to have the same hunting and wildlife viewing opportunities that we’ve enjoyed,” said Julia Stuble, the Wyoming state director for The Wilderness Society.

That’s a premise Steve Degenfelder, a landman for Kirkwood Oil and Gas, disagrees with. He’s seeking to acquire at-issue leases in the Green River Basin that intersect with migration paths used by the Sublette herds of pronghorn and mule deer, but says he intends to use horizontal drilling and existing roads to minimize damage to the corridors.
“Wildlife folks can have their cake and eat it, too,” Degenfelder said. “They can have the activity occur far from these critical spaces and still enjoy the tax revenue.” 
Industry assurances and the potential for lease stipulations down the road haven’t placated groups that lobby on behalf of wildlife and wild places. The sheer number of conflicts with valuable habitat in the lease sale is of “great concern,” and it’s unclear whether BLM will listen to those concerns at a time when the federal government is shut down, said Alec Underwood, conservation director for the Wyoming Outdoor Council. 
“While there are places that are appropriate for oil and gas development, potentially fracturing our iconic big game migration corridors is an affront to all those who value Wyoming’s wildlife,” Underwood said.

The Bureau of Land Management’s Wyoming staff were unreachable for an interview. Because of the lapse in appropriations, the agency is only responding to “urgent” media inquiries related to visitor access, safety and essential operations, according to Kristen Peters, a U.S. Department of Interior spokeswoman. 
Underwood’s colleagues at the Wyoming Outdoor Council completed an analysis and compiled maps that show where and how many parcels intersect with designated, identified and known-to-science migration paths. 
The breakdown shows: 

In designated migration paths (those protected by Wyoming’s policy), there are 32 parcels in the lease sale that overlap corridors. Collectively, those parcels encompass 38,727 acres. There are seven parcels totaling 13,749 acres in the Sublette Mule Deer Corridor (AKA, Red Desert to Hoback), three parcels totaling 4,293 acres in the Platte Valley Mule Deer Corridor and 22 parcels totaling 20,685 acres in the Baggs Mule Deer Corridor. 
There are 31 parcels totaling 49,329 acres in the Sublette Pronghorn Corridor, which has been “identified” by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department and is in the process of being assessed for designation by Gov. Mark Gordon. Notably, significant overlap occurs in a disputed portion of the pronghorn corridor located east of Farson. 
The Wyoming Outdoor Council also analyzed parcels in the lease sale that bisected migration routes mapped by the U.S. Geological Survey. There were 23 parcels totaling 29,775 acres that overlapped the Shirley Basin Pronghorn migration (12 parcels, 11,896 acres), Elk Mountain pronghorn migration (five parcels, 6,725 acres) and the Wyoming Range mule deer migration (six parcels, 11,154 acres).

In total, BLM’s second-quarter 2026 sale proposes leasing roughly triple the acreage of what’s slated to be offered during upcoming auctions in December and March. The sharp increase in potentially leased ground comes in the wake of President Donald Trump’s pledge of “energy dominance” — he even declared October to be “National Energy Dominance Month.”

The federal budget reconciliation bill, dubbed the “One Big Beautiful Bill” by Trump, also requires land managers to make more ground available to oil and gas drilling — at least 50% of all public land nominated by industry, according to the Center for Western Priorities. 
Degenfelder, at Kirkwood Oil and Gas, said that many of the parcels he’s interested in leasing in the Green River Basin, including in the migration corridors, were originally nominated via an “expression of interest” he submitted back in 2021, during the Biden administration. The BLM considered offering some of those leases in 2023, but they never materialized in an auction, he said.
“The Rock Springs Field Office authorized them to be offered, and then the state office reversed that,” Degenfelder said.

Stuble, at The Wilderness Society, said federal land managers should pull back leases that are in the migration corridor. The BLM, she argued, has a “statutory obligation” to inventory the migration routes and design management around them. 
“That has not happened for the vast majority of the corridors that are in this lease sale,” Stuble said. “The bottom line for us is allowing gas rigs and well pads in places where the migrating animals forage and rest puts those herds at risk.” 
If the parcels in migration paths do go forward to auction, there’s a likelihood that at least the 32 tracts in designated routes will be affixed with a migration stipulation. Language would be added at the request of the Wyoming Game and Fish Department, according to Will Schultz, the agency’s habitat protection supervisor.
“The lessee or designated operator will be required to work with the BLM and state of Wyoming to take reasonable measures to maintain corridor functionality,” Schultz said.

Schultz is in the process of compiling Game and Fish’s comment letter in response to the BLM lease sale. The state’s migration policy, he said, does not allow for stipulations in the “identified” corridors — like the Sublette Pronghorn herd’s migration.  
“There aren’t the same protections that are afforded to designated routes,” Schultz said. “However … it allows for us to have that opportunity to have a discussion with the operator on voluntary measures that they can take.” 
In an earlier era, Wyoming Game and Fish sought complete lease deferrals when more than 90% of a parcel overlapped with a migration corridor. During a lease sale in the first Trump administration, for example, BLM pulled more than 7,500 acres in the Sublette Mule Deer Migration Corridor path from an auction at the request of the agency. Still, 32 parcels totaling nearly 13,000 acres that overlapped the corridor went to auction and they generated lukewarm interest: Bids topped out at $9 an acre, far below the statewide average of $202 an acre during the 2018 sale.
With Wyoming’s revamped migration policy now in place, the state no longer requests complete deferrals, Schultz said. 
The Bureau of Land Management is accepting feedback on its 2026 second-quarter oil and gas lease sale for Wyoming through Nov. 17. Public comments can be submitted through an online portal available at ePlanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2040967/570.

 “We were hoping that we were gonna be able to get that declaration. It's very hard for a town like ours to pay that kind of money,” said Burke’s town administrator, James Sullivan. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Trump denies federal disaster aid for Vermont’s July 2025 flooding.","In the past two years, the town of Burke has relied on federal funds to recover from floods, but this year, Burke will be cut off from a key source of that funding.
On July 10, rainfall and flooding significantly damaged public infrastructure in Burke and other towns in Caledonia and Essex counties. In August, Gov. Phil Scott submitted a request to President Donald Trump for a major disaster declaration, citing more than $1.8 million in statewide damages, exceeding the $1.2 million threshold that states need to meet to qualify for a declaration.
But Wednesday night, Trump denied the request. 
A federal disaster declaration would have unlocked Federal Emergency Management Agency funding to reimburse municipalities for 75% of the costs, including debris removal, road and public building repairs, and staff overtime during and after the storm.
The declaration would have also made available funds from the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which provides 75% reimbursement for projects that reduce the risk of damage to public infrastructure during future disasters.
Other blue states, Illinois and Maryland, were also denied their requests, while states such as Alaska, Nebraska and North Dakota, and the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe in Minnesota, were approved for major disaster declarations.
Gov. Wes Moore of Maryland responded to the President’s decision in a press release saying, “FEMA has a responsibility to weigh the merits of each emergency request objectively. Instead, President Trump and his Administration have politicized disaster relief, and our communities are the ones who will pay the price. While we disagree with both this process and outcome, our resolve is unbroken. We will continue to support Marylanders recovering from these storms, even if Washington won’t.”
Eric Forand, Vermont Emergency Management director with the Department of Public Safety, said the letter from FEMA on Wednesday night didn’t provide any specific reasons about why the funds were denied.
“All we know is that there’s a threshold (of damage costs) that we crossed, but in the end, it is the discretion of the president, so we did submit it, and we were denied,” Forand said.
A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson called the federal government’s response “non-political” in a response to VTDigger’s request for comment. 
“The law and regulations require FEMA to review each request closely and consider the unique circumstances of disaster-caused damages as well as state and local capacity. This request was determined that the damage from the event was not of such severity and magnitude as to be beyond the capabilities of the state and affected local governments to recover,” the spokesperson wrote.
Burke’s town administrator, James Sullivan, said Burke received disaster declarations after the 2023 and 2024 floods.
“We were hoping that we were gonna be able to get that declaration. It’s very hard for a town like ours to pay that kind of money,” he added, explaining that the town had between $400,000 and $500,000 worth of damage to public infrastructure from this year’s flooding.
Now, Sullivan said, the town will work closely with the Vermont League of Cities and Towns and the Northeastern Vermont Development Association to explore other options, but if they can’t find any solution, costs could fall on taxpayers.
Forand said state officials are still evaluating different courses of action and haven’t decided whether to appeal the government’s denial of federal funding.
A recent analysis by the Pew Research Center shows that without federal assistance after the most significant disasters, many states would see their reserves depleted.
Vermont was among the most vulnerable states to federal funding cuts, according to the analysis. The study looked at the highest amount a state received in a single year for disaster aid, then compared it against the state’s reserves. Vermont received its highest tally of disaster aid — more than $421 million —  in 2011, following Tropical Storm Irene, according to Peter Muller, one of the authors of the research. In 2024, the state’s reserves were just slightly more than that, at $465 million. 
The only states with higher aid-to-reserve ratios were Louisiana and Mississippi — which received billions of dollars in funding from the federal government following Hurricane Katrina,  and were therefore considered outliers in Pew’s analysis. 
Muller highlighted that if states have to use those funds for disasters, they would not be able to use them for other unexpected demands. 
“The really important thing to keep in mind is: Those reserves for Vermont, and every other state, are often intended for more than one purpose. They’re not just sitting there waiting for disasters,” he said.

“No new SNAP benefits will be issued for November unless federal guidance changes,” the department said in a press release. 
This move comes more than three weeks into the federal shutdown, after the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it would not tap into its $6 billion contingency fund to cover food assistance next month.
Nearly 400,000 Mississippians receive food assistance through SNAP, and the vast majority are families with children or elderly people. That is about 13% of the population, slightly higher than the 12% nationwide who use SNAP to help buy groceries.
 The Associated Press reported that officials in Louisiana, Vermont and Virginia pledged Thursday to keep food aid flowing to recipients in their states, even if the federal program is stalled next month because of the government shutdown.
The Mississippi Department of Human Services encourages members to use up their current benefits before the end of October to buy shelf-stable foods, such as canned goods. It’s not clear whether SNAP clients will be able to use pre-existing benefits beyond Oct. 31, the department said. 
The department will continue to process new applications. Current enrollees are also reminded to fulfill all requirements to remain eligible. 
New work requirements for SNAP are slated to fall into place next month, as well, as a result of a federal budget law that President Donald Trump signed during the summer. Work requirements already exist, but the law increases the upper age limit on those from 54 to 65 and extends the requirement to those previously exempt: veterans, those facing homelessness, and young people aging out of foster care. There is still a caregiver exemption, but parents must have children younger than  14 – down from 18.

But Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New […]","Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, is backing bills to move back dates on Louisiana's 2026 election calendar to allow for a possible U.S. Supreme Court decision that could reshape the state's congressional districts. (Photo by Allison Allsop/Louisiana Illuminator)A state lawmaker behind the effort to move back Louisiana’s election calendar next year says legal experts have told him there is a chance the U.S. Supreme Court could rule on a key congressional redistricting case in time for the legislature to draw new boundaries for the 2026 midterm elections.
But Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, said there is no firm date or guarantee that justices will issue their decision in time to justify the calendar change he’s proposed. Two identical bills that adjust next year’s election dates have advanced from their respective chambers through two days of a special legislative session on election laws. 
The measures move next year’s primary election schedule back roughly one month. Instead of an April 18 party primary for Louisiana’s congressional races and some municipal elections, the new date would be May 16. Primary runoffs would be moved from May 30 to June 2. 
The qualifying period for the election would be adjusted from Jan. 14-16 to Feb. 11-13 in the bills Beaullieu and Sen. Caleb Kleinpeter, R-Port Allen, have both co-authored.
Beaullieu said these new dates would allow Louisiana to “take advantage of a window of time” that would be created if the Supreme Court rules before the end of the year on Callais v. Louisiana. The case involves a group of white voters who sued the state over a map created in January 2024 with a second majority-Black district in the U.S. House of Representatives out of the state’s six spots. 
The plaintiffs have called into question a portion of the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, created and amended over decades to protect the electoral strength of Black citizens. They argue Section 2, which prohibits voting laws or procedures that discriminate based on race, color or membership in a language minority group, now conflicts with the 14th and 15th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. Those amendments cover, in part, representation in Congress and racial discrimination in voting.
Gov. Jeff Landry and Attorney General Liz Murrill, both Republicans, originally supported the version of a congressional map with two Black-majority seats. They now stand with plaintiffs and hope the Supreme Court rejects the current map that includes the 6th Congressional District, held by U.S. Rep. Cleo Fields, D-Baton Rouge, that covers a winding stretch between Baton Rouge and Shreveport.
Beaullieu, who chairs the House and Governmental Affairs Committee, confirmed he was part of a state contingency that went to Washington. D.C., for the Supreme Court’s Oct. 15 hearings on the Callais case. Justices heard from both parties in March but later asked for further arguments on the Voting Rights Act provisions.  
The Louisiana group also met with Trump administration officials Oct. 15, but Beaullieu said there was no discussion of when the Supreme Court might rule on Callais.  
“There was a visit at the White House, but it was more to make sure that what we were doing was giving our legislature the most flexibility [for a possible redistricting],” Beaullieu said in an interview. “They weren’t saying anything about dates or anything.” 
Rep. Ed Larvadain, D-Alexandria, disputed Beaullieu’s account Friday morning during a House and Governmental Affairs hearing on the election calendar bill. He speculated, without evidence, that Landry already has been given word that the Supreme Court will throw out Louisiana’s current congressional map and will allow lawmakers to draw a new version with one or no majority-Black districts.
“The governor wouldn’t call us in and spend all this money if there wasn’t an opinion coming,” Larvadain said. “I think an opinion has already been written. It just hasn’t been dropped yet.”
Beaullieu stressed to the committee there’s no official forecast when the Callias decision will be issued. He later acknowledged to a reporter the election calendar changes he backs would become pointless if the Supreme Court doesn’t rule before the end of the year.
“We’re not going to second-guess ourselves,” Beaullieu added. “It would be the opposite if we had not had the session, and [justices] come back early enough [with a decision]. Then our hands are tied because we didn’t push the dates back. I think that would be the worst-case scenario, so I think us being proactive is the best thing for the state and the legislature.” 
Black Democrats on the House and Governmental Affairs Committee pressed Beaullieu to explain his optimism for an earlier-than-usual Supreme Court ruling on the Callais case. He said lawyers have told him that because justices have heard two sets of arguments in the case, they could be inclined to rule this year instead of waiting until the spring when they typically issue their decisions after fall arguments. 
Pressed to identify those lawyers, Beaullieu said they included Attorney General Murrill and House Speaker Pro Tempore Mike Johnson, R-Pineville, among others.
“I don’t know that that’s a scientific answer,” Beaullieu said. “That’s just the thoughts that are out there.”
Rep. Candace Newell, D-New Orleans, raised concerns with Beaullieu that a Supreme Court decision on Callais, followed soon by an anticipated redistricting session, might run afoul of what’s called the Purcell principle. It comes from a 2006 ruling when justices said election laws should not be changed too close to an election because it could lead to confusion among officials.
First Assistant Secretary of State Catherine Newsom told the committee her agency is prepared to move forward with next year’s elections whether they stay on their current dates or get pushed back one month.
If the legislature does revisit redistricting later this year, the secretary of state would need data from the new maps by mid-January to begin the revised three-day qualifying period Feb. 11.
The Louisiana Senate will meet Saturday and is expected to advance Kleinpeter’s versions of the Beaullieu election calendar bill and a proposal that moves five state constitutional amendments from the April ballot to May. 
The House returns Monday.

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)SIOUX FALLS — South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden and a group of legislators — including one seeking his job — made rival proposals this week to shift millions in state housing infrastructure funds to other purposes.
On Wednesday, a legislative task force working on property tax reduction advanced 19 ideas that could become legislation this winter. The ideas include taking the roughly $65 million remaining in the state’s housing infrastructure fund and pairing it with money from the state’s budget reserves to provide $500 individual property tax credits to homeowners.
On Friday, Rhoden said he wants to use $30 million of housing infrastructure money to offer interest-free loans of up to $15 million each for expansion projects at the Sioux Falls and Rapid City airports.
“We’ve seen huge increases in travelers coming through these airports,” Rhoden said while making the announcement at the airport in Sioux Falls. “With more gates, more flights, and more destinations, we’ll be able to draw more visitors.” 
The plans require approval from legislators, who will gather in January at the Capitol in Pierre for their annual lawmaking session.

Both plans target the Housing Infrastructure Financing Program, which legislators and Rhoden’s predecessor, Kristi Noem, created in 2023. They used a mix of state and federal money to create a $200 million fund.
Awards from the program cover up to a third of a developer’s cost for things like roads, water-and-sewer lines, and sidewalks. The fund has supported 83 projects statewide, helping to create 7,360 single-family housing lots and 5,754 apartment or other multi-family units.
Half of the fund went out as grants. About $65 million remains from the other half, devoted to loans.
Rhoden wants to move the $65 million from the housing infrastructure fund to the state’s Revolving Economic Development and Initiative Fund, known as the REDI Fund. The $30 million could then be loaned to the airports. 
Rhoden did not specify a use for the rest of the money, but in the REDI Fund it would be available for low-interest loans to start-up firms, businesses that are expanding or relocating in South Dakota, and local economic development corporations. REDI Fund loans are awarded by the state Board of Economic Development, whose members are appointed by the governor.
When asked about the shift in purpose for the money, Rhoden’s spokeswoman, Josie Harms, responded with a statement.
“It wouldn’t have been right to use these dollars sooner, before they had the opportunity to be used for housing development — but by now they have,” the statement said. “Most of the original $200 million was invested into housing, and what remains is currently sitting unused; therefore, adding no value to South Dakotans. It’s only right to invest these dollars so that they are actively adding value to our great state.”
Rhoden has not yet formally declared himself a candidate to keep his job next year, but he has published a campaign website and is seeking campaign contributions. 
The idea to use remaining housing infrastructure money for property tax credits is from state House Speaker Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, one of several declared candidates for governor in next year’s elections and a co-chairman of the property tax task force.
Rhoden criticized Hansen’s plan Friday. 
“That proposal, quite frankly, has no merit,” Rhoden said, arguing that one-time credits would be a bandage approach to the ongoing problem of rising property taxes.
Hansen responded in a statement to South Dakota Searchlight.
“Families are getting hammered by high property taxes, and they remain my top priority,” Hansen said. “They need relief now — no more delays, no more excuses, and definitely no more of these budget swaps to fund pet projects.”

Rhoden has his own proposal to lower property taxes by giving counties — which currently can’t impose sales taxes — the option to levy a half-percent sales tax while using the revenue to lower or replace homeowner property taxes.
Meanwhile, an economic development official thinks the remaining housing dollars should stay where they are.
“We’re disappointed that the administration has turned away from the business of investing in housing infrastructure,” said Julie Johnson, an Aberdeen-area lobbyist for various economic development and housing groups. “These are very important funds in the world of housing development across the state.”
Last week, the president and CEO of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank, Neel Kashkari, told a Rapid City audience that the best thing local governments can do for housing affordability is encourage more home construction.
“Localities need to look at what can you do locally to try to remove some of the barriers that are preventing more supply from coming in,” Kashkari said.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0959-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 18:56:50.412075

Santee Cooper’s governing board voted unanimously Friday to allow the power company’s management team to officially begin negotiating with Brookfield Asset Management on an agreement to restart construction of the failed expansion project at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant in Fairfield County.
Brookfield, which boasts a $1 trillion global investment portfolio, was among more than 70 companies to express interest after Santee Cooper put a call out nine months ago. It was a partner on one of 15 proposals Santee Cooper ultimately reviewed.
Negotiations will continue over the next six weeks, CEO Jimmy Staton said. Santee Cooper will name the other partners on the project at a later date.
Santee Cooper did not make public the potential terms of the deal, expected to be valued in the billions.
But Staton said Santee Cooper would use any cash proceeds it may earn from the agreement to pay down debts still owed on the abandoned nuclear facility. Customers could also benefit from the power the reactors would produce if finished.
“I feel pretty confident that our customers will realize some fairly significant value, both rates wise and otherwise, in this process,” Staton said.
Santee Cooper and the now defunct South Carolina Electric & Gas started construction on the two first-of-their-kind nuclear reactors alongside an existing unit near rural Jenkinsville in early 2013. But the project was riddled with delays, cost overruns and fraud that led to multiple federal convictions of former executives.
Final executive punished for VC Summer failure to spend at least 10 months in prison

The utilities abandoned the plant’s expansion in 2017, but not before jointly spending $9 billion on the reactors that never produced a single megawatt.
Santee Cooper’s share of the debt was $3.6 billion, which customer continue to pay for on their monthly bills. Those payments could continue, in part or in full, through 2032, depending how much money Santee Cooper can secure for a buy down in any final deal with Brookfield.
If the two companies manage to ink a contract, Staton pledged that Santee Cooper customers will face no new costs associated with the project. All of that will be borne by Brookfield, as well as big tech companies, such as Google or Meta, that could buy the nuclear power a finished plant would generate.
“We’ve protected the rate payers of South Carolina, and quite frankly, I think we’ve shifted the paradigm of how nuclear energy gets built here in the United States,” Staton said.
After the firms mothballed the reactors eight years ago, SCE&G’s parent company, SCANA, spiraled into bankruptcy, as did the reactors’ designer, Westinghouse.
Virginia-headquartered Dominion Energy bought up SCANA.
Dominion is not part of the deal, so it won’t at all pay down debt saddled to its 800,000 South Carolina customers. They’ll continue to pay over the next 14 years for $2.3 billion worth of debt from the abandoned expansion.
Here’s how much SC power customers are still paying for a failed nuclear project

And it was Santee Cooper’s potential new partner, Brookfield, that took over Westinghouse in 2018.
To restart construction, Santee Cooper and Brookfield will need to find a construction firm. Westinghouse, which remains a part of Brookfield’s investment portfolio, won’t be the builder this time, Staton said.
It will take a year or more of due diligence, licensing and permitting before any construction on the inactive plants can restart, Staton added.
Among the funds Brookfield manages is a portfolio focused on clean energy and decarbonization. Earlier this month, the firm announced it had raised $20 billion for the effort.
The move to restart V.C. Summer follows calls by Gov. Henry McMaster earlier this year for a “nuclear power renaissance” in the state.
Sen. Graham on SC’s proposed nuclear reboot: ‘We’re going to finish these reactors’

And U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has vowed his support for the effort, which will ultimately have to make its way through the federal regulatory process.
Staton also pointed to a May executive order signed by President Donald Trump, which calls on the Department of Energy to prioritize approvals for 10 large-scale nuclear reactors under construction by 2030.
“South Carolina is going to have number one and number two in that process,” Staton said. “You have placed South Carolina in the epicenter of the resurgence of nuclear in the United States.”
Still, nuclear power projects are expensive and take years to complete.
Vogtle Electric Generating Plant, operated by Southern Co. in Georgia, started construction around the same time as V.C. Summer. Work on the expansion wrapped up last year. Today the site is the nation’s largest nuclear plant, with four reactors.
But adding the two newest reactors cost more than $30 billion, more than twice the initial estimates.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_2264-1024x705.jpg,,,2025-10-24 18:56:50.412075

The proposal outlines 14 short-term initiatives aimed at curbing disorder in the state's largest city.

Gov. Phil Scott released a set of initiatives that he says will help address public safety in Burlington, ranging from increasing law enforcement presence to expanding substance use treatment. 
Details of how the proposals would be rolled out remain under ongoing discussion, officials said Friday, with state and city leaders adding that, despite past tensions, working together and combining resources would be key to the plan’s success.  
The governor announced the steps of the 14-point “short term action plan” in a press release Thursday. 
“I believe this collaborative effort will help Burlington turn the corner, so residents, students, visitors, business owners and their employees feel safe, so they can enjoy all the attributes this historic city has to offer,” Scott said in the announcement. 
He also underscored that the proposals would be put into effect over a three to four month period, with more long-term efforts to come. 
The outline does not go into great detail about many of the proposals — most are laid out in only a sentence. The initiatives also do not include projected cost estimates or provide information about how they would be funded. 
Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for the governor’s office, wrote in an email Friday that the plan will be funded “within existing resources.”

It is unclear what the projected price tag for each part of the plan would be and how that would be funded. Wheeler did not immediately respond to a follow-up email requesting more details.
Scott’s announcement comes more than a month after he declared he would develop a plan to address public safety concerns in Burlington. Previously, Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak said that Scott wasn’t doing enough to help the Queen City. 
In turn, Jennifer Morrison, commissioner of the Vermont Department of Public Safety and Burlington’s former police chief, said at an August press conference with the governor that Burlington was the one that needed to step up. “The city has made their bed, and they are going to have to ask for specifics to help turn the corner,” Morrison said at that time.  
Speaking on the governor’s new plans, Mulvaney-Stanak said Friday that the city is grappling with more complex problems than a municipality could possibly handle on its own. 
She sees homelessness, mental health issues and the opiate crisis as the main “trifecta” of issues the city is grappling with, she said. While those problems are certainly suffered statewide, she said that Burlington has been “the canary in the mine” for some time. 
Mulvaney-Stanak said that as the governor’s plans get underway in the coming months, it’s time to start looking at medium and long-term solutions. 
“How do we get to the deeper issues here that underpin a lot of the folks who are truly suffering in the center of all this?” she asked. 
A special court docket
One part of Scott’s plan — the establishment of a special docket aimed at reducing a backlog of cases pending in Chittenden County Superior criminal court — was already announced earlier this month and is now up and running. Its launch came after public defenders saw a large recent uptick in criminal cases in the county over the summer. 
That plan included the governor appointing a special prosecutor, the judiciary assigning a judge, and the defender general’s office naming a lead defense attorney to help move cases of people with five or more cases through the court system. 
A retired judge, Martin Maley, has been specially assigned to preside over the docket, according to Chief Superior Judge Thomas Zonay. 
Zonay added in an email Friday that the governor’s office has “indicated” it will cover the costs associated with operating the additional courtroom during the 90-day pilot docket period. 
“We project that the additional costs, including a judicial officer, court personnel and security personnel to approximate $150,000,” Zonay wrote. 
Police cooperation
In his latest announcement, Scott said that a number of policing initiatives will accompany the court. He offered state law enforcement resources to assist city police with “foot patrols, marked unit presence, and greater visibility in Burlington,” the announcement said. 
Scott also directed local service providers that work with the Agency of Human Services to use law enforcement “when appropriate for violent and disruptive behaviors in and around their premises.” 
Adam Silverman, a state police spokesperson, referred specific questions about the law enforcement agency’s role in the plan, and how the plan would be funded, to the governor’s office. 
Wheeler, the governor’s spokesperson, stated in an email that the administration would be in “close communication” with Burlington Police Chief Shawn Burke “to coordinate the operational details.”
Details of collaboration between city and state police are yet to be determined, Burke said Friday. Burke said he’s meeting soon with the director of the state police and Zach Weight, the special prosecutor, to iron out the details. 
Burke said he doesn’t see Scott’s plan as an “enforcement only” strategy.
“Any notion that enforcement is the only way out of this is completely false, but policing is important,” Burke said. And sometimes police presence and response is necessary to keep people safe, he said. 
Burke doesn’t expect Scott’s plan to change the way his officers police, he said. It really augments resources, he said. 
Mulvaney-Stanak said that she’s grateful for the resources in the court system, but that it’s necessary for the court and the police to also be connecting people with the resources they need, rather than just incarcerating them. 
Prison is a “non-solution” — both her Burke share that opinion, Mulvaney-Stanak said. People should only be sentenced to prison if they’re violent or an acute threat to the community, she said. 
Pre-trial supervision
For people who are sentenced to prison, Scott’s plan calls for the corrections department to expand prison substance use treatment as well as the “immediate implementation” of a pre-trial supervision program in Burlington.
Haley Sommer, a corrections department spokesperson, said Friday that the department already provides substance treatment to incarcerated individuals, such as medication assisted treatment. 
The proposal calls for the corrections department to “intensify” substance use treatment in facilities to provide services more like a person would receive in a residential treatment facility available in the community, Sommer said. That would include, Sommer said, increased hours, enhanced assessments and additional types of treatment. 
The pretrial supervision program will build on a pilot program already underway in Essex and Orleans counties, and expand it into Burlington and Chittenden County, according to Sommer.
“It serves those who have been charged with a crime and that are awaiting trial and they are in the community,” Sommer said. 
According to Sommer, the program targets “certain high-risk” people who may have previously violated their conditions of release or have multiple dockets and need more support services as they await resolution of their cases. 
Sommer said money to pay for the pretrial supervision initiative in Burlington would come from funds in the state budget already approved for the previously planned expansion of the program.  
Mulvaney-Stanak said that she and Weight, special prosecutor of the new court, have already noticed a gap in services between when someone is cited for a crime and when they appear in court. “That’s an immediate break in a system that often will push people right back out into the street,” she said. They are considering how to close that gap, she said. 
Scott’s creation of the new court comes at a time when corrections facilities in Vermont are oversubscribed, with male facilities almost 60% above the recommended threshold, according to department data. Sommer said it’s not clear at this point whether the overall plan would lead to an increase in people incarcerated.
“It’s challenging to predict what those numbers will look like,” Sommer said. “We do also have some outlet for sending individuals out of state as we’re currently contracted for around 300 beds, but only have 128 men out of state.”

He's seen here speaking in 2024 at the Colorado Bar Association office in Denver. (Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said he would support a state constitutional amendment that would allow the state to redraw its congressional districts to offset partisan gerrymandering in other states.
Weiser, a Democrat who is also running for governor next year, is the first statewide official to support such an idea. He first shared his support during a Thursday interview with 9News. On Friday his campaign announced his position in a statement.
“When states like Texas and North Carolina redraw their maps to stack the deck in favor of Republicans, Colorado must be prepared to respond. If we want to stop this dangerous power grab, we must remove the incentive for these tactics in the first place — that means being ready to act,” he said in the statement.

President Donald Trump has urged Republican-led states to redraw their congressional lines so the party can pick up more seats in the U.S. House of Representatives next year. Texas, Missouri and North Carolina completed that mid-decade redistricting to give Republicans an advantage. California voters will decide on a ballot measure to redraw the state’s maps in November.
“When other states break long established norms and do mid-decade redistricting, Colorado can’t stand idly by and just watch,” Weiser said.
An independent redistricting commission draw congressional maps in Colorado, and the panel redrew the maps for the first time in 2021. Colorado has eight congressional districts, with four represented by Democrats and four represented by Republicans.
A proposed state constitutional amendment for next year’s ballot, however, would give the governor emergency redistricting power to offset “national redistricting imbalances.” That ballot measure has not yet been filed with the secretary of state’s Title Board, but it underwent a review by Legislative Council Staff in September.
Weiser is calling for a “narrowly-drawn” constitutional amendment to allow mid-decade redistricting. The earliest any new maps could be drawn under that amendment would be for the 2028 cycle.
U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet, the other high-profile Democrat running for Colorado governor, said in a statement to Newsline that Democrats need to focus on flipping House seats to put pressure on Trump.
“All options should be on the table to defend our democracy, but changing the maps in 2028 is too late,” he said. “We can take on Republicans like (Rep.) Lauren Boebert and win House seats here in Colorado — from Adams and Weld Counties to the Western Slope and El Paso County.”

Gov. Kelly Armstrong remains steadfast in his refusal to reappoint incumbent Murray Sagsveen. Sens. David Hogue, R-Minot, and Kathy Hogan, D-Fargo, adamantly maintain he should be one of the three appointees to minimize turnover on the board. 
“The learning curve for new people on this commission is probably two to three years because it’s a very complex commission,” Hogan said. “I’m concerned about continuity, and that’s part of the reason why I’m hesitant to replace Mr. Sagsveen.”

Hogue and Armstrong believe the Ethics Commission has been trespassing upon executive branch authority and that needs to be addressed. But they differ on whether Sagsveen can be part of the solution. 
Armstrong also said he strongly disagrees with Sagsveen’s assertion in a candidate questionnaire that the Legislature has passed laws to limit the authority of the Ethics Commission, violating the state constitution.
Hogue suggested the committee appoint one candidate to a four-year term to replace Ward Koeser and then continue to work toward a compromise on the remaining two vacancies. Koeser isn’t seeking reappointment.
“I don’t think any one of us would lose any bargaining position if we fill that position today,” Hogue said. 
Armstrong, a Republican, said he prefers to appoint candidates to all three vacancies simultaneously instead of making piecemeal selections. 
“I want the weekend to think about it,” Armstrong said. 
Sagsveen and Koeser continue to serve on the commission until replaced or reappointed by the selection committee even though their terms expired on Aug. 31. Cynthia Lindquist and Ron Goodman’s terms expire in 2027. The fifth seat is vacant following the May death of former Chair Dave Anderson. 
Sagsveen was initially appointed to the commission last September to fill a vacancy after Paul Richard retired. Sagsveen has nearly five decades of experience in state government and has served under multiple Republican leaders. 
The appointment of an ethics commissioner requires the consensus of the governor, Senate majority leader and Senate minority leader, not a majority vote. 
Armstrong adjourned the meeting after 11 minutes of discussion. No appointments were made. The committee will reconvene early next week. 
Governor wants ‘reset’ from North Dakota Ethics Commission as committee deadlocks on candidates

Cathy Bliss, a member of the League of Women Voters who routinely observes Ethics Commission meetings, said she is mystified by the governor’s refusal to reappoint Sagsveen. 
“I was really quite shocked. Apparently I’m still naive at this age,” Bliss said in an interview. 
But she is encouraged by the bipartisanship of Hogue and Hogan who have presented a united front. 
“Take your time. Get it right because this is really important,” Bliss said. “We’re at a critical juncture.”
Ellen Chaffee, one of the private citizens and activists behind the constitutional amendment that created the Ethics Commission, took issue with Armstrong demanding a “reset” from the watchdog agency.
She said the tenor of the discourse around and with the Ethics Commission by other parts of state government needs to change. 
“There’s a certain level of maturity and respect and civility,” Chaffee said. “That’s what needs to be reset.” 
Hogan said after the meeting she is worried about delaying the appointments for too long because the Ethics Commission has been “tentative” about taking action until the new members of the board are appointed.
“I’m not sure if we can get to consensus,” Hogan said.

(Photo via Getty Images)The Iowa Freedom of Information Council is arguing against the award of damages in a libel case where the plaintiffs showed no evidence of harm to their reputation.
In June 2021, a Polk County jury awarded $8 million to a Polk County man and his daughter in a defamation case against their neighbor, former Des Moines lawyer Jaysen McCleary. The plaintiffs had alleged McCleary had wrongfully claimed the man sexually molested his own daughter.
The Iowa Court of Appeals reversed that decision when it found the district court erred by denying a trial continuance McCleary had sought for health reasons. The case was remanded to district court for a new trial to assess damages, resulting in the father and daughter being awarded a combined $57,000 in compensatory damages for emotional distress, plus $570,000 in punitive damages. The district court then reduced the punitive-damage award to $55,000.
That decision is being appealed and cross-appealed, and this week the Iowa Freedom of Information Council weighed in through a friend-of-the-court brief, arguing that such damages shouldn’t be permitted in libel cases that involve non-media defendants and where there’s been no showing of reputational harm.
“The juries that tried this matter were instructed to assess damages for (McCleary’s) speech,” the council argues in its brief to the court. “So, unlike most any other tort case, plaintiffs’ injury was presumed, and jurors were charged only with calculating how much to give them in damages for libel. Yet the evidence demonstrated these plaintiffs had incurred no injury to reputation. The resultant awards accordingly arose without proof of an otherwise essential element of a defamation claim and provided compensation for hurt feelings only.”
The council argues the two jury awards in the McCleary case contradict the directive of the Iowa Civil Jury Instructions on libel damages, which tell jurors that “damages must be limited to those which naturally result from the defendant’s statement.”
The council argues the district court’s own rulings in the case “establish the irrefutable fact that the plaintiffs did not incur any injury to reputation from the statements they claim defamed them.”
As evidence of that conclusion, the council cites post-trial rulings in which the district court asserted that “there was no evidence that either plaintiff suffered any reputational damage,” and that there was “no testimony that any individual believed” any of the statements made by McCleary.
“The district court made findings and rulings that the record lacked proof of the very essence of a libel action, which is injury to reputation,” the council argues in its brief.
As part of that same brief, the council says it hopes to add a “distinct public policy voice to the debate” on free-speech protection that is “afforded everyday Iowans sued for defamation, especially now that libel per se verdicts in the state regularly surpass the $1 million mark.”
The council argues the district court’s decision — confirming no injury to the plaintiffs’ reputation while endorsing the recovery of damages — “defies logic and offends the widely accepted principle that courts redress injury rather than reward favored litigants with a windfall.”
In its friend-of-the-court brief, the council also notes that it is acting “in support of free speech generally, rather than for or against any speaker or subject.” In fact, the council says it “renounces the conduct of the parties, including how each has used libel law and the judicial system as armaments to wage personal war.”
The council also notes that McCleary unsuccessfully pursued lawsuits against the Des Moines Register, one of its founding members, and former Register reporter Clark Kauffman, now with the Iowa Capital Dispatch, for a series of stories about McCleary’s use of the court system.

The October survey also found that public opinion around Scott’s return-to-office mandates, and his refusal to send National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., ran clearly along party lines.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
The latest University of New Hampshire Green Mountain State Poll results released on Friday indicate that the majority of Vermonters approve of Gov. Phil Scott’s performance in office and want him to run for reelection next year.
The October poll outlined political positioning leading up to next year’s statewide elections, according to professor Andrew Smith, an author of the poll and director of UNH’s Survey Center. It draws on 880 survey responses collected last week, which are weighted according to demographic information from U.S. Census data and recent election results, Smith said.
The governor has remained relatively popular with Democrats and “mitigated some of the anger” from those farther to his right since the presidential election, Smith said. “He’s in a pretty good spot for reelection.”

Over 60% of Vermonters approved of Scott’s work as governor, with 57% to some extent in favor of him running for reelection. Slightly less than half believed he actually deserved to be reelected, the survey said.
Scott’s consistently high standing in polling is particularly noteworthy given the state’s strong blue leanings in other areas of politics, Smith said. The survey found 80% of Democrats and over half of all Vermonters describe Scott as far or slightly to the right of their own views. Yet in a question that allowed poll-takers to say they wanted multiple potential candidates to run, Scott registered only slightly lower support, 47%, among Democrats than the 50% garnered by liberal State Treasurer and rumored gubernatorial hopeful Mike Pieciak. An even lower 38% of Democrats said they wanted State Attorney General Charity Clark — another possible challenger for governor — to run. 
But Scott’s potential Democratic opponents also registered high rates of “don’t know/no opinion” responses to this query. “The major reason for Vermonters’ ambivalence about Pieciak and Clark is they are largely unknown,” the survey authors observed.
For more than 70% of Republicans, Scott sat far or slightly to their left. Just 20% of all Vermonters thought that Scott’s politics are “close to (their) own views,” the survey estimated.

U.S. Rep. Becca Balint, I-Vt., continued to demonstrate strong appeal among the state’s Democrats, with just over half the state saying she deserves reelection, according to the survey.
Mark Coester, a Republican who ran against Balint in 2024, has filed to repeat his challenge next year. Just 6% of Vermonters had a favorable opinion of Coester, and more than three-quarters didn’t know enough about him to say, the survey found.
The survey also had several questions about current state policy decisions, determined by taking a “look at what issues are in the news, what people are paying attention to,” Smith said.
The poll asked respondents about the Scott administration’s much-discussed return-to-office plan for state employees, which has drawn pushback from the Vermont State Employees Association, among others. Overall, 51% of Vermonters supported the policy to some extent, with 13% remaining neutral, the survey found.
But public opinion on the governor’s policy ran heavily along party lines — 80% of Republicans and 64% of Independents strongly or somewhat supported the measure, compared with just a third of Democrats. 
The governor’s refusal to send Vermont National Guard troops to Washington, D.C. at the request of President Donald Trump was met with relative popularity across the state, Friday’s poll said. The move was opposed to some degree by 70% of Republicans, but affirmed by 98% of Democrats. With all responses combined, 72% of all Vermonters approved of the decision, the survey found.

(USDA photo / Preston Keres)Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte, as well as all four members of the state’s federal delegation signed on to a letter last month claiming American Prairie’s bison restoration project is at odds with the state’s economy.
The five men sent the letter to Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota. The Interior Department holds decision-making power over grazing rights on Bureau of Land Management land, which under former President Joe Biden were granted to American Prairie in 2022. 
The state, along with livestock industry groups, appealed the federal decision. Some ranchers have also expressed concern about added costs of having bison near their cattle, including fears of brucellosis, a bacterial disease that can spread between the animals. 
“For us, a decision in favor of APR will re-shape the entire landscape of our state,” the letter reads. “Montana’s most profitable economic industry, for decades, has been agriculture. Agriculture drives our economy, sustains our small rural towns, and is the cultural epicenter of our state.”
While there’s no question agriculture is a cultural hallmark of the state, as a percentage of the state’s real gross domestic product, the industry ranked 12th in 2022. That year, Montana generated around $4.6 billion in agricultural cash receipts.
The letter goes on to argue removing “vast swaths” of land from agricultural production will harm the state and allowing American Prairie those grazing rights “threatens the economic vitality of our most important industry.”
American Prairie has sought to reintroduce bison to parts of Montana and owns more than 500,000 acres in the state. They own and manage 900 head of bison across 46,000 acres. The organization leases much of its land to cattle producers, supporting about 7,000 head and 25 ranchers, the organization spokesperson Pete Geddes said in a statement. There are almost a half million cattle in the seven counties they work, he added. Including calves, there are about 2.1 million head of cattle in the state.
“The claim that American Prairie ‘threatens the economic vitality’ of the state, is on its face absurd,” Geddes said. “American Prairie has little influence on the long-term demographic and economic trends in Central Montana. Extended drought, market fluctuations, international trade policies, personal family decisions, and global integrated agricultural markets have much larger impacts.”
Geddes went on to say that since 2020, the organization has paid $7 million in payroll, supporting 23 local jobs in Fergus and Phillips Counties, which infused $17 million into those economies, he said. They’ve also paid $877,000 in property taxes and $345,000 to ranchers participating in a wildlife abundance program, he added.
 
Some ranchers, including Gilles Stockton, an author and former president of the Montana Cattlemen’s Association, have other concerns. 
“If you’re ranching in a brucellosis designated area, which they have in southwestern Montana, it’s hugely expensive,” Stockton said. “And it’s doubly expensive if one of your cows happens to become brucellosis positive.”
Some elk and about 60% of female bison in Yellowstone National Park test positive for brucellosis, a disease that attacks the reproductive system and causes abortions in pregnant cattle, elk, and bison. It’s a nonnative disease to the area, brought into Yellowstone by cattle in the 1900s and can also cause sickness in humans, though human infection is uncommon and the state hasn’t reported an official case since 2017.
“One of the primary mechanisms of historical transmission to people is through the milk, but pasteurization has made that a nearly obsolete pathway,” Dr. Tahnee Szymanski, State Veterinarian, said in an interview with the Daily Montanan. “In the 1930s and ’40s, here in the United States, we had a much higher incidence of brucellosis in our cattle herds all across the country, and they started the national brucellosis eradication program.”

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has what’s called Brucellosis Class Free status, a tool used to maintain compliance so infected animals aren’t being moved around or consumed. 
Montana has a “Designated Surveillance Area” for the disease in southwestern Montana — stretching from Dillon to past Livingston, and down to Gardiner and the Wyoming and Idaho borders. 
Those borders are built through a partnership with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, Szymanski said. FWP will go out, capture, tag and test elk and track their movement. Park County and Madison County elk have tested positive for brucellosis, she said. 
That said, Montana is considered brucellosis free.
“The only population of infected animals in Montana is Yellowstone National Park, bison or elk in the Greater Yellowstone Area, we have a couple of livestock herds that are under quarantine for past detections, but any other domestic bison or cattle herd in the state of Montana is considered to be free of brucellosis,” Szymanski said. “That includes tribal populations of bison, APR, bison, people should not be concerned about those animals because of potential disease risk.”
About 100,000 brucellosis tests are administered in that area each year to keep the state’s class free status, according to the Montana Department of Livestock. Cattle vaccinations do have hurdles and have to be performed by a licensed veterinarian. 
“If a human accidentally injected themselves with it, that it would make them kind of substantially sick,” Szymanski said.
That costs about $630,000 per year, according to the agency. Losing the status would incur even more testing costs by places that receive bison and cattle from the state.
“Loss of Class Free status would lead to required testing of livestock exported from anywhere in the State (not just southwest Montana) and cost the livestock producers millions of dollars for testing as well as revenue from lost sales due to a negative stigma,” a Department of Livestock information sheet reads.
American Prairie tests their animals regularly, Geddes said, and brucellosis is not present in their bison.
 
Grazing permits have also been a source of contention for American Prairie, and the letter states the organization is violating federal law.
The letter mentions the Taylor Grazing Act, legislation dating back to 1934 that created stipulations for grazing cattle and eventually led to the creation of the Bureau of Land Management. 
Challenges to the Bureau of Land Management over American Prairie grazing their bison say the act doesn’t allow for conservation grazing. American Prairie asserts that’s not true and Geddes said nowhere in Taylor Grazing Act does it limit grazing permits to production livestock. 
“The BLM is authorized to issue grazing permits to ‘stock owners.’ American Prairie qualifies as both a ‘stock owner’ and ‘engaged in the livestock business.’  AP bison are livestock and we are operating as a non-profit business,” Geddes said. “American Prairie’s primary purpose for obtaining grazing permits is for grazing livestock.”
One of American Prairie’s goals is returning the land to a state more similar to when hundreds of thousands of bison roamed free before colonization and westward expansion.
The Taylor Grazing Act was in part intended to preserve and protect that same grassland, Stockton said, who feels ranchers have done a pretty good job of that.
“The results of that is that we were able to take land that had been really badly overused and restore it across eastern Montana,” Stockton said. “So, you know, the grasslands that you have in eastern Montana are really in the best shapes that they’ve ever been.”
Stockton ranches near Grass Range, is close to American Prairie holdings and feels the Bureau of Land Management overstepped their authority. There’s frustrations with who gets to graze when, fencing problems — keeping cattle away from bison, in a ranchers eyes — and costs associated with vaccinations if brucellosis does spread further.
But, even then, other concerns for Stockton trump issues with the bison nonprofit.
“We got a feeling that the APR, when they moved in here, they were at war with our culture, I guess, our communities and our cultures,” Stockton said. “But the fact of the matter is that in terms of actual impact, say, for me, personally, I’ve got more trouble with my billionaire neighbors.”

(Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)State Senate President Cameron Henry said Friday that he does not believe the National Guard needs to be deployed in New Orleans, but he can see a need for it in Baton Rouge.
“My thought is not to have them come to New Orleans because we have State Police there and they are doing a good job,” Henry, a Republican, said during an interview with the LSU Manship School News Service.
The New Orleans Police Department announced a 20% overall decrease in violent crime incidents so far in 2025 compared to 2024. Despite this decrease, President Donald Trump has talked about sending the National Guard to New Orleans. 
Gov. Jeff Landry has asked the Pentagon to send 1,000 National Guard members to fight crime in New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Shreveport. 
Henry, who represents parts of Jefferson and Orleans parishes, believes the National Guard should be sent elsewhere. 
“Downtown Baton Rouge has a significant homeless population problem,” Henry stated. “Though the National Guard can’t do anything about the homeless population, what they can do something about is the fights and arguments that the homeless are getting into on the street.” 
He adds that Baton Rouge brings in a lot of out-of-state guests for LSU football games. The money from tourists is necessary to continue to fund programs and services that Louisiana residents need.
“To have a group of homeless people fighting in the middle of the street is not a good message for anyone,” Henry said.
Last month, Landry also addressed the homelessness problem during an interview on Unfiltered With Kiran.
“I think that (majority) of the homeless population is really a group of mentally unstable people that need some institutional care,” Landry said. “Another 10% are, quite frankly, a bunch of criminals that use the homeless population to basically camouflage or to carry out their illegal drug activity, their human trafficking. They prey on those people. And it really is inhumane, and it doesn’t do us any good to have people out there.”
The Pentagon has not responded to Landry’s request. Political leaders in New Orleans, which depends on tourism, have voiced their opposition to having guard troops in their city. 
“The National Guard actually doesn’t help toward crime reduction,” said New Orleans Mayor-Elect Helena Moreno during a debate on Sept. 16. She believes that if federal resources were to be used in New Orleans, then the city’s police chief and local leadership should be consulted as to what the city needs. 
Landry sent his request to the Pentagon in late September, leaving the state legislature without any answers. 
“Since he mentioned that, we haven’t heard anything from anybody about it,” Henry states.
While the state continues to wait for a response, there are no current plans for deploying the National Guard into these cities.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Fall yard work and maintenance can be a key time to remove and prevent the spread of invasive species and diseases, according to guidance from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources. 
Invasive species like bush honeysuckle are easy to spot and yank out during the fall and funguses like oak wilt can be best managed by pruning during cooler temperatures. Iowans should also be on the lookout for things like zebra mussels as they pull boats and other equipment out of the water.
The Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship confirmed Friday that the invasive spotted lanternfly has been identified in Iowa. IDALS urged Iowans to keep an eye out for the insects that can be destructive to vineyards, orchards and forests.

These Asian-native insects like to cluster on the trunks of their favorite food, tree of heaven. The lanternflies have brown outer wings with dark spots and bright red and black inside wings that can be seen when the lanternflies open their wings. In nymph form, the lanternflies are black with white spots and turn red as they get older, according to photos from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. 
The insects excrete a sticky “honeydew” substance that can be seen near the plants that a colony has infected. They also create spots of mold that look like soot along the plant and its fruit. As nymphs, the insects gather in large clusters on a plant, which can make them easy to spot.
While the insect prefers tree of heaven, which IDALS said is common in alleyways, unkept urban areas and fence rows, they can feast on around 70 plant species. 
The spotted lanternfly was introduced in Pennsylvania in 2014 and is now present in 20 states. The insect was seen and confirmed in Des Moines County in September, but state entomologists have not seen signs of ongoing infestation in the area. 
IDALS encourages Iowans who identify the spotted lanternfly to contact IDALS at (515) 725-1470, Entomology@IowaAgriculture.gov or their local Iowa State University extension office. 
When bringing outdoor equipment inside, or transporting in the fall and winter, APHIS recommends scanning the items for “egg masses,” which look like smears of mud. These masses should be crushed and scraped into a sealable plastic bag and then thrown away to prevent the spread of spotted lanternfly.

Clean boats and water equipment for zebra mussels 
Boats, trailers, docks and lifts in Iowa’s lakes and rivers should be thoroughly checked and scrubbed down for zebra mussels before being stored for winter, DNR advises. 
DNR’s Aquatic Invasive Species Coordinator Kim Bogenschutz said the winterization process is “a great time” to check for new infestations. 
“As you bring each item out of the water, visually inspect areas that have been submerged for months,” Bogenschutz said in a news release from DNR. “Juvenile zebra mussels should be visible this time of year, but also run your hand over smooth surfaces to check for very small juvenile zebra mussels that feel like sandpaper.”

Zebra mussels are expert hitchhikers, which is why boat owners are instructed to clean, drain and dry all of their equipment before leaving a water body. Equipment like bait buckets should also be emptied and cleaned. According to DNR, it is also illegal to introduce any live fish, except for hooked bait, into public waters.
Zebra mussels, once introduced to a water body, can build up dense clusters, increase algal blooms and interfere with the aquatic food chain. 
DNR has confirmed the presence of zebra mussels in nearly 20 Iowa lakes and nine rivers. Most recently, the department found the mussels in Saylorville Lake. 
Pruners, herbicide and rakes 
As most plants and leaves turn brown in the cooler months, the plants that keep their leaves a bit longer tend to pop out of the landscape. 
DNR said this is the case with bush honeysuckle, a deciduous tree native to Eurasia that will outcompete Iowa native plants in a landscape and is therefore considered invasive. 
Bush honeysuckle plants will hold their leaves well into November, while native varieties’ leaves will drop off. The bush honeysuckle can also be identified by breaking off an older stem. According to DNR, bush varieties will have a hollow, brown core while native varieties will be solid. 
Smaller plants can be pulled out, while more substantial growths of bush honeysuckle will need to be chopped at the roots, or cut near the base and hit with an herbicide solution. 
Removing bush honeysuckle:



Glossy buckthorn is also easy to spot in the cooler months when surrounding vegetation drops its leaves. This small tree or shrub has a brown-gray bark with lighter colored pores and a bright yellow and orange sapwood, the wood just inside the bark. 
These plants can similarly outcompete native species and cause shaded forest floors where other plants have difficulty surviving. According to Iowa State University, the plants are also a host to soybean aphids. 
Iowans can remove glossy buckthorn by chopping it at the base of the plant and coating the exposed stem with herbicide, or by coating the lower 12 to 18 inches of the stem with an herbicide. If the herbicide is dripping off of the plant, it has been over applied, which can be damaging to the surrounding environment. 
Identifying and removing buckthorn: 



DNR also recommends pruning oak trees during colder temperatures to prevent the spread of oak wilt, a fungus that can cause oak trees to wilt and eventually die. 
Tivon Feeley with DNR’s forest health program said pruning outside of the oak tree’s growing season is the best way to prevent the spread of the disease. 
Black oak, pin oak, and red oak trees are most susceptible to the fungus and will typically die within the same season they are infected, according to DNR. White and bur oak varieties can live with the fungus for a number of years before the disease takes over. 
Open wounds in the tree during the growing season can easily be infected by small beetles that carry the fungus spores from one tree to another, which is why DNR recommends pruning outside of the growing season. 
“It’s best to wait until after Oct. 15 to start pruning oak trees,” Feeley said in a news release. “You can prune your oaks all winter long with the goal to stop pruning by March 1.”
Trees can also be infected by root grafts that connect to nearby, infected trees. 
Infected trees will have leaves that bronze along their outer margins and defoliation will begin at the top of the tree. 
Pruning trees and dealing with invasive species in the yard might sound like a lot of work, but DNR said these chores could replace one of the most dreaded fall activities: raking and bagging leaves. 
According to the department, leaving some leaves and yard waste in strategic areas can provide insulation for trees and wildlife and benefit the soil. 
A newsletter from DNR suggested leaving an unmown area of the yard, away from the house, to collect leaves and branches that will provide shelter for critters during the winter. As the leaves sit there, they will break down into a loam that can be beneficial for flower beds or planters come spring.

The initial examination by the Bolivar County coroner and the autopsy completed by the Mississippi medical examiner’s office concluded the death of the 21-year-old Black man was a suicide, and no foul play occurred.
The independent autopsy, conducted later, was paid for by civil rights activist Colin Kaepernick, a former NFL quarterback.

Reed’s body was found hanging in a tree. Some members of his family and activists say they believe he was lynched, and they point to Mississippi’s racist history of lynchings of Black people.
Jeremy Marquell Bridges, an activist from Alabama, said he’s been in recent contact with Reed’s mother, Sophia, and Ben Crump, a nationally prominent attorney representing Reed’s family.
Bridges said this week that Crump needed more time to complete a reenactment as part of the independent investigation. Crump did not specify when that would be complete.
Bridges said the independent investigation revealed injuries sustained from a recent attack by white male students, but he did not provide any proof to Mississippi Today as of Friday.
Delta State University confirmed that Reed had listed his grandmother, Sharon Candy Tillman, as his emergency contact. Tillman said she is waiting to see what the independent autopsy says about claims that Bridges and others are making. 
In an interview with The Chicago Crusader, Bridges said preliminary findings from the independent autopsy alleged that Reed lacked significant bruising around the neck consistent with a suicide by hanging. Bridges also claimed to Mississippi Today that the state crime lab was late supplying Reed’s organs and X-ray imagery to Nebraska pathologist Dr. Matthias Okoye, who the Reed family retained to conduct the independent autopsy.
On Oct. 16, Mississippi Today reached out to Bridges to ask for proof of these claims. Bridges had also claimed that Reed had defended a Black female student who was harassed by white students, and that the buckle was missing from the belt that hung him.
Bridges was unable to provide proof, but he and a member of the Reed family said they were expecting the independent autopsy last week.
Mississippi Department of Public Safety spokesperson Bailey Martin did not address Bridges’ claims that Reed’s organs were delivered late to Okyoe, but confirmed the funeral home had them as of Oct. 17, she wrote in an email to Mississippi Today.
Reed’s funeral was held at Abundant Life Assembly church in his hometown of Grenada on Sept. 27. 
Reed’s mother joined members of the New Black Panthers Party at a protest Oct. 18 on the Delta State campus in Cleveland. They alleged that his death was the result of a lynching. They repeated claims that Reed suffered “blunt force trauma to the back of the head,” which was not found in the coroner’s examination or the autopsy completed by the Mississippi medical examiner’s office.

Rumors have swirled online in the weeks since Reed’s death with videos and posts on social media sites like TikTok and Instagram echoing the allegation that he was beaten before his hanging. Some garnered more than 130,000 likes.
One TikTok user with nearly 30,000 followers removed his September video echoing many of the allegations surrounding Reed’s case. He attributed his decision to a Facebook post by Tillman, Reed’s grandmother. She clarified that the second autopsy was not yet released – and the initial findings have not yet been substantiated.
“I don’t usually respond to social media, but I’m tired,” Tillman wrote in an Oct. 3 Facebook post.
Security footage from campus is still with law enforcement agencies and can’t be shared due to the active nature of the investigation, according to the university.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday confirmed that the Hillsborough County state Senate seat that has been vacant since he appointed Republican Jay Collins to be lieutenant governor will likely not have representation during the regular 2026 legislative session.
The governor announced that the primary election for the Senate District 14 seat will take place on Jan. 13, 2026.  The general election will take place on March 24, 2026.
That’s 11 days after the 2026 Florida legislative session is scheduled to end. The session is slated to begin on Jan. 13 and end on March 13. 
He announced those same election dates for the House District 87 seat in Palm Beach County, vacated when he appointed Republican Mike Caruso in August to serve as clerk of the circuit court and comptroller for Palm Beach County.
DeSantis’ delay in calling an election date in the SD 14 seat led the ACLU of Florida to file a lawsuit in a court in Leon County on Sept. 30, contending the governor had violated his duty under the Florida Constitution and state law. 
The lawsuit noted that, in more than 25 instances, the governor took fewer than five days to call for an election upon a vacancy in a congressional or legislative seat. When then-GOP state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia resigned from his Senate District 11 seat on July 18 after DeSantis named him chief financial officer, the governor took just four days to call a special election for that seat.
SD 14 was considered a swing seat in the 2022 election, but Collins defeated Democratic incumbent Janet Cruz by nearly 10 points. Caruso won re-election to the HD 87 seat by 19 points in 2024.
Among the Republican candidates rumored to be considering a run for the SD 14 seat are former Rep. Shawn Harrison along with HD 65 Rep. Karen Gonzalez Pittman and Melanie Griffin, now secretary of the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation.
Democrat Brian Nathan, a Navy veteran and union leader, has already filed to run for the seat.

This photograph of the tag admitted into evidence, which is held by one bolt and leaning to the right, is useful in digesting constitutional question raised in the case. (Submitted)TOPEKA — The Jackson County traffic stop at 3:30 a.m. Aug. 25, 2021, prompting arrest of passenger Tashara Yeargin-Charles, was an unlikely route to a divided decision by the Kansas Supreme Court on constitutional interpretation of reasonable searches and seizures.
Yeargin-Charles, who engaged in peculiar conduct at the scene along U.S. 75, sought a place in the Supreme Court’s docket to suppress evidence and reverse her district court convictions for possession of methamphetamine, marijuana and drug paraphernalia, interference with law enforcement and transportation of an open liquor container.
A Supreme Court majority considering the appeal rejected her constitutional claims but took the opportunity to further define boundaries on roadside behavior by Kansas law enforcement agencies.
The decision written by Justice Melissa Standridge affirmed Yeargin-Charles’ guilt. In 2024, the Kansas Court of Appeals reached the same conclusion.
Standridge wrote the majority was convinced state law mandated a Kansas license plate had to be securely fastened to the vehicle, positioned at least 12 inches from the ground and clearly visible and legible. The opinion says Jackson County Deputy Justin Dobler and Sergeant Travis DeBarge made a constitutional stop after observing the plate on the Yeargin-Charles vehicle sagged to the right.
“Upon review, we find substantial competent evidence supports the factual underpinnings of the district court’s conclusion that Deputy Dobler had reasonable suspicion to stop the vehicle for a suspected violation,” her opinion said.
Standridge pointed to officers’ testimony that the plate was “loosely secured by a bolt or a screw on the left side in the manufacturer’s hole and was tilted downwards to the right,” the tag was “not secured by anything” on the opposite end and the plate was visibly “flapping in the wind.”
The 4th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Kansas Constitution’s Bill of Rights protect individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. Traffic stops have been determined to be constitutionally permissible when law enforcement officers had facts supporting reasonable suspicion someone was committing, had committed or was about to commit a crime.
 
Dissent on hanging tag
Justice Caleb Stegall, in a dissent joined by Justices Eric Rosen and K.J. Wall, said the majority chose not to adhere to a “strict reading” of Kansas statute.
Each word of K.S.A. 8-133(c) should be considered, Stegall wrote, because the case hinged on whether the tag on the Honda carrying Yeargin-Charles was “flapping” as officers claimed or “swinging” in terms of what state law banned.
Stegall argued state law articulated a vehicle license plate had to be “securely fastened … to prevent the plate from swinging.” He said Kansas courts had an duty to conclude a Kansas plate was in violation of state law only when it was observed swinging.
The Supreme Court recently adhered to strict reading of state law to decide Beck v. State, which involved determining whether obstruction of the state name on a Kansas license plate justified a traffic stop. The Supreme Court reversed lower courts and rejected the claim that Geary County officers had reasonable suspicion to make a stop because the state name wasn’t legible. In that case, the Supreme Court said the traffic stop was forbidden because state law addressed only visibility of the plate’s alphanumeric display and registration decal.
Stegall said the majority’s reasoning in Kansas v. Tashara D. Yeargin-Charles conflicted with the approach to Beck v. State. He said state law defined the degree to which a license tag had to be fastened by emphasizing the connection must prevent swinging.
Jackson County law enforcement officers testified the plate was flapping — not swinging.
“One does not need to be a legal scholar or even dissect these dictionary definitions to understand that flapping and shaking are not factually identical terms to swinging,” Stegall wrote. “We abandon our duty of independent review when we simply defer to an officer’s testimony about what counts as secure. Is a plate with two bolts secure if an officer thinks it isn’t?”
In Standridge’s majority opinion, she said dissenting justices focused narrowly on the phrase in state law requiring motorists “to prevent the plate from swinging” and overlooked broader requirements that plates had to be “securely fastened.”
“Even if we were to accept the dissent’s flawed interpretation — that a license plate meeting all other requirements violates K.S.A. 8-133(c) only when it is actually swinging — the touchstone of our analysis is whether it was reasonable for the officer to think the law was being broken, not technical perfection in statutory parsing,” she said.
 
Peach vodka and a joint
In the Court of Appeals decision affirming Yeargin-Charles’ convictions, judges offered details about the Jackson county traffic stop.
DeBarge observed an open container of alcohol inside the vehicle and instructed the three occupants to exit so officers could search the vehicle. Dobler examined Yeargin-Charles’ purse and found an open bottle of peach vodka, a marijuana joint and a pipe with burnt meth residue.
While the purse was being searched, the Court of Appeals said, Yeargino-Charles dropped to the ground and claimed she was about to give birth. As medical staff arrived, Yeargin-Charles was observed “screaming, farting and trying to force herself to throw up.”

League of Women Voters hosted Mark Gordon, who fielded questions about everything from new property tax law impacts to the well-publicized beef between him and Secretary of State Chuck Gray.
The post Governor talks election bill flood, eroding civility and tyranny at Lander town hall appeared first on WyoFile .","Shortly after Mark Gordon became Wyoming’s governor, he bought a house on a handshake deal. 
“There was no contract or anything,” Gordon told a crowd gathered in a Lander hotel Thursday afternoon. “[We] just came to an agreement. Everything he said he was going to do, he did. Everything I said I was going to do, I did. 
“That’s the state I grew up in.”
But that implicit trust and sense of civility, Gordon said, has eroded in recent years, at least in government. Election attack ads, public name-calling and refusals to participate in public debates are all examples of shifting norms of Wyoming politics. 
“I think we have lost a sense of decorum,” Gordon said. “I think that’s harmful, because now meetings where the important topics are being discussed, they kind of devolve into spectacle as opposed to principled conversation about what the right thing to do is and listening to one another.”
Civility was among the topics Gordon spoke to during the town hall. The League of Women Voters event presented the governor with a series of questions about Wyoming’s political atmosphere and challenges.
Over the one-hour conversation, Gordon addressed the definition of tyranny, cited the U.S. Constitution, talked about the value of serving in office and framed answers in the context that as a conservative, he believes in small government.
The event offered insights into the governor’s priorities and beliefs as he heads into the final year of his term. 
Election integrity 
Moderators kicked the event off with the topic of election integrity, which Secretary of State Chuck Gray and the Wyoming Freedom Caucus have made a priority despite few documented cases of voter fraud in the state. 
“Governor, does Wyoming have a voter election fraud problem?” Moderator Steff Kessler asked.

“I have consistently said that the people that Wyoming folks elect to be their clerks … do a very credible job,” Gordon said. “And I consistently have maintained that we can always improve what we’re doing. But in terms of a lot of fraud, I don’t see it.”
Wyoming’s constitution put the power to manage elections at the local level, which is where Gordon thinks it belongs. “We have a system that works,” he said, and one that includes provisions for examining anomalies and detecting fraud. 
Moderators then asked about the wave of election-related legislation introduced in the 2025 Legislature — which signifies that lawmakers are concerned about the security of Wyoming elections. A slate of election-related draft bills are also expected to dominate an upcoming legislative meeting Nov. 3-4. 
“Can you help us understand why the Legislature is treating our county governments as if they are untrustworthy and incapable, requiring state oversight in an intervention?” Moderator Linda Barton asked. 
Gordon reiterated his beliefs about the system working and opportunities for improvements. 
“Now, is there overkill?” he asked. “Perhaps. I mean, if you look at the Legislature today, they all got there by a supposedly flawed system, yet now we’re really quite anxious to make sure that we correct that.”
Gordon brought up the critical function of separation of powers in government and noted that Wyoming lawmakers are seeking ways to pull power into the legislative branch.

“That’s the definition of tyranny” as set out by James Madison in the Federalist Papers, Gordon said. It’s important to keep an eye on the division of powers, he said, adding later, “I am concerned that the Legislature is trying to take to itself the powers that aren’t accorded to it in the Constitution of how to run elections.” 
In all his years in Wyoming politics, Gordon continued, he has never seen such high levels of distrust. 
While moderators asked specifically about critical comments Gordon has exchanged with Gray in public forums, the governor declined to go into detail about the feud.
Gordon did acknowledge that with increasingly ugly campaigns, he can see why people would not be encouraged to run for office. 
“It’s hard for me to try to convince somebody to put yourself through that,” he said, even when there’s “a terrific reward on the other side.
“On the other hand, if we don’t get engaged, we surrender the field, and that is not a good option, in my mind.” 
Tax confusion 
Next, Barton asked: “Is there any policy that you believe has been passed by the Legislature that has not been fully understood by the voting public, such as consequences of reducing property taxes in the downstream impacts to our small towns and counties?” 
She was referring to a law passed in March amid concern about rising property taxes that authorized a 25% exemption on the first $1 million of a single-family home’s fair market value. The law resulted in shrinking property tax revenues for towns, counties and hundreds of special districts across Wyoming — which fund everything from hospitals to 4-H and county road and bridge departments.

“I think that particular issue is one that Wyoming communities are beginning to wrestle with,” Gordon said. “You’re hearing out of Casper that parks aren’t as neat as they used to be. You’re hearing out of Basin, we’re having to close libraries. And these consequences are going to be larger and larger.”
What’s especially unfortunate about it, Gordon said, is that many people misunderstood how property taxes are levied and allocated. 
“There was a notion that property tax was going to the state,” he said, “and it goes to local governments. It’s how fire departments are funded, it’s how parks are funded, it’s how roads are funded, senior centers, all of that stuff is funded from local taxes.”
Gordon remembers a legislator on the powerful Joint Appropriations Committee saying, “the state doesn’t need that property tax.” 
“A member of the Joint Appropriations Committee did not understand, the state doesn’t collect that property tax,” he continued. “And so by that misrepresentation, I think we are not doing what is the right thing for Wyoming.”

(Screenshot taken of Loras College inauguration ceremony)By the time Michael Doyle picked up the phone for an interview with the Iowa Capital Dispatch Friday morning he’d already been up for hours, waking at 4 a.m. to work out and get ready for his inauguration day.
The now-official Loras College president even made it to the Dubuque campus before the sun had fully risen, to drop off a binder containing his speech and the speech his wife would give in his introduction.
“So pretty much a normal day,” Doyle said.
However, the rest of his day did not follow the usual path. More than a year after being named president-elect of Loras College, Doyle was inaugurated as the university’s 27th president officially Friday with a Mass, reception and activities for students and visitors. During his speech, Doyle said he welcomes Loras College’s new chapter with the knowledge of its strong foundation and forward movement.
Doyle was selected by the Loras College Board of Regents as president-elect in July 2024 and worked alongside then-President Jim Collins until Collins retired in the spring. He previously worked at Loras for 14 years in different roles, including vice president for institutional advancement and chief financial officer, and returned to the college after more than two years of working as president of Steele Capital Management, Inc.

It was “the pull of the students” and the higher education environment that had Doyle missing Loras, his alma mater. He said he’s excited to be back even as higher education faces challenges with enrollment and finances. Loras has to be “nimble” as it and other colleges navigate changing federal programs, the enrollment cliff, rising costs and more.
“We pay attention to what’s going on, and we have to adapt and adjust based on … federal and state legislation,” Doyle said. “But we’re not going to make excuses, and we’re just going to move forward and do what we need to do to have success.”
Part of moving forward has been implementing strategies developed during his time as president-elect, Doyle said, aimed at increasing enrollment, fundraising and lowering institutional debt.
In the fall of 2024, Loras “implemented a fundamentally sound strategic enrollment plan” that resulted in an “11% increase in first year transfer and graduate enrollment” — a metric Doyle said he hopes will continue to grow over the next five years.
Loras also ended its fiscal year in May with the highest annual cash fundraising total in the college’s history and more than double what was raised the previous fiscal year, at more than $15.6 million. Momentum is also growing for the college’s current $20 million fundraising campaign, to which donors have already committed more than $13.7 million.
Payoffs are coming in from efforts to decrease the university’s long-term debt as well, Doyle said, with a plan launched last September culminating in one-quarter of debt already eliminated. Loras reached this point more than two years ahead of schedule.
Five years down the line, Doyle said he sees a thriving Loras College that has met and exceeded the goals set before he fully stepped into the role as president. Even as two Catholic universities, St. Ambrose University and Mount Mercy University, move forward in a strategic combination, Doyle said “Catholic higher education is strong” and Loras being rooted in faith and its legacy will help keep that strength going.
“We’re facing strong headwinds, there are challenges, but we’re going to lean into those challenges and meet those challenges head on,” Doyle said. “And we feel we’re well positioned to move into the future and raise Loras to new heights.”

Gov. Phil Scott filled two leadership positions at the Vermont Department of Economic Development on Friday, positions that have been in flux since the departure of a longtime administrator this spring.
Lyle Jepson, head of the Chamber and Economic Development of the Rutland Region since 2020, will be the new department’s new commissioner. Nick Grimley, currently the department’s Director of Entrepreneurship and Tech Commercialization, will be deputy commissioner. 
Both will begin their new jobs on Nov. 4, according to a press release from Scott’s office.

The department operates within the Agency of Commerce and Community Development and oversees a number of programs related to promoting economic development and job growth in Vermont.
Jepson is stepping into a position filled by two interim commissioners since the departure of longtime department head Joan Goldstein in April. Her deputy, Brett Long, initially stepped in as interim commissioner. Upon Long’s retirement, the interim post was filled by Tim Tierney, who will now be returning to his previous role as director of business recruitment and international trade for the department, said Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for Scott, in an email.
Prior to his regional economic development role in Rutland, Jepson spent 30 years in public and technical education across the state, the announcement said. Grimley, with the department since 2017, had previously co-founded the business accelerator LaunchVT.
“Growing the economy has been one of my top priorities since being elected governor,” Scott said in the release. “I believe Lyle’s decades of experience as an educator, as well as Nick’s proven track record supporting the business community, will serve Vermonters well.”

(Andrea Tinker/Alabama Reflector)Statues of civil rights activist Rosa Parks and disability rights activist Helen Keller were unveiled at the Alabama State Capitol Friday, the first Alabama women to be depicted there. 
The dedication ended six years of work by the Alabama Women’s Tribute Statue Commission to get the statues installed. 
“Today we gather to lift two legacies, Rosa Parks and Helen Keller. Two women born in Alabama on the soil of this great state with the grit and grace that changed the trajectory of not just our state, but our nation,” Commissioner Tracey Morant Adams said at the ceremony Friday.

The commission consists of six members with Rep. Laura Hall, D-Huntsville, serving as chair. In 2019, Hall sponsored HB 287, which began the project. 
“For the very first time, the grounds of our Capitol will feature statues of women, and what finer examples could there be than Rosa Parks and Helen Keller?” Gov. Kay Ivey asked at the ceremony. “These are two Alabama daughters who were born in small towns who faced extraordinary challenges and yet rose to shape history through quiet strength and unwavering and unwavering conviction.”
The statue of Parks is placed at the front of the Alabama State Capitol near the steps, and near a statue of Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy, and J. Marion Sims, an obstetrician who experimented on enslaved women.

The statue of Keller is seen behind the building facing the current Alabama State House. That building is set to be demolished and replaced with green space after the completion of the new Alabama Statehouse,  expected to be completed in the fall of 2026.
Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, D-Mobile, also spoke at the ceremony. In 2018, Figures sponsored SB 365 which made Dec. 1, the day Parks was arrested for not giving up her seat in the whites only section of a segregated bus to a white man, a state holiday.
“This is such a historical day for Alabama. For us to unveil the first two women’s statues, but those two women are an African American and a caucasian Alabamian, and that just shows you how far we have come as a state,” Figures said.
The Helen Keller statue sits on a limestone bench and depicts Keller reading a book in Braille with her left hand extended as if she is doing tactile lip reading. The plaque on the statue tells Keller’s life story in English and Braille and features the American Sign Language finger spelling alphabet and the Braille alphabet.
“This translation, this opportunity for students to learn is something that must be noted and it is so exciting for all of us to think about the potential of what is to come because of this effort,” Commissioner Annie Butrus said Friday at the unveiling.
The Rosa Parks statue at the front of the State Capitol shows Parks in motion walking up the steps of what would be the bus she was taking nearly 70 years ago on Dec. 1, about a mile from the Capitol down Montgomery’s Dexter Avenue.
“I want you to be reminded of her resolve and commitment to step up, take action, powerfully communicating the thinking behind that action,” Julia Knight, the creator of the statue, said at the unveiling. “Rosa Parks was not a tired seamstress, she was a dedicated activist.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7717-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-24 17:18:06.695696

""I was kind of surprised that Vermont would recognize New Hampshire certifications, but New Hampshire wouldn’t recognize Vermont,” said New Hampshire Rep. Thomas Oppel.

This story by Liz Sauchelli was first published in the Valley News on Oct. 23, 2025.
WEST CANAAN — A Mascoma-area state legislator has proposed a bill that would make it easier for Vermont-licensed school bus drivers to become certified in New Hampshire.
New Hampshire state Rep. Thomas Oppel, D-Grafton, decided to introduce the bill after learning about the challenge of finding bus drivers to serve the Mascoma Valley Regional School District. As the school year began in August, Mascoma was forced to make some last minute changes to its bus routes because of the shortage of drivers.
One difficulty is the licensing requirements in Vermont and New Hampshire, Steve Landon, location manager at Butler’s Bus Service branch in White River Junction, said in September. People licensed to drive in New Hampshire can easily drive in Vermont because the Green Mountain State recognizes New Hampshire licenses, but in New Hampshire, drivers with Vermont licenses must go through the Granite State’s process as if they are a new bus driver.
“I hadn’t thought about it and I was kind of surprised that Vermont would recognize New Hampshire certifications, but New Hampshire wouldn’t recognize Vermont,” said Oppel, whose district includes Canaan, Dorchester and Orange.
He spoke to New Hampshire Department of Transportation officials and asked Legislative Services in Concord, which assists lawmakers with research, to put together a side-by-side comparison of Vermont and New Hampshire requirements. They are similar in that both states require that bus drivers have a commercial driver’s license and an added bus driver certification.
“If you’re certified in New Hampshire or Vermont, you can drive in either state if my bill passes,” said Oppel, who has found co-sponsors for his bill, including NH Rep. David Fracht, D-Enfield, and NH Rep. Henry Giasson, R-Goffstown.
Before signing onto the bill, Giasson, a member of the House Transportation Committee, wanted to confirm that the two states’ requirements were similar, he said. Giasson was satisfied with the research Oppel did. “If a New Hampshire bus company can employ a Vermont bus driver with no safety risk to the public, I don’t see why we wouldn’t allow it at this point,” Giasson said.
Even though Goffstown is more than an hour from the Vermont border and the bill would not necessarily affect Giasson’s constituents, he said, “I think it’s a good call to expand our market to people in border states.”
While the bill won’t necessarily alleviate the challenge of finding more bus drivers for rural routes like those in Mascoma — which includes Canaan, Enfield, Dorchester, Grafton and Orange — it could make it easier for Butler’s Bus Service to move drivers around as needed to serve other school districts, especially those that are located along the Connecticut River.
“It may not help with recruiting drivers necessarily, but it certainly would help us be able to spread the drivers that we do have around to different customers for sure,” Landon said.
Currently, if a bus driver certified in Vermont wants a New Hampshire certification, they have to go through a background check and — once that’s cleared — they have to do 10 hours of training in New Hampshire by a state-certified instructor, then take a written test to get school bus certificate, said Landon.
Getting the original Vermont certification takes eight hours and also requires a background check and written test. It can take between 30 and 60 days for a certified Vermont bus driver to go through the New Hampshire certification process.
“It would help us because the locations that we have that are on the border of Vermont and New Hampshire, I could possibly share drivers quicker than I can now,” Landon said. For example, a driver based in White River Junction could then drive a route in Plainfield or Cornish, which Butler’s also serves, without having to redo their training in New Hampshire.
Mascoma Valley Regional School District Superintendent Amanda Isabelle called Oppel’s proposed legislation “exciting.” Mascoma is still in need of one more bus driver and while there are currently people in training to fill that spot, the legislation would allow Vermont bus drivers to fill in on a substitute basis. The dual state process “is absurd to me,” she said. “You’re already on a bus. You don’t need to come here to be trained to drive a bus.”
Mascoma now has three employees — the district’s special education director, a social worker and an administrative assistant in the special education department — going through the training process to be able to transport students in vans in case of an emergency.
Another Mascoma employee is in the process of obtaining a commercial driver’s license so that they can become a substitute bus driver. “We’ve had a lot of our employees step up and it’s much appreciated,” Isabelle said.
Oppel’s legislative service request for the bus driver bill has not been drafted into formal legislation and does not yet have a bill number.

(Photo courtesy Harry Reid International Airport)U.S. Rep. Steven Horsford on Friday sent a letter to Gov. Joe Lombardo urging him to do “everything within his power” to ensure Nevadans continue to receive food stamps during a prolonged federal government shutdown.
That should include the possibility of Lombardo calling a special legislative session, read the letter, which was also signed by Horsford’s fellow Democratic peers, U.S. Reps. Dina Titus and Susie Lee.
“Whether through official actions or by simply picking up the phone and telling his fellow Republicans to end this cruelty, the Governor must act,” said Horsford in a press release announcing the sending of the letter.
In any given month, approximately 500,000 Nevadans — 15.5% of the population — receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP or food stamps. Lombardo’s office has confirmed that, if the federal government shutdown extends beyond Oct. 31, federal funding would be insufficient to cover the cost of SNAP for November and beyond.
Independent of the government shutdown, Nevada SNAP is already expecting budget turmoil. Administrators of the program in August told state legislators that a new federal requirement that states pay them to use an income verification system will force the state to reallocate $19 million in the current fiscal biennium, and will cost the state $25 million annually in future biennia.
At the same time, local food banks have reported seeing increased demand.
Lombardo did not respond to the Nevada Current‘s request for comment by publication time.
His office earlier this week did say it is working with the state departments of human services and agriculture to “secure supplemental resources for SNAP beneficiaries in the event the shutdown extends beyond October 31.”
Horsford’s letter acknowledged and applauded those efforts but added the governor should “use every tool and resource available.”
Also on Friday, Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine publicly called on state elected officials to step in. He noted Nevada currently has the highest Rainy Day Fund balance in state history.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)School board directors and parents sued Washington state Thursday to block a Democrat-backed law overhauling rights for public school students and their parents.
The policy has become a flashpoint in the national debate over gender inclusivity and diversity, equity, and inclusion in schools. A conservative political group has a separate push underway to get it overturned through the legislative process or at the ballot box. 
This week’s lawsuit, filed in Thurston County Superior Court, argues House Bill 1296 violates state and U.S. constitutional rights guaranteeing the free exercise of religion and ensuring parents can raise their children without state interference.
The debate over House Bill 1296 was one of the most contentious of this year’s legislative session in Olympia. Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson signed the law in May.
Republicans argued that it undermines Initiative 2081, which lawmakers passed last year. 
The earlier initiative enshrined certain rights for parents of public school children, specifically around issues like reviewing classroom materials, obtaining medical records, and opting children out of assignments involving questions about their sexual experiences or their family’s religious beliefs.   
Let’s Go Washington, the group that spearheaded Initiative 2081, is collecting signatures to get a measure before lawmakers next year that would repeal this year’s rewrite. If the group is successful, and lawmakers don’t approve it, this new measure could end up before voters in 2026. 
Republicans and other critics of this year’s law argued that it undermined last year’s initiative.  
Democrats countered that changes were necessary to protect vulnerable children. 
One of the most significant changes removed parental access to their children’s school-based medical records. The complaint claims these revisions violate the federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, known as FERPA.
Other changes include pushing back the deadline for parents to receive copies of their child’s school records from 10 days to 45 days. 
One of the plaintiffs, Gabriel Galbraith, is a Kennewick school board member. In March, the board pleaded with the Trump administration to force the state to comply with the president’s executive order seeking to ban transgender athletes from participating in girls’ and women’s sports.
“We’re being told not to share information that parents have a right to know,” Galbraith, who is up for re-election next month, said in a statement Thursday. “That’s not education — that’s state interference in the family.”
The more than half-a-dozen other plaintiffs include school board members from Lynden, Darrington, Woodland and Deer Park, and parents from Olympia and Tumwater. 
One parent reported taking her son out of Olympia public schools because she couldn’t opt him out of instruction about gender identity.
The state Legislature, Ferguson, the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction and state Superintendent Chris Reykdal are named as defendants in the lawsuit.

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)As many as 1.4 million Georgians who rely on federal food assistance could face the abrupt loss of benefits starting Nov. 1 if the government shutdown has not ended.
The Georgia Department of Human Services announced Friday that the U.S. Department of Agriculture informed the state that there is “insufficient funding” to cover November payments for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which is 100% federally funded and provides food assistance to about one in 10 Georgia residents.
If the shutdown is not resolved soon, SNAP electronic benefit transfer cards will not work beginning Nov. 1, according to DHS. Even if a shutdown deal were reached immediately, the time required to process the payments and make them available to recipients would likely delay benefits. The state agency advised recipients to use existing funds on their cards now and plan ahead. 
The federal government shutdown began on Oct. 1 after lawmakers failed to approve a funding bill before the beginning of the new fiscal year. U.S. House Republicans passed a stopgap spending bill that would have funded the government until November, but that is stuck in the Senate, where Democrats say they won’t vote for a continuing resolution until Republicans agree to extend tax credits that are set to expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. 
The Georgia Budget and Policy Institute urged the USDA to take immediate steps to release available contingency funds to cover at least partial payments for the program, which serves more than 640,000 children in the state.
“If the administration can cover full or even partial SNAP benefits for November, it provides some certainty that families and individuals can go to the grocery store and buy the essentials and maybe something for Thanksgiving,” Ife Finch Floyd, the institute’s director of economic justice, said Thursday.
But the USDA on Friday announced that it would not use contingency funds to provide food assistance benefits, stating that the government shutdown occurred before SNAP funding for the new fiscal year was enacted.
The USDA has about $6 billion in contingency funds, enough to cover about two-thirds of one month’s national SNAP benefits. GBPI also suggested that the USDA use its discretionary authority, as it did in early October for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, known as WIC, to secure additional resources to fully fund November benefits.
SNAP provides more than $3 billion annually to Georgia’s local economies and is critical for retailers statewide, according to GBPI. Usage is higher in rural areas, where about 17% of the population relies on the assistance, compared to 11% in metropolitan areas.

Sept. 9, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceEnvironmental advocates, community leaders and members of the Michigan Legislature will gather on Detroit’s east side Sunday for food and festivities while demanding accountability from the state’s largest energy providers. 
The East Side Community Network’s Stoudamire Wellness Hub will host state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit), state Reps. Tonya Myers Phillips  (D-Detroit) and Donovan McKinney (D-Detroit), and Detroit Action Political Director James Johnson alongside Detroit residents and representatives from multiple organizing groups, as they call out the state’s largest energy providers over high rates and poor reliability.
The speakers will also offer information about the ratepayer bill of rights, a slate of bills which aims to address these issues alongside concerns that political spending is stymying additional regulations on energy providers. 
The “Our Bills Are Too Damn High!” block party runs Sunday from  2 p.m. to 4 p.m. with speeches set to begin at 3 p.m. In addition to remarks from lawmakers and residents calling for greater accountability from DTE Energy and Consumers Energy, Michigan’s largest energy companies, the event will feature food and performances.
In recent years, both utilities have faced repeated criticism for high energy prices and poor reliability, with the Citizens Utility Board, an energy utility watchdog, noting that the companies have “some of the highest outage durations among all investor-owned utilities in the nation.”
Ballot initiative seeks to ban political contributions from monopoly corporations, like utilities

While both companies have each pledged to improve their services, customers and advocacy groups have remained frustrated with the utilities’ near yearly requests to increase their rates, with DTE requesting a $574 million rate increase earlier this year, while Consumers Energy requested a $436 million increase for its electrical rates. 
Dana St. Couer, a senior communication strategist for DTE said customers saw 70% improvement in time spent without power in 2024 due to $1.5 billion in investments in the electric grid last year coupled with less extreme weather. 
In a statement on Jan. 14, Consumers Energy said the average customer spent 21 fewer minutes without power in 2024, with 93% of customers seeing their power restored within 24 hours. 
Katie Carey, Consumers Energy’s director of media relations, emphasized in an email to the Michigan Advance that the company’s rate requests fund future investments. 
“For example, clearing trees away from power lines is critical to our plan, addressing the #1 cause of outages. We are proposing a five-year timetable to clear all of our system’s low-voltage lines, which serve homes and businesses directly,” Carey said. “We had previously been working toward a seven-year effective cycle. We plan to clear 8,000 miles of high- and low-voltage power lines this year. We expect a 30% reduction in tree-related outage incidents by 2030.”
In the interim, lawmakers have offered their own solutions through legislation seeking greater accountability from energy providers, while providing customers additional protections. 
The ratepayer bill of rights includes legislation sponsored by McKinney that would increase the outage credit customers receive on their bills to $5 an hour, gradually increasing to $15 an hour after 24 hours without service and $25 dollars per hour in interruptions longer than 72 hours. 
The current credit offers customers $42 if their outages last 16 hours or longer under normal conditions, 48 hours if skies are gray and 96 hours under catastrophic weather conditions, with customers receiving an additional $42 for each day they are without power. 
The package also includes Myers Phillips’ House Bill 5047, which would ensure winter shut off protections for households with seniors 65 and older, and children 16 and younger. 
The ratepayers bill of rights also includes legislation to allow for the establishment of community solar energy programs, and to ban utility companies and businesses seeking government contracts from making political contributions. 
Chang told the Michigan Advance on Thursday that the event is aimed at raising awareness and getting more community members engaged on issues of energy affordability and reliability, while providing those affected with concrete solutions they can take action on. 
Oftentimes when there is a major storm, Chang said her office will hear from residents and see the resulting power outages firsthand. While the outage credit has increased in recent years, it does not match the impact felt by those facing the outage Chang said, pointing to individuals losing the food in their refrigerator as one example. 
When looking at the ratepayer’s bill of rights as a package, Chang emphasized that these policies focus on what ratepayers need. 
“When we talk about reliability, when we talk about energy policy, when we talk about outages, ultimately, it’s about people,” Chang said, noting that these outages weigh the heaviest on those who are already struggling to pay their bills and keep food on the table.”

Former state Rep. Robin Smith, R-Hixson, was sentenced Friday to eight months in federal prison for her role in a corruption conspiracy described as a scheme to steal from Tennessee and its citizens through the General Assembly’s taxpayer-funded constituent mail program.
Smith, 62, “failed the trust of the public” and has “been a failure,” she said during her sentencing hearing in Nashville federal court.
“My mom and dad raised me to be much better than this,” Smith said. “I ask for the forgiveness of the public.”
Smith pleaded guilty in March 2022 to one count of honest services wire fraud, a charge regularly used in corruption prosecutions, and agreed to “full, complete and truthful” cooperation with the federal government.
She was fined $7,500 and will be on supervised release for one year after incarceration. Smith cried while addressing the court Friday morning, frequently referencing her Christianity and the debt she said she owes to her family, friends, God and the public.
“There isn’t a day that goes by where that reality doesn’t confront me in a real way,” she said.
Smith, ex-Speaker Glen Casada, R-Franklin, and his one-time chief of staff, Cade Cothren, all played a part in a scheme to illegally profit off the General Assembly’s taxpayer-funded constituent mail program from October 2019 to early January 2021.
As part of Smith’s plea deal, she testified against Casada and Cothren during their May federal trial. It was the right thing to do, and she was simultaneously hoping for leniency in her sentence, she said at the time.
A Nashville jury ultimately found Casada guilty of 17 counts and Cothren guilty of all 19 counts of bribery, conspiracy, fraud, money laundering and theft, according to federal court records.
Both men were sentenced in September.
Casada is expected to serve 36 months in federal prison, one year of probation and pay a $30,000 fine, court records show. Cothren was sentenced to 30 months in prison, one year of probation and a $25,000 fine.
Casada, Cothren and Smith allegedly all helped to create a fake company called Phoenix Solutions, which designed and sent mailers to constituents on behalf of politicians through the use of taxpayer funds.
The group intended to do the work they were hired to do, Smith testified, but they also intended to profit.
The group received nearly $52,000 from the state in payments related to the postage and printing allowance over the course of 2020, according to a trial brief, which stated that Cothren paid Casada and Smith more than $35,000 in bribes and kickbacks during that time.
The scheme allegedly went on into early January 2021.
FBI agents raided Smith’s home that same month.
District Judge Eli J. Richardson said at sentencing that Smith was more involved than Casada in really propping up Phoenix Solutions, pressuring public officials and “spinning a web of fabrications.”
“We have these public officials,” he said. “We elect them to do the right thing.”
Former Tennessee rep says identities had to be “masked” in kickback scheme

And then, in this case, they turn around, lie and deceive, according to Richardson.
“It’s pretty callous stuff, and it’s not a great look,” he said.
Smith led the Hamilton County Republican Party from 1998 until 2002 and was unanimously elected to lead the state GOP in 2007.
She was elected in 2018 to represent state House District 26, which includes parts of central Chattanooga and extends north along Chickamauga Lake, encompassing, among other communities, Hixson, Lakesite, Middle Valley and Sale Creek.
Smith resigned from her seat in March 2022 amid her plea deal.
Her life has been defined by doing good things for others besides this one “stain on her life,” her attorney William David Bridgers said.
She’s dedicated time to nonprofits and the public, has a strong presence within her religious community and cares for her sick mother, he said.
Their crimes began after Cothren resigned in 2019. He allegedly sent sexually explicit and racist text messages and admitted to using cocaine in a legislative office on one occasion, according to reporting by the Associated Press. Casada, who allegedly received some of those messages and sent his own lewd remarks, resigned shortly after.
Smith was part of this scheme to help both men rehabilitate their lives after their “really bad scandal” rather than to scam legislators, Bridgers said.
She knew her actions were morally wrong but didn’t know she committed a crime until the FBI came knocking at her door, he said. She quickly began cooperating with the federal government once she realized the gravity of her actions.
“She had sinned against her God,” Bridgers said. “She had sinned against her family. She had sinned against her government.”
Richardson, apparently in response to Bridger’s arguments, said Smith wouldn’t have taken 25% of the profits if she only wanted to help Casada and Cothren.
“The one way I don’t help out other people is by taking a cut of what they have,” Richardson said.",https://tennesseelookout.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Casada-4-29-25-004-scaled-e1761360698548-1024x619.jpg,,,2025-10-24 22:56:38.320342

In this image from Jan. 13, 2025, Schwab performs ceremonial duties at the Kansas Capitol. (Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Secretary of State Scott Schwab received praise from President Donald Trump for making Kansas one of the first states to commit to use of a federal database to confirm U.S. citizenship of people registered to vote.
Schwab, who is a Republican candidate for governor in 2026, had previously lauded the president for taking steps to help states screen voter registration lists through sharing of federal data. As secretary of state, Schwab is Kansas’ top election official.
In March, Trump signed an executive order making the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements program available to states for free. SAVE exists as an online platform enabling local, state and federal governments to electronically check a federal database for immigration and citizenship status of applicants for public benefits.
“You were one of the first leaders to step up and protect the integrity of our elections by using the SAVE system,” Trump said in a letter sent to Schwab on Oct. 8 and shared publicly several days ago by Schwab. “As you know, safeguarding our elections is a dual responsibility of the states and federal government. This vital mission requires our partnership to be based on mutual trust and a shared commitment to our constitutional responsibilities.”
Trump said in correspondence to Schwab the “right of American citizens to have their votes properly counted, without illegal dilution, is a prerequisite for our government to truly be representative.”
The president said “many states” were failing to enforce basic and necessary election laws. The executive order, and wider reliance on SAVE, could be useful to states working to “reverse this dereliction,” Trump’s letter said.
Trump has claimed without evidence President Joe Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 election due to voting misconduct.
In July, Schwab attended a White House meeting with other state elections officers to discuss sharing of federal data. He said at that time it could be beneficial if Kansas could have routine access to the Social Security Administration’s death index and data from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to identify individuals who were deceased or noncitizens and ineligible to vote.
Schwab, who has repeatedly declared Kansas elections fair and accurate, said reliance on up-to-date databases could improve voter confidence in the state’s election system.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1132223-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-24 16:57:23.079236

(Photo by New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]The U.S. Department of Justice said Friday it will install election monitors in Passaic County, acceding to a request from Republican Party officials there.
The announcement comes 11 days before Election Day, when the governor’s race and all 80 Assembly seats will be on the ballot. Republican Jack Ciattarelli, who has President Donald Trump’s endorsement, is vying against Democrat Mikie Sherrill to become our next governor.
“We will commit the resources necessary to ensure the American people get the fair, free, and transparent elections they deserve,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement.
The announcement follows a request for federal intervention from GOP officials who have sought greater scrutiny of mail voting in Passaic, a heavily Democratic county that flipped to support Trump in last year’s presidential race. Federal officials did not provide a justification for the deployment of monitors.
New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin called the federal deployment “highly inappropriate.”
“DOJ has not even attempted to identify a legitimate basis for its actions,” he said in a statement. “The Constitution gives states, not the federal government, the primary responsibility for running elections, and our state’s hardworking elections officials have been preparing for months to run a safe and secure election. We are committed to ensuring that every eligible voter is able to cast their ballot and make their voices heard.”
Platkin’s office said he is weighing options to prevent voter intimidation and election interference as a result of the federal deployment.
A spokesperson for the Passaic County Board of Elections, whose membership is split equally between Republicans and Democrats, said it is aware of the feds’ plans and will cooperate.
“The Board is committed to ensuring that the election is administered fairly, securely, and smoothly and will cooperate with the USDOJ to achieve those objectives while ensuring that eligible voters are able to cast their vote,” said Lindsay Reed, a spokesperson for the board.
She added that the board would accede to the department’s request to observe the transfer and counting of mail ballots. Democrats vote by mail at far greater rates than Republicans.
Voting fraud allegations are not unheard of in Passaic County. In 2020, Paterson Councilmen Michael Jackson and Alex Mendez, who had not yet taken office, were charged with mail ballot fraud and related charges for allegedly acting as ballot bearers for more than three ballots — the maximum allowed under state law — and for failing to identify themselves as ballot bearers.
A Superior Court judge ordered the May election be rerun that November, and both men won the do-over race. Neither has been convicted, and both were reelected last year.
The judge’s order made no finding of voter fraud, leaving that to criminal courts, but ordered a new race because of various procedural violations related to mail voting.
The Department of Justice said it would also deploy election monitors to five California counties. Four of those counties are politically competitive, and one is overwhelmingly Democratic.

New research suggests cities could significantly reduce childhood poverty by creating their own child tax credit programs. (Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images for Community Change)Child tax credits are becoming more popular across the country, with more than a dozen states offering them as financial relief toward the cost of raising kids.
But new research suggests cities could significantly reduce child poverty by offering child tax credit programs of their own.
An analysis by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University and the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that municipal programs could move the needle with relatively small amounts of money: offering $1,000 or less per year to low- and middle-income families could cut child poverty rates by 25% in several cities.  
Researchers say this sort of new assistance would not only boost household finances, but also likely create more demand for local businesses, stabilize housing markets and increase local tax revenue.
The study focused on 14 cities: Baltimore; Charlotte, North Carolina; Chicago; Denver; Houston; Jacksonville, Florida; Los Angeles; Minneapolis; New York; Oakland, California; Philadelphia; Phoenix; Seattle; and the District of Columbia. The analysis found that most of those cities could make significant gains by spending less than 15% of municipal revenues on new child credit programs. 
Red states pushed child tax credits this year, but the broadest plans fizzled

In Minneapolis, for example, researchers said a new program that cost less than $30 million per year would cut the city’s poverty levels by half when accounting for existing state and federal credits. (The mayor there has recommended spending about $2.03 billion in the 2026 fiscal year budget.) 
The prospect of creating new tax credit programs would likely pose financial and logistical challenges. Cities already are juggling many other priorities including public safety and housing affordability, while at the same time facing what some experts have characterized as a “fiscal crisis” from growing climate change costs, federal funding cuts and declining downtown activity.
Some cities, including Baltimore, New York and Philadelphia, have city income taxes that could incorporate a child tax credit. But, the research noted, cities without that tax managed to distribute pandemic recovery funds through basic income programs. That experience shows cities could create their own standalone applications, leverage IRS data-sharing agreements or  work with third-party administrators.
“So you could use a similar sort of outreach approach, which wouldn’t necessarily be as comprehensive or systematic as a city that already has its own income tax system in place, but it’s a potential option,” said Ryan Vinh, an author of the study and a research analyst at the Center on Poverty and Social Policy. 
State interest in creating or expanding child tax credits boomed after the pandemic-era expansion of the federal child tax credit delivered cash directly to millions. That move quickly lifted millions of children out of poverty, researchers found. But the expanded tax credit expired in 2021 — leading to a doubling in the nation’s childhood poverty rate in 2022.
Advocates favor refundable tax credits that provide money directly to families. While parents must still file tax returns to receive the benefit, refundable credits give parents funds even if they earn too little to owe income tax, providing financial relief for groceries, medical care or rent. 
This year, several conservative-led states explored new child tax credit programs, though proposals offering the biggest benefits to families fizzled in Indiana and Ohio. So far, no city has implemented its own credit. 
While many cities and states are facing tight budget constraints, Vinh said a reduction in federal support will likely put more pressure on local governments to tackle challenges like poverty. The federal government has slashed funding for safety net programs including Medicaid and the nation’s largest food assistance program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. 
“A lot of these things will either lead to the erosion of benefits over time, a loss of benefits, or kind of a decline in what families are able to receive,” Vinh said. “We don’t fully know the number yet, but we do know that child poverty will most likely increase as these program restrictions increase.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti joined a filing Friday in the U.S. Supreme Court supporting President Donald Trump’s order to end automatic birthright citizenship.
The brief brought by Skrmetti and 24 other states’ attorneys general urges the court to clarify that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Citizenship Clause doesn’t grant automatic citizenship to people born on American soil regardless of their parents’ residency and immigration status. 
The American Civil Liberties Union, multiple state attorneys general and immigration rights groups challenged the executive order. But Skrmetti sided with the president even though his order was blocked in early October by a federal appeals court in Boston.
“The idea that citizenship is guaranteed to everyone born in the United States doesn’t square with the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment or the way many government officials and legal analysts understood the law when it was adopted after the Civil War,” Skrmetti said in a statement.
The Fourteenth Amendment says, “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”
Yet the attorney general said the brief provides evidence from the 1860s through early 1900s backing his interpretation that citizenship required parental domicile and allegiance to the United States, not temporary or unlawful presence.
About 4.4 million U.S.-citizen children under 18 lived with at least one person without permanent legal documentation as of 2018, according to the American Immigration Council.

(Photo by Caity Coyne/West Virginia Watch)Kanawha County Circuit Court Judge Richard Lindsay said Friday that he wants to hear more about the legality behind Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s order to deploy hundreds from the West Virginia National Guard to Washington D.C. 
Lindsay listened to more than an hour of legal arguments on Friday related to a lawsuit brought by the West Virginia arm of the American Civil Liberties Union and the West Virginia Citizen Action Group against the state due to the National Guard deployment. 
Following some testimony and arguments from attorneys on the case, Lindsay ruled that the hearing will continue on Nov. 3. By that date, he said, he wants to see more information from the state regarding how Morrisey’s decision to send troops to D.C. following a request from President Donald Trump is legal.
The hearing was held due to the ACLU and CAG requesting a temporary restraining order to halt the deployment of West Virginia troops in D.C.
Morrisey announced in August that he would be sending 300-400 members of the West Virginia National Guard to Washington D.C. after Trump declared a “public safety emergency” in the nation’s capital. That declaration ended in September, but troops have remained in the district.
In late September, a spokesperson for the state’s National Guard said members could remain in D.C. through November.
Lindsay said the question of legality is “the central issue” to the case.
“Because if what the governor has done in the deployment of the National Guard to Washington, D.C., if that is lawful, that cures — at least in this court’s mind — whether or not a [temporary restraining order] is necessary, whether or not an irreparable harm has been suffered and whether or not there’s standing,” Lindsay said.
The ACLU and CAG argue in their lawsuit that the deployment is unlawful and an abuse of state powers that allow the governor to activate National Guard troops for matters outside of the state under limited circumstances. Attorneys for the ACLU further argued Friday that the ongoing deployment is causing real and irreparable harm to people in West Virginia, specifically at CAG. 
CAG executive director Dani Parent testified Friday that members of CAG — both employees and other community partners — are being tasked with fighting against and learning more about the National Guard deployment. By undertaking that work, Parent said, other critical work done by the organization related to defending democracy, government transparency and more is going undone. 
“Here we have a member-driven organization that is dedicated to this purpose, that is having to spend their time and money differently than they would have to were it not for the actions of [the state, in deploying the National Guard],” said Aubrey Sparks, legal director for the ACLU, during arguments to Lindsay. “That is harm. That is harm in a legal sense as well as in a practical sense.”
The state, represented by Chris Etheredge, who is a lawyer with the Attorney General’s Office, countered that this harm isn’t clear and it isn’t real. CAG, Etheredge argued, spends less than 25% of its resources on work related to democracy and government transparency. Etheredge continued that the only parties who could claim to be “directly harmed” due to the National Guard deployment are residents of D.C. or members of the Guard themselves.
Lindsay asked Etheredge to clarify.
“You’re not saying that the only possible plaintiff that could bring this type of action would be a National Guard member? You’re not saying that, are you?” Lindsay asked.
“I’m saying that the only theoretical harm [the ACLU and CAG] have even alleged that could possibly give them a right to relief would be harm by a National Guard member,” Etheredge responded.
Sparks, however, argued that the harm is very real — especially if it was caused by an illegal action from the governor. 
“Transparency and accountability isn’t something that just happens once, you get it, and then you’re done,” Sparks said. “It’s built. It’s a norm. And when that norm is eroded, it doesn’t erode in just one area. It erodes it in all areas.”
Sparks, speaking after Friday’s hearing, said the case raises questions about what it means when set and established norms are threatened by potentially unlawful actions. It shouldn’t be a problem, she said, to prove that something done by the government was done legally and within all appropriate parameters of set law.
“This represents a real deviation from the norm that we have come to expect living in a democracy — that the government follows the rules that the government is bound by,” Sparks said. “I think when we deviate from that norm, when we erode it, it hurts a number of other democratic processes and principles, and in some ways, it’s a canary in a coal mine that we should all be really concerned about.”
Sparks continued, saying she believed it was “objectively a good thing” that Lindsay continued the hearing in order to ensure the court reaches “the right ruling.”
“And we’re confident that the right ruling is finding that the governor’s acts, and the [state’s] acts more broadly, were unlawful,” Sparks said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-24 20:36:34+00:00,CT Mirror,Judge approves Hartford HealthCare’s purchase of 2 Prospect-owned CT hospitals,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/24/hartford-health-care-prospect-purchase-judge/,"A judge approved on Friday the purchase of Manchester Memorial and Rockville General hospitals, currently owned by Prospect Medical Holdings.","A judge for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas approved on Friday Hartford HealthCare’s $86.1 million purchase of two Connecticut hospitals owned by Prospect Medical Holdings — Manchester Memorial and Rockville General.
Prospect filed for bankruptcy protection in January, and the sale of its hospitals around the country is being overseen by the court. The company did not receive any other bids for the two Connecticut facilities. 
Deborah Weymouth, president and CEO of Prospect’s Connecticut hospitals, said in an emailed statement that the organization is pleased to have received court approval.
“This marks an important milestone and we look forward to closing the transaction as quickly as possible,” Weymouth wrote.
Tina Varona, a spokesperson with Hartford HealthCare, said the health system is “uniquely positioned to deliver on our promise to these communities.”
“We are actively working to provide resources to stabilize and grow the workforce, enhance quality and safety, and make strategic investments in people, programs, technologies, facilities and community partnerships,” Varona wrote in an emailed statement.
The deal still needs to receive state approval, known as a “certificate of need,” the process health care entities must clear before engaging in major transactions, like mergers and acquisitions.
OHS and the Lamont administration faced criticism over the time spent evaluating a failed $435 million deal signed in 2022 for Yale New Haven Health to acquire the three Prospect-owned hospitals.
During the state legislature’s 2025 session, earlier this year, lawmakers passed a measure that allows for an expedited timeline for the acquisition of hospitals that have filed for bankruptcy. Under the newly-established emergency certificate of need process, OHS must issue a final decision within 60 days from when the application is deemed complete.
OHS spokesperson Wendy Fuchs confirmed that Hartford HealthCare has yet to file for an emergency certificate of need.
Some of the proceeds from the $86.1 million sale will go towards paying the towns of Manchester and Vernon for outstanding real property taxes. Lawyers for Manchester and Vernon claim the towns are owed $4.2 million and $1.1 million in real property taxes, according to court documents.
A lawyer with Medical Properties Trust, Prospect’s landlord and the company that owns the hospital buildings, declined to confirm how much the towns were owed, but said that any real estate taxes would be paid.
“I’m not going to opine on the precise number because I don’t think we have a view on the number. I leave that to the debtor. But we don’t dispute that, whatever the real estate taxes that the debtor and the buyer agree to with the townships, those will be paid at closing,” the attorney said.
A spokesperson for MPT did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication.
The towns’ attorneys also claim Manchester and Vernon are owed an additional $692,288 and $330,316 in personal property taxes. 
But Prospect has other debts to pay off that take priority over the municipal personal property taxes, including a loan from MPT that has a current balance of roughly $248 million. Unlike the real estate taxes, the outstanding personal property tax dispute would likely remain unresolved when the transaction closes, the judge said.
In addition to Manchester Memorial and Rockville General, Prospect also owns another Connecticut facility: Waterbury Hospital.
The state plans to acquire Waterbury as part of a broader plan to expand its own struggling flagship medical institution, UConn Health. The state is also in talks to acquire two independent hospitals, Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam and Bristol Hospital. 
On Oct. 3, the University of Connecticut’s Board of Trustees and the UConn Health Board of Directors voted to approve a $13 million bid to acquire Waterbury Hospital. However, the health system had not submitted an offer as of Oct. 24.
The deal will also consist of some level of forgiveness of the outstanding taxes Prospect owes the state, Connecticut officials confirmed. 
Earlier this week, The Connecticut Mirror reported that Prospect owes the state more than $127 million in unpaid hospital provider taxes going back more than three years, according to court documents.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023_0927_SR_Hospitals_004-scaled-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-24 16:57:23.079236

Gov. Greg Gianforte promoted Montana products and the Treasure State’s partnerships with South Korea and Japan on a trade mission this week.
On the trip, Gianforte, a Republican, touted, wheat, beef, coal and technology — and opportunities for future growth in trade — to business leaders, such as Chairman Jin-Sik Yoon of the Korea International Trade Association, one of Korea’s top five private economic organizations representing more than 70,000 companies.
In 2024, Korea was Montana’s second largest trading partner, with $335 million in exports, according to a series of news release from the Governor’s Office about the trip.
“Montana is open for business, and we are eager to partner with Korea’s most innovative companies,” Gianforte said in a statement. “From agriculture to advanced technology, Montana offers the talent, resources, and business climate needed to grow and succeed in the global market.”
In Korea, Gianforte highlighted an existing partnership with a couple of companies, UP Chemical and Advanced Material Solutions, and their recent investment in a manufacturing facility in Stevensville, the news release said.
It said SemiLink Materials recently established a facility in the Bitterroot and serves as a worldwide supplier of specialty gases for the semiconductor industry.
Industrial machinery exports, largely for semiconductor applications, were Montana’s largest export to Korea in 2024, accounting for $103 million in sales, and wheat is the state’s most consistent export to both Japan and Korea, at $38 million last year, according to a news release.
In Japan, Gianforte promoted wheat, beef and technology, and he outlined opportunities for collaboration in photonics, quantum, semiconductors, advanced manufacturing and clean energy, according to a news release. He also invited the Japan External Trade Organization to lead a delegation to Montana.
Gianforte highlighted Montana’s “strong business climate” and interest in encouraging innovation and more trade, a news release said.
He touted Montana’s work in bioscience and growth in academic research including in photonics.
“Globally, the photonics industry is estimated to be worth $1.75 trillion and is an enabling technology that contributes more than $16 trillion to global GDP,” a news release said. “Montana has one of the highest per capita concentrations of companies in the United States specializing in optics, photonics, and quantum technology and a strong history of working with Japan and Korea with some business partnerships having been established for over 30 years.”
In a statement, he said Montana and Japan share a deep history rooted in “respect, innovation and opportunity.”
“We’re building on that foundation by expanding our collaboration in technology, energy, and agriculture to create more good-paying jobs and investment in Montana and Japanese communities.”
He also met with representatives in the beef industry to highlight Montana as one of the top ten beef-producing states in the U.S. and the more than $41 million in beef exports sent to Japan last year.
The governor touted Montana coal and energy as well. A news release said roughly half of the 26 million metric tons of coal mined in Montana each year are exported to Asian markets through Canada.
“Montana has long been a global leader in providing dependable energy,” Gianforte said. “We’re committed to ensuring a stable supply of coal and to growing the partnerships that power communities here in Japan and back home in Montana.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GG-1024x711.jpg,,,2025-10-24 16:57:23.079236
,DC,2025-10-24 20:31:38+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Pay for Trump and Congress continues in shutdown, unless they ask it be held",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/pay-trump-and-congress-continues-shutdown-unless-they-ask-it-be-held,,"WASHINGTON — Some members of Congress are asking for their salaries to be withheld during the government shutdown, while federal workers on Friday missed their first full paycheck since many operations closed on Oct. 1.With no movement toward a deal to end the shutdown, the House remained on a prolonged break from Capitol Hill, the Senate left for its usual long weekend and President Donald Trump prepared to depart for a trip to China, where he will likely focus much more on foreign policy and tariffs than the funding lapse. The president, lawmakers and federal judges all receive their regular paychecks during government shutdowns, unlike the 2 million civilian federal employees and thousands of staffers who work in the legislative branch. Members of Congress are paid $174,000 a year and leaders are paid more.Active duty military members would also normally miss their paychecks, but the Defense Department reprogrammed $8 billion earlier this month to avoid a missed payday for U.S. troops. It’s unclear if the Pentagon can do that again ahead of the Oct. 31 pay date or if there was enough money left to cover those salaries. Pay for CongressUnlike most federal workers, members of Congress have the option to receive their pay as normal, donate their salaries to charity, give the money back to the Treasury, or have their checks withheld during this shutdown.  Rhode Island Democratic Rep. Gabe Amo posted a letter Thursday evening from House Chief Administrative Officer Catherine L. Szpindor confirming that House members’ salaries can be held back until after the funding lapse ends. Szpindor wrote that legal requirements, including the 27th Amendment, entitle members of Congress to their pay and that any lawmaker who has their check withheld during a shutdown can request it be distributed at any time. Szpindor did not respond to a request for comment.A spokesperson for Ohio Republican Sen. Jon Husted said the Senate Financial Clerk told their office that while senators are required to be paid, officials can withhold his check until after the shutdown ends, at his request. The Senate disbursing office will continue to cut the check, but Husted will not pick it up until after Congress funds the government, the spokesperson said. Husted doesn’t believe members of Congress should receive their salaries on time when other federal workers cannot, the spokesperson said. A different Senate staffer, speaking on background about the issue, told States Newsroom the salary for another senator was transitioned from direct deposit to a physical paycheck so it could be held by the disbursing office for the duration of the shutdown, at that senator's request. Members of Congress who have asked for their salaries to be withheld include Colorado Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet, Florida Republican Rep. Kat Cammack, New Jersey Democratic Sen. Andy Kim, Oklahoma Republican Rep. Stephanie Bice and Oregon Democratic Rep. Janelle Bynum, among others.  Spokespeople for Trump and Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., did not respond to a request for comment about whether they are having their salaries withheld during the shutdown. A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said he is having his paycheck held back.Can lawmakers’ salaries legally be withheld?Congress has voted several times over the years to officially withhold members’ salaries during a shutdown, but none of the bills have ever become law. There have been questions during past funding lapses about whether members’ paychecks could legally be withheld.The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office wrote in a letter to Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst just before the shutdown began that member pay “is required by the Constitution and is considered mandatory spending.” “Thus, Members of Congress would continue to be paid during a lapse in discretionary appropriations,” CBO Director Phillip L. Swagel wrote. That assessment lines up with a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, updated in August, that says “Members of Congress continue to receive their pay during a lapse in appropriations for a number of reasons.”Lawmaker salaries “have been provided by a permanent, mandatory, appropriation since” 1981, the report says.The U.S. Constitution, in Article I, Section 6, Clause 1, says: “Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.”And the 27th Amendment to the Constitution says: “No law, varying the compensation for the services of the Senators and Representatives, shall take effect, until an election of Representatives shall have intervened.”The CRS report quotes the Government Accountability Office’s principles of federal appropriations law as saying, “The salary of a Member of Congress is fixed by statute and therefore cannot be waived without specific statutory authority.”But the report also points out nothing prevents a member of Congress from accepting the salary and then donating all or part of it back to the Treasury.No options and no paychecks for fedsThat same choice isn’t available for the people who work for members of Congress or those at departments and agencies throughout the executive branch. They must go without their paychecks until after Congress and the president broker a deal to fund the government and end the shutdown. Any worker who manages national security issues, or the protection of life or property, is considered exempt and continues working until the shutdown ends. Any federal employee not in that category is placed on furlough. The Senate was unable to advance multiple bills Thursday that would have provided salaries to some federal employees and contractors during the shutdown. Absent new congressional action, both exempt and non-exempt federal workers are supposed to receive back pay under a 2019 law once government reopens, though Trump and administration officials have cast doubt on whether they will do that for employees in the executive branch. Guidance from the House Committee on Administration says that all employees who work within the legislative branch will receive back pay once a funding bill becomes law. “Neither essential nor furloughed employees are authorized to receive compensation during a lapse in government funding,” the report says. “Federal law statutorily requires retroactive pay for furloughed and essential employees following the end of a lapse in government funding.”",,,,2025-10-24 16:57:23.079236

Patrick Morrisey. (Photo by Kristian Thacker/West Virginia Watch)A resident of John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center, represented by Sen. Joey Garcia, has filed a lawsuit against West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey seeking to stop the sale of the state-run facility. 
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion
The lawsuit comes as Morrisey’s sale of four long-term care hospitals, including the John Manchin center, is expected to close next week. 
Garcia, D-Marion, filed the complaint Thursday in Marion County Circuit on behalf of Mary DeVito, a 94-year-old widow who has lived at the facility since 2019 and requires 24-hour care, according to the lawsuit. 
The lawsuit names as defendants Morrisey and Michael Caruso, secretary of the state Department of Health Facilities, in their official capacities. 
Morrisey announced in August the state had reached a deal to sell four state-run long-term care facilities to New York-based development group Marx Development Group for $60 million. Besides the John Manchin facility, they include Hopemont Hospital in Preston County, Lakin Hospital in Mason County and Jackie Withrow Hospital in Raleigh County. 
Together the facilities are licensed for about 500 beds. The facilities typically serve elderly patients using Medicaid. 
In the complaint, Garcia argues that Morrisey and Caruso don’t have the authority to divest Caruso of his duty to manage and operate the John Manchin facility. 
According to the lawsuit, House Bill 2006, legislation from 2023 that reorganized the state Department of Health and Human Resources into three departments, required the new Department of Health Facilities to operate the facility. Garcia believes the Legislature’s permission is required to sell the facilities. 
The case is assigned to Marion County Circuit Judge Matthew S. Delligatti.
Delligatti on Friday granted a temporary restraining order stopping the sale of the John Manchin facility. He scheduled a hearing in the case for 3:30 p.m. Tuesday in Marion County Circuit Court. 
The sale is scheduled to close Oct. 31. 
In an email Friday, Drew Galang, Morrisey’s press secretary, said his administration has received the complaint and is aware of the temporary restraining order.  
“The contract to sell these facilities is based on very strong legal authority, and we look forward to communicating our arguments to the court at Tuesday’s hearing,” Galang wrote.

Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced the news Thursday at the state Capitol in Charleston, West Virginia.
This is a technological leap forward for our state as West Virginia becomes the 12th state in the country to adopt this technology,” Morrisey said. “This is a first step toward a broader rollout aimed at making everyday life easier for West Virginians.”
The rollout, done in collaboration with the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles, is ongoing, and Morrisey said they hope to expand the use of the digital ID to include businesses and more. 
Right now, West Virginia residents can present their ID using their iPhone and Apple Watch at 250 TSA checkpoints at airports across the U.S., including West Virginia International Yeager Airport in Charleston and Huntington Tri-State Airport. 
“It’s only going to grow,” Morrisey said, adding that some of the smaller airports in the state are still waiting for scanners that can recognize digital ID. 
A news release from the governor’s office said that, “ID in Apple Wallet uses the privacy and security features that are built into Apple devices to help protect a user’s identity and personal information.” Users do not need to unlock or hand over their device to present their ID.
To add a West Virginia driver’s license or state ID to Apple Wallet, tap the + button at the top of the screen in Apple Wallet, select “Driver’s license or State ID” and follow the on-screen instructions to start the set-up and verification process.

(Screenshot via Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Montana)On the same day Montana’s insurance commissioner announced an investigation into a massive data breach by the state’s largest health insurance company, a group of attorneys filed a class-action lawsuit in Helena alleging that the corporation failed to notify customers and didn’t take standard precautions to safeguard the data, which could include birth dates, Social Security numbers and data on the health conditions of individuals.
The class action lawsuit, filed in Lewis and Clark County District Court, says that Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Montana should be held responsible for as many as 462,000 Montana customers’ private and healthcare information being taken. That is approximately one-third of the state’s residents.
Moreover, it accuses the insurance giant of knowing about the data breach for months, but failing to notify any of its customers that their information was at risk.
Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield said that it doesn’t comment on pending litigation.
However, in a story about Montana Commissioner of Securities and Insurance James Brown opening an investigation, a spokeswoman for the company told the Daily Montanan that a third-party vendor was responsible for the data breach, but it would not confirm the breadth of the leak.
The lawsuit was filed on behalf of two Montana residents.
“This type of personal and sensitive data is highly targeted and sought after by hackers who seek to exploit that data for nefarious purposes,” the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit asks Lewis and Clark District Court Judge Christoper Abbott to certify it as class action, meaning that Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield’s customer base of more than 460,000 could be named and eligible for any settlement. Attorneys for the group include Raph Graybill and Rachel Parker of Graybill Law Firm in Great Falls; John Heenan of Heenan and Cook in Billings; and David Paoli of the Paoli Law Firm in Missoula.
On Friday, a notice about the data breach was placed on the company’s website. It said that the breach was caused by third-party vendor, Conduent, and that notices about the breach were being sent to customers, beginning on Oct. 24.
The lawsuit also alleges that even though the data breach was discovered and known about in January 2025, Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield didn’t act quickly. Brown’s office confirmed with the Daily Montanan that it didn’t learn of the data breach till Oct. 8, nearly a year after it said the breach started. According to court documents, it lasted from October 2024 until January.
Montana law requires reporting of breaches “without reasonable delay.”
The lawsuit alleges that the data breach has resulted in several harmful results including an invasion of privacy, lost time and costs associated with the breach, and spam and fraud calls as well as identity theft.
The lawsuit also seeks several dozen remedies in seven counts being brought against Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield. Those counts include negligence, breach of contract, violating the Montana Consumer Protection Act and breach of fiduciary duty.
Attorneys argue that Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield did not take adequate precautions in protecting the sensitive personal and health information, which should have included encrypting the information as well as deleting it when it was no longer needed.
The lawsuit also outlines how data obtained by hackers can be used and sold on the dark web.
“Private information can be sold at a price ranging from $40 to $200. Criminals can also purchase access to entire company data breaches from $900 to $4,500,” the suit said.
The lawsuit then explains how a few personally identifying data points can be parlayed into a larger and nearly complete identity theft of a person.
“Because a person’s identity is akin to a puzzle with multiple data points, the more accurate pieces of data an identity thief obtains about a person, the easier it is for the thief to take on the victim’s identity — or track the victim to attempt other hacking crimes against the individual to obtain more data to perfect a crime,”  the lawsuit said.  “With (complete) packages, cybercriminals can cross-reference two sources of private information to marry unregulated data available elsewhere to criminally stolen data with an astonishingly complete scope and degree of accuracy in order to assemble complete dossiers on individuals.”
The lawsuit also warns that cybercriminals often hold the data for some time before they use it, or victims don’t discover the theft until well after the fact, after financial damage is done.
“A study by Experian found that the average cost of medical identity theft is ‘about $20,000’ per incident and that most of victims of medical identity theft were forced to pay out-of-pocket costs for health care they did not receive to restore coverage. Almost half of medical identity theft victims lose their health care coverage as a result of the incident, while nearly one-third of medical identity theft victims saw their insurance premiums rise, and 40% were never able to resolve their identity theft at all.”
The lawsuit also pointed out that a 2007 General Accounting Office report said that fraudulently obtained data may be held for as long as a year before cybercriminals use it.
“As a result, studies that attempt to measure the harm resulting from data breaches cannot necessarily rule out all future harm,” the lawsuit said.
The lawsuit estimates that identity and credit theft monitoring will cost around $200 per year per class member.
“This is a future cost for a minimum of five years that plaintiffs and class members would not need to bear but for defendant’s failure to safeguard their private information,” the lawsuit said. “Through its failure to provide timely and clear notification of the data breach…(Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield) prevented plaintiffs and class members from taking meaningful, proactive steps to secure their private information and mitigate the impact of the data breach. (They) could have taken action earlier had they been timely notified of the data breach.”
As part of the lawsuit, attorneys for the plaintiffs are asking the court to impose a host of protections and punishments, including more encryption, destruction and purging of personally identifying information after its use, prohibiting keeping information on cloud-based services, ordering periodic security checks by both staff and independent auditors, as well as more comprehensive education and alert programs to inform staff and customers.
The suit also asks for actual damages, compensatory damages and punitive damages, as well as a 10-year third-party monitoring firm to report on whether Montana Blue Cross-Blue Shield is complying with the court order.

The event was attended by political and higher education figures from across the state. (Photo courtesy of FIU)Former Lt. Gov. Jeanette Nuñez took her oath of office Friday, cementing her (semi-)new title: president of Florida International University. 
The FIU community and Nuñez’s network gathered for her presidential investiture ceremony in Miami, complete with video comments from Gov. Ron DeSantis. She’d served at FIU on an interim basis since she left the governor’s office in February, 
“To lead FIU as its seventh president, and as the first alumna, is both the greatest honor and the greatest responsibility of my career,” Nuñez said during the ceremony at the Ocean Bank Convocation Center. Having earned a bachelor’s degree in 1994 and master’s in 1998 from FIU, she’s not only the first graduate to preside over the institution, but also the first woman to serve. 
“President Nuñez is a visionary leader, a dedicated public servant and a trailblazer whose lifelong commitment to excellence and innovation perfectly aligns with the bold future the Board of Trustees has laid out for her,” FIU Board of Trustees Chair Carlos Duart said. 
Nuñez’s network
Present at the ceremony were Attorney General James Uthmeier, Education Commissioner Anastasio Kamoutsas, Supreme Court Justice John Curiel, U.S. Reps. Byron Donalds (R-Naples), Mario Díaz-Balart (R-Miami), Carlos Jiménez (R-Miami), and Frederica Wilson (D-Miami Gardens), and director of the U.S. Marshal Service Gadyaces Serralta.
A number of State University System figures attended, including Chancellor Ray Rodrigues.
Rodrigues, who served in the Legislature alongside Nuñez, pointed to her stint as chair of the Higher Education & Workforce Subcommittee in the House from 2012-2014, pointing to that committee’s efforts to establish preeminence classifications and performance-based funding.
“These two pieces of legislation, preeminence and performance-based funding, are what has driven the transformation and elevation of higher education in the state of Florida,” Rodrigues said. 
Florida International University follows through, votes for a Nuñez presidency

“FIU, I tell you this morning, that your president’s service to this institution began long before she was ever employed by you, going all the way back to the vision and foresight she had as a representative and then later as lieutenant governor,” Rodrigues said. 
DeSantis and U.S. Secretary of State and National Security Adviser Marco Rubio both recorded video messages congratulating Nuñez that played during the ceremony. 
“She served with distinction and she served ably” as lieutenant governor, DeSantis said, “but she is now in her element as the president of Florida International University down in Miami.”
Nuñez, 53, served in the Florida Legislature from 2010-2018 before serving six years as lieutenant governor, starting in 2019. 
She was named interim president in February and was permanent president in June.

Remarks
Nuñez spent part of her remarks honoring the six former presidents of FIU: Chuck Perry, Harold Crosby, Greg Wolfe, Modesto Maidique, Mark Rosenberg, and Kenneth Jessell. 
Maidique, for whom the main campus is named, Rosenberg, and Jessell were in attendance. 
“Each of these leaders fought their share of giants, convinced the naysayers, silenced the detractors and endeavored diligently to build the university I now have the privilege of leading,” Nuñez said.
Nuñez’s presidency was met with opposition, with the Faculty Senate representative Noël Barengo voting no, citing “deep concern about what we see as another effort by the governor’s office to interfere with public higher education.” He did vote in her favor for the permanent presidency. 
About a dozen public speakers appeared in the virtual meeting approving her as interim president in February, questioning the need for Jessell to step down before his contract expired and her partisan political involvement. One called Nuñez “a yes-woman for DeSantis’ dangerous agenda.”
FIU, 60 years old, was founded on the site of an old airport. Earlier this year, it received the highest rank for performance metrics among Florida’s public universities. 
“Looking forward to FIU’s next 50 years, I see boundless opportunity. I see the inevitability of FIU, a world-class university, a research powerhouse, but also a thriving marketplace of ideas. I see a place of intellectual inquiry and of academic rigor. A place where new ideas are born and students learn and challenge each other,” Nuñez said. 
Nuñez said her administration would double the university’s research expenditures. She also said she believes FIU will be a top 30 university by 2030. This year, U.S. News & World Report ranked it No. 46 among public universities and No. 97 among national universities. 
“Academic freedom is one of the pillars of higher education, and FIU is proud of the work we’ve done to honor this long-standing tradition,” Nuñez said. “But we must be vigilant in ensuring that our faculty fosters open dialogue and viewpoint diversity.”
Lawmakers and the governor have passed various pieces of legislation related to topics that may be taught in schools and which initiatives, particularly those related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, may be funded with state dollars. State law also mandates a survey that tracks ideological moods on campus.
“Rather than telling our students what to think, faculty should welcome rigorous debate. Under my leadership, FIU will uphold diversity of thought, academic freedom, and civil discourse. FIU will never be a place where hateful and violent rhetoric devolve into chaos, nor will it be a place where a select few ideas will be tolerated,” she said.

The news comes as voters are already casting ballots on Proposition 50, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposal to redraw the state’s congressional districts to favor Democrats. Early in-person voting is set to begin this weekend in many counties.
Federal personnel from the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division will be sent to Fresno, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties. Harmeet Dhillon, the former vice chair of the California Republican Party and a Republican National Committee chairwoman, leads the division. 
It’s unclear whether the federal monitors will be onsite during early in-person voting or just on Nov. 4. The Justice Department has not said whether monitors will be stationed at polling places in addition to county elections offices. 
A spokesperson for the department did not respond to an emailed request for comment in time for publication. 
The request for election monitors came from the California Republican Party, the Associated Press reports. Chairwoman Corrin Rankin wrote a letter to Dhillon’s office on Monday, according to the AP. A spokesperson for the state party did not respond to multiple requests for comment via email and text. 
Election observers are nothing out of the ordinary, and both parties regularly deploy poll watchers to ensure voting sites abide by state and federal election laws. 
The Justice Department also has a long history of monitoring jurisdictions that have track records of civil rights violations. Last November, leaders in some Republican states denied the Biden administration’s Justice Department personnel entry into some polling sites. 
“It’s entirely normal for the California Republican Party to request election integrity resources wherever they may be available,” said Bryan Watkins, a former senior adviser to the state party and its former chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson.
Watkins said the state GOP during his tenure welcomed poll monitors from the House Administration Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Republican National Convention. 
“If federal oversight gives voters confidence that their ballots will be secure and counted, I fully support it,” said Millan Patterson in a statement. She now is leading the campaign against Newsom’s Prop. 50.
California Democrats immediately denounced the request as a weaponization of the Justice Department against the state’s voters. 
“No amount of election interference by the California Republican Party is going to silence the voices of California voters,” said Rusty Hicks, chair of the California Democratic Party, in a statement. “Sadly, we’ve come to expect it from a so-called party that operates as more of a Trump fan club.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/030320_SF_Voting_AW_CM_13.jpg?fit=1024%2C721&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-24 16:01:30.992327

Food banks and pantries are already bracing for the increased need, including in Iowa, where more than 270,000 Iowans rely on SNAP each month.However, even if Congress immediately reached a deal to end the shutdown, the time needed to process the payments and make them available for recipients means SNAP benefits would likely be delayed. State officials have warned SNAP recipients of the possibility of delays.In West Virginia, officials said delays are expected and told residents to seek assistance at local food pantries. Roughly 1 in 6 West Virginia residents rely on SNAP each month. Legal requirement citedSharon Parrott, a White House Office of Management and Budget official during the Obama administration who now leads a left-leaning think tank, said in a Thursday statement that USDA is legally required to use its SNAP contingency funds.Parrott, the president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said the multi-year contingency fund is “billions of dollars that Congress provided for use when SNAP funding is inadequate that remain available during the shutdown — to fund November benefits for the 1 in 8 Americans who need SNAP to afford their grocery bill.”Parrott said the Trump administration could use its legal transfer authority, just as it did with WIC funding, to “supplement the contingency reserves, which by themselves are not enough to fund families’ full benefits.”",,,,2025-10-24 16:57:23.079236

Photo by Max Nesterak/Minnesota Reformer. Allina Doctors Council SEIU — comprising over 600 doctors, physician assistants and nurse practitioners — announced Friday that union members are calling a one-day unfair labor practices strike on November 5. 
“We’ve shown them that we’re really serious about this contract, that we need to see a contract that’s going to improve primary care,” said Matt Hoffman, a family doctor and union member. 
The strike will include all 61 primary care and urgent care clinics across Minnesota and western Wisconsin at Allina Health, one of the largest health systems in the Upper Midwest with a $5.8 billion in revenue in 2024. 
The strike could make Minnesota history as the first of its kind, union organizers said during a Friday press call. 
Doctors have not historically seen themselves in need of unionizing, but the broad trend of health care consolidation — hospitals and clinics combining into sprawling health systems like Allina — has led to worsening labor conditions even for physicians and other well paid practitioners. 
Allina doctors voted by a wide margin to unionize in October 2023 and picketed in June to voice frustration with what they called the “factory style” of modern medicine. 
The union is demanding a contract with higher wages, employment benefits written in ink and safe staffing levels, among other issues. The union says Allina has cut wages around 5% on average for physicians, though the precise number is hard to pin down due to variation across physician agreements. 
Allina released a statement, saying in part that “the union’s request for significant compensation increases and extreme benefits proposals are simply not realistic or sustainable,” citing rising costs and cuts to Medicaid passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump in July.
“The bargaining table is where a responsible path forward for all parties can be found, and we have two bargaining sessions scheduled before the one-day strike is planned to occur,” the statement says.
The statement also says Allina is prepared to continue providing safe care during the one-day strike and will contact patients about changes to appointments.
Of particular concern to the doctors: Allina’s physicians do not have employment contracts, instead working for the health system under an employment agreement without time limits, said Nick VenOsdel, a pediatrician at Allina Health Hastings Clinic. The agreement includes a non-compete clause and “a lot of language in there [that] just says that Allina is allowed to change any components of that agreement at their discretion,” he said. 
Non-compete agreements were banned in Minnesota for contracts made after 2023, and the Minnesota Attorney General’s office is actively investigating another multistate health system for imposing non-competes on its physicians. 
Allina is closing four clinics in November, exacerbating the short-staffing of primary care clinics. Cora Walsh, who works at Allina’s West St. Paul clinic, said that the Inver Grove clinic closing has caused “a lot of concern at our clinic. We already have patients waiting to get in with providers here.” 
VenOsdel said the doctors and other providers “are just at our breaking points collectively. We feel like we’ve done everything we can to avoid getting up to this point even prior to unionizing,” he said. The union has engaged, he said, in “years of people trying to use appeal to logic, appeal to emotion, beg and plead to change things.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/P1151760-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 16:01:30.992327

Then she was moved to a rehab unit, then transferred to a nursing home, which was supposed to have been her final destination.
There had been a big meeting of her doctors, social workers, and her family — the city mice who had flown in from points all over the country. They all agreed that Donna would never go home again. After all, she was now 87 years old and had serious health problems.
Her son and daughter-in-law showed up and drove away with her car.
“Don’t you let them put a ‘For Sale’ sign up in front of my house,” Donna said when I visited her in the nursing home. “I’m coming home.”
I remained silent.
“This place is costing me a fortune and doesn’t even have wastebaskets.”
“Wastebaskets? Really?”
Donna sat in a recliner chair in a large, clean room, fully equipped with a kitchen, bathroom, hospital bed, TV, and even a small patio out the sliding glass door. But apparently, no waste baskets.
“They will provide one, but they charge extra. Or, you can bring one from home. So, I might as well just go home.”
“How much extra for a wastebasket?”
“I don’t know, but for $400 a day, you’d think you’d get a waste basket. And a washcloth and towel.”
“They don’t provide those either?”
“Nope.”
What the facility did provide was three square meals a day, two delivered to her room and one served in the communal dining room. Donna had to get there on her walker on her own.
“They only lay eyes on me twice a day, once when they bring my breakfast, and again when they bring my supper. I could die between 5 p.m. and 8 a.m. and no one would know.”
“But what about physical therapy and occupational therapy?”
“Very little. And they’re in and out in 10 minutes. The physical therapist gave me a list of things I had to be able to do before I can go home. Stand up, sit down unattended. Check. Walk to the bathroom. Check. Heck, I’m walking to the dining room. Wash your face. How am I supposed to do that without a washcloth? I’m working my way down the list with the rest. Check, check, check.”
I knew what her family had decided, so I didn’t want to encourage this homeward movement, but frankly, it did sound better than lying in bed dead for hours at $400/day sans wastebaskets.
“And I’m so bored here. What’s happening to the lawn at home?”
Uh, oh. Donna’s mind had turned to lawn mowing. She loved mowing the lawn and had a state-of-the-art John Deere riding mower sitting in her garage. Through the years, I’d noticed that whenever she was stressed or wanted space from her husband, Stu, she mowed the lawn. All three acres. In the heat of the day. 95 to 115 degrees. It didn’t matter the temperature. She kept on mowing. Various neighbors had offered to help, but she refused any aid.
“Oh, don’t worry about your lawn,” I told Donna. “The neighbor guys have it covered.”
A Walker riding lawn mower. (Photo by Mary Swander)
Three different neighborhood men were rotating through on their riding mowers. The men ranged in age from 13 to 60. One mowed each week, sometimes twice. The summer had been rainy, hot, and steamy, the grass growing fast. There had been no particular order to the rotation. The men would drive by on their way to somewhere else, notice the grass had gotten a little high, and within a couple of hours, it was cut. Sometimes, one neighbor would show up and mow on Monday, and another on Wednesday. I knew who was on the other side of the fence by the distinct sound of their Walker mowers.
I had covered Donna’s outside chores all summer. Once the gates were secured, Donna’s lambs grew nicely in her pasture, and her geese were waddling in and out of her pond. A Mennonite neighbor had brought in a crew to clean the whole house. A third young neighbor scrubbed down Donna’s garage so well that you could have eaten off the floor. Then he kept up with her garden that was cascading with ripening tomatoes.
“I’m almost done with the list,” Donna called me on the phone to alert me of her progress. “Coming home soon.”
Her daughter appeared later that same day. “She’ll never be able to go home. They won’t discharge her with a catheter.”
Good fences aren’t always what make good neighbors

The next week, I got the word. “Come and get me.”
Really? Oh, OK. I showed up in Donna’s nursing home room. She’d packed all her belongings in seven or eight large grocery bags. I went up to the nurses’ station to see if I could find a cart, but I was left to my own devices.
“Looks like I’ll make several trips,” I told Donna.
I carried all the bags out to my car, tucked in Donna’s small suitcase, and a couple of boxes of food that had been in the refrigerator. Finally, I helped Donna maneuver into the front seat, her catheter bag hanging from her walker. I figured that some arrangement had been made for maintaining this device. A visiting nurse, perhaps, was coming to the house. Surely, someone would be there that afternoon. Doors closed and locked, we headed out of the parking lot.
“Geez, the nurses weren’t too helpful about finding a cart.” I said.
“That’s because they’re mad I’m going home.”
“What? You didn’t have clearance for this move?”
“No.”
“Not from the doctors either?”
“No.”
“What about your family?”
“They are all against it.”
“What?”
“‘I hope you get along OK at home,” they said.
Oh, no, I thought. But get along OK at home she did. The first thing to go was the catheter.
“I was a nurse for 40 years,” Donna said. “I put in a million of these things. I certainly know how to take one out.”
Next, the physical and occupational therapists showed up at home and both forbade her from walking on the uneven grass.
“It just needs to be mowed,” Donna reassured them.
Then an Amish neighbor appeared in her black bonnet to start making meals. I’d defrosted some venison I’d found in Donna’s freezer, and the neighbor made enough small meals to last a month.
Next, Donna’s church sent a home health aide with two black crosses wired to the grill of her car. The aide took Donna to all her medical appointments. She got Donna up a high step and into the tiny shower in the mudroom. Once she was dry, Donna called the local plumber, telling him to rip out the bathtub and install a large walk-in shower in her regular bathroom.
Little by little, over the course of the next couple of months, Donna improved. The aide took Donna to Walmart for groceries. She took her to the bank, and around town to buy gift certificates for all the neighbors who had helped her. Soon, Donna was at the rec center walking around the track.
“I only made it around once,” Donna said, determined to do more laps.
Still, tiredness plagued her. Some days she woke up in the morning, had breakfast, then fell back in bed asleep. Her blood pressure plummeted and I tried to take her back to the hospital, but she refused.
“Oh, my blood pressure goes up and down,” she said.
Finally, she had a long-awaited appointment with a cardiologist and was fitted with a heart monitor. A week later, she swallowed a pill to address a heart arrhythmia issue.
Then suddenly, her car reappeared in her drive.
“What’s this?” I asked.
“I’ll just drive to church and back,” she promised.
What she didn’t mention was dealing with the lawn. One late afternoon, I was cleaning up my garden, readying it for winter, when I heard the distinct sound of a mower drifting over the fence. And not a Walker mower. A John Deere mower. Donna’s John Deere mower.
“Hey, what’s going on over there?” I called.
But Donna didn’t hear me. She sat in the mower seat, earphones on her head, blocking out all other sound. Back and forth, she mowed the front yard, around the mailbox, around the bird feeder poles, and the flower beds. She mowed through the backyard, the racket shooing her geese toward the pond. Back and forth, and back and forth, Donna mowed, the sun shooting its descending rays down through the trees.

A federal judge ordered them to be removed. (Screenshot from court documents)A federal judge on Friday ordered Ten Commandments posters be removed from Lakeside School District, two days after he permitted the Garland County district to be added to a lawsuit challenging a new state law requiring the displays. 
Following passage of Act 573 of 2025 this spring, public schools are now required to “prominently” display a “historical representation” of the Ten Commandments in classrooms and libraries. The posters must be donated or bought with funds from voluntary contributions. The law also requires them to be displayed in public colleges and universities and other public buildings maintained by taxpayer funds.
Seven Northwest Arkansas families of various religious and nonreligious backgrounds filed a lawsuit in June challenging the constitutionality of the statute. The families allege the state law violates the First Amendment’s Establishment Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,” and its Free Exercise Clause, which guarantees that “Congress shall make no law … prohibiting the free exercise [of religion].” 
Supporters of the law have argued the tenets have historical significance because they influenced the country’s founders in creating the nation’s laws and legal system.
U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks granted a preliminary injunction in August that blocked implementation of the statute in four districts — Bentonville, Fayetteville, Siloam Springs and Springdale. 
Brooks later allowed the Conway School District to be added to the suit as a defendant and district families as plaintiffs. He also ordered Ten Commandments posters be removed from the district’s schools and converted a temporary restraining order against the district into a preliminary injunction. 
A temporary restraining order temporarily halts an action and may be issued immediately, without informing all parties and without holding a hearing. It’s intended to last until a court holds a hearing on whether to grant a preliminary injunction, according to Cornell Law School. 
After Brooks granted permission Wednesday to add Lakeside School District as a defendant and Christine Benson and her minor child as plaintiffs in the case, attorneys for the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction on Thursday. 
Brooks granted the temporary restraining order Friday and held the preliminary injunction in abeyance. He also temporarily blocked Lakeside from complying with the law and ordered the district to remove Ten Commandments displays from its schools by 5 p.m. Monday. 
“A temporary restraining order should issue as to Lakeside School District No. 9,” Brooks wrote in Friday’s order. “Lakeside Plaintiffs are identically situated to the original Plaintiffs: They advance the same legal arguments, assert the same constitutional injuries, and request the same relief.”
Defendants and the attorney general’s office, which intervened in the case, have until Nov. 3 to submit briefs to address why the existing preliminary injunction should not be modified to include Lakeside School District as a defendant, according to Friday’s order.

(Photo: Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)Two former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency leaders joined students and community members at Duke University to speak on advancing environmental goals in the face of federal resistance to climate change regulation.
At an event celebrating the Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment and Sustainability’s 20th anniversary on Thursday, former EPA Administrators William Reilly and Michael Regan discussed finding climate solutions. 
Regan, who is now a distinguished fellow at Duke’s Sanford School of Public Policy, served from 2021 to 2024 under former President Joe Biden, who signed the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. This measure encouraged private sector, public sector, local and state governments, as well as households to invest in clean energy, electric vehicle tax credits and decarbonization efforts. 
As a North Carolinian who also formerly served as secretary of the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality, Regan emphasized the importance of working with state leaders. 
Regan said 70% of the EPA’s budget is passed through to the states. As a result, the agency is closely tied to state environmental departments, because the officials work together on strategic planning, setting priorities and measuring results. 
“Most of those individuals at the state levels are the ones where the rubber meets the road, and they’re the ones that are having conversations with the private sector, with local communities, with environmental justice communities,” he said. 
Former President George H. W. Bush appointed Reilly, who led the EPA from 1989 to 1993. Reilly now serves as chair of the Nicholas Institute’s advisory board. 
Notably, Bush signed the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, a major revision to the original 1970 law. The amendments targeted three major threats to the environment and public health: acid rain, urban air pollution and toxic air emissions, according to the EPA’s website. 
In 1990, perception among members of Congress was that the EPA was “excessively oriented” toward regulation, Reilly said.
While the agency was initially popular during its inception in 1970, public support waned under the Reagan administration, which imposed budget cuts. EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch resigned in 1983 because of an administrative scandal and another EPA official, Rita Lavelle, was convicted of lying to Congress.
To combat this and restore faith, the agency needed a new perspective, he said. The Bush administration worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to develop the clean air amendments and incorporate new ideas. 
“We need to be more resourceful, more open to those kinds of approaches which have not really been tried before,” Reilly said. 
A Duke student asked the pair how EPA leaders can continue to carry out their mission effectively while working under more narrow legal documents, such as West Virginia v. EPA. In that 2022 ruling, the Supreme Court limited the agency’s ability to regulate carbon emissions in the power sector, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. 
Regan said these Supreme Court cases force the EPA to be more creative in terms of protecting public health, and place restrictions on the level of authority the agency can give to regulators. 
“We don’t need a ton of new regulations,” Regan said. “We need smart regulations that give flexibility so that markets and technologies can achieve those environmental goals.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4387-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-24 16:01:30.992327

Ajay Pittman, D-Oklahoma City, enters the House chamber of the state Capitol before the governor's State of the State Address on Feb. 3, 2025. (Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — The House speaker stripped an Oklahoma City Democrat of her committee assignments Friday following a lawsuit against her from the Oklahoma Ethics Commission. 
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said he removed Rep. Ajay Pittman from four committees, including tourism, agriculture, energy and natural resources, and the health budget subcommittee, at the recommendation of his chamber’s Democratic Caucus.
House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, confirmed Friday that her caucus has recommended the temporary suspension. She said that the House Democratic Caucus has also suspended Pittman from its membership and activities pending the outcome of an Attorney General investigation. 
Pittman did not immediately return messages seeking comment. 
The Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office is also investigating Pittman and recently served a search warrant for her office at the Capitol, but a spokesperson said Friday the warrant is sealed. He did not respond to a question about the subject of the investigation. 
The Ethics Commission lawsuit alleges that Pittman committed fraud and breach of contract by filing fake documents to settle a previous ethics investigation. The Commission is seeking civil relief through the Oklahoma County District Court.
Pittman previously settled with the Ethics Commission for improperly using campaign funds for personal use and agreed to pay $35,000. She failed to comply with the settlement agreement, leading to further investigation by the Commission and the eventual lawsuit, officials said. 
A court filing alleges Pittman provided the Commission a letter from her landlord that was actually created by her mother, former state lawmaker Anastasia Pittman, indicating that her campaign records had been destroyed by water damage. 
The lawsuit also alleges Pittman submitted a falsified check to the Commission as proof of a payment from her personal funds as outlined in the settlement agreement.
“These are serious findings from the Ethics Commission, in addition to an ongoing criminal investigation, so I feel this additional step is warranted,” Hilbert said in a statement. 
Hilbert previously removed her from the State Tribal Relations Committee. 
Munson said the allegations against Pittman are “severe enough” to warrant action.
“The House Democratic Caucus remains committed to accountability and transparency for all elected officials and we will continue to focus on serving all constituents and solving problems for everyday Oklahomans,” Munson said.

Ron DeSantis dismissed a slate of proposed constitutional amendments from House Republicans to lower or eliminate property taxes, a South Florida Democrat has unveiled his own ideas for the 2026 legislative session.
“As property tax bills arrive for families around Florida, living in our state feels more expensive than ever,” said state Sen. Mack Bernard, D-West Palm Beach, in a press release Friday. “That’s why I’ve filed these property tax relief proposals — because voters should have a chance to decide on what the best financial relief is for themselves.”

Bernard’s legislative package includes one bill and four joint resolutions. A joint resolution needs to be approved by three-fifths of each chamber in the Legislature to become a proposed constitutional amendment, which then needs 60% support from the public to become law. Bills need simple majority votes and approval by the governor.
These are the five proposals:
SJR 270 — Would exempt the non-school portion of property tax for Florida seniors aged 65 and older who have claimed a homestead exemption for a minimum of five years and whose annual income does not exceed $350,000.
SJR- 274 — Would provide additional homestead property tax benefits for long-term homeowners. It says that assessed value cannot increase after 20 years of ownership and residency; and it would provide homeowners after 30 years of ownership and residency with an additional homestead exemption equal to 50% of the property’s assessed value.
SJR-278 — Would cap the assessed value increase of new homestead properties after a change in ownership at 150% of the property’s prior year assessed value, provided the assessed value was under $500,000, for ad valorem purposes.
SJR 282 — Would limit the assessed value of real property to 3% or the percentage change in the consumer price index, whichever is lower, if the property is owned and used for commercial purposes by a small business.
Bernard is also sponsoring a bill (SB 286) that would allow Florida residents to make changes, additions, or improvements to their homestead without increasing the assessed value of the property if the total just value of changes, additions, or improvements is less than $100,000.
In offering his proposals on Friday, Bernard becomes the first Democrat in the Legislature to weigh in substantively on property tax reform. Property taxes have become a leading issue for DeSantis and Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia, who have promised that Floridians will have the opportunity to vote to either severely reduce or outright ban property taxes on homesteads.
However, they have not stated exactly what would come before the voters next year.
To fill that void, seven Florida House Republicans offered their own joint resolutions to reduce property taxes a week ago. But DeSantis essentially dismissed their substance on Wednesday night, noting in a social media post that “placing more than one property tax measure on the ballot represents an attempt to kill anything on property taxes,” adding that it was “a political game, not a serious attempt to get it done for the people.”
That irked House Speaker Daniel Perez, who responded in a statement Thursday asking where were DeSantis’ proposals?
“So when the Governor says he wants to ‘abolish’ property taxes. How? We don’t have any details,” he said.
“But what the House does have is a proposal that reflects the Governor’s comments in the media and can garner the support of voters in November — the elimination of non-school property taxes on all homesteaded properties, in addition to a range of possible ballot initiatives — some to offer tax cuts, and some to fix broken parts of the system. We offered multiple proposals in good faith because it is unclear to us what — if anything — any other party is willing to do.”
Bernard, an attorney, was elected to represent Senate District 24 in Palm Beach County in a special election in 2024. He previously served in the Florida House between 2009-2012.

(Photo by Andrew Roth/Michigan Advance)Mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan, who is running an independent campaign for Michigan governor in the 2026 election cycle, is gaining traction among voters, according to a new poll released Friday from Schoen Cooperman Research. 
The poll of 600 likely November 2026 voters in Michigan shows Duggan with the support of 26% of voters — while top Democratic candidate Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson sits at 30% and top Republican candidate U.S. Rep. John James having 29% of voter support. 
A statement from Duggan’s campaign called the poll a demonstration of him “rapidly closing the gap on the top Republican and Democrat candidates statewide.”
The margin of error for the poll is 4%, placing Duggan within that margin. 
“We are building a coalition of support unlike anything this state has seen before, pulling unprecedented support from Democrats and Republicans. We’re winning unions, chambers of commerce, clergy and elected officials,” said campaign manager Ed Duggan in a statement from the campaign. 
The statement also pointed to Duggan’s job approval statewide as the mayor of Detroit, where 63% of Democrats — the party that he ran under for all three of his mayoral terms — and 47% of Republicans approved. 
The poll also showed Duggan with a higher net favorability rating compared to Benson, James, and Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist — though all did have net positive ratings among voters. 
“Another poll, another lead for Jocelyn Benson,” Benson’s campaign manager Nikki Goldschein wrote to the Advance in response to the polling. “Michiganders want leaders who can take on broken systems and fix them to make life easier for people across the state — not politicians who attack and divide. That’s why voters keep putting Jocelyn on top, while John James and Mike Duggan are left fighting to keep up.” 
Internal Benson campaign polling also shows Duggan much further behind Benson or James, over 15 points behind either of those candidates.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)With just over a month before its lease is set to expire, the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) has been given the state’s OK to remain at its downtown Providence headquarters for another decade.
The State Properties Committee voted 4-1 Thursday to approve a new 10-year, $24 million lease keeping the department in its converted factory headquarters in Providence’s Jewelry District, much to the frustration of the more than dozen current and former workers who attended the two-hour meeting inside a Department of Administration conference room.
For months, workers organized under SEIU Local 580 have claimed the office building at 101 Friendship St. has poor ventilation, leaks, heating issues, and infestations by insects, mice and other rodents populating the building’s five floors — along with recent bat sightings.
Speaking to the committee, the department’s director, Ashley Deckert, acknowledged that the building “has not been without its challenges,” but that officials have been working with the building’s owner to address issues as they arise.
“While not every challenge can be solved overnight, I’m confident that the building is in a strong operational position,” Deckert said. She added that the department had gone “above and beyond” to make the building safe, functional and welcoming. 
But Matthew Gunnip, president of SEIU Local 580, said that’s not the reality his 300 union members face — showing the committee enlarged photos of buckets filled with brown water, rotting wood, and soot-covered pipes.
“DCYF’s representations were insincere,” he said in an interview after the meeting. “There’s not much transparency.”

Tensions over the building caused the department to miss a key deadline to renew its lease. Under the previous 10-year agreement, the state had to sign a new deal by July 31 to extend it for another decade.
The State Properties Committee was initially set to vote on the renewal July 22, but union pushback prompted the panel to delay the decision pending results from an air quality test. A second vote, scheduled for July 29, was postponed again to allow for a public hearing — a rare step for the committee that reviews state leases.
“Even though we meet in public, we do not normally meet with public comment,” Committee Chairman Marco Schiappa said in his opening remarks.
And in another deviation from the norm, the committee posted years of documentation, including air quality and pest control reports, for the public to view and submit questions to the panel.
Schiappa said the public didn’t submit any questions ahead of Thursday’s meeting. But when the committee opened up for comment, current and former employees spoke of the building’s poor conditions that they say remain and have contributed to health problems among employees.
Diane Winckelium, a former social worker who worked in the building from 1997 to 2009, said she was sick “at least on a monthly basis.”
“I had constant sore throats, sinus infections, [and] severe fatigue,” she said. “Ulitimately I had to undergo a procedure to have tube placed up my ears just to cope.”
It wasn’t until she left the department, she said, that her symptoms finally disappeared, except for her sinusitis. 
“I am stuck with that for life,” Winckelium said.
Debra Bonner, a retired child protective investigator, said she had never had allergies until she worked in the Friendship Street offices between 2002 and 2020. She told the committee she has since been diagnosed with cancer, which she believes came from working in the office building.
“All the vents in that building had black soot,” she said.
State and building officials maintain the air quality is safe, citing recent reports — including a Sept. 5 analysis by R.I. Analytical Laboratories, Inc. — that measured particulates, carbon dioxide, dander, and mold, all found to be within normal levels for an office environment.
“The bottom line is that we found a generally clean, maintained building,” Kenneth Davis, a senior environmental scientist for the lab, told the committee.
But Gunnip said the union was not alerted to the findings of that report until Oct. 14. He requested the committee again delay action until the union could get a third-party look at the building.

Nicholas Vaz, representing Attorney General Peter Neronha on the panel, called the request reasonable and worth exploring. He was the lone vote against the extension. But public member Robert Donovan, who moved to approve the lease, warned it would lead to “analysis paralysis” and push a final decision even closer to the Nov. 30 lease expiration.
“All the parties have been given ample time to present experts,” he said.
With the new lease, officials promised improvements including new carpets and paint throughout the majority of the building, new flooring in the lobby and main entrance area, new window blinds, and water fountains with filtration units installed on each floor.
Deckert said the department is also working with building manager Provident Property to establish a maintenance request system that lets employees track when a request is made, who it is assigned to, and when it is completed. 
“Creating a better communication pathway is a priority,” she said.
Gunnip still remains skeptical that this will be the case, adding that he was appalled by the State Properties Committee’s vote.
“There was no acknowledgement of what was reported by the workers,” he said. “It seemed like the vote was taken even before we had the hearing.”

Alex Mercer)New Mexico environment officials announced Friday that approximately 100 homes in Curry County will have a new water source to lessen their exposure to toxic PFAS in their drinking wells from nearby Cannon Air Force Base.
The state environment department said it will be awarding a $12 million state legislative appropriation for the project to EPCOR, which runs water and wastewater services in Eastern New Mexico, and is a major utilities provider in the U.S. and Canada. The company operates more than 41,000 connections in Clovis, according to the state’s drinking water website.
The move comes in response to the state’s PFAS blood testing initiative in the area that found that 99.7% of the 628 participants had PFOS — the form of PFAS (per and poly fluoroalkyl substances) widely used in military firefighting foam — in their blood. The state’s report also found New Mexicans working or living closer to the PFAS-contaminated groundwater plume under Cannon had PFAS levels that were three times higher than residents not working or living near the plume.
Studies on PFAS’ health impacts remain ongoing, but exposure has thus far been linked to kidney and reproductive cancers, decreased fertility, fetal developmental delays, disruption of immune responses and liver functions in people.
The project will extend EPCOR’s existing water system east of the base to include members of Curry County. The connections will be voluntary, requiring households to opt-in, according to a news release on the project. In a statement, state Environment Secretary James Kenney said that connecting to EPCOR’s water lines would be “the best way for Curry County residents to receive drinking water that meets or exceeds all state and federal standards.”
In a joint statement, Republican lawmakers from the Clovis and Broadview areas said they were “excited” to see movement on the $12 million project they set funds aside for in the 2025 legislative session.
“PFAS contamination has impacted the health and wellbeing of our families near Cannon Air Force Base and finding real solutions is critical,” Minority Whip Sen. Pat Woods, Sen. Pat Boone, Rep. Martin Zamora, and Rep. Andrea Reeb said in a joint statement.
New Mexico remains embroiled in several lawsuits with the U.S. Department of Defense over PFAS contamination, and is part of multi-state litigation in South Carolina.
The state is also involved in separate litigation in the federal court system, after the U.S. Department of Defense sued the state’s environment department, claiming New Mexico overstepped its authority in mandating cleanup.
In yet another case filed this year, state officials alleged Cannon Air Force illegally barred state inspectors entry to the base to test for PFAS, violating a new state law. A Department of Defense’s request to move that case forward in federal court remains on hold pending a ruling on whether the case should be incorporated into the multi-state litigation in South Carolina.

Vermont’s state chapters of the Republican and Democratic parties could both see new leadership next month after the parties hold their biennial reorganization meetings.
Paul Dame, the incumbent chair of the Vermont Republican Party, is running for a third term but facing a challenge from a somewhat unconventional opponent: a sitting state senator. Sen. Russ Ingalls, R-Essex, is vying to lead the party with a pitch that it could do more to recruit down-ballot candidates and deepen its ties with younger voters. 
Meanwhile, on the Democratic side, Jim Ramsey — who’s served as interim party chair since February — said Wednesday that he will not be seeking the job on a permanent basis. Ramsey was elected to the role after former chair David Glidden resigned.
“Over the course of the past few months, my work commitments outside of the VDP have been increasing, and much of it is occurring away from Vermont, particularly in Washington, DC.,” Ramsey wrote in an email to other party leaders last week.
Vermont Democrats will elect a new chair on Nov. 15, while the GOP will elect a new leader on Nov. 8. Both chairs will be chosen by the members of each party’s state committees, which largely consist of delegates selected at the county level. 
The Democratic state committee is slated to have about 45 members this year, while the GOP state committee will likely have about 110, party leaders said. 
‘A winning team’
Dame was first elected GOP chair in 2021, and he was reelected to the two-year post in 2023. Like Ingalls, he said he’s running to build on sweeping gains the party made in the Vermont House and Senate in last fall’s elections that dismantled Democratic supermajorities in both chambers.
For Dame’s part, though, he thinks a leadership change won’t help win more seats. He acknowledged that the party’s gains were largely thanks to campaigning by Republican Gov. Phil Scott, though believes his relationship with the governor played a role, too. 
“I think when you’ve got a winning team, you want to be very careful about mixing things up,” said Dame, who lives in St. George and runs a retirement planning company.
Despite those gains, recent history gives Republicans some reason to be wary. During the last midterm elections in 2022, the party lost substantial ground to Democrats after winning a handful of new seats in 2020 — albeit, not the wave they won last year. It’s not entirely clear what impact President Donald Trump’s popularity, or the popularity of policies backed by Trump’s GOP allies in Congress, might have on the 2026 race. 
The state Republican Party has also faced a scandal over the past two weeks that could factor into the chair race. State Sen. Sam Douglass, R-Orleans, resigned from his seat after he was exposed in a Politico report as a member of a group chat with other young Republicans from around the country that exchanged racial slurs and other derogatory messages.  
Gov. Scott issued a press release calling for Douglass to resign the evening of the day the Politico report was published. The following day, Ingalls was the lead signatory on a statement signed by several Northeast Kingdom legislators calling for the same, adding, “these comments have no place within our society as a whole and will not be tolerated.”
Douglass formally submitted notice of his resignation to Vermont’s Senate secretary, John Bloomer, on Wednesday.
For his part, Dame had not immediately called for Douglass to resign from his Senate seat. He called the group chat “shocking and grotesque” in a statement the following day but suggested that remarks attributed to Douglass in the Politico story were not bigoted or racist. Hours later, however, the executive committee of the state GOP issued a press release with a “full, complete retraction” of Dame’s statement.
“The Vermont Republican Party (“VTGOP”) Executive Committee stands united with Governor Phil Scott and the Republican Senate and House leadership and calls for the immediate resignation of Senator Sam Douglass,” they wrote in the release.
The party’s executive committee includes Dame as well as the party’s vice chair, treasurer and secretary, along with Republican state legislators and other members appointed by the larger state committee, according to the party’s governing rules. 
In an interview on Vermont Public’s midday radio show, Vermont Edition, on Monday, Dame, who served in the House from 2015 to 2017, pushed back on the notion that his values were not aligned with those of the rest of the committee. He said he was hesitant to jump to conclusions about Douglass’ intentions, and that he issued the statement he felt comfortable with given all the information he had at the time.
“Part of what I’ve been trying to do in my term as chair is, trying to find what is a standard that we can hold all of our elected officials to — and, how do we begin to apply that equally, in a nonpartisan way?” he said on the radio.
A senator’s challenge
Ingalls has served in the state Senate since 2019 and currently chairs the chamber’s Agriculture Committee. He is well-known as one of the chamber’s most conservative voices. 
Ingalls faced criticism from the state’s Democratic Party in April when he was one of a handful of members of the chamber to vote against a resolution condemning the arrest of Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student activist and years-long Upper Valley resident, by masked federal immigration agents in Colchester. The Columbia University student, who was a prominent leader of pro-Palestinian protests on campus, was later ordered released by a Vermont federal judge.
To be sure, Ingalls also represents some of the state’s most politically conservative areas. In Essex County, which makes up most of his district, 55% of voters supported Trump in the 2024 presidential election, compared with 33% on average statewide. 
“I have spoken to far too many of you who feel disenfranchised with the direction of our Party and its leadership,” Ingalls said in a social media post announcing his candidacy last week, a day before the Politico story was published. “I hear you and commit to making sure that your values and ideals are reflected in the Party that you love.”
In addition to serving in the Legislature, Ingalls owns a real estate business and operates a group of radio stations in and around his Northeast Kingdom district. Over the summer, Ingalls decided to switch the brief newscasts that play at the top of the hour on his stations from stories produced by Associated Press or the major broadcasters ABC, CBS and NBC to Fox News.
Dame, in an interview, questioned whether Ingalls would be able to devote his time fully to serving as party chair in addition to all those different roles.
“I think that he’s too important in the role that he’s in to have his attention divided with everything that comes with this job,” Dame said, referring to Ingalls’ Senate seat. Republicans have a minority of seats but enough to sustain vetoes by Gov. Scott.
For a moment this month, a third candidate also had his hat in the ring for state GOP chair: Joe Gervais, the current chair of the Bennington County Republicans who has run, unsuccessfully, for both the House and Senate. Gervais announced his bid for chair on Oct. 2, but last week, he reneged on that idea and endorsed Ingalls’ bid instead, he said in an email.
Ingalls did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
A new Democratic chair
While Republicans will be focused on maintaining — and attempting to boost — the number of seats they have in both chambers next year, Ramsey, the outgoing Democratic chair, said his party will focus on messaging to voters that characterizes Scott, and other Republican leaders, as an inadequate safeguard against the Trump administration. 
It’s not clear yet whether any of Vermont’s statewide Democratic incumbents — namely, Treasurer Mike Pieciak or Attorney General Charity Clark — will announce a bid for governor for 2026. Scott has not said yet whether he plans to seek what would be his sixth term in the office.
Ramsey said his increasing work commitments in Washington, D.C., stem largely from his and his wife’s work with organizations that advocate for research on brain health. He said that work has taken on new urgency amid the Trump administration’s efforts to slash public health research. The couple plans to move to Washington, D.C. full time but keep a second home in Manchester, Ramsey said.
Glidden, the former Democratic chair, announced he was resigning from the job in November 2024, triggering a midcycle election for the role. Ramsey beat out Andy Julow, who was appointed to a state Senate seat in May 2024 but then lost in the general election that fall to a Republican challenger. The party chair vote was 38-7, according to Ramsey.
Julow said in a text message Wednesday that he does not plan to seek the job again. Ramsey said he wasn’t immediately aware of other candidates who had publicly declared their intention to run.
Ramsey appeared to receive at least some scrutiny during his time as chair over fundraising efforts. A report from the Vermont Democratic Party’s treasurer last month, which was reviewed by VTDigger, stated that staff added a specific line for party fundraising tied to the chair. Between January and August, the chair had raised “$0 against a budgeted (expected) revenue of $6500,” the report states. The line was added “in response to requests for more fundraising transparency,” it states.
Ramsey said he was aware of that line item but pushed back on the idea that it was a criticism of his work as chair. He said he did not think it painted a complete picture of the work he’d done since taking on the role. He compared the $6,500 figure to the party’s total revenue over the same time period which, per the report, was about $227,000, saying the former would have been a small drop in the bucket.
“I’ve done a lot of work with emails, letters, meetings, calls, other stuff,” Ramsey said. “There has been quite a bit of activity on my part.”

When bulldozers began to tear down the East Wing of the White House this week to clear the way for President Donald Trump’s $250 million ballroom, historians raised alarms that important American history was being buried in the rubble, including chapters about previous first ladies and their roles uplifting women going back nearly a century.
Among the offices housed in the East Wing is the Office of the First Lady, first professionalized by Eleanor Roosevelt during her husband’s administration. Roosevelt used the East Wing for official functions, as a base of operations for her activism and as a space for interacting with groups representing the American people, from the Girl Scouts to the Women’s Trade Union League.
Betty Ford argued to increase pay for her staff in the East Wing. Rosalynn Carter became the first first lady to keep her own office there, in 1977. It was also in the East Wing that Laura Bush launched her literacy efforts, and where Michelle Obama oversaw her “Let’s Move” campaign.
Katherine A.S. Sibley, a professor of history at Saint Joseph’s University in Philadelphia, said that before Carter, first ladies had offices in the presidential residence, often in their bedrooms. Roosevelt establishing a staff and presence in the East Wing — and subsequent first ladies having dedicated staff and their own offices there — were acknowledgements of the significant role presidential spouses play on key initiatives.

“To me, this demolition suggests that the current White House does not think that the first lady does anything of value,” Sibley said. “I’m not talking about [Melania Trump] particularly, but the office itself — they’re not cognizant of the history.”
The demolition of the East Wing took many by surprise. In July, when Trump signed the executive order authorizing the construction of the ballroom, he said: “It won’t interfere with the current building. … It’ll be near it but not touching it and pays total respect to the existing building, which I’m the biggest fan of.”
The ballroom is being financed by contributions from private companies with business before the Trump administration, including Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Lockheed Martin and OpenAI, according to news reports. At a dinner with donors last week, Trump said: “Everything out there is coming down and we’re replacing it with one of the most beautiful ballrooms you’ve ever seen.”

The National Capitol Planning Commission, an Executive Branch agency that Congress tasked with having a “comprehensive, consistent, and coordinated plan for the National Capital,” is now chaired by a top Trump aide, Will Scharf. He has said the commission does not have oversight over demolition, it only approves construction.
The agency’s website states that it is closed due to the ongoing government shutdown. The 19th received an automated response to its email to the White House press office, saying there are staffing shortages and they are unable to respond to all inquiries, also citing the government shutdown.
In a statement released Monday night, the White House characterized the response to the East Wing demolition as the “latest instance of manufactured outrage, unhinged leftists and their Fake News allies … clutching their pearls over President Donald Trump’s visionary addition of a grand, privately funded ballroom.”
Former East Wing staffers told East Wing Magazine that seeing the offices where they once worked torn down was “jarring,” a “gut punch” and “revolting.” Members of the Nixon administration asked the White House to stop the renovation or at least allow them to provide input on the preservation of artifacts. One said they feared a “time capsule” they had installed near a window would be destroyed.

Historian Alexis Coe told The 19th that “serious work would happen” in the East Wing, “on issues that were significant to the American population.”
From the East Wing, Roosevelt expanded the role of first lady, working to highlight women with intention. Her first news conference, on March 6, 1933, featured 35 reporters, all of them women. During her tenure, she held nearly 350 news conferences, helping to elevate the role of women in national and political life, as well as in journalism.
People have also historically chosen to protest outside the East Wing as a way of making themselves seen and getting the attention of the first lady, including on the issue of civil rights in the 1960s, which Lady Bird Johnson supported.
“Serious work is not going to happen there anymore. This is another instance in which Trump has said one thing — that the East Wing would not be altered — and he’s altering it,” Coe said.

(Photo: Wes Muller/LA Illuminator)A Canadian mining company plans to build a facility in Calcasieu Parish to refine rare earth metals used in a variety of motors and electronics in the consumer, technology and defense industries.
Aclara Resources Inc., headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia, announced a $277 million investment to construct the first U.S. heavy rare earth separation facility at the Port of Vinton, according to a Friday news release from Louisiana Economic Development. 
The company plans to mine deposits of rare earth metals in South America and ship them to Louisiana for processing at its proposed facility in Vinton. The facility will use hydrochloric acid to extract and separate the metals from the clay mineral deposits. 
Rare earth elements — such as dysprosium, neodymium, praseodymium and terbium — are considered critical materials for many industries. Some are used as high-powered magnets in wind turbine motors, vehicle alternators and heat-seeking missiles, according to ScienceNews. Others are used as high-temperature alloys in aircraft engines and nuclear reactors, or as signal amplifiers in fiber optic cables, among other applications. 
Aclara’s Louisiana facility is expected to directly employ 140 people. It will occupy an LED Certified Site at the Port of Vinton, prequalified for industrial development through environmental and engineering reviews. 
“Louisiana provides ready access to the key reagents we depend on, helping ensure operational reliability and lower transportation costs,” Aclara Resources CEO Ramón Barúa said in the news release. “The state’s world-class chemical industry and highly skilled workforce made the decision even more compelling. Simply put, Louisiana has everything we were looking for.”
The state is giving Aclara a $3 million grant to pay for infrastructure and an additional job-creation grant for as much as 22% of wages paid. Additionally, the company will be eligible for the state’s lucrative Industrial Tax Exemption Program through which it will be largely exempt from property taxes in Calcasieu Parish. 
Construction is expected to begin in 2026 and be completed in 2027. 
Aclara boasts what it calls a sustainable mining process that uses no explosives, milling or wastewater ponds. The company says it recirculates 95% of the water it uses for mining and plants trees after razing the land. It plans to begin its mining operations in Chile in 2027 and in Brazil in 2028, according to the company’s website.

(Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)McCOOK, Neb. — The process of converting a state prison in McCook into a state-run, federal immigration detention facility is allowed to proceed for now as a district judge considers a motion seeking a temporary injunction filed by McCook residents and a former state lawmaker.
Red Willow County District Judge Patrick Heng heard arguments Friday on the temporary injunction motion, as well as the state’s subsequent motion to dismiss filed earlier this week. He did not make an immediate ruling on either but indicated he would rule “soon” on the motion to dismiss.
The 24-page lawsuit argues Gov. Jim Pillen’s in-progress plan to convert the Work Ethic Camp in McCook would “usurp” legislative authority and violate separation of powers under the Nebraska Constitution and state law. The case names Pillen and Rob Jeffreys, director of Nebraska’s correctional system.

“This case is not about immigration, it’s about our constitutional Republican form of government,” said Nick Grandgenett, attorney for Nebraska Appleseed, which is leading the lawsuit on behalf of the plaintiffs.
Nebraska signed a two-year 183-page contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Sept. 30 to convert the camp into an ICE detention facility.
The lead plaintiff, former State Sen. DiAnna Schimek of Lincoln, served in the Nebraska Legislature between 1989 and 2009, including as chair of the Nebraska Legislature’s Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee. She was one of 41 lawmakers who approved the Work Ethic Camp in 1997 at the request of then-Gov. Ben Nelson, a McCook native and the state’s last Democratic governor.
The facility was meant to reduce prison crowding by moving out low-risk offenders and making space for more violent offenders elsewhere. The Work Ethic Camp opened in 2001, and the Legislature has repeatedly appropriated state funds to keep up the facility.
Schimek and the 13 McCook residents argue that without legislative approval, Pillen, Jeffreys and other officials can’t convert the facility or use state funds other than how lawmakers have specified. The lawsuit also states the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services has authority over state prisoners, not non-citizens awaiting civil proceedings seeking to deport them.
Pillen has previously argued state law gives him authority through the creation of the Corrections Department, plus a clause in the Nebraska Constitution that “supreme executive power rests with the governor.”
Arguments Friday largely centered around a provision of the state Constitution that reads, “The general management, control and government of all state charitable, mental, reformatory, and penal institutions shall be vested as determined by the Legislature.”
Each side of the case had different interpretations of the provision. Lincoln Korell, an attorney representing the state, argued the Legislature had already granted this authority to Corrections, granting the state — or in this case the administration — the ability to enter the contract.
Robbie McEwen, legal director of Nebraska Appleseed, argued that Corrections was granted the power to house incarcerated people within state law. Because the agreement pertains to Nebraska housing immigrant detainees for ICE, he argued that it requires separate legislative approval.

Grandgenett further argued that Pillen and Jeffreys entering the contract violates the Legislature’s authority to appropriate state funds. State senators often refer to the Legislature’s jurisdiction being “the power of the purse.” He cited Nebraska’s unlawful expenditure doctrine, which refers to taxpayers’ ability to sue to prevent the illegal expenditure of public funds.
Korell noted that the federal government plans to reimburse Nebraska on many expenses related to the project. The contract states that ICE plans to pay Nebraska at least $2.5 million each month to house federal detainees — adult males and females — at the camp. It includes a daily bed rate of $269.17 per detainee. In the second year, minimum ICE payments to Nebraska would rise by 3%.
The Work Ethic Camp previously had an annual operating cost of $10.2 million and a daily bed rate of $199.50 per inmate. It housed only males.
Pillen’s office estimated the contract would net Nebraska about $14.25 million per year. ICE agreed to also pay Nebraska a one-time lump sum of $5.9 million for “facility renovations.” Work has already begun to make adjustments to the property. Corrections contracted with Outback Fence, a Lincoln-based fencing company, paying $750,000 to install a 12-foot razor wire-topped fence at the prison by the end of the month.

Grandgenett countered that it doesn’t matter if the feds will reimburse Nebraska, because the state will still have to make the initial expenditures that he contends will cause “irreparable harm.”
“It’s the ‘unlawful expenditure doctrine,’ it’s not the ‘unlawful expenditure unless you make a profit doctrine,’” Grandgenett said.
Joe McKechnie, another attorney for the state, argued that even if the state backs out of the agreement, there still would be plenty of expenses Nebraska would have to shoulder, including the fencing updates.
“The immigration detainees in Nebraska will still have to be detained somewhere,” McKechnie said.
Korell argued Heng should dismiss the case for several reasons. He said the Red Willow County District Court does not have jurisdiction to hear the case, because the lawsuit excludes several parties with interest in the project. Korell argued that if the plaintiffs are successful, that would effectively terminate the contract, which would impact both the federal government and Outback Fence.
McEwen said this perspective could lead to a slippery slope in which every associated organization to the project would need to be included in the case, like food vendors and other contracted businesses. He argued the case concerns the state’s authority to enter the contract, so the state should be the primary party.
Korell also argued plaintiffs used broad justifications about their motives for bringing the case. To get their feet in the courthouse door, Schimek and the McCook residents argue the case concerns an unlawful expenditure of public funds and a “matter of great public concern.”
While Korell acknowledged these are legitimate reasons to file a suit, he argued they are meant to be interpreted narrowly. He said plaintiffs need to show they face an imminent injury as a result of the project, which could apply to federal detainees or state inmates relocated for the project, but not McCook residents.

“Nebraska courts aren’t a stage just for any person to air their grievances against any other person,” Korell said.
In separate affidavits, Schimek and the 13 McCook residents attested to their concerns about the state-federal plan, expressing concern about not having an opportunity to participate in the policy decision before Pillen and others acted.
Some McCook residents expressed concern for McCook children and the “toxic public dialogue” or “fear” the decision had already caused. Ronda Graff said she worried the prison’s repurposing would undermine long-time efforts to create a “welcoming, friendly and engaging community.”
Heng did not offer a timeline as to when he expects to make his rulings, but indicated he would rule on the state’s motion to dismiss first.

You can read more about the section here.

Few topics in education stir as much passion as school choice.
On the surface, the idea sounds simple and appealing: Give families state dollars and let them decide where to send their children to school. But beneath that slogan are serious consequences for Mississippi’s children, communities and future—consequences we cannot afford to ignore.
As Mississippi’s public education system experiences its most impressive gains in decades, we must ask an important question: Why now? Why introduce a policy that would destabilize a system that is clearly working?
Over the past decade, Mississippi has seen remarkable growth, with 87% of districts now earning a C or higher, according to the Mississippi Department of Education.

Notably, eight of the 19 districts rated D, F or not rated at all are charter schools. Our state’s national ranking for K–12 achievement has climbed from 50th to 16th, and Mississippi now leads the nation in early literacy gains and fourth-grade reading growth. These results were not achieved through privatization or vouchers. They were  achieved through focus, consistency and intentionality by teachers and administrators across our state.
When a system is continuously improving, research is clear—now is not the time to blow it up. It is the time to double down on what works.
The path forward for Mississippi lies in refining and strengthening our current educational system, not  abandoning it for one that lacks accountability or proven results. 
Accountability should apply to everyone  
Public schools in Mississippi operate under one of the most transparent and rigorous accountability systems in the nation. Every school and district receives an annual letter grade — A through F — based on clear, publicly reported indicators such as student  achievement, academic growth, graduation rates and college and career readiness.
Those results are not hidden in a report or spreadsheet. They are published statewide each year, tied directly to state and federal funding decisions and used to guide support and improvement efforts.
When schools fall short, the state steps in. The Mississippi Department of Education provides targeted assistance, professional development and intervention strategies to help struggling schools improve.
Local school boards are required to discuss results in open meetings, and the public has full access to performance data by school, grade and subgroup. In short, the public knows exactly how their schools are performing and can hold leaders — like me — accountable for results.
Private schools receiving taxpayer-funded vouchers, however, face none of these same expectations. They are not required to administer state assessments aligned with Mississippi’s academic standards, report graduation rates or publish any data showing whether students are actually learning. They are not required to have certified teachers.
There are no annual report cards, no performance frameworks and no transparency measures that allow parents or taxpayers to see results.
That lack of oversight raises a serious question. If public money is funding private education, how are families — or lawmakers — supposed to know whether “school choice” is actually working? Without data, there is no way to compare outcomes or determine whether students receiving vouchers are gaining ground, standing still or falling behind.
If public dollars are going to private institutions, the public deserves to know what they’re getting in return. Accountability should not stop at the schoolhouse door simply because the sign out front doesn’t say “public.”
Transparency is not a punishment. It’s a promise. It’s the reason Mississippi’s public education system has achieved record gains in the last decade.
We turned years of stagnation into a story of improvement precisely because we were willing to measure results, confront reality and act on what the data showed. If accountability has helped strengthen our public schools, shouldn’t it be expected of any school that receives public funds? 
The cost of disruption  
Universal school choice would drain critical resources from public schools – the very institutions that anchor our communities.
When public dollars follow students out the door, the schools left behind still carry the same responsibilities: Teaching every child who walks through their doors, keeping class sizes manageable and providing programs in the arts, athletics and career-technical education. What disappears are the resources to sustain that work.
Unlike public schools, private schools that receive vouchers are not required to serve all children. They can – and often do – set admissions criteria that exclude students with disabilities, English language learners or those with behavioral or academic challenges.
Private schools may decline to provide transportation, limit access for low-income families or charge additional fees beyond the voucher amount. That’s not freedom or fairness; that’s selective access.
Public schools, by contrast, open their doors to every child, every day. They are the great equalizer – places where opportunity is not limited by income, background or ability. Public schools don’t get to choose their students. They simply choose to serve  them all.
In every community, the public school is more than a building. It’s a gathering place, a unifying symbol and a promise that every child deserves a fair start. To weaken that promise by diverting funds to institutions that operate without the same responsibility or transparency is to risk unraveling one of the most essential threads in the fabric of our state. 
A better path forward 
At its core, education is a public good, not a consumer good. It exists not to serve individual preference but to ensure the collective well-being of our communities and the strength of our democracy.
Public education thrives on shared responsibility,  transparency and inclusion – values that cannot be reduced to marketplace competition or transactional choice. 
When we begin to treat education as a commodity to be bought and sold, we risk eroding the foundation of equal opportunity and civic unity that has anchored this nation for more than a century. Public schools are where our children learn not only  academics, but empathy, cooperation and the responsibilities of citizenship. 
Mississippi’s recent success story proves what’s possible when we invest in what works — early literacy, teacher development, career pathways and continuous  improvement.
Rather than expanding programs that siphon resources away from public schools, we should continue building on the practices that have moved Mississippi from the bottom of national rankings to one of the most improved states in the country.
The future of Mississippi’s children depends on the decisions we make today. If we want every child, in every community, to have a fair shot at success, we must protect and strengthen our public schools. Let’s continue to refine what’s working instead of dismantling a system that is finally moving in the right direction. 
Education is not a marketplace — it’s a promise. And that promise belongs to every child in Mississippi.

Attorney General Dave Sunday announced seven people have been charged with violations of the Election Code and Voter Registration Law and related offenses stemming from an investigation that started in Lancaster County last October. Sunday took office in January.
Guillermo Sainz, 33, of Sierra Vista, Arizona, was charged with three counts of soliciting registrations, which is a misdemeanor violation of the Election Code regarding offering financial incentives for achieving registration quotas. Sainz worked as director of a company’s registration drive efforts in Pennsylvania, the Attorney General’s Office said. It did not identify the company in a news release.

Also charged are Amos Clay, Anya McCurdy, Meghan McDevitt, Richard Perez and Samantha Szukiewicz. Each is charged with felony tampering with public records and unsworn falsification, forgery and two crimes under the state’s Elections Code and Voter Registration law, all misdemeanors. Szukiewicz is also charged with identity theft.
Court documents detailing the charges were still being processed Friday afternoon, according to an official at the district court in Lancaster County where the charges were filed.
“We are confident that the motive behind these crimes was personal financial gain, and not a conspiracy or organized effort to tip any election for any one candidate or party,” Sunday said. “Pennsylvanians should have peace of mind that the election process worked in this case.”
Election workers in Lancaster County flagged about 2,500 applications last year that appeared to have the same handwriting and were filled out on the same day. Some of the applications were for previously registered voters and the signatures on the documents did not match those the county had on file, Lancaster County District Attorney Heather Adams said at the time.
Officials in Berks, York and Monroe counties also noticed inconsistencies in voter registration forms submitted shortly before the Nov. 3, 2024, election. While county election offices processed the forms and found some legitimate registrations, a significant number were rejected because the information could not be verified as belonging to real people, the Attorney General’s Office said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
The Attorney General’s Office reviewed several thousand forms and interviewed people across the state and country in collaboration with officials from the Berks, Lancaster, and York counties. It also assisted with a similar prosecution by the Monroe County District Attorney’s Office.
“The Office of Attorney General determined that the crimes were not motivated by efforts to sway any election or voter rolls for any specific party or candidate. Rather, the charged defendants were motivated to maintain employment and income by reaching quotas,” the Attorney General’s Office release said. “The voter registration forms collected by Sainz’s operation included all party affiliations.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_0679-1024x696.jpg,,,2025-10-24 14:57:19.695375
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-24 18:33:15+00:00,CT Mirror,Mimi Torres-García case prompts lawmakers to mull policy change,Ginny Monk and Laura Tillman,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/24/new-britain-girl-death-dcf-policy-changes/,Her case sparked debate about changes to the way DCF confirms children’s identities during interviews and whether it has enough resources.,"The case of an 11-year-old found dead earlier this month in a plastic storage container involves circumstances that the state Department of Children and Families has “rarely, if ever,” seen before, the interim commissioner said Thursday.
Those circumstances now have legislators talking about whether the agency has enough resources and considering potential changes to state law regarding the way DCF confirms children’s identities during interviews.
Jacqueline “Mimi” Torres-García was severely abused and starved. Her mother, aunt and her mother’s boyfriend have all been charged in connection to her death. DCF had a history with the family, and in January of this year responded to a report about maltreatment of Torres-García’s younger sister.
When DCF staff conducted their investigation, they were told that Torres-García was being homeschooled out of state and would return, although the date initially provided by the family to caseworkers for her return changed. DCF staff then had a video call with a child who Karla García, Torres-García’s mother, said was her daughter, DCF interim Commissioner Susan Hamilton said. 
But court documents show that Torres-García died in September 2024, months before DCF staff had the video call with the girl who posed as her.
“The circumstances in this case outlined well-orchestrated efforts by adults, one rarely if ever seen before in our Agency, to conceal the whereabouts of a child by being intentionally deceptive and producing a completely different child to pose as the child in question,” Hamilton said in a statement.
Gov. Ned Lamont said Thursday that state agencies, including the Office of the Child Advocate, are working together with law enforcement to find out what happened.
“We’re doing everything we can, no stone unturned,”  he said. “I’m not sure it was dereliction. I think you had a parent, some family members, that tried to cover up a crime.”
The video call wasn’t standard practice, but the agency made an exception because the child was out of state and wasn’t the one who had reportedly experienced maltreatment, Hamilton said in her statement.
“They made an exception, and we have this terrible outcome,” said Children’s Committee ranking member Sen. Jason Perillo, R-Shelton. “I don’t think that’s acceptable. We put policies and practices in place to keep people safe, and we follow them. Failure to do that is absolutely unacceptable.”
DCF policy is to conduct visits in-person, Hamilton said.
“We don’t have virtual visits with clients,” she said previously at a public meeting.
Asked Thursday about the well-being of the child who was made to pretend to be Torres-García, Lamont said he didn’t know, although it appeared he had been briefed on the details of the case.
“I don’t know the answer to that, except that that kid was looking pretty good in the video,” he said with a chuckle. A spokesperson from his office said the governor has not watched the video.
The agency recently implemented a policy change that requires staff to ask for photo identification of adults involved in investigations, and that policy will be formalized in policy books soon, Hamilton said.
“Through the engagement process with the parents or guardians, we interview all children in the household, relying on parental or guardian identification because children under the age of sixteen do not typically possess photo identification,” Hamilton said.
Children’s Committee co-chair Sen. Ceci Maher, D-Wilton, said she’s considering legislation for next session that would require DCF to maintain photos of all children involved in the system so they can be identified.
She said she’s also considering measures that would prevent anyone convicted of child abuse from moving into a home where children live after they have been released from prison on parole. In the Torres-García case, her aunt, Jackelyn García, had been convicted of risk of injury to a child and been incarcerated for 18 months. 
Jackelyn García appeared to be living with Torres-García’s family and has been charged in connection to her death.
“What are the policy pieces we can put in place to make sure that we are looking at things holistically to see not just immediate fixes, but a bigger picture?” Maher said.
DCF dealt with this case in the face of staff turnover challenges, an issue that exists at child welfare jurisdictions across the country. Online data shows that the agency has about 2,800 full-time employees, a drop from closer to 3,000 during the last gubernatorial administration.
“Social Work is a ‘calling’ and our staff are often immersed in some of the most complex forms of violence, child maltreatment, and family dynamics in our communities as part of their daily job functions and responsibilities,” Hamilton said in her statement. “As such, the work may result in extreme emotional, psychological and physical challenges for our employees.”
DCF has tried to improve turnover rates with internal office support, an Employee Assistance program that offers counseling, an Employee of the Month program, mentoring and training, among other initiatives.
At a recent conference in which DCF employees met to brainstorm strategies for improving challenges at the agency, Hamilton also spoke about the issue of worker turnover.
“We do pay. We do what we can to pay to attract people. The work is hard, no matter what. But we do have to, as a system, figure out ways to retain people. Because we’re putting a lot of effort, training and support in that first year,” Hamilton said. Although she didn’t have the numbers she said “people are deciding to leave after a year, and then you have to sort of start over.” 
At that conference, DCF employees also discussed the severity and complexity of their cases post-COVID pandemic. They said that the caseloads of workers is not the best metric for the amount of work they are doing, because the complexity of cases has risen significantly. 
Sarah Eagan, executive director of the Center for Children’s Advocacy and a former child advocate, said staff turnover has been “a dominant concern,” for DCF over the past few years.
She added that the conversation should be about DCF resources and whether there are enough services for families. Other systems, including Torres-García’s legal representation in her custody case, should be considered, she said.
Children’s Committee co-chair Rep. Corey Paris, D-Stamford, said staff turnover and caseworker loads is something he’s having conversations about, although he didn’t disclose details of legislative proposals he’s considered.
“I am thinking of a number of things, of how we might be able to better position and enable DCF with more resources and with better oversight to better run their agency,” Paris said.
Paris wants to see more of the facts of the case before he makes decisions about legislative proposals, but there is a “history here with other cases that we can point to in terms of how we need to focus on procedural and policy changes.”
Children’s Committee ranking member Rep. Anne Dauphinais, R-Killingly, said she’s also not ready to make decisions or advocate for legislation until she has all the facts, but that she thinks DCF has an “astronomical number” of staff.
“I think until we actually lay eyes on all of those reports, we’re not going to really be able to, I think, make any suggestions or kind of come up with any conclusions of where this all went and what went wrong,” Dauphinais said.
She added that she doesn’t want to see solutions that introduce too much government involvement in people’s lives.
“I don’t think anybody wants big government oversight over themselves merely because some individuals have created some horrific crimes, but we want to make sure that the agencies in place are doing their jobs correctly,” she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/90-1024x683.webp,,,2025-10-24 14:57:19.695375

Pictured, from left, is Nic Few and Christian Kitchens (photo by Jon Gitchoff).“Man, don’t let them put you back in there.” 
Oshoosi Size is living with his older brother, Ogun, after being released from prison.
Ogun wants his little brother to get his life together and stay out of trouble. That’s not easy to do with a criminal record — even if you don’t do anything wrong.
The Brothers Size, running at the St. Louis Repertory Theater, is a funny, beautiful, painful play about young men trying to get by. It feels innovative and urgent, despite being written 20 years ago by Tarell Alvin McCraney, Academy Award-winning writer of Moonlight. It’s set in the Louisiana bayou, but all I could think about was Missouri.
Too little has changed for formerly incarcerated people since the play was written. There was a moment during the first Trump administration when Republicans, Democrats and faith leaders worked together on criminal justice reform. That moment ended without a true reckoning on mass incarceration in this country and its terrible ripple effects. 
Now, we’ve entered a “tough on crime” era where anything and anyone can be criminalized. Still, there are bipartisan, achievable steps that we can take to make things a little bit better at the state level.
Sandra Keely is the founder of 3 Daughters and 1,000 Sons, a St. Louis organization that runs free legal clinics and connects people with low-cost legal services to get their criminal records expunged. Keely also works on criminal justice reform in Missouri more broadly, inspired by her brother’s incarceration.
“When one person is in jail, the whole family is in jail,” she says.
Keely never went to law school, but she’s an expert in Missouri law. 
“Poverty has its benefits,” she told me of her self-acquired legal education. “Because I had poverty, I couldn’t afford an attorney. I looked for any way to glean information.”
Keely can tell you how to navigate the Missouri court system, specifically, how to represent yourself pro se (that is, without a lawyer). She can tell you how to handle a divorce or real estate issue pro se, but her focus is on criminal justice. Her organization is named for the fact that she’s the mother of three daughters, but also considers herself mother to thousands of men in the criminal justice system. She wants them to have a real chance at a new life when they get out.
Having a record of a conviction, or even an arrest that never led to charges, can keep a person  from finding work, housing or accessing food benefits. Those kinds of obstacles increase recidivism. If you can’t take care of yourself or your family, you’re more likely to commit further crimes, especially crimes of poverty.
Jerika White’s brother was convicted of multiple felonies as a teenager because he was in possession of a gun when his friend shoplifted. White is now the criminal justice policy manager at Empower Missouri, where she leads the campaign to pass Clean Slate legislation, which would automate the process for eligible individuals to have their records expunged. 
Clean Slate has had bipartisan bill sponsors and support. But it hasn’t made it across the finish line in the last several legislative sessions. It’s a pretty small ask — the bill doesn’t expand who is eligible for expungement, a group limited to those who have committed particular non-violent and non-sexual offenses, who have completed their sentences and not re-offended for a set number of years. 
It doesn’t help people whose records are on paper, rather than electronic. It doesn’t help people convicted of multiple felonies, though it’s typical to charge multiple felonies for one incident. 
What the bill would do is take what is already a right on paper in Missouri and make it a reality. There are over half a million Missourians who qualify for expungement under our current law, but only an estimated 1% of them succeed in having their records cleared. The petition process is complicated and lawyers are expensive.  
It makes more sense for the state to use the information it already possesses to automatically clear eligible records than to expect half a million people, many of them living in poverty, to hire lawyers in order to have the second chances they are entitled to under the law.
The only objections to the bill have involved concerns about administrability. This is a concern I take seriously given Missouri’s ongoing failure to administer public benefits in accordance with the law. But the bill that will be re-introduced this session allocates funding for technology upgrades and has generous implementation deadlines.
They teach you in criminal law 101 that there are four reasons we incarcerate people: incapacitation, deterrence, rehabilitation and retribution. We are currently taking people who aren’t dangerous and don’t need to be incapacitated, who have every reason to be deterred by their past excessive punishments, and we are making their rehabilitation impossible. 
The ball and chain that we force formerly incarcerated people who have served their time to carry is ongoing and unjustifiable retribution.
The Brothers Size is not a play about the law. It’s about the bond between siblings. But the plot turns on a brother’s assumption that his former felon brother will not be treated fairly. 
It’s a fair assumption. 
In Missouri, we can take a step towards letting people who have done their time truly have a chance to be free.

(Courtesy of Scott Lopez)With growing energy demands in New Mexico for developments ranging from housing to data centers, a new advocacy group posits nuclear power as a solution.
The New Mexico Nuclear Alliance, a registered trade industry group promoting nuclear power, will make its official debut Friday afternoon before lawmakers at an interim Science, Technology and Telecommunications committee meeting in Las Cruces.
Founder Scott Lopez started the New Mexico Nuclear Alliance in July. A former marine and longtime investor and business consultant, Lopez doesn’t have a background in nuclear power, but says he has “dozens of family members” from his hometown in Española either working or retired from nearby Los Alamos National Laboratory.
Lopez told Source NM he was “driven to start the alliance” after moderating a panel discussion on nuclear power by officials from LANL; Urenco, the uranium processing facility; and Kairos Power, a start-up planning to construct a testing laboratory in Albuquerque, during last May’s two-day New Mexico Energy Policy Symposium.
“We realized there was no trade association, there was not the kind of voice, so to speak, to advocate for work on policy, economic development  for New Mexico’s nuclear industry, which is cradle-to-grave in the life cycle,” Lopez said.
He said the group’s vision is not “big stack Three-Mile Island or or Palo Verde type nuclear reactors,” but smaller reactors that are still in the testing or design process that he hopes will be “commercially viable and available” within a decade.
Lopez said the alliance has no plans to back legislation in the 2026 session. However, he said the group would consider supporting a bill similar to a Colorado law, HB25-1040, signed by Gov. Jared Polis in 2025, which redefines nuclear as a “clean energy resource” because it doesn’t release emissions that drive climate change.
Since the start of the year, the Trump administration has initiated plans to accelerate nuclear power production, and launched proposals to fasttrack new uranium mines in New Mexico, despite roadblocks from states; objections from tribal and environmental groups; and ongoing cleanup for abandoned mines.
Lopez said the New Mexico Nuclear Alliance supports new uranium mining, as long as there’s tribal consultation, but also funding for “funding, monitoring, and long-term reclamation,” from legacy mines. The Nuclear Alliance, he said, has a “moral obligation to acknowledge the legacy,” of uranium mining for nuclear power on New Mexico’s Pueblos and tribes.
“By cleaning up, doing right by our tribal communities that have uranium legacy issues is core to what the Nuclear Alliance believes in and will support,” Lopez said.

(Photo via Google Earth)The administrator of an Iowa nursing home that dumped an alleged rape victim at a homeless shelter after evicting her from the care facility will be allowed to keep her license, a state board has ruled.
State officials say Amanda Nobles, the former administrator of Correctionville Specialty Care, accused the alleged rape victim of paying for sex before the woman was evicted from the home and dropped off at a homeless shelter with no notice and no medical records.
The nursing home employee who the resident accused of rape was the focus of sexual-impropriety complaints at two other Iowa care facilities. He was later convicted of sexual exploitation of a minor in a separate incident.

In July 2025, the Iowa Board of Nursing Home Administrators charged Nobles with violating an unspecified state or federal regulation or law related to practice of the profession of nursing home administration. Recently, Nobles and the board agreed to resolve the disciplinary case with a settlement agreement and final order that doesn’t disclose the nature of any of the alleged violations.
The public order indicates only that while Nobles was working as the nursing home administrator at Dunlap Specialty Care from October 2022 to January 2023, and at Correctionville Specialty Care from August 2023 to November 2023, the facilities were cited for unspecified “deficiencies, some of which were attributable” to Nobles.
As part of the settlement agreement, the board has allowed Nobles to keep her license subject to two years of probation. She will also be required to complete 10 hours of educational training on ethics and nursing home administration.
The agreement notes that Nobles “does not admit to any wrongdoing but agrees to enter into this settlement agreement to avoid the cost and uncertainty of a contested case hearing.”
Alleged rape victim evicted from facility
State inspection records and court filings show that in November 2023, the Correctionville home was cited for an incident in which a female resident of the home alleged that a staff member, Martell Guider, sent her a video of himself masturbating and then sexually assaulted her by forcing her to perform oral sex inside his car in the facility’s parking lot.
Guider was also accused of accepting money from the woman as payment for cigarettes he procured for her.

According to the inspectors’ written reports, the administrator of the home — which would have been Nobles, according to state inspectors and licensing board records — reported that after she saw evidence of the electronic payment from the resident to Guider, she “confronted” the resident and “accused” her of providing sexual favors to the employee in return for cigarettes — an allegation the resident denied.
According to the inspectors, the alleged victim of the sexual assault was “very upset by the allegations,” stating that she “would never do anything so vile.”
After the woman reported the alleged rape, Correctionville Specialty Care evicted the woman from the facility and dropped her off at a homeless shelter with no notice to the shelter and with no medical records, according to state inspectors.
Guider, a state-certified nursing assistant, was fired from the Correctionville home, but state inspectors say the facility’s parent company, Care Initiatives of West Des Moines, continued to provide work for him in other Iowa nursing homes that it operates.
Guider was never criminally charged in the Correctionville case. He was, however, criminally charged for his conduct while working at Kalona’s Pleasantview Home in 2024.
Allegations made at Audubon and Kalona homes
According to police and prosecutors, officials at Pleasantview Home confronted Guider sometime in January 2024 after multiple employees raised concerns that he was being inappropriate with a 17-year-old minor who was present at the home but not a resident.
Police allege that after his supervisors talked to him about the complaints, Guider shared an explicit photo of the minor with his employer. According to the police, Guider had threatened the minor to induce her to send him the photos via the social-messaging platform Snapchat.
Guider was charged with sexual exploitation of a minor by causing the minor to engage in a sex act, sexual exploitation through the use of photographs, possession of material depicting a minor engaged in sex, and first-degree harassment.
A jury convicted Guider of sexual exploitation by causing the minor to engage in a sex act. He was acquitted of the remaining charges and was sentenced to five years of probation.
In April 2023, prior to working at either the Correctionville or Kalona homes, Guider was working at Audubon’s Friendship Home when a female colleague filed a complaint with the state inspections department and police, alleging Guider had been making suggestive remarks to female coworkers, sent them photos of himself masturbating, had recorded video of one worker as she provided care for a resident, and had invited some of his female colleagues out to his car where he kept a bottle of Seagram’s Crown Royal.
Audubon police later acknowledged they didn’t pursue the matter, and the state inspections department acknowledged it rejected the complaint it had received, saying the situation was best addressed by management since it didn’t impact resident care.
Nobles has been an Iowa-licensed nursing home administrator for at least eight years. Some Board of Nursing Home Administrators records indicate she was granted her license in August 2009, while other board records give the date as March 2017.

These amounts beef up low Medicaid reimbursements.,"3 Gary Marchand talks about the state of the hospital on Wednesday, Sept. 20, 2023. Credit: Eric Shelton/Mississippi Today

Greenwood Leflore Hospital, plagued by financial hardship for years, saw a bright spot this spring when it was selected for a new federal payment status. But a dispute with Mississippi Medicaid could jeopardize the public Greenwood hospital’s ability to keep services open if a resolution is not reached, its leader says. 
“Access to services will be reduced for residents of the central Delta region,” Interim CEO Gary Marchand told Mississippi Today. He said no decisions about service changes have been made yet. 
The Mississippi Division of Medicaid informed the hospital in June it is recouping $5.5 million overpaid last year to Greenwood Leflore Hospital in state-directed payments, Marchand said. These amounts beef up low Medicaid reimbursements. The payments were high because they were calculated using old data, which did not take into account the hospital shuttering its labor and delivery and intensive care units in 2022. 
The amount is not insignificant. The hospital’s total operating expenses were $74.7 million in the 2023 fiscal year, according to an audit performed that year. 
Mississippi Medicaid has withheld $2 million so far this year and will continue recovering payments at a rate of $900,000 a quarter beginning in December, Marchand wrote in an Oct. 20 memo sent to hospital employees and board members. 
“Supplemental payments withheld to date along with the scheduled quarterly Recoupments will place a significant strain on hospital operations,” Marchand warned. 
Additionally, the hospital’s Medicaid tax assessments should have been lower to reflect the reduced service levels, which could have offset about half of the total recoupment, he added.
Greenwood Leflore Hospital proposed several options for repayment to the Division of Medicaid that would buy it time to first begin receiving higher payments for Medicare patients, said the memo. The anticipated larger payments are the result of the hospital’s acceptance to the federal Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program, which allows selected hospitals to be reimbursed based on their actual costs for inpatient care instead of a fixed amount. The higher payments are expected to begin by the end of the year and retroactively reimburse services provided since May 1. 
Next month, the hospital will begin providing skilled nursing care for people recovering after hospital stays, but will not begin receiving the higher payments for these services until late 2026. 
The Division of Medicaid advised the hospital in September that it did not agree with the solutions proposed by the hospital, Marchand said in the memo. On Oct. 9, the hospital appealed the decision and requested an administrative hearing on the matter, which has not yet been scheduled. 
The Division of Medicaid did not respond to a request for comment. 
Greenwood Leflore is one of 30 hospitals overpaid a total of $48 million during the state’s 2024 fiscal year, Marchand said.
Greenwood Mayor Kendrick Cox said he has been working with state and federal lawmakers to resolve the dispute. 
“We desperately need our hospital,” he said. “… There’s a lot of people in our community that aren’t financially able to transport themselves or their relatives to other towns or states for health care services.”  
The state-directed payments helped to stabilize Greenwood Leflore’s finances after it was forced to close valued services. But now, the closure of those services could put others at risk, and the new payment model hasn’t yet provided the relief it’s expected to. 
This is just one piece of what Brock Slabach, chief operations officer of the National Rural Health Association, called the “brutal mix of issues” that rural hospitals, which often have low patient volumes and high overhead costs, face when trying to break even.
“These are different environments than some of our larger, urban facilities,” he said.  
Rural hospitals across the U.S. are struggling. Over half of Mississippi’s rural hospitals are at risk of closure or have experienced losses on services, according to a recent report from the Center for Healthcare Quality & Payment Reform.  
Greenwood Leflore Hospital serves approximately 300,000 patients in the Mississippi Delta, a region of the state with limited access to medical care, according to its website. The 35-bed hospital operates a physician-staffed emergency room and offers general, vascular and outpatient orthopedic surgery, cancer care and a full suite of diagnostic services. 
The hospital has faced a litany of financial challenges over the past several years. Before the COVID-19 pandemic began, the hospital was losing $7 to 9 million a year, Marchand previously told Mississippi Today.
The pandemic only worsened the hospital’s precarious financial condition. To keep its doors open, the hospital shut down departments and clinics, went up for lease multiple times, drew down millions of dollars in credit, applied for grants from the state Legislature, and pursued a more lucrative hospital designation. In 2023, the hospital suspended the use of 173 beds to control costs, according to an audit. 
Marchand, who will step down at the end of the year, repeatedly warned local leaders and state lawmakers that the hospital was on the verge of closure. 
To become more financially secure, the facility vied in 2023 to be designated a critical access hospital. These facilities are reimbursed by Medicare at a rate of 101%, theoretically allowing for a 1% profit. But its initial application was denied because critical access hospitals must be located 35 miles from the nearest hospital, and South Sunflower County Hospital in Indianola is closer, at 28 miles away. 
Greenwood Leflore was one of three hospitals in the state chosen for the Rural Community Hospital Demonstration Program in April. 
Democratic U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson called the designation a “meaningful victory” in a statement.

“For far too long, rural hospitals have operated at a disadvantage, being underfunded, understaffed, and overburdened,” he wrote. “This program is a step toward leveling the playing field.” 
The program’s payment model can help stabilize rural hospitals, but it only increases reimbursements for inpatient care — even though many hospitals are seeing higher outpatient volumes, said Slabach.
And the reimbursement challenges rural hospitals face are worsened by workforce shortages, since rural hospitals often have to offer higher pay to attract providers — money they don’t have due to low reimbursement rates.
“It’s a vicious circle,” Slabach said. 
State-directed payments like those recouped from Greenwood Leflore Hospital, which were championed by Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, have been a vital source of cash for Mississippi’s struggling rural hospitals, especially in a state that has gone a decade without expanding Medicaid.
But those payments are set to be reduced over time beginning in 2028 as a result of federal cuts to Medicaid included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act signed by President Donald Trump in July. 
Mississippi is expected to receive at least $500 million over the next five years as a part of a major federal investment meant to offset the cuts’ impact on funding for rural health care. States must submit applications for the funding to the federal government by Nov. 5. 
The funding aims to strengthen access to health care by investing in lasting improvements to preventive medicine, collaboration between health care facilities, workforce development and innovations in care and technology.
“It could well be a lifeline for a lot of hospitals that are struggling,” said Harold Miller, the director of the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform.

(Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate-Pool)Louisiana political leaders are preparing to use around $150 million monthly in state funding to help continue food assistance benefits while the federal government shutdown in Washington D.C. continues, Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said Friday. 

“I mean, it’s a choice between using money that we have or people going hungry,” Henry said in an interview. “That’s why we have the fund balances that we have.” 

Gov. Jeff Landry issued an executive order Friday helping the state to cover the costs of food assistance for most, but not all, of the people enrolled in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, for a short period of time. Legislators also plan to approve an “urgent request” that will allow state money to be released for the program next week. 

Landry’s order is more restrictive than what Henry said lawmakers are willing to support. It only extends benefits to children, elderly and disabled people – but not other adults in the program – for a short period of time, from Nov. 1-4.  

The legislators want to preserve SNAP benefits for everyone who is already enrolled in the program for multiple months if necessary, according to the Senate President. 
In Louisiana, 793,000 people receive SNAP benefits that help them purchase food every month. Landry’s executive order only covers 565,000 of those people. 

Henry said it’s not clear yet whether the state will be able to find enough money in the short term to avoid a break in benefits for everyone who receives SNAP assistance, but that is the goal of the legislative leaders.
A priority is to ensure seniors and people with disabilities who are enrolled in the program – and receive their benefits on the first of the month before others – see no delay, he said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

Louisiana will be paying for the food assistance to continue, even if the federal government doesn’t reimburse the state for its missed months of service. Henry said it could require the state to dip into its savings accounts, and he added Republicans and Democrats have agreed they are willing to do so. 

“We are sending a clear message that the people of Louisiana are the priority,” said Sen. Gerald Boudreaux, D-Lafayette, head of the Senate Democratic Caucus, agreeing with Henry. 

The House will vote on the urgent request Friday and the Senate will take it up on Wednesday, Henry said.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Supreme Court upheld the disbarment Friday of a former Dodge County Attorney who was convicted of misusing his authority, three drunken offenses and found to have stalked the boyfriend of his estranged wife.
Oliver Glass, who resigned as Dodge County Attorney in 2021 after 10 years in office, had argued that the permanent loss of his license to practice law was excessive. Glass admitted that he had violated his oath of office and rules as a practicing attorney but sought a suspension of his license and the opportunity to practice law eventually.
But the Supreme Court, in its ruling, upheld the recommendation of the Counsel for Discipline that Glass lose his license.
The court pointed out that lawyers who are in public office are held to a higher standard than attorneys in private practice and that Glass had a third drunken driving offense in July 2024 while on probation for misusing his office.
His case generated several stories in the Omaha World-Herald, and his legal and drinking problems were detailed in the court’s order on Friday.
In 2018, his wife filed for a legal separation. Glass, upon learning that she was dating another man in 2020, looked up the boyfriend’s criminal record in a national database that is supposed to be used only for official law enforcement purposes.
Glass enlisted other attorneys in his office and local law enforcement personnel to also look up the boyfriend’s record. Glass also began surveilling the homes of the boyfriend and his estranged wife and sending threatening social media messages to the boyfriend.
In 2021, Glass resigned from office after a second DUI arrest, and his law license was suspended — a suspension that remained in effect into 2025. In addition, he was indicted by federal prosecutors for cyberstalking the ex-wife’s boyfriend.
He struck a plea bargain and pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in federal court, which resulted in a 9 month prison term as well as supervised release. Prosecutors noted that the “weaponization of law enforcement and criminal investigations for personal benefit” by Glass had undermined “respect for the law.”
The Supreme Court, in a 13-page opinion, said the case generated negative publicity for the practice of law and “endangered public confidence in the legal profession and the justice system.”
The court agreed with a referee’s conclusion that there was a need to deter other attorneys from similar conduct and that a permanent disbarment was warranted.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-24 17:13:36+00:00,CT Mirror,State prosecutors investigating Bridgeport city councilman again,Andrew Brown,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/24/bridgeport-absentee-ballots-alfredo-castillo/,State officials are investigating a claim that Bridgeport city councilman Alfredo Castillo improperly collected absentee ballots this month.,"State officials are once again investigating Bridgeport city councilman Alfredo Castillo for allegedly collecting absentee ballots from public housing facilities ahead of the city’s general election next month. 
The State Elections Enforcement Commission voted this week to refer two recent complaints about Castillo to state prosecutors for potential criminal charges.
The complaints were filed by Jazmin Cooper, who is the daughter of Bridgeport city councilwoman Eneida Martinez, and they accused Castillo and three other political operatives of “manipulating voters” and illegally taking possession of absentee ballots, which is a felony in Connecticut. 
Cooper, who is deeply involved in Bridgeport’s politics, accused Castillo of taking possession of a voter’s absentee ballot at the Crescent Crossings housing complex, and she alleged that she personally witnessed Castillo stuff several absentee ballots into the front pocket of his hooded sweatshirt at the Harborview Towers, another public housing facility, on Oct. 11.
“I personally watched and recorded Alfredo stuff ballots in his sweater,” Cooper wrote. “He then disposed of them then came back at night to finish his job of [harvesting] ballots from voters.”
“He was going to units and sending them down to their mailbox to retrieve their ballots, had them sign and he did the rest,” Cooper wrote. 
Cooper also accused Castillo, who previously worked for Park City Communities, Bridgeport’s public housing authority, of using an old badge in order to gain access to the public housing facilities and its residents. 
“Alfredo Castillo has been using his housing authority HUD badge from years ago … and using it to impersonate a HUD worker,” one complaint said.
Cooper provided state officials with videos and photographs of Castillo outside the public housing facilities with a sweatshirt on, but the images don’t show Castillo handling ballots.
Castillo, who is already facing more than 30 criminal charges involving abuse of the state’s absentee ballot system during Bridgeport’s 2019 and 2023 elections, declined through his attorney to comment on the latest complaints.
Meanwhile, some of the other political operatives whom Cooper accused of assisting Castillo denied that they ever interacted with voters at the Crescent Crossings and Harborview Towers.
Tony Barr, who is the chairman of Bridgeport’s New Movement Party, said he did go to Harborview Towers, but he said it was to meet up with a friend.
And Wilfredo Martinez, the chairman of Bridgeport’s Independent Party, who is running for a city council seat, said he had never even been to the Crescent Crossings property.
“If they want to waste their time filing SEEC complaints, they can,” Martinez said. 
Ismael Sanchez, the fourth political operative named in the complaint, could not be reached for comment.
The new election complaints highlight the combative nature of Bridgeport’s municipal politics, even during off-year election years when there isn’t a citywide race for mayor.
This year’s general election in Bridgeport features several races for city council as well as a referendum on whether the city should change its charter to eliminate the local sheriff offices and allow the mayor to appoint the town and city clerk. 
Both of the public housing facilities that are cited in the complaint are in Bridgeport’s 137th district, where Bridgeport’s city council chairwoman Aidee Nieves is facing a general election challenge from Martinez and Sanchez.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025_0909_SR_BridgeportBallotHearing_041-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-24 13:17:02.975456

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)A heavy hitter in municipal financing has been tapped to help close the sale of Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital.
The Rhode Island Health and Educational Building Corp., the quasi-public agency issuing the debt on behalf of buyer The Centurion Foundation, brought on Bank of America this week to co-manage the bond sale, according to Christopher Hunter, an agency spokesperson. The update was first reported by WPRI-TV 12.
Centurion, an Atlanta-based nonprofit, has struggled to lure investors to back the $150 million in taxable and tax-exempt bonds needed to buy the pair of safety-net urban hospitals. Already, Rhode Island Attorney Peter Neronha, who reviewed the transaction under the state’s Hospital Conversations Act, has eased up on the conditions imposed on the deal four times to make it easier for Centurion to finalize its purchase. 
As the nation’s largest underwriter of municipal bonds, Bank of America was brought on to assist Barclay’s, the existing bond underwriter, to market the bonds to inventors, Hunter told the Rhode Island Current in a text message Thursday night. And, now the bond will move from a limited public offering to private placement, a move that further limits the investor pool but avoids more stringent federal registration and regulation requirements.
“A private placement will allow additional flexibility in marketing and selling the bonds to a group of highly specialized investors,” Hunter said.
Bank of America was one of eight companies that responded to the Rhode Island Health and Educational Building Corp’s request for proposals seeking manager and co-manager for Centurion’s bond financing, according to Oct. 16, 2024 meeting minutes. Barclays, another respondent, was chosen as the senior manager for the bond issue at the same meeting, while an option for a co-manager was deferred, with the agency’s executive director empowered to make a decision. 
Hunter said Friday that identities of the other companies that submitted proposals could not be shared without a formal public records request. Rhode Island Current submitted the records request Friday morning.
Executive Director Dylan Zelazo told the board at its meeting on Thursday that he had brought on Bank of America to serve as co-senior managing underwriter for the bonds. There was no discussion of the decision, Hunter said. A recording of the meeting was not immediately available.
A spokesperson for Bank of America’s Global Markets segment, which oversees municipal banking and investments, did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment.
The bonds were previously scheduled to close by Oct. 31, after multiple delays and changes to the terms of the transaction. Now, that deadline has been pushed back, although a new date has not been set, Otis Brown, a spokesperson for CharterCARE Health of Rhode Island, Centurion’s Rhode Island subsidiary, said in an email Friday morning.
“Centurion’s commitment to complete the sale has not changed,” Brown said.
Nor have the underlying financial and economic factors that are making it difficult to sell the bonds in the first place.
S&P Global Ratings Agency noted “significant uncertainty” in the financial and operational performance of Centurion’s bonds in a March 25 ratings assessment, giving the bonds a BB- rating which denotes relatively high-risk for a non-investment grade bond. The rating was affirmed by S&P in August.
The unfavorable credit assessment largely reflects the status of the hospitals’ current owner, Prospect Medical Holdings, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in January. The LA-based hospital chain operator’s mismanagement of its hospitals is well-documented, largely attributed to former majority stakeholder Leonard Green, a private equity that drained the accounts of health care facilities nationwide to pay out investors and executives, according to a U.S. Senate Budget Committee report in January. 
Roger Williams and Fatima remain on the brink, posting a $60 million operating loss for fiscal 2023 with projections for multimillion-dollar losses in fiscal 2024, alongside staffing and equipment shortages and safety problems posed by overdue infrastructure repairs. 
And the bleak financial forecast doesn’t account for federal spending cuts, which are expected to hurt hospitals nationwide by reducing Medicaid enrollment and curtailing state aid and tax breaks.
Yet proponents of the sale insist Centurion is the only hope for keeping the critical health care services from closing — an outcome that would add even more strain to the state’s fragile health care landscape.
The two hospitals in Providence and North Providence, with 500 beds between them, account for more than 50,000 emergency room visits per year. Together they have 104 beds for behavioral health patients, representing more than 20% of behavioral health beds available statewide, and employ 2,700 people.
“The Attorney General understands that Centurion continues to work to close the deal, but believes that it must happen very soon to ensure that the plan endorsed by the bankruptcy court is not upended,” Tim Rondeau, a spokesperson for Neronha’s office, said in an emailed response Friday.
The return to nonprofit status under Centurion could let hospitals recoup donations given to a charitable foundation formerly tied to the facilities. Earlier this month, CharterCARE Health asked the similarly named, but distinct, Chartercare Foundation for a “return” of donations that were intended to support the hospitals. The two entities were initially linked, but separated in 2014 when Prospect bought the hospitals, shifting them from nonprofits to for-profit entities no longer able to accept tax-exempt charitable foundations. 
Paula Iacono, the executive director for Chartercare Foundation, said previously that the foundation’s board of directors would consider the request at an unscheduled time. Iacono did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday.

Connecticut relies entirely on imported natural gas because the state has no natural gas reserves or production. 
Connecticut’s electric power sector alone used a record amount of natural gas in 2023, accounting for nearly 60% of total state generation.
Nearly all natural gas consumed in Connecticut comes from out-of-state sources, primarily the Appalachian region, including Pennsylvania, as well as the U.S. Gulf Coast, Canada, and the Mid-Continent region. The gas enters the state through three main interstate pipeline systems: Algonquin, Iroquois, and Tennessee, with almost all supplies passing through New York before reaching Connecticut. 
Local utilities, including Connecticut Natural Gas, Southern Connecticut Gas, and Eversource, distribute the fuel to homes, businesses, and power plants via over 60 city gate stations. The state also lacks underground storage, relying on nearby states to meet peak winter demand, making imported natural gas critical for Connecticut’s energy needs.

Gretchen Whitmer in the Michigan Court of Claims to argue for the unconstitutionality of a so-called “Pregnancy Exclusion” in state law that determines a person’s right to choose their end-of-life care. 
The lawsuit specifically concerns the Michigan Estates and Protected Individuals Code, which dictates the process for designating a patient advocate, who can determine a person’s medical care if they are not able to do so themselves. However, pregnancy creates an exception to this. 
“A patient advocate cannot make a medical treatment decision under [state law] to withhold or withdraw treatment from a pregnant patient that would result in the pregnant patient’s death,” the statute reads. 
Filed on Thursday, the lawsuit alleges that the statute is a violation of due process rights and of equal protection for pregnant people, as well as freedom of speech rights. 
The lawsuit, filed by Compassion Legal: The End-of-Life Justice Center at Compassion & Choices; If/When/How: Lawyering for Reproductive Justice; Perkins Coie LLP; and Mogill & Lemanski, PLLC, also argues that this goes against Michigan’s constitutional protections for reproductive freedom, which includes “the right to make and effectuate decisions about all matters relating to pregnancy.”
“Denying individuals the right to refuse treatment because they are pregnant is fundamentally at odds with the Michigan Constitution,” said Jess Pezley, senior staff attorney at Compassion Legal, in a press release. 
Stacey LaRouche, a press secretary for Whitmer, wrote to the Advance in response to the suit, “Governor Whitmer has been a champion for reproductive freedom, and led the fight to protect and expand our rights following the repeal of Roe v. Wade, when other states did nothing. We cannot comment on pending litigation, but will be following this closely.”
Dr. Viktoria Koskenoja, an Emergency Medicine Physician in Skandia, Mich., and her husband, Sam Holcomb, are both plaintiffs in the case. Koskenoja designated Holcomb as her patient advocate, should she ever not be capable of making her own medical decisions — and included directions around potential pregnancy in her guidance to him. 
“I made the decision to include them anyway because I felt so strongly that my ability to control my own medical care shouldn’t depend on my pregnancy status,” she said in the press release, despite her lawyer encouraging her not to. 
“When I agreed to become my wife’s patient advocate, I made a commitment to speak for her if she could not speak for herself, and honor her most personal decisions,” Holcomb added.
The lawsuit has been assigned to Michigan Court of Claims Judge Sima Patel, who earlier this year struck down Michigan’s mandatory 24-hour waiting period for receiving abortions.

They added that Abrego Garcia, who has a wife and family in Maryland, has not expressed fear of being removed to Liberia.“Although Petitioner has identified more than twenty countries that he purports to fear would persecute or torture him if he were removed there, Liberia is not on that list,” according to the filing.Abrego Garcia’s attorneys in his Maryland case could not be immediately reached for comment.The new filing comes shortly after attorneys for Abrego Garcia in a separate case in Tennessee this week requested to subpoena Trump DOJ official Todd Blanche in connection with Abrego Garcia’s claim that his criminal case by the Trump administration is vindictive. That hearing is set to start Nov. 4.Abrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to those charges, which accuse him of the human trafficking of immigrants in an incident stemming from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. Detention challengedAbrego Garcia, whose wrongful deportation cast a spotlight on the president’s aggressive immigration crackdown, is challenging his detention on the grounds that the Trump administration is using his imprisonment as punishment rather than for the purpose of removal. Abrego Garcia has stated he is willing to be deported to Costa Rica, which has agreed to accept the longtime Maryland man as a refugee. Because Abrego Garcia has deportation protections from his home country of El Salvador, the Trump administration must find a third country that is willing to accept him and a country where Abrego Garcia believes he will not face harm or persecution. The Trump administration so far has floated sending Abrego Garcia to one of three nations in Africa —  Ghana, Eswatini and Uganda.Earlier this month, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis found little evidence the Trump administration has made any effort to remove Abrego Garcia either to the southern African nation of Eswatini or Costa Rica. At that hearing, Abrego Garcia’s attorneys told Xinis they have not received an answer from the federal government as to why officials won’t remove Abrego Garcia to Costa Rica. Detained in PennsylvaniaXinis is currently mulling whether or not to order the release of Abrego Garcia, who is detained at a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Pennsylvania. Any indefinite stay would likely be unconstitutional, per a 2001 Supreme Court ruling that does not allow for immigrants to be detained longer than six months if the federal government is making no efforts to remove them.In March, Abrego Garcia was wrongly deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador, where he detailed his experience of psychological and physical torture.",,,,2025-10-24 12:17:05.335891

The first speaker, Barrett Donahoe, executive director of the Mid-South Association of Independent Schools, said repeatedly at the meeting that private schools would not make their students take state assessments, nor would they change their faith-based curriculum or their ability to turn some students away, even if the schools were to take state money through school-choice programs. 
It’s a popular argument among school-choice opponents — that voucher programs would allow private schools to accept tax dollars without being held to the same standards as public schools. But Donahoe did little to rebut it, instead doubling down on his stance.  
When Rep. Greg Holloway, a Democrat from Hazlehurst, questioned his logic, Donohoe replied, “I don’t think we have to compromise anything. I think our schools do a good job.”

Many lawmakers were curious about accountability standards for private schools. Donahoe said that, mostly, private schools are held accountable by parents who pay tuition, typically between $7,200 and $7,500 a year. 
Other representatives were less skeptical about private-school accountability.
“I don’t want to force our Christian schools to teach secular curriculum,” said Rep. Jansen Owen, a Republican from Poplarville and co-chair of the select committee, after the meeting. ”I don’t want the state’s involvement to infringe on that in any way.”
Owen and Donahoe suggested that private schools serve many low-income students, but data says otherwise. In 2016, just 8% of private school students lived in poor households, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. 
Donahoe predicted that if school choice laws are passed, private schools wouldn’t get an influx of students, calling it a “false narrative” perpetuated by opponents of the choice policies.  
It’s true that in other states, a majority of school-choice vouchers went to children who were already enrolled in private school, and school-choice programs don’t necessarily make private schools more accessible for low-income students or students with disabilities. 
Next, officials from the Mississippi High School Athletics and Activities Association told lawmakers that expanded school-choice policies would “completely upset” the competitive balance of high school sports and activities. 
“There’s no doubt in my mind we’re going to have movement based on academic needs, but I promise that the vast majority of our movement will be because of athletics,” said Chad Harrison, president of the association. 
He encouraged lawmakers to consider allowing MHSAA to maintain its eligibility rules for students. That means if a student living in one district transfers into another district, they wouldn’t immediately be eligible to play sports. 
Owen said the association’s concerns were addressed in a bill that failed last session, and they’d likely be able to find a compromise this year. 
Mary Werner, a Mississippi Board of Education member, and Sam Duell from yes. every kid., a pro-school choice advocacy organization funded by the Koch brothers, concluded the meeting. 
Werner, who said she wasn’t speaking to the committee on behalf of the board, suggested establishing a lottery would be the most equitable school-choice solution. 
Duell presented a number of polls and surveys that showed parent satisfaction is higher when they get to make choices about their child’s education.
House Education Chairman Rob Roberson, a Republican from Starkville, said the select committee on school choice would likely meet again once or twice before the legislative session begins in January.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/23165817/Education-Freedom-Select-Committee-1.jpg,,,2025-10-24 11:59:39.338975

Kansas officials have refused to turn over the data because of concerns it would be a privacy violation. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A California judge said states suing the federal government over demands for food program data are likely to win their claims and ruled program funding must continue while the case progresses. 
Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and Department for Children and Families Secretary Laura Howard have been criticized and sued by state Republican leaders for refusing to turn over Supplemental and Nutrition Assistance Program data, potentially causing the USDA to withhold $10 million in administrative costs. The state has appealed that decision.
Although Kansas didn’t join the national lawsuit, state leaders are watching the outcome, as it may support their reasons for refusing to yield to USDA demands. 
A spokeswoman for the governor’s office said it wouldn’t comment about ongoing litigation.  
In a 25-page order filed last week, U.S. District Judge Maxine Chesney considered the arguments of 21 states and the District of Columbia that have signed onto the lawsuit. 
The national case was filed in the Northern District of California in July, outlining why states believe the federal request for personal data of SNAP recipients and applicants violates privacy rules. 
Plaintiff states are likely to establish that they are not required by SNAP Act provisions to provide data and “consequently, have shown a likelihood of success on their claim that USDA, in demanding such data, acted in a manner contrary to law,” Chesney wrote.
To determine her ruling on the injunction, Chesney considered multiple factors, including whether the plaintiffs are likely to succeed based on case merits and whether they are likely to suffer irreparable harm.  
Howard told Kansas Reflector the state is concerned that turning over private data before the California lawsuit is settled could put the state at risk. 
“I honestly believe that if I were to release that data, then the courts find in favor of the states, then I’m putting the state at liability for releasing the personal information of more than 700,000 Kansans,” she said. 
At least 27 Republican-led states have turned over the data requested, according to NPR, while most the states resisting the USDA demands are led by Democrats.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Laura-Howard-20250820_135927-1024x661.jpg,,,2025-10-24 11:59:39.338975

The Iowa Board of Chiropractic recently charged licensee Ryan Bowman with violating the provisions of the Iowa law dealing with chiropractors’ health care agreements with patients.
The charges state that Bowman “specifically” violated Chapter 135N.1(2) of the Code of Iowa, which outlines more than a dozen different requirements for such agreements. The board has not publicly disclosed which of those requirements it feels Bowman failed to meet.

In its final order sanctioning Bowman, the board also says its “investigation revealed concerns about proper licensure” of Bowman’s staff, but the order does not identify those concerns or the staff.
To resolve the case, Bowman and the board have agreed to a settlement that requires Bowman to comply with the law, complete six hours of educational training on documentation, and, within three months, provide a copy of his chiropractic assistant’s certification.
According to state records, the board action stems from a patient complaint that was received in May 2024.
Bowman did not respond to calls to his clinic Thursday.

(Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)A second Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate in Maine dropped out of the race to endorse Gov. Janet Mills — but this time because of controversial past remarks from popular political newcomer Graham Platner. 
Daira Smith-Rodriguez, a union member and U.S. Air Force civilian contracting officer, announced Friday that she ended her bid. 
“As a survivor of military sexual assault, I cannot, in good conscience, indicate support or remain silent if there is even a possibility that someone who questions the reality of this crisis could be elevated to the United States Senate,” Smith-Rodriguez wrote in a statement on her website.
In Reddit posts from 2013, Platner downplayed the challenges service members face in reporting sexual assault and suggested people wouldn’t get raped if they weren’t inebriated around people they didn’t feel comfortable with, as the Washington Post first reported.
In one post, Platner wrote, “In today’s current climate, when every whisper of a misplaced hand brings down a feature length film, anyone who actually thinks the military is purposefully covering up rape to save the career of some god damn [captain], is clearly both an idiot and junior enough in rank or life experience to think it matters.”
Platner has disavowed the comments, telling The Post, “I don’t want people to judge me off the dumbest thing I said on the internet 12 years ago.”
Unearthed Reddit comments present first stumble in Platner’s rise

But given these past remarks, Smith-Rodriguez said that Platner’s candidacy poses “too great a risk to those who still need a voice to fight for them” and for that reason she’ll be backing Mills, who she said has a record of “courage, conviction, and an unrelenting drive to deliver results for all Mainers.” 
Dan Kleban, co-founder of Maine Beer Company, also suspended his campaign shortly after Mills entered the race earlier this month and subsequently endorsed her.
With the June 2026 primary still months away, it’s to be seen whether Mainers agree, though the first public polling on the Senate race shows apparent continued support for Platner over Mills. 
The survey captured responses while some of Platner’s past comments were being made public, but more controversies have surfaced since, including his now-covered Nazi-linked tattoo. 
Smith-Rodriguez’s exit from the race comes days after another Democratic Senate candidate Jordan Wood, a former congressional aide, called for Platner to drop out because of revelations about his past. 
In an interview with Maine Morning Star on Friday, Wood — the only gay candidate in the Senate race — doubled down on that call in light of additional comments reported by The Advocate on Wednesday that revealed Platner had a pattern of homophobic language and rhetoric that mocked or demeaned LGBTQ+ people in more recent Reddit posts, between 2016 and 2021. 
“Today I find that stuff abhorrent,” Platner told The Advocate. “And I am sorry that I ever used it.”
Wood said he finds how recent and prolonged these comments were to be alarming and questions how voters can trust that Platner is telling the truth today. 
Wood also worries about such remarks giving license to use homophobic language or symbols that indicate violence, which he said “is something that Donald Trump has really eroded for our country.” In Wood’s view, the worst thing the Democratic Party can do “in the opposition to Donald Trump is somehow give permission to looking lightly on what I believe are both offensive and threatening symbols and words.”
Where Smith-Rodriguez and Wood diverge is on whether a crowded primary will be beneficial as Democrats try to unseat long-time Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins. 
“It has become clear that Republicans are eager to see a crowded Democratic primary that divides our voices and strengthens theirs,” Smith-Rodriguez wrote Friday in her statement ending her candidacy. “I will not allow that to happen.”
Wood, who is staying in the race, said he consistently hears from Mainers at town halls that they want a primary process that affords them the opportunity to weigh in on who the best Democratic candidate is to put up against Collins. 
“Keep in mind that we have ranked-choice voting,” Wood added, which will allow Mainers to rank candidates in order of preference rather than choosing just one. “So Daira’s comments about exiting the race, I view it less of a problem because of how ranked-choice plays out.”

The governorship and all 80 Assembly seats are on the ballot. (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]Early in-person voting in New Jersey’s gubernatorial and Assembly elections begins Saturday.
New Jersey’s 21 counties will stand up 173 polling stations where voters can cast machine ballots ahead of Election Day. They are open between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., or 6 p.m. on Sundays.
The state’s early-voting period runs through Nov. 2. Voters can cast ballots at any early polling station in their home county.
New Jersey’s leading gubernatorial candidates, Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D) and former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli (R), are set to be busy this weekend.
Ciattarelli is holding a bevy of early voting rallies in North Jersey, including one in Clifton where he will be joined by Puerto Rico Governor Jenniffer González Colón. He is also hosting a tele-rally Friday night with President Donald Trump.
Sherrill is doing much the same, though with a focus on turnout in Camden and Middlesex counties. She will get a boost from some other prominent Democratic officials. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro will stump for her at a rally in Monroe Saturday, and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly will join her at a Blackwood rally later that day.
All 80 Assembly seats are also on the ballot this year.
See a list of early voting centers
Nearly 1.2 million residents cast early in-person ballots in last year’s general election, smashing turnout records and pulling past mail-voting turnout that had, until then, accounted for an overwhelming share of New Jersey’s pre-Election Day voting.
New Jersey law requires the state to reimburse counties for early voting expenses for up to five, seven, or 10 early polling sites, depending on a county’s number of registered voters, and counties are required to set up at least three, five, or seven sites, depending on their size.
Three counties — Hudson, Essex, and Union — have opted to erect more early polling stations than will be reimbursed by the state this year. Essex and Union counties will each have 11 early polling stations, while Hudson will have 34.
The 173 early polling stations set a new record for the state. Last year, counties had a total of 168 early voting sites.

The national movement is aimed at safely disposing of medicines that, in the wrong hands, could be dangerous. In April, during the last campaign, Kentucky collected 9,843 pounds of unused prescription drugs, according to Gov. Andy Beshear’s office. 
“Safely disposing of prescription drugs means we can create safe spaces for those in recovery,” Van Ingram, the executive director of the Office of Drug Control Policy, said in a statement. “Only together can we keep reducing overdose deaths and support treatment resources, and National Prescription Drug Take Back Day can be the first step for so many. If you or a loved one need help now, know there are resources out there for you to get help today.”
People who cannot make it to a drop-off location Saturday can do so year-round at Kentucky’s 200 permanent drug disposal locations in 87 counties. 
“One life lost to a drug overdose is one too many, and we have to do everything in our power to keep our loved ones safe and get them into recovery,” Beshear said in a statement. “National Prescription Drug Take Back Day is just one way we can make sure drugs are disposed of properly and prevent drug abuse, and I encourage every single Kentuckian with out-of-date or unused prescription drugs to take part.”

‘Use caution, no matter what’ 
Putting drug paraphernalia and nonprescription drugs in the hands of researchers can also reveal public health risks, a recent announcement showed.  
New testing of discarded syringes in Fayette County revealed substances that warrant community caution, the University of Kentucky’s Harm Reduction Hub and Lexington recovery organization Voices of Hope announced this month. 
Jimmy Chadwell, the president of Voices of Hope, said these substances aren’t new to Kentucky but they are new to Fayette County. And while the discovery is not necessarily an emergency, there are always risks involved when people are in active-use addiction, he said. 
“I think that people should always use caution, no matter what,” Chadwell said. 
The University of Kentucky’s Harm Reduction Hub recently started testing syringes from various communities, Chadwell said, to see how many different chemicals are in them. Any concerning results are then shared with the county where those syringes came from, he said. 
Chadwell did not have the specific location the recent batch — the largest tested yet — came from, but did say they were all from people who inject drugs in Fayette County. He also did not know how many syringes were tested. 
The substances found in a large batch of recently-tested used syringes from Fayette County include carfentanil, xylazine, medetomidine and BTMPS (a plasticizer) — which are linked to overdoses, severe wounds and medical complications, according to Voices of Hope. 
According to the organization: 

Carfentanil is an extremely potent fentanyl analog that may not always be detected by fentanyl test strips, greatly increasing overdose risk. According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, carfentanil is “10,000 times more potent than morphine.” 
Xylazine is a veterinary sedative associated with severe skin wounds and tissue damage.
Medetomidine is a veterinary tranquilizer similar to xylazine, linked to rapid-onset
withdrawal symptoms requiring medical care.
BTMPS is a plasticizer used in the manufacture of plastics, which in animal studies has been associated with heart and lung damage and sudden death.

Kentuckians should take a few precautions, Chadwell said, to keep themselves and others safe. They include:

Never use alone. 
Always have Narcan available, which is available for free at a variety of places across Kentucky. 
Learn how to provide rescue breathing. 
Several organizations, including Voices of Hope, also provide free fentanyl test strips. Voices of Hope, located at 644 North Broadway in Lexington, also has  xylazine test strips and is working to get medetomidine test strips, Chadwell said.  

Chadwell compared Narcan to a “fire extinguisher.” 
“We don’t have a fire extinguisher in our office in hopes that a fire breaks out, but we have one just in case it breaks out,” he said. “It doesn’t mean I’m going to go start a fire and then put it out if I have a fire extinguisher. Same concept with Narcan. Even if you’re someone that’s never used drugs, you don’t even know anyone that used drugs, you can be an innocent bystander and see someone overdosing and have that and be able to respond.” 
Anyone needing recovery support in the Lexington area can reach out to Voices of Hope, Chadwell said. Call 859-303-7671, email info@voicesofhopelex.org, visit 644 N. Broadway or go to the website at www.voicesofhopelex.org. 
“We want to get the education out there,” Chadwell said. “It’s not necessarily that it’s so much more dangerous than it was a few weeks ago. It’s just another reminder there are new substances — and new substances we haven’t detected yet can also come around. If they do, we’ll be sure to let the public know.”

(Screenshot: FDA)A UNC researcher says the United States has a lot of catching up to do when it comes to informing consumers about the potential health risks of products they’re buying. 
Depictions of smoking-related health problems, including images of rotting teeth and tumors, are printed on cigarette packs sold in Canada. And inside, explicit health warnings are printed on each cigarette. 
Food product labels in most Latin American countries are on the front of packages and say whether they are high in salt, sugar or saturated fat. 
The U.S. is behind other countries in requiring easy to understand nutrition and warning labels that draw consumers’ attention, said Marissa Hall, a UNC-Chapel Hill behavioral scientist. 
“Warning labels are a surprisingly powerful tool for changing behavior when they are well-designed,” Hall said Thursday. Labels with icons or graphics are the most effective, she said. 
Hall gave a talk about useful labels on alcohol, tobacco and food as one of the recipients of a campus award recognizing achievements of junior faculty. 
As it happens, the United States is in the midst of a long process of updating its rules for tobacco labels to include graphic images and health warnings on packages and cartons of cigarettes. Tobacco companies have sued to stop the federal Food and Drug Administration rule, and litigation is ongoing. 
Studies have found that graphic cigarette package warnings help people quit smoking, she said. Other studies have found that graphic tobacco labels could avert thousands of deaths in the US over time. 
The FDA has also proposed a rule that would require packaged foods to have nutrition labels printed on the front, with information whether salt, sugar and saturated fat content is low, medium or high. 
Labels are important because they deliver information to consumers right when they need it, Hall said. It’s also important to get the labeling right, because weak labels are hard to change. 
Hall and a colleague created UNC Mini Mart, a research space that looks like a convenience store. One UNC Mini Mart study found parents were less likely to purchase sugary drinks for their children when the bottles had pictorial warnings about heart damage and type-2 diabetes.
Marissa Hall, behavioral scientist at UNC Chapel Hill, Oct. 23, 2025 (Photo: Screenshot)
Hall also said the U.S.’s required warning label on alcohol hasn’t changed since 1989, leaving plenty of opportunities for upgrades. 
Alcohol warning labels don’t follow best practices, she said. They’re on the back or side of the package, they’re long, hard to read messages with no images or icons. 
In a recent study that’s under review, researchers found that fewer than one-third of people who drink alcohol said they read the warning in the previous three months, Hall said. Only 4% were able to remember all five topics in the warning. 
Researchers are in the middle of a study where people bring their own alcohol containers to the study office to have more prominent labels attached to the front. People in the control group will have a barcode attached. 
“Ultimately, this will provide some of the strongest evidence of whether or not these new evidence-based warning labels would reduce drinking,” she said. 
In an interview, Hall said it’s a step forward for the FDA to require nutrition labels on the front of packaged foods, but the label design is not ideal.

Changes to the program, made under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, take effect Nov. 1. Signed into law in July, the act cuts $168 billion of federal funding for SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, over the next decade. 
A recent report from DataHaven found that thousands of Connecticut residents will entirely lose coverage or see major monthly reductions in SNAP benefits.
[SNAP benefits poised to stop Nov. 1 despite CT hopes to continue]
Overall, Connecticut residents will receive $11 million to $15 million less in food assistance each month.
In Connecticut, Hartford, New Haven, Waterbury and Bridgeport will be hit the hardest, with thousands of SNAP recipients in each city losing at least $25 a month in benefits (both the Urban Institute and DataHaven used this threshold to focus only on families receiving substantial benefits).
Hartford is projected to receive between $1.2 million and $1.6 million less in SNAP benefits each month. New Haven, Waterbury and Bridgeport could see between $900,000 and $1.2 to $1.3 million less a month.
About 11% of Connecticut residents live below the federal poverty line but account for 41% of all SNAP recipients, according to DataHaven.
Before the new rules, adults without disabilities or without young dependents had to either work 80 hours a month or meet an exemption in order to receive SNAP benefits. The bill expands work requirements and removes numerous exemptions including ones for veterans, people aged 55 to 64, young adults 18 to 25 who aged out of foster care, homeless people and parents of children 14 to 17.
Additionally, noncitizen lawful immigrant groups such as asylum seekers and refugees will no longer qualify for SNAP benefits.
According to the Urban Institute, evidence shows that work requirements decrease SNAP benefits but don’t increase work or wages.
“People in every corner of our state are being crushed by the cost of living, and as this data shows, federal SNAP changes are only going to make that worse,” Meghan Holden, the director of marketing and communications for The Connecticut Project Action Fund said in an Oct. 20 DataHaven media advisory. “Right now, 58,000 Connecticut households are at risk of losing an average of $194 per month in SNAP benefits. That money is the difference between a child going to bed with an empty belly or full, between a veteran eating one meal a day or three, between hunger and survival.”
[Which CT social services could the government shutdown affect?]
Changes to the program also include stricter cost-of-living adjustments to the Thrifty Food Plan, which determines the cost of a nutritious and balanced meal. The plan serves as the basis for the maximum amount of money put into SNAP, but under the changes, reevaluation for the costs of a meal will be less frequent and cost-neutral, or will only take into account inflation.
Historically, SNAP benefits have not fully covered a “modestly-priced meal” as determined by the TFP, according to data from the Urban Institute. The DataHaven report found that major cost disparities exist between modestly-priced meals and the maximum SNAP benefits currently distributed in Connecticut, especially in the Western Connecticut Planning Region. 
If the federal shutdown continues into next month, SNAP benefits will not be sent out.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-21-at-12.32.13-PM-1024x775.png,,,2025-10-24 11:00:24.867424

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)The first legal challenge to North Carolina’s new congressional district lines came quickly. 
One day after the legislature approved a plan to change the 1st Congressional District from purple to red, voters have already told federal judges they want to contest it. 
The 1st District is already part of an unresolved lawsuit over racial gerrymandering. Some of the voters who brought that suit have asked the court to add the plan for the new district to it. 
The new district lines adopted this week dismantle a bloc of Black voters that has helped send a Black Democrat to Congress since 1992. 
North Carolina Republicans who redrew the lines this week said they were answering a call from President Donald Trump to increase GOP membership in the US House in next year’s election. Republicans have a thin majority in the House and could face losing it in the midterm election. 
The redrawn map would change the state’s congressional delegation from 10 Republicans and four Democrats to 11 Republicans and three Democrats. The Triangle and Charlotte would have the remaining Democratic districts. 
Republicans maintained they did not use racial data in redrawing the 1st District, but the amended complaint filed Thursday in the ongoing lawsuit said the new district violates the federal Voting Rights Act and the Constitution. 
The district as it was drawn for last year’s election is part of a federal lawsuit covering congressional and state Senate districts. It’s this lawsuit the voters want to update with a challenge to the new district. 
A three-judge panel heard arguments in the case this summer but has not issued a ruling. 
On Wednesday, the judges ordered lawyers to file briefs by Monday addressing what the new district lines mean for the existing case. 
Republican legislative leaders did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new challenge.
The 1st District has played an outsized role in the state’s civil rights history, the amended court complaint says. The district has elected a Black representative since 1992, when Eva Clayton became the first Black candidate since 1898 to win a U.S. House seat from North Carolina. US Rep. Don Davis narrowly won reelection to a second term in 2024. 
The new district boundaries dilute Black voting power in both the 1st District and the 3rd District, the complaint says, making it unlikely that Black residents will be able to elect the candidate of their choice in either of them. 
“Whatever the General Assembly’s partisan aims, they have—once again—chosen to target Black neighborhoods and communities to achieve them,” the complaint says. 
Also on Thursday, lawyers with the nonprofit group Forward Justice said they plan to sue over the new district, but they have not yet filed that suit.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4810-scaled-e1761277055148-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-10-24 11:00:24.867424

(Getty Images)Georgia’s SNAP administrators say they would need more than $60 million from state coffers to maintain their level of staffing after next year’s federal cuts to the program that more than one in 10 Georgians use for groceries.
The news from the agency that oversees the food stamp program comes after Republican Gov. Brian Kemp ordered state agencies not to ask for more money for their budgets. It also illustrates the difficulty that state agencies are facing with disruptions in federal funding.
The funding need was flagged in a form that the Department of Human Services sent to the governor’s budget office. The agency also informed its board of the funding need in September.


Shutdown means no aid in Georgia
SNAP recipients face a threat closer than next year: Georgia won’t send out November SNAP benefits unless the federal government reopens. Asked about contingency plans, Kemp’s office blamed minority-party Democrats for the federal shutdown. Georgia SNAP administrators say they have asked the state’s payment vendor for a plan on how quickly they can issue benefits once the shutdown ends.


Yet in compliance with Kemp’s budget instructions, the DHS did not make a formal request for more money in its full, formal budget request to the governor’s office.
Agency spokesperson Ellen Brown told The Current in an e-mail that “We continue to work closely with (The Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget) to determine any needs that may fall outside the parameters of the overall budget instructions.”
The governor’s office did not respond to written questions about whether he will consider the funding boost needed for the SNAP program, or his considerations as his office prepares spending plans. “The budget development process is still ongoing and our full recommendation will be released at a later time,” a spokesman wrote.
Kemp’s spending recommendations are expected in early January and his staff are already working on spending plans that will cover Oct. 1, 2026, when SNAP cuts passed in the Republican federal spending and tax law known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act cuts go into effect.

The cuts will decrease funding for state staff salaries who administer the food stamp programs from 75% to half. The amount necessary to fill that gap is about $62 million per year, according to early projections by DHS.
The new federal budget guidelines have rewritten multiple rules and procedures in the SNAP program. States must implement work requirement rules by Nov. 1 for working-age able-bodied people without dependents. Georgia also must pay a greater share of the salaries for staff working to upgrade the software system which determines eligibility for residents in the state. New rules mean that the federal government may withhold some federal funding from states that make too many payment errors in their SNAP programs.
Sen. Ben Watson. Ross Williams/Georgia Recorder
Savannah state Senator Ben Watson, a Republican, will oversee the discussions about the SNAP program as the chair of the budgeting subcommittee that oversees the Georgia Department of Human Services.
In an interview with The Current GA, Watson said it’s a long time until the legislative session starts and the situation is fluid in Washington, D.C.
He said the federal government may yet look at things like the definition of the federal poverty level or at tax credits for low-income households.
Watson said the state will look at whether Georgia’s SNAP program might be “tightened up.”
“So will Georgia be a leader in this and see if we can make some exciting change? We’ll see,” Watson said.
All Democrats in Congress and a few Republicans voted against the federal tax and spending law passed last summer. Georgia’s delegation split on party lines.
The Georgia Budget and Policy Institute, an Atlanta-based nonprofit, notes that small towns and rural areas such as McIntosh County, tend to have higher SNAP utilization than the state average, and that their residents have the most to lose if Georgia decreases funding or changes eligibility to make it harder to get into the program.
States are still trying to assess all the impacts of the federal funding cuts, and are awaiting federal guidance from Washington, D.C. about how the changes will affect social safety net programs and state administration of those programs.
Much of any upheaval in the budget cuts will be faced by the new Georgia governor who will be elected next November. Kemp, who is limited to two terms in office, will be stepping down in January 2027.
Brown, the DHS spokeswoman, said that her agency remains committed to the best customer service for Georgians in need of such aid.
“We’re always focused on cutting down application and renewal processing times for the average SNAP recipient through better customer service and technology,” Brown wrote.

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)Relax. It’s just a “public education campaign.” 
That’s how some construction-related unions innocently describe how they’ll spend the million dollars they say they’ve raised to help pass the film tax credit bill state lawmakers are poised to consider in a special legislative session.
The unions’ money isn’t meant to be spent on next year’s election campaigns, Vince Saavedra with the Southern Nevada Building Trades Unions recently told the Nevada Independent.
That must be reassuring to state legislators who might be on a ballot next year. They’re free to vote their conscience without fear of deep-pocketed special interests air- and cyber-bombing attack ads on them.
Unless of course the unions change their mind.
During the regular legislative session earlier this year, by the slimmest of margins, the state Assembly approved granting $1.4 billion in tax credits to the film industry. The movie and video corporations in turn would sell the credits at a discount to taxpaying Nevada companies, which in turn would get a tax break as a result of buying the credits, all of which would deprive the state of $1.4 billion that would otherwise be spent on legitimate public expenses like schools and health care and public safety.
However, the state Senate failed to pass the measure, perhaps only because it ran out of time. 
The film tax credit won’t be on a special session agenda unless Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo is sure it has enough votes to pass.
That means Lombardo, along with Democratic Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizzaro and Democratic Assembly Speaker Steve Yeager, need to know which way all the legislators will vote before Lombardo can even call the special session.
Hence the urgency of unions bragging about a million-dollar war chest. 
Which they say won’t spend on next year’s election campaigns. 
But they could change their mind.
Maybe they already did.
The federal government shutdown casts uncertainty on a lot of things, and the timing of a legislative special session is one of them. But if rumblings within the Nevada political-media-industrial complex are on the mark, and hold, the special session would be in mid-November, which is coming up fast. Lombardo and legislative leaders need head counts sooner rather than later.
Meanwhile, another leader of the coalition of construction industry unions pushing the plan, Tommy White with Laborers Local 872, told the Associated Press the group’s million dollars would be spent on TV and digital ads and mailers.
And yet has anybody seen any evidence — million-dollar evidence, to be specific — of a “public education campaign” from the unions in support of the movie studio giveaway bill?
Perhaps a skeptic, or a state legislator, can be forgiven for suspecting the million bucks isn’t for public education, but being brandished as a threat to spend heavily against noncompliant legislators next year.
Diversifying with the stars
Along with “because we said so” and “or else,” the film tax credit’s evangelizers insist Nevada politicians should hand out public money to movie studios because doing so will somehow magically transform Southern Nevada’s economy and prosperity will rain down on everyone.
The unions’ argument starts with the claim that the film tax credits will mean 19,000 construction jobs.
That estimate is from an analysis commissioned by the movie studios that stand to receive the $1.4 billion in public handouts and that, ably guided by Howard Hughes Holdings, have been leading about half of Nevada’s state-level politicians around by the nose for at least the last three years.
Yet even that project-friendly analysis estimates a much more modest 12,643 “direct” construction jobs, “or 1,580 jobs per year.”
It also estimates about 9,300 direct non-construction jobs “at stabilization,” less than 6,000 of which would be employed by “motion picture and video industries.”
The Las Vegas area workforce is currently about 1,140,000 strong. If a Nevada economic development plan attracted 6,000 highly trained scientific and technical research and development professionals and about 10,000 additional scientific and technical support jobs centered around a complex of research laboratories packed with hundreds of millions of dollars worth of sophisticated equipment, that might diversify the Las Vegas metro area’s economy a little. 
Another 6,000 people in the entertainment industry, eh, not so much. 
And in a workforce the size of Southern Nevada’s, “1,580 jobs per year” in impermanant construction work isn’t economic diversification. It’s another day that ends in y.
Beyond film and construction work, the bulk of the rest of the employment associated with the tax credits would be in retail, hotels, food service, and office services. In other words, more of the same.
And that’s from a report paid for by the film studios who are trying to make the project look good.
The state’s publicly funded economic development agencies charged with diversifying the economy may want to shop around. For $1.4 billion, we can probably do better.
The deciders
To reiterate, the Assembly already passed the studio handout bill and could be expected to do so again. 
So if there is enough resistance to make Lombardo stop pretending a film tax credits scheme warrants a special legislative session, the state Senate is where it’s at. And, to reiterate, the state Senate has never voted on it.
There are 21 Nevada state senators. Eleven of their seats are up next year: 

SD2: Edgar Flores, D
SD8: Marilyn Dondero Loop, D
SD9: Melanie Schieble, D
SD10: Fabian Donate, D
SD12: Julie Pazina, D
SD13: Skip Daly, D
SD14: Ira Hansen, R
SD16: Lisa Krasner, R
SD 17: Robin Titus, R
SD20: Jeff Stone, R
SD21: James Ohrenschall, D

Some of these people have announced they’re seeking reelection, some haven’t. But these are the people most likely to be the targets of the construction unions’ “public education campaign.”
One of them, Robin Titus, is the leader of state Senate Republicans. She also declared earlier this week that she’s a hard no on the studio bill. (This thing has always been a Democratic scheme.)
And one additional Democratic state senator will be on the ballot next year, in the primary and, she hopes, the general election. Cannizzaro, the Senate majority leader, is running for attorney general. She’s also recently declared full-throated support for the film tax credit scheme. It looks like the unions’ “public education campaign” already worked on her.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DSC06367-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 11:00:24.867424

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem will hold a press conference Friday afternoon to “discuss ICE operations and update on the Trump Administration’s immigration enforcement operations in the Twin Cities,” according to a media advisory that has circulated on social media.
Protests are expected in the Twin Cities on Friday, organized by groups that oppose the agenda of President Donald Trump.
Noem was the governor of South Dakota until Trump appointed her as the head of the Department of Homeland Security, where she is the face of Trump’s campaign to deport immigrants by the millions. (Longtime Trump advisor Corey Lewandowski, however, has been described as the “shadow secretary” by DHS staff, NY Mag reports.)
Under Noem, DHS has bucked precedent by requesting troves of personal data from states and other federal agencies to assist in deportation efforts; arresting people at courthouses; sending immigrants to countries they have no ties to and in some cases known for human rights abuses; and ignoring court orders.
On Trump’s orders, DHS has sent hundreds of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents into American cities, where they have been accused of detaining people without due process, including at least 170 citizens. 
The media advisory provides no details of the contents of Noem’s “update.” But it comes amid the DHS’s push to send crews of ICE agents into blue cities — in some cases accompanied by the National Guard — and reports that ICE is in talks with private prison company CoreCivic to reopen a defunct Appleton prison as a 1,600-bed immigration detention center.
Protests are expected outside the federal Whipple Building Friday afternoon.

That high-court ruling is back in the spotlight after the arrests on Thursday of more than 30 people, including an NBA player and coach, in two cases alleging sprawling criminal schemes to rake in millions by rigging sports bets and poker games involving Mafia families.
What did the Supreme Court decide?
The court’s ruling struck down a 1992 federal law, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, that had barred betting on football, basketball, baseball and other sports in most states.
Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his majority opinion that the way Congress went about the gambling ban, barring states from authorizing sports betting, violated the Constitution’s Tenth Amendment, which protects the power of states.
“The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make,” Alito wrote. The court’s “job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not.”
The trouble with the law, Alito explained, was that Congress did not make betting on sports a federal crime. Instead, it prohibited states from authorizing legalized gambling, improperly infringing on their authority. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Anthony Kennedy, Neil Gorsuch and Elena Kagan joined Alito’s opinion.
Dissenting justices said the court should have acted more narrowly
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote that even if the part of the law regulating the states’ behavior should be struck down, the rest of it should have survived. In particular, Ginsburg wrote that a separate provision that applied to private parties and betting schemes should have been left in place.
Writing for Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Stephen Breyer, Ginsburg said that when a portion of a law violates the Constitution, the court “ordinarily engages in a salvage rather than a demolition operation,” preserving what it can. She said that instead of using a “scalpel to trim the statute” her colleagues used “an axe.” Breyer agreed with the majority that part of the law must be struck down but said that should not have doomed the rest of the law.
But Alito, in his majority opinion, wrote that Congress did not contemplate treating the two provisions separately.
Opponents of gambling warned about corruption
Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, a former college and NBA star, was a sponsor of the law that he said was needed to protect against “the dangers of sports betting.”
All four major U.S. professional sports leagues and the NCAA had urged the court to uphold the federal law, saying a gambling expansion would hurt the integrity of their games. They also said that with legal sports betting in the United States, they’d have to spend a lot more money monitoring betting patterns and investigating suspicious activity.
The Trump administration also called for the law to be upheld.
Alito acknowledged in his majority opinion “the legalization of sports gambling is a controversial subject,” in part for its potential to “corrupt professional and college sports.”
He included references to the “Black Sox Scandal,” the fixing of the 1919 World Series by members of the Chicago White Sox, and the point-shaving scandal of the early 1950s that rocked college basketball.
But ultimately, he wrote, Congress couldn’t require states to keep sports gambling prohibitions in place.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25135471977857-1024x702.jpg,,,2025-10-24 13:02:05.368922

(Nathaniel Herz/KYUK and Northern Journal)A note from Northern Journal publisher and KYUK collaborator Nathaniel Herz:
Here’s a second piece from Jeron Joseph, a resident of the Western Alaska village of Kwigillingok who was forced to evacuate after a remnant typhoon flooded his village and destroyed some 35% of its buildings. The storm caused significant damage in more than a dozen villages in the region, and this week, President Donald Trump approved a federal disaster declaration in response.
In his first piece, Jeron, 30, whose Yup’ik name is Anguterayak, recounted his harrowing departure from his home amid rising floodwaters, and his evacuation from Kwigillingok by military helicopter to the Western Alaska regional hub town of Bethel. 
In this new account, he describes his flight from Bethel to Anchorage in a military transport plane, reuniting with his friends, family, and dog, and the early stages of settling into an environment that feels deeply foreign even if it’s within the same state. 
A few facts about Jeron that are worth keeping in mind as you try to grasp the new reality for him and hundreds of other evacuees: He rarely left Kwigillingok, known as Kwig — just for things like medical appointments and getting his state-issued identification renewed. All of those trips were to Bethel; the only other place in Alaska that he’s been is a town in the southeast part of the state, where his aunt brought him to visit a relative as a teenager. And he’s never had a driver’s license, never having needed one in Kwig. 
A night in Bethel
To begin with: I have been hearing many things about the first article, and I and many people from my community are so overwhelmed by the support, the love, and the messages — the well-wishes of strength and welfare that are being sent our way. We couldn’t be happier for those messages.
To begin where I left off: After we were dropped off by the helicopter in Bethel, we were hosted for the night there by one of my aunt’s nieces. I had a humorous exchange with her niece, where she almost tripped on one of my bags — I said to her, ‘It would be funny if, after all this, you were the one who got hurt.’
We spent a lot of the night catching up. We talked about the things we wished we would have brought with us, including sentimental items. The following morning, we were taken back to the hangar where we’d initially landed, so that we could take the morning flight to Anchorage. When we got there, we had some exchanges with friends and family, and it felt like this was the first time we were truly away from home. Up to that point, it just felt like we were passing by. That moment in the hangar where we saw a lot of our community members truly felt like going away.
Getting on the transport plane
They began boarding us onto that big C-17. None of us in the village had ever seen very large planes like that, and we were enthralled by the breadth of the plane.
Walking towards the loading bay on the tarmac, I would describe it as my own version of crossing the River Styx. As much as I wanted to, I didn’t look back at the hangar. I didn’t look back at the hangar because I knew I was going to start crying. My thought was that this is going to be the first day of the rest of our lives.

They began loading us onto the plane. A few elders sat in chairs along the walls, but the rest of us, they sat us down on the floor, row by row, no seats, no cushions. We all had to sit down as they strapped very long individual straps to each row of passengers that were supposed to act as seatbelts, but I’m fairly certain are for securing cargo.
We took off, and everyone who wasn’t in the chairs during that ascent, a lot of us had to hold on to that strap because we were sliding back, feeling like we were going to fall. There were exclamations of surprise among the passengers.
I don’t know if it was because of the exhaustion following what happened, but during the pressure changes, I had to do some mental gymnastics and really try to get a hold of my focus and my breathing so I wouldn’t pass out, because I was very close on a number of times during that flight.
My brother was also on the flight — I had texted him a message asking him to maintain eye contact with me so that my focus would have an anchor point, to keep me from passing out. Maybe two-thirds of the way into the flight, I had to break out a classic Barbra Streisand movie, the 60’s Technicolor gem “Funny Girl,” on my phone, because I have memories of watching that as a young adult. I couldn’t hear it because of the flight, but I was able to recite along in my mind because I listened to and watched it so much. That was able to calm me down.
Landing in Anchorage
I had gotten maybe 15 minutes into the movie when we began descending, and I could feel the pressure changes. All over again, I had to re-strategize my breathing. When we landed, I felt another moment of relief, and I embraced my aunt. There was applause among the passengers, cheering the landing. I was glad that that experience was over. My aunt described as being ‘crammed together like sardines.’

At the military base where we landed, they lined everyone from the plane up to get into a shuttle so that we could go back to the shelter at the Egan Center. I started seeing sights that I hadn’t seen since I was a teenager.
Growing up in the flat, watery plain of the Kuskokwim Delta all my life, I had forgotten about how imposing the urban structures and the trees are — because the sky at home is totally open. Maybe folks here think that the sky is pretty open already in some places. But at home, it always felt like a planetarium without an edge. I remember winter nights where I would stargaze and I could see the entire sky, horizon to horizon, and just lie down there admiring the beauty.
Trees are beautiful. Mountains are beautiful. The city skyline is beautiful. I love admiring it all, but I just miss the beauty I used to see.
Being here inland, now, of course, I don’t dislike it. But it just feels like I’m an ant at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, and I have imposing structures all around me: trees, buildings, and mountains, all appearing to look down on me, and that certainly takes adjusting.

After landing, I’ve been experiencing the feeling of a whole new world where convenience is king. With our subsistence lifestyle, the relationship that we have with our resources is that they’ve always been rare and precious, and very tasty.
I don’t mean to disparage, but it feels like, here, everything’s so disposable. And I notice a mental complex where you can get everything at the snap of a finger. It creates this sort of detachment with resources, and it boggles me to see people wasting food and water, because that would actually be seen as a petrifying offense in the villages. That’s something that I might have to adjust to. Everybody is so nice and accommodating, but it’s still an adjustment.
Another thing that bewilders me, being before these palaces of convenience, is that, despite all that people have, they still plan for more. My assumption when I thought about this was, ‘Maybe there’s a brand of competitiveness here that makes people feel this way.’ Who could’ve put that feeling there? And why?
I’d like to say that when we were in our village, it felt like that was the entire world. That kind of insularity, though it may seem ignorant to some, is something that led to another feeling. It felt like we already had the world. That feeling created a neighborliness that is nigh unmatchable.
Reuniting with friends and family
At the Egan Center, where we were dropped off, we sat in the dining area and came across several of our friends and family who had also decided to come to Anchorage. I hadn’t realized this about other people’s faces until then, but it turns out that they can act as an anchor and a port for our emotions and feelings of home. Seeing those faces certainly eased the feeling of a whole new world.
We were talking amongst ourselves. We were talking about how we all missed our home, and a lot of us had gasped and ran up to other people we knew, being so grateful for each others’ safety. One of the ones that affected me the most, though, was seeing my own mom, who had been outside the village when the storm hit.

On the helicopter ride to Bethel, she had FaceTimed me and my family members, and we had all cried then. Thinking of the first time we’d be seeing each other in a new world, while saying goodbye to the place most precious to us that was in view of the helicopter window. How we wanted our feet to touch that ground one last time. When she saw us at the Egan Center, I was overwhelmed with another wave of tears.
The structures may be gone. Our home might have been declared unlivable. But I have the greatest assurance now that the people and the voices are still here. Those people and those voices that we have been through so much with, and that will go through so much more — through strangeness, through a lack of familiarity, and having to navigate a whole new concrete jungle. We’re still here.
After spending so much time talking and reuniting, my aunt and I were met by a relative who’d come to pick us up. We waited for our luggage. Then we were told it might not get there today. My aunt and I sighed, and then the relative took us to his home where we’d be staying, and he showed us around.
Getting settled
A number of things struck me as odd. The first was probably fences. I go back to how open everything feels in the tundra. Having to grasp property lines and stuff like that — of course, we want to be respectful, but it’s just still another new thing for us to adjust to.
We had the nicest time being able to settle ourselves in that relative’s home, but it was still hard. We could have been given the most comfortable parachute in the world, but it still wouldn’t be enough to alleviate our grief.
I had another moment of my own grief when I went out onto the deck and started crying again, because everything inside the house reminded me in some way of my home. That moment was actually catalyzed by seeing a towel rack that those relatives had brought back from the village. I hadn’t seen that towel rack since I was a child.
My aunt came out to the deck, and she had to console me for five minutes. I said to her, ‘Everything inside reminds me of home.’ And she said, ‘You’re crying. I know you’re hurting. But this is a whole new world for us, and you have to say goodbye and thank you to those times. We can’t get them back, but we’ll be able to make new ones when we can.’

I got inside to the room where they set me up. I didn’t have a change of clothes, other than some sweats that we had taken from the clothing drive at the Egan Center. Putting those clothes on made me realize how so many of us are so close to losing the things we’ve become accustomed to — the roof over your head, the clothes you wear, the food and water that are given to you. Being in that room and having no stuff gave me a whole new appreciation for the things that I used to enjoy in my little cave of a room at home.
The next day, or the day after that, we got our luggage, and we felt like we had gotten pieces of ourselves back. I know I mentioned my computer before — I got that, too. I set it up, I turned it on, and I was relieved to see that it still works. When I saw that my sheet music was still playable, that brought another whole new wave of relief, because I didn’t want to lose all of those years’ worth of work.
Finding friends and relatives
Someone I spoke to about the kinds of things I took from home — they thought it was interesting that I’d bring a dog and a computer. I told them, ‘I wanted to pack the village, but the luggage fee would’ve been disastrous.’
And I really wanted to. How I wanted to. But the more time we spent flying, the less we expected to see familiar faces, or familiar voices, in the place where we landed. Fellow Yup’iks who speak our language, Know our humor.
But my aunt and I were pleasantly surprised across these days of adjustment — meetings happened at the most unexpected times. You’re doing something mundane or habitual while out doing errands when out of the blue, a face from home or from neighboring villages surprises us. I’ve lost count of the number of times we’ve said or heard: ‘Aaah! Oh my gosh, haven’t seen you! My name’s…’ And they’d tell us their Yup’ik names and how we’re related to them or their friends.
These exchanges validate what we’re feeling, what we miss. If you can’t picture what it feels like, imagine you’re in the most foreign, alien, nowherest nowhere you can think of, out of the States. Then you take a wrong turn, and there’s that Starbucks in the middle of nowhere. That’s how I would describe it.
A blanket for my soul
One specific meeting I experienced was just like this, though it wasn’t a surprise. My childhood best friend moved out of our village when we were in middle school. I texted him that I was in town, though I wished it was under better circumstances. He’d said something like, ‘Oh my gosh, where!!??’ I told him, and he said he was coming as soon as he could. I waited. I waited. I kept asking where he was. He told me to hold my pantaloons. He’s coming.
I saw a newspaper dispenser on the way to meet him. The image on the newspaper was of a helicopter. You can imagine what I was thinking then, and what I was feeling. I wished he was here. I wished it was now. I didn’t want to have to cry before I cried meeting him.
We met in an indoor space, and I saw his back where he was seated in a waiting area. My heart felt like it was about to jump out of my mouth and meet him before the rest of my body. I sprinted up to him. He heard me, he turned around, and I embraced him. He hung on to me. I smiled so much I could feel it in my ears. Years and years of anticipation dropped when we hugged in that waiting area. He whispered a little friendly joke in my ear, ‘Your shoes were squishing.’ I chuckled, and I cried tears of joy.
For the eight or so hours after we met, we literally didn’t stop talking — about my experience, our boyhood memories, and our inside jokes with our immediate friend group. He took me to his place and he started making salmon soup. Wild caught. Here was a whole new world before me, and I was freaking out over Yup’ik soup. Homestyle, for us. Having that bowl of salmon soup was like a blanket for my soul, made from the feeling of home. I relished each spoonful, slowly, not knowing when I’d have it again.

Picking up the dog
Going back to the day when we evacuated from Kwig on the chopper — I’m still raw thinking about this. We were told that the last kennel plane was full, and that my dog, my Jack Russell terrier, had to go on the next one. The thing was, the next kennel plane was scheduled for the day after we left.
You might be able to imagine the hole in my heart that that development bore into me. Nearly in tears, I walked up to the reception area at the school that served as the village shelter and asked who I could entrust my dog to. I was pointed to an overseer who we knew we could depend on. I was given every guarantee that my dog would be okay, but be that as it may, I still wasn’t certain in my heart that she would come.
When it came time to take our bags and ourselves to the fourwheeler and its trailer to head to the helicopter, my heart sank. I knew what else I was going to leave behind, but to leave my dog, even temporarily? I felt guilt, shame, and sadness. That she couldn’t understand we’d get her back.
The fourwheeler started rolling toward the village airstrip, and she started whining. I started crying. I cried all the way there. When we got to the airstrip, my brother had to embrace me as I cried loudly into his ear. Every turn brought back memories of the village, my family, my friends, and my dog. And losing my dog from my sight as she disappeared further from the horizon just rendered me into pieces.
Fast forward to the evening of the reunion with my friend, we were informed that our dog made it to a cargo depot. When I heard, I felt like a little boy who’s going to see his dog for the first time in weeks or months.
I could not sit still for the entire drive over. I kept talking to my aunt about some of the things my dog used to do, and also some of the things that we’d have to do, like getting nail clippers and a brush for her. And of course, she’s going to have to be housebroken in a whole new way, and mind her manners.

There was a little confusion at the cargo depot. We spent probably 10 or 15 minutes knocking on all the doors, and we were about to leave when we got a text saying we should bang harder. But before we could bang on the gate again, it opened and we saw our dog, Maundy. I named her after a dog who had died, as it is Yup’ik tradition to name a baby after someone who has recently passed. Though Maundy’s namesake, my mother’s dog, had passed before I could remember.
I walked up to her. I was so happy. I was flooded with memories of her, and how much of a little fussy brat she is sometimes. But I still love her. And this time, when she whined when she came back to us, I felt lifted up onto cloud nine.
As we’d gotten out of the storm and were settling in at our relative’s place, it had felt like we were on a merry-go-round for days. Once we had our luggage and our dog, and got to see all the familiar faces, it finally felt like we were able to sit down and just do nothing if we wanted to — which is also a precious thing.
We have a roof, we have our things. We have the things that I now believe we ought to be grateful for, like food and water. And I know I will never not be appreciative of our next meal ever again.
An emotional church service
Some days after we settled in, we had a number of logistical things that we had to do back at the relief center. One of the things that they organized there was a church service that included Yup’ik singers who used to sing in the affected villages.
I was able to get through the opening and the prayer okay. But when they got to the Yup’ik singers and the Yup’ik songs, I was reminded of my grandmother, Lena, whose Yup’ik name was Kayungiar. She used to take me to our Protestant Moravian church at home, where they had open singing.
The church was in the south part of town, which experienced the worst flooding — I don’t know what happened to it, and in some ways that feels worse. I wish I could know now, so that I could at least have some closure for that special place.
I had managed to bring a little Bible that my mom gave me in 2010. Having that additional connection to home, combined with the singing, brought me to tears again.
Some of the members of the congregation came up to me. They wrapped their arms around my shoulders, and they started saying prayers for me. I was so overwhelmed with emotion that I actually had to get out of the service for a little bit, so that I could get my emotional equilibrium back.
There was a member of the Red Cross who asked me if I was okay. I explained my feelings to her. And she said, ‘I know it’s hard. You have so much you miss. But I know you can find some friendly faces here, so that you can make new church memories.’

Another person, in a blue vest, checked up on me as I went to go get some water; she told me she’s from an Episcopalian family on the East Coast, and couldn’t imagine how she’d feel if her own childhood church had been affected. It gave me great comfort to know that there were people who could sympathize with how I was feeling.
I said to the lady from the East Coast that my home is gone, the places I love are gone. But when I look at that church service, I know that the people and the voices are still here. And as far as I know, they will always be here, even if there’d be only one person left.
That is the sort of thing that I choose to think about when I’m in this alien world. For everyone reading, you could be that one person that I talk about. You could be the one to carry our traditions in your heart. You could be the shelter of our way of life. And as long as we have the people, as long as we have our language, I know that that lifestyle and that knowledge will never drift away. Typhoon or not.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)A new online statewide directory has been launched to showcase and connect Alaska Native artists across disciplines.
The Alaska Native Arts Directory is the work of the nonprofit Alaska Native Arts Foundation. Listing is free. The directory went live last week, timing that coincided with the Alaska Federation of Natives annual convention in Anchorage.
As of Monday, about 200 artists were listed, most of them with photos and biographical information. The Alaska Native Arts Foundation said it is seeking to expand that number to more than 1,000 by next year.
The Anchorage-based foundation said it also has a goal of holding a first-ever Alaska Native Arts Economic Summit next year, bringing together artists, policymakers and other partners to work on building the Indigenous creative economy.
There are other artists’ directories in Alaska, some of them with a focus on Indigenous artists. One, the Collective49 Marketplace, enables member artists to promote and sell their work online. And there are numerous local artists directories, such as those in Ketchikan and Homer.
The Alaska Natives Art Directory, however, is intended to be more comprehensive. Along with being statewide, the directory includes writers, musicians and other performing artists along with those who create carvings, paintings and other physical works of art. It includes contemporary art forms as well as traditional Indigenous arts.
“The Alaska Native Arts Directory celebrates the full spectrum of Alaska Native creativity, visual and written arts, performance, design, and traditional practices, reflecting the diversity and vitality of Alaska’s Indigenous cultures,” Gail Schubert, chair of the Alaska Native Arts Foundation, said in a statement.
Launch of the Alaska Native Arts Directory represents a renaissance of sorts for the Alaska Native Arts Foundation.
The foundation was created in 2002 and for several years operated an ecommerce site and a gallery in Anchorage. But it shut down those operatioons in 2016 after losing state funding and encountering other financial problems.
The directory project and other new activities now have a variety of funding sources, according to the foundation’s statement. The effort is backed by grants and other support from organizations that include the Rasmuson Foundation, the U.S. Small Business Administration, the office of U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, the Alaska State Council on the Arts and the Municipality of Anchorage, among others, according to the statement.

(Photo courtesy Indiana State Fair Commission)Cindy Hoye, who has led the Indiana State Fair Commission since 2004, will step down in 2026 after a nearly 40-year career with the organization.
In a Thursday announcement, the commission praised Hoye’s “visionary service” and credited her with re-shaping the fairgrounds and state fair “into what (they) are today.”
“(Hoye’s) remarkable tenure leaves behind a legacy of excellence, innovation and unwavering dedication,” the commission said in a social media release. “Thank you, Cindy, for 40 incredible years of leadership and impact!”
Hoye, who became executive director in 2004 after serving 16 years as the commission’s marketing director, said serving as executive director was “an absolute honor and incredible privilege.” 
“With the State Fair’s roots deeply planted in its mission, this place will always hold a special significance for me and most importantly for Hoosiers across the state,” she said in a statement. “I am immensely proud to have worked alongside one of the greatest teams of people you’ll ever encounter. Their sense of pride, purpose, and relentless pursuit of excellence is truly remarkable.”
Hoye added that the State Fairgrounds are “in capable hands, guided by a clear and strategic roadmap for continued success.”
Her tenure is marked by a number of major initiatives and projects. 
Hoye oversaw renovation of the Corteva Coliseum and construction of the Indiana Farm Bureau Fall Creek Pavilion, as well as expansions of 4-H programming, She additionally helped attract high-profile track-and-field events — including the NCAA Division II National Championships, Big Ten Championships and the Hoosier State Relays — to Indianapolis and the fairgrounds campus.
Gov. Mike Braun described Hoye’s tenure as “remarkable” and said she “elevated” the commission.
“Her unwavering commitment to the State of Indiana, to her staff, and to leaving the Fair and Fairgrounds better than she found it, has set a standard of excellence that will continue to guide us for years to come,” the governor said in a statement.
The commission has initiated a search for Hoye’s successor, and she will assist in the transition ahead of her official retirement in March, agency officials said.

Some members of the Parole Working Group established by Gov. Mike Kehoe wanted to require more than the current system, which starts at 15% of a sentence for the lowest-level offenders and peaks at 85% for the most violent. Others urged a system with a standard that would lower the population of Missouri’s prisons — currently about 24,000 — with releases tied to personal growth.
Without agreement, the report highlights that it makes no recommendation on the question, Trevor Foley, director of the Missouri Department of Corrections, said in an interview with The Independent.
“I wanted the governor to understand that this was a big debate and that the working group did not land on consensus here,” Foley said. “Ultimately, (Board of Probation and Parole Chairman Tony Helfrecht) and I determined that any policy to get more people in prison or fewer people in prison wasn’t really the scope of the order.”
The group’s final report lays out how some practices, listed in a departmental policy book, will become formal department rules, and how other rules will be revised or reorganized. It also recommends changes to medical parole and sets a higher bar for decisions to revoke probation and return a person to custody.
It was silent on whether parole policies fixed in state law should be changed because members decided that was outside the scope of their study.

“Prior to doing this, the board could unilaterally alter those guidelines at any time they want,” Foley said of the policies being moved into formal rules. “Now, by moving them into rules, those become an open-forum, public policy debate of what should the minimum percentages be for eligibility or the maximums, or how should it apply to different offenses.”
Critics, both inside and outside the working group, weren’t impressed with the report’s conclusions. 
Newton County Prosecutor Will Lynch said he pushed for a rule requiring every person sentenced to state prison to remain in custody for at least 50% of their term.
“The recommendations and outcomes don’t necessarily fix what I believe is wrong with parole in Missouri,” Lynch said.
Amy Malinowski, Missouri director of the MacArthur Justice Center, said the working group ducked the toughest questions.
“They’re just announcing things that are either already the case or that they’re already required to do,” she said. “And we are supposed to take that as reform.”
Kehoe’s office released the working group’s report on Oct. 3. Both Foley and Helfrecht told The Independent that they believe the final report met the governor’s goal of “promoting consistent and equitable decision-making for parole decisions” and his directive to do so by revising agency rules to provide “clarity, transparency, and accountability for the parole process.”
The new rules must be published in the Missouri Register, which opens a period for public comment and requires legislative review before taking effect. The proposed rules are being reviewed by Kehoe’s office, Foley and Helfrecht said, and will be published when the governor approves them.
Much of the five-page report focuses on how some practices, listed in a departmental policy book, will become formal department rules, and how other rules will be revised or reorganized.
“Prior to doing this, the board could unilaterally alter those guidelines at any time they want,” Foley said. “Now, by moving them into rules, those become an open-forum, public policy debate of what should the minimum percentages be for eligibility or the maximums, or how should it apply to different offenses.”
 Parole eligibility

To determine exactly how much time any person sentenced to a term in a Missouri state prison will serve depends on a number of factors — the level of the offense, whether it is considered a violent crime or dangerous felony, the person’s criminal history and how long they were held before conviction.
Missouri has five levels of felony. Under department rules, non-violent offenders in those classes must serve 15% of their sentence, or just over 12 months of a maximum 7-year term for a Class D felony. 
By statute, the minimum for the same sentence, if the person is being incarcerated for a second time, is 40%, or almost three years. And if it is the fourth time being sent to prison, the minimum is 80%, or five and one-half years.
Foley called Missouri’s criminal sentencing laws “phenomenally complicated” and noted they are “frequently litigated.” 
Some issues aren’t related to how the rules apply but how credit for time served on a sentence is awarded.
Missouri math: How a 23-year sentence adds up to more than 40 years in prison

The department is currently in court over how a records officer calculated that a man with a 23-year sentence must be in custody for 41 years. Deandre Pointer of Kansas City was convicted of first degree murder, second degree murder and two counts of armed criminal action in 2005, receiving consecutive life sentences. 
His sentence was vacated and he was resentenced to 23 years in 2023, but he was given credit for time served only on one of the new terms because his previous sentences were ordered to be served consecutively. Instead of being eligible for release in 2024, he must wait until 2044.
Foley said he could not directly comment because of the litigation, but he defended the work of the records officers and said it complied with the law.
But even simple sentences can be handed down without certainty for any party. During an interview this summer with The Independent, Boone County Circuit Judge Brouck Jacobs, who represented the judiciary in the working group, said he was seeking ways to make sentencing clearer to defendants and crime victims.
“They think somebody’s got seven years for breaking into their home, a burglary,” Jacobs said, “and then I think they’re shocked and chagrined when the person’s out in a year-and-a-half.”
Foley said he thinks the changes will help, but that any significant revision of how sentencing and parole interplay is up to state lawmakers. Determining the parole eligibility date for is a “math problem” where all the variables aren’t known until the person being incarcerated is received by the department, Foley said.
“The goal would be, at the day of sentencing in the courtroom, does every stakeholder understand the implications of that sentence?” Foley said. “Because right now, they don’t.”
 Detailed recommendations

The report isn’t all just reference to revisions to match current practices and reorganization of sections in the Code of State Regulations.
An incarcerated person in a parole hearing will have the ability to bring two representatives of their choice to provide information about rehabilitation efforts or barriers to release.
“That might not sound like a huge deal, but it’s a tough decision for some of these folks to make, who they’re going to have there to represent them,” Helfrecht said. “They can bring up such things as a solid home plan, where they are going to live, their employer and family support. Now they can even have representation.”
Amy Malinowski, director of the MacArthur Justice Center’s Missouri office (photo submitted).
Malinowski, however, doesn’t share Helfrecht enthusiasm about that change.
It is “the only sort of substantive change that I saw” related to Kehoe’s stated goals, she said.
“But that’s it,” Malinowski said. “You know, they worked all summer, and this is it.”
Some of the other detailed recommendations would:

Streamline the parole process by foregoing formal hearings for some low-level offenders, who often arrive eligible for parole because of time served in a county jail.
Remove the requirement that a prisoner paroled for medical reasons have a treatment plan in place before being released.
Require allegations of a parole violation such as a new crime to be proven before the Parole Board holds a revocation hearing, and for the board to “only consider revocation when a preponderance of evidence is found regarding new law violations or technical violations associated with community risk.”

The changes to the requirements for medical parole will align the policy with the statute, which does not require a treatment plan as a condition for release, Foley said. Medical parole can be considered for individuals who have a terminal disease, require long-term nursing care or have a health issue that would be made worse by continued incarceration.
While the availability of care will no longer be a factor in the decision, Foley said the situation of the person being considered for parole will be a concern.
The prison population is aging — almost 25% of offenders are older than 50 — and every prison has a nursing unit. Finding a nursing home willing to accept someone released from prison is difficult, Foley said.
“I do think we likely would be concerned about putting forth a medical parole packet to the board when that individual had no place to go,” Foley said. “We’re not interested in people dying homeless on the street.”
One change not reflected in the report is a revised form that will summarize the findings of the three-member parole hearing panel. 
On the current form, when parole is denied, often the only reason provided is that “release at this time would depreciate the seriousness of the present offense…”
The new form shows how the panel evaluated the offense, whether it was violent or sexual in nature and whether drugs were involved. Drug and alcohol history also spills into the person’s time in custody, and whether they have completed substance abuse treatment.
Four categories cover the person’s time in prison and on supervised release previously and with evaluations for conduct violations, program participation and whether the person had new offenses while incarcerated.
The final category is a catch-all for any reason not previously considered, including whether there is community opposition or the person has a stable post-release plan.
Working group member Courtney Everett, coordinator of the St. Louis University Prison Education Program, said in an interview this summer that the form needed revisions to provide more detail.
In an email about the final report, Everett said he was pleased at the openness of others in the 15-member working group, dominated by law enforcement and corrections officials, to consider his recommendations.
“A violent crime will always be violent, so denying a person parole because of the seriousness of their crime is punishing them for issues beyond their control and the opposite of what is best for public safety,” Everett said. “I did bring this up and the group agreed that this is an issue, however I don’t see this mentioned explicitly in the report.”
Helfrecht defended the current form but agreed more information would help document board decisions.
“Whenever we make a decision,” he said, “we make a decision for our offenders, but we also make it for the safety of our communities and our victims.” 
 Hurried process?

In the Jan. 13 executive order establishing the working group, Kehoe set Oct. 1 as the deadline for delivering a report. The panel held one public hearing on June 13 and completed the report on Sept. 18.
But not every member of the working group left the final meeting with the understanding that the report was final. In an email five days before Kehoe released it, Everett said he was expecting a final meeting to go over the report prior to it being delivered.
Secret meetings of parole study group may violate Missouri Sunshine Law

And after it was released, Everett said he had not seen the final version prior to its delivery and noted the cover letter was dated Sept. 19.
“We should have had an opportunity to see the final language before it was submitted to the governor to ensure we were all in agreement,” Everett said. “I don’t know if there would have been any revisions or further discussion, but I think one final round of eyes on the document would have been productive.”
Foley and Helfrecht said they tried to make it clear that the Sept. 18 meeting would be the last.
At the public hearing in June, 14 people signed up to give comments but only three actually spoke, including Malinowski. All other meetings were held in private. While the working group accepted written comments, it took no other public testimony.
“I would have loved for victims of crime to have the opportunity to come in and say, ‘here’s how the current system affected me,’” Lynch said.
Everett also said more public hearings would have helped the working group.
“I feel that everyone tried their best but we could have benefited from more interaction with the people most impacted by our decisions,” he said. “We could have benefited from more than one public hearing and having a research professional in the group would have been an asset.”
The working group did not have to hold any public hearings, Foley and Helfrecht said, because Kehoe directed the working group to include representation of a variety of perspectives.
But they said the lack of feedback at the public hearing, which was scheduled for up to three hours, was a surprise.
“I’ll be honest, we were stunned,” Foley said.
“I wish that meeting would have been longer,” Helfrecht said. “I wish we would have had more speakers.”
A more robust report that met the governor’s goals was possible, Malinowski said. The parole board doesn’t need legislative action to open its hearings to the public, give offenders their case files or change how decisions are stated.
“There is a lot they could have done if they had taken ownership of this opportunity,” she said. “I think they could have done more with the time they had.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Algoa-Correctional-Center-04022025-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-10-24 10:00:53.054680

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)TOPEKA — While Kansas remains one of the last states in the nation without legalized medical or recreational marijuana, THC-infused drinks have evaded scrutiny from officials.
The question of the legality of the drinks came up Thursday at a meeting of a joint legislative committee on security.
Robert Stuart, executive officer for the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, explained to lawmakers that while marijuana is illegal in Kansas, THC-infused beverages are considered hemp products and allowed under the 2018 federal Farm Bill, which legalized cannabis plants containing no more than 0.3% of a plant’s weight in tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. Products created using hemp are commonly advertised as Delta 9 items, and they can have a weaker effect than marijuana because of their lower THC content.
Rep. Pat Proctor, a Republican from Leavenworth, asked Stuart: “Should we be outlawing it?”
Yes, Stuart said, and he wagered the KBI’s position would be the same.
“If it’s intoxicating, it’s damaging,” he said.
THC drinks are restricted to adults over the age of 21, same as alcoholic beverages.
“You hear all sorts of social arguments and all sorts of different ways of thinking about it,” Stuart said, “but it would be much clearer for any of those distributors, any of those dealers, for any member of the public, to say, OK, this is what’s clearly illegal and clearly what’s not.”
Blurred lines make it difficult for retailers to comply with state laws, for consumers to know the products they purchase are safe and for law enforcement to conduct criminal investigations, Stuart said.
Kansas City, Missouri-based brewer Boulevard Brewing Company announced this month a THC-infused version of its signature Quirk seltzer, which will be called “Berry Jane.” It will be available in two dosages. One containing 5 mg THC and another containing 10 mg, differentiated by a darker can. They are expected to be sold in Kansas and Missouri next month.
The KBI celebrated a major crackdown on THC products earlier this month, raiding 10 storefronts in six cities across the state. KBI director Tony Mattivi said the products were harming Kansas children.

It’s here and it’s happening. The recent revelations about Republicans “joking” about an affinity for Nazism should wake us up to the reality of the moment. When President Donald Trump says immigrants have “bad genes” and are “poisoning the blood of our country,” he has raised the specter of eugenics that thrived in our country and of course in Germany during the 1930s.  There’s a direct line from this thinking to the Holocaust.
We need look no further than Minnesota for insight into this ugly history. During the early 20th century, Minnesota and many other states passed eugenics laws to support so-called racial purification. Laws in 31 states allowed the sterilization of mentally disabled and “feeble-minded” people, epileptics and more. Minnesota passed a sterilization law in 1925, and more than 2,000 people — mostly women — were sterilized. In California around 20,000 were sterilized from 1917 to 1952.
Through the 1930s, American scientists at the prestigious Cold Spring Harbor Lab in New York promoted eugenics and maintained a Eugenics Record Office. David Starr Jordan, who wrote early major works on the fishes of North America and was president of Stanford University, was a white supremacist and supported forced sterilization programs aimed at poor Black, Indigenous and Hispanic women as well as the mentally disabled. 
We know that Charles Lindbergh, the Minnesotan famous for his solo flight across the Atlantic, was a eugenicist and talked of preserving the inheritance of European blood and guarding against its dilution by foreign races. He praised Hitler. Margaret Sanger, who was the first president of Planned Parenthood, was a eugenicist.
The Minnesota Eugenics Society was founded in 1923 by Charles F. Dight, who served as president until his death in 1938. He actively promoted reproduction of the “fit” and race betterment (the State Fair held “fit family” contests). 
During the 1930s, Dight communicated with Hitler, praising him for his plan to “stamp out mental inferiority among the German people” and “advance the eugenics movement.” If carried out effectively, Dight wrote, “it will make him the leader of the greatest national movement for human betterment the world has ever seen.” 
Our country has had a history of restricting immigrants, e.g. the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act that limited immigrants from eastern and southern Europe and Japan. 
Trump castigates immigrants as criminals and insane, even though immigrants have lower crime rates than that of American citizens. 
How could the President release 1,500 convicted insurrectionists yet push to deport immigrants? He’s likely a true believer in the nonsensical race science that was predominant a century ago.  
Episcopal Bishop Mariann Budde, who spent a quarter century in Minnesota, told Trump at the now famous prayer service early this year, “The people who pick our crops and clean our office buildings; who labor in poultry plants and meatpacking plants; who wash the dishes after we eat in restaurants and work the night shifts in hospitals — they may not be citizens or have the proper documentation. But the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals. They pay taxes and are good neighbors.”
Aren’t we all the immigrants or the descendants of immigrants? And don’t we all have defects? 
Let us not forget: We are called to protect the vulnerable, to treat everyone as equals, to “do unto others as we would have them do unto us.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/08-05-Lindbergh-in-Cottonwood-County-1-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-10-24 09:02:46.544809

“Together with Beloit College, we’re shaping a stronger health care workforce for the Midwest and beyond,” said DMU President and CEO Angela Franklin in the release. “This partnership accelerates the pathway to a rewarding career in health care for motivated students who are ready to pursue the education to get there.”
Doctorate programs of osteopathic medicine, podiatric medicine, physical therapy and occupational therapy will guarantee interviews for Beloit students, as well as master’s degrees in physician assistant studies, anatomy and biomedical sciences. The interdisciplinary PhD in biomedical sciences will also have guaranteed interviews, the release stated.
Of the eight programs with guaranteed interviews, the release stated both the doctor of podiatric medicine and doctor of occupational therapy will also reserve one seat each year for a Beloit student.
According to the release, the new partnership “illustrates both institutions’ commitment to improving access to advanced health care education while maintaining academic integrity and student-centered values.” DMU has similar partnerships with Simpson College in Indianola, Benedictine University in Illinois and Voorhees University in South Carolina.
“We are thrilled that this partnership makes pathways into health professions clear for our students,” said Beloit College President Eric Boynton in the release. “Des Moines University has a long history of educating students to treat the body as a whole, and their comprehensive, holistic approach to medicine is an excellent companion to the skills students develop at Beloit College.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-24 13:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Which CT social services could the government shutdown affect?,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/24/ct-social-services-government-shutdown/,Connecticut would feel the effects of a continued shutdown on federally funded programs around nutrition assistance and child care.,"November is a critical month in the federal government shutdown if it drags on for at least a couple of more weeks — and Connecticut would feel the effects across a few federally funded programs, namely around nutrition assistance and child care.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, would temporarily come to a halt starting Nov. 1 in Connecticut and other states. And two local Head Start centers face an imminent funding lapse in federal dollars next month, though at least one confirmed it plans to keep operating through November.
As the shutdown enters its fourth week, the federal workforce has largely felt the brunt of the government’s closure, with furloughed and essential employees starting to miss paychecks. But the pain of a shutdown will be felt more broadly if it stretches into the next month and imperils social services predominantly for lower-income households.
On top of that, open enrollment for health plans on the state’s insurance exchange, Access Health CT, begins on Nov. 1. Enrollees face possible premium hikes in 2026 if federal subsidies aren’t renewed before then. The expiration of those subsidies and their future are at the heart of the shutdown fight in Congress.
Of the federal programs that could face significant disruptions or cuts in the coming month, SNAP would take the biggest hit, unless the Trump administration can find a way to keep it going. Connecticut Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal joined other colleagues in a letter urging the USDA to use its contingency fund to pay out November benefits for SNAP.
But other benefits supported by federal dollars remain more in limbo or largely unaffected in the near term. The state said it has enough resources to keep the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program afloat for at least another month.
For Head Start, two programs in Connecticut won’t receive new federal grants expected on Nov. 1 if a shutdown persists. The state is looking for ways to temporarily support them, though exact plans haven’t been finalized.
The culmination of these funding cliffs on Nov. 1 could be a pressure point to jumpstart talks, but meaningful negotiations between the two parties have yet to come to fruition. The shutdown is currently the second longest in U.S. history.
More than three weeks into the shutdown, there has been little to no movement on reopening the government. Democrats are still pressing for extending the expiring health care subsidies in order to secure their votes, while Republicans say the issue should be dealt with separately and shouldn’t be attached to a funding bill.
The Senate has taken a dozen votes on the Republicans’ bill to fund the government through Nov. 21, but enough Democrats have opposed that bill to block it from advancing, including both of Connecticut’s U.S. senators. Meanwhile, the House has been out of session since late September since passing the short-term funding bill, referred to as a continuing resolution.
That standstill in Congress has officials and advocates in the state awaiting some of the toughest cuts so far. And while Connecticut will not feel the full force of shutdown disruptions next month, the state will inevitably face additional funding issues in a long-term scenario.
“As we stare down the barrel of this Nov. 1 date, to me, the fact that the House isn’t even in session tells me that here at the food bank, we have to be prepared for no SNAP on Nov. 1,” Jason Jakubowski, Connecticut Foodshare president and CEO, said.
Nutrition assistance
If SNAP pauses on Nov. 1, about 360,000 beneficiaries in Connecticut will not receive their monthly benefits for November and won’t be able to use their existing balances until a shutdown ends.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture sent states a recent memo warning “there will be insufficient funds to pay full November … benefits.” The federal guidance directs states to effectively shut down the Electronic Benefit Transfer or EBT cards. Benefits are loaded onto those cards, which are used by beneficiaries to help purchase groceries.
The lack of access to benefits, however, would be temporary. Recipients won’t lose any benefits currently stored on their EBT cards, according to guidance from the state Department of Social Services. But because of the uncertainty around the government reopening, DSS is recommending people spend the balances on their cards by Oct. 31. 
By November, the EBT cards are expected to shut off. Once the shutdown ends, recipients will regain access to the benefits that remain on their cards.
Connecticut distributes about $75 million per month in federal SNAP benefits, with many households receiving about $190. The federal government covers the costs of SNAP benefits, while it splits the administrative expenses evenly with the state, though that funding structure is subject to change in the future due to reforms in President Donald J. Trump’s “big beautiful bill.”
Officials are looking into possible state interventions, but their options are limited. Connecticut was able to temporarily fund another federal nutrition program, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children. WIC serves about 52,000 people in the state, including women who are nursing or pregnant as well as young children. The expectation is that the state will get reimbursed by the federal government once a shutdown ends.
There are also talks among state officials and legislative leaders about beefing up emergency aid to food pantries and banks. If SNAP funding dries up next month, that will put increasing pressure on local food pantries to fill the need.
Connecticut Foodshare has been in daily talks with state officials about how the state might step in with nutrition assistance at risk. The group works with more than 600 food pantries across the state as well as 110 mobile sites.
With Nov. 1 approaching, Jakubowski said the focus is on the existing network of pantries and ensuring they have enough food to meet the increased demand. But if the shutdown goes beyond that, he said, they’ll need to seriously consider setting up emergency food distribution sites for the month of December — similar to what they did during the pandemic.
Advocates see cuts to food aid not only having a direct effect on families and other beneficiaries but also a larger economic impact on the stores and retailers that accept SNAP. Connecticut has about 2,500 SNAP retailers, with those dollars making up 5% to 15% of their business.
And they worry about how other shutdown-related cuts could have a ripple effect.
“Those don’t directly affect us, but there’s absolutely an indirect effect of those things,” Jakubowski said about cuts to heating aid and other federal programs. “There is definitely a residual effect. That’s less money they have to spend on groceries.”
Head Start centers
More Head Start centers — early childhood services that serve low-income children from birth to age 5 — could also feel the financial pinch of the shutdown heading into November. And that could cause disruptions in the coming weeks across the country.
These programs get federal grants on different timelines. Only half a dozen have been operating without federal funding this month. But an additional 134 programs will face a similar outcome in November in an ongoing shutdown, including two in Connecticut, according to the National Head Start Association.
In Connecticut, two centers won’t get access to federal resources when their grant cycle starts on Nov. 1 in the event of an ongoing shutdown: EdAdvance, a Regional Educational Service Center that serves western Connecticut, and Children’s Learning Centers of Fairfield County in Stamford. Between those centers, they have a combined 395 slots that serve children in Head Start and Early Head Start programs.
Connecticut’s Office of Early Childhood is working to fund these programs temporarily for one month, though the plans haven’t been finalized, according to Maggie Adair, the communications and legislative program manager for the OEC.
EdAdvance was supposed to get its five-year federal grant starting on Nov. 1. But to help with an expected funding lapse, it will get some of its allotted state funding for the year early, executive director Jonathan Costa said. That will help EdAdvance stay open through November, though he noted they will need to evaluate things if the government remains closed heading into December. 
As of this week, all Head Start centers across the country remained open amid the shutdown. But one program in Florida is poised to closed down on Monday, according to National Head Start Association deputy director Tommy Sheridan.
During the 2013 shutdown, Connecticut was one of half a dozen states that saw closures of Head Start centers, including one in Bridgeport.
Winter heating assistance
The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, also faces funding issues next month. But Connecticut will be in the clear, at least in the short term.
DSS administers LIHEAP grants to largely fund the Connecticut Energy Assistance Program, which provides subsidies to low-income households to help with their heating bills during the winter months.
The Connecticut Energy Assistance Program has more than $7 million in funds that were unspent from the past winter. The state anticipates that funding to last them midway or through the end of November, and it indicated they are looking into other options if the shutdown dips into December.
“The state of Connecticut has about $7 million in carryforward funds to assist eligible households with their home heating costs. We anticipate funding will last through mid-to-late November and are working on making sure families continue to receive the help they need to stay warm this winter and are evaluating options if the Federal Budget impasse continues past November,” DSS spokesperson Christine Stuart said in a statement.
Demand is expected to grow this winter, with the Lamont administration projecting more than 100,375 households needing heating assistance.
Other states are seeing a more immediate effect on their LIHEAP funding. Pennsylvania announced this week it’s delaying the opening of its energy assistance program by a month because of the budget impasse in Washington.
Open enrollment for Obamacare plans
Funding disruptions caused by the shutdown are happening at the same time that households are receiving notices about how much more they could pay for health plans next year if premium subsidies expire.
About 150,000 Connecticut residents purchase coverage through Access Health CT, and about 90% of those benefit from a federal subsidy.
Even without that tax credit, enrollees in Connecticut will still have access to some financial support, but residents with exchange plans could expect to pay $1,700 more on average every year for health insurance, according to Access Health CT. 
Connecticut could see some of the highest premium increases in the country if the enhanced premium subsidies go away, particularly for enrollees over the age of 60, according to a report from KFF.
Open enrollment for 2026 plans runs from Nov. 1 through Dec. 15 for those who want their plans to begin in January. For those who want to enroll in a plan that starts in February, residents have until Jan. 15.
As people weigh their options, officials in the state recommend holding off on immediately enrolling to see if Congress resolves the shutdown and the impasse over the Affordable Care Act subsidies. 
“If you could, wait a little bit longer,” Access Health CT CEO James Michel said Tuesday. “Instead of enrolling on Nov. 1, give it more time, because I know there’s conversations going on right now to try to get the subsidies resolved.”

San Francisco has avoided an aggressive immigration crackdown under President Donald Trump — for now. 
As CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones explains, Bay Area officials and residents remain on alert after Trump called off his plans on Thursday for a “surge” of federal immigration enforcement in San Francisco. The move comes a day after the president sent about 100 federal agents to Coast Guard Island in nearby Alameda, prompting state and city leaders to denounce the potential deployment of federal troops in San Francisco. 
In a social media post, Trump cited discussions with San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie and calls with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff as reasons why he canceled the show-of-force. (After receiving public backlash, Benioff — who does not primarily live in San Francisco — walked back comments he made earlier this month supporting the deployment of the National Guard to the city).
Trump’s post ended with the phrase, “Stay tuned!”
On Thursday morning, protestors gathered at the entrance to the Alameda military base, where federal agents used a flash-bang grenade and pepper powder to disperse the crowd, according to KQED. At least two arrests were made.
Meanwhile, Lurie said that San Francisco “remains prepared for any scenario.” In Oakland — where Trump previously floated sending federal troops — its Mayor Barbara Lee said the city stands “ready to support our residents through every legal and appropriate means available.”
And Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson for Gov. Gavin Newsom, said the office is continuing to monitor the region “as the days progress.”

Crofts-Pelayo, in an emailed statement: “Trump has finally, for once, listened to reason — and heard what we have been saying from the beginning. The Bay Area is a shining example of what makes California so special, and any attempt to erode our progress would damage the work we’ve done.”

Planned Parenthood funding: Newsom on Thursday said the state will invest more than $140 million to assist California’s remaining Planned Parenthood clinics. Earlier this year the Trump administration banned the clinics, which is the state’s largest abortion provider, from receiving federal Medicaid payments. About 80% of Medi-Cal patients use Planned Parenthood for reproductive health care, cancer screenings and primary care check ups. Read more from CalMatters’ Kristen Hwang.

Marines’ misfire

California congressmembers are calling for an investigation as more details emerge about the Marine artillery mishap over Interstate 5 on Saturday, reports CalMatters’ Deborah Brennan.
In a planned demonstration involving firing 60 rounds of artillery at San Diego County’s Camp Pendleton, an apparent misfire ended up scattering shrapnel over the coastal freeway. The shrapnel struck a California Highway Patrol motorcycle and an empty patrol vehicle. The demonstration was in celebration of the U.S. Marine Corps’ 250th anniversary, which was attended by Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth.
Public safety officials and former members of the military said the demonstration’s location was unusual, and that live-fire training typically takes place on designated ranges within the base.
U.S. Rep. Mike Levin, a Democrat who represents the district that includes Camp Pendleton, sent a letter to Hegseth demanding answers to questions about the incident, including who decided to shoot live artillery over the freeway. Twenty-six other California congressmembers and the state’s two senators also signed the letter.

Levin, to CalMatters: “I’m led to believe the decision-making did not put public safety first.”

Clamping down on police data

Los Angeles County leaders are calling on their sheriff to limit license plate reader data sharing after CalMatters found that some law enforcement agencies were illegally sharing the data with federal immigration agencies, write Phoebe Huss of CalMatters’ College Journalism Network and Khari Johnson.
The county’s board of supervisors submitted the motion in September, requesting that the sheriff’s department not use license plate data it collects for non-criminal immigration enforcement. They also called for the department to conduct privacy training for deputies and delete plate sightings after 60 days, unless the plates are flagged on criminal lists.
The request cited a June CalMatters report, which found that a dozen Southern California police and sheriff’s departments shared such data with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection — despite a 2015 state law banning California law enforcement agencies from sharing license plate reader data with federal entities.
CalMatters did not find that the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department shared data with ICE or the Border Patrol, but some L.A.-area agencies did. The sheriff’s department says it “welcomes” the request and will review its policies.

While the need for rooftop solar is not going away, federal tax incentives are, which is why it's important for state and local governments to step up, Josh Tulkin writes. (Photo by Joe DelNero /National Renewable Energy Laboratory)This past summer, Maryland experienced record-breaking energy use and record-high electricity bills due to record-breaking heat. As we enter the fall and will soon face colder weather, it is critical that Maryland continues to seek ways to lower energy costs for Marylanders and connect more energy to our grid.
Installing rooftop solar and battery storage brings energy independence to residents looking to lower their energy bills and move away from reliance solely on the grid. Unfortunately, Congress has ended tax credits designed to encourage energy conservation and incentivize people to install solar and battery storage in their homes.
It is now incumbent on local and state governments to take all steps in their power to promote adoption of conservation and solar. While local governments can’t replace federal tax credits or control tariffs, they can still have a huge impact. They can cut red tape, offer their own incentives, speed up permitting and drive down the soft costs.
High upfront costs are among the top reasons Americans who want to put solar on their roofs and batteries in their garages haven’t done so yet. One of the ways we make things cheaper is by cutting down costs in the process. Thankfully, Maryland has already been working to make solar more affordable and passed the Brighter Tomorrow Act of 2024, which, among many cost-cutting provisions, requires local jurisdictions to adopt more effective permitting technology.

Enter SolarAPP+, which stands for Solar Automated Permit Processing (plus other clean energy technologies). In 2021, I was proud when Montgomery County started piloting the ‘SolarAPP+’ Platform to instantly approve solar permits for residents. Montgomery County has shared that residential rooftop solar projects that go through SolarAPP+ have been passing their inspections at a 30% higher rate than those submitted through the traditional route.
We cheered when lawmakers passed the Brighter Tomorrow Act of 2024, which added funding to support the requirement for Maryland jurisdictions to use solar permitting software to automate the process for residential rooftop solar and home energy storage installations. In 2025, we conducted outreach, hosted educational webinars with guests from the Maryland Energy Administration and SolarAPP+, and engaged with dozens of volunteer leaders across the state to inform them about this game-changing software.
And there’s been some good news in 2025: We were thrilled to hear that, in June, Prince George’s and Worcester counties were awarded the Maryland Energy Administration’s first SolarAPP Implementation Grant. In July, MEA relaunched a fiscal ’26 Maryland SolarAPP+ Implementation Grant Program, setting the stage for additional jurisdictions to onboard, train and support adding this automated tool to their tool belts.
We have heard that Kent County, Salisbury and Rockville launched their SolarAPP+ portals and that Prince George’s, Wicomico, and Worcester counties are all going through the onboarding process as I write this.
As we head into another high-energy-use season and with federal solar tax credits disappearing soon, it is essential that SolarAPP+ get launched in time for residents to take advantage of it. This crunch season is critically important, and far too many jurisdictions are lagging behind.
We have been supportive of adopting this technology as it aligns with our values of making clean energy accessible to more people. SolarAPP+ was developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and building safety officials and is now run by an independent nonprofit foundation, with additional support from Maryland Energy Administration grants.
We call on jurisdictions to move swiftly to adopt SolarAPP+, apply for the implementation grant from MEA, and ultimately comply with the law. Making rooftop solar easier for Marylanders is one thing we can all agree on.
Will this solve all of the problems with solar? No – but it is something we can do now, even as federal opportunities dry up. Now is not the time for backsliding; it’s the time to add clean, affordable sunshine into the mix for as many rooftops as are ready for it.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/53515164850_6f123440fb_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 09:02:46.544809
,California,2025-10-24 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Gavin Newsom cited 3 main reasons in his vetoes this year. Trump was one,Ryan Sabalow,,,,,https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/10/gavin-newsom-vetoes-2025/,"Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed 123 bills this year, citing fiscal restraint — and Donald Trump.","In summary
Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed 123 bills this year, citing fiscal restraint — and Donald Trump.


Sen. Anna Caballero is one of California’s most influential lawmakers, since she is in charge of a committee that decides in secret to kill hundreds of bills each year, often at the behest of the governor’s administration.
But even though Caballero is the powerful chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and regularly works with the governor’s team, Gov. Gavin Newsom still vetoed seven of her bills this year, the most of any lawmaker.
“I do tough bills,” Caballero, a Democrat who represents the Merced area, told CalMatters. “So sometimes I get lucky, and other times, it’s disappointing. And, you know, you learn to live with it.”
Her vetoed bills include one that aimed to reduce emissions at state ports, another that sought to add oversight for metal shredding facilities and one that sought to train police to investigate foreign governments that target immigrant communities.
In his veto messages, Newsom described those bills as unnecessary since state agencies were already doing similar work. That’s one of the more common themes in Newsom’s 123 vetoes from this legislative session that he finished signing earlier this month. He used the word “duplicative” 16 times, according to an analysis of CalMatters’ Digital Democracy database. 
The analysis highlights how Newsom uses his veto pen to assert authority over a Legislature his fellow Democrats control while rejecting bills he deems too costly, redundant or politically risky.  Newsom cited fiscal implications dozens of times in his veto messages, reflecting the challenges of a tough budget year. This year’s vetoes also gave him a chance to throw some shade at Newsom’s biggest enemy: President Donald Trump. 
Newsom mentioned Trump by name three times in his vetoes, and he cited Trump’s “hostile economic policies” in almost a quarter of his veto messages, 28 times. 
“With significant fiscal pressures and the federal government’s hostile economic policies, it is vital that we remain disciplined when considering bills with significant fiscal implications that are not included in the budget, such as this measure,” Newsom wrote, in vetoing Caballero’s bill that sought to exempt hydrogen fuel from sales taxes.
He used a nearly identical line to veto three other Caballero bills, including a measure to provide tax credits for medical equipment, a bill that would have provided grants for carbon dioxide removal and another that sought to incentivize biomass power plants. 
The vetoes represented just a small percentage of what Newsom’s did with the 917 bills that were sent to his desk this year. He vetoed just 13.4% of them, a slightly lower rate than previous years, according to Chris Micheli, an adjunct professor at McGeorge School of Law and a veteran lobbyist who keeps detailed statistics on the Legislature. 
It certainly wasn’t all vetoes for Caballero. Newsom also signed 10 of her bills into law. 
Zombie bills return for a second veto
There was another theme in Newsom’s vetoes: Spiking bills he’d previously vetoed.
He did that six times.
As CalMatters reported, even if a bill gets vetoed one year, lawmakers often bring the legislation back again — often with wording identical to the previous version. 
Previously vetoed measures are especially likely to be resurrected if well-funded lobbying groups that donate heavily to politicians are pushing for a new law. 
That was the case with two bills Newsom axed for the second time this year.
One was a union-backed bill by Democratic Assemblymember Dawn Addis of San Luis Obispo that sought to make it easier for farmworkers to win workers’ compensation claims against employers for heat-related illnesses. The other was a previously vetoed measure by Democratic Assemblymember Esmerlda Soria of Merced that sought to allow community colleges to offer bachelor’s degrees in nursing. Nurses unions, hospitals and community colleges supported the bill.
Newsom noted those bills were “nearly identical” to measures he previously killed, and he cited the same reasons. 
Newsom again spiked a bill that would require counties to create multidisciplinary behavioral health teams, a proposal to force insurers to pay for menopause treatment, a reparations bill and a measure to fund a study on women veterans’ mental health.
First-year lawmaker Democratic Assemblymember John Harabedian, representing the Pasadena area, had five vetoes this year, the second most in the Legislature. They were mostly related to health insurance and the fallout from last winter’s devastating wildfires in Los Angeles County.

Newsom vetoed his bill that would have required insurers to pay for up to 12 mental health visits for people living where there has been a recent wildfire. Another would have created a state-led disaster housing task force in Los Angeles County. The governor also vetoed a measure that sought to speed up patients getting the care their doctors recommended.
“Big, transformative policies often take multiple attempts, and I’m proud to keep pushing forward to serve my constituents,” Harabedian said in an emailed statement. 
Newsom signed four of Harabedian’s bills. 
None of Democratic Assemblymember Ash Kalra’s bills were vetoed this year  — for the first time in the San Jose lawmaker’s nine-year legislative career. He had 12 signed into law.
That included a bill aiming to prevent foreign labor contractors from exploiting their workers that was similar to a measure Newsom vetoed before. Kalra said he narrowed the bill to cover only farmworkers to address Newsom’s concerns. 
“You have to be persistent,” he said. “Sometimes it takes three, four or five times, or in the case of the foreign labor contractor bill, seven years.”

How other lawmakers avoid vetoes
Other lawmakers also got a lot of their bills past Newsom’s veto pen. 
Democratic Santa Ana Sen. Tom Umberg had Newsom sign 16 of his bills, the most behind San Francisco Sen. Scott Wiener, who had 21. As the Senate Budget Committee chair,  Wiener is the lead author of mandatory budget bills that skew his totals. 
Umberg’s bills include one prohibiting streaming providers such as Netflix from playing overly loud advertisements; another to prohibit Elon Musk and others from hosting lotteries to gin up partisan voter registration, one intended to stop puppy mills and an audit of the state’s troubled bar exam.
Umberg, a former federal prosecutor and attorney nearing the end of his term, said his success is due in part to him serving in the Legislature off and on since the 1990s. He’s served under four different governors, so he said he knows what they’re looking for.
“I hope that my years of experience provide some benefit and some expertise in legislating and how to work a bill through the process and how to get a bill signed,” he said.
Newsom vetoed one of Umberg’s bills this year, a measure that would have added new price-gouging protections and penalties in disaster zones. Newsom didn’t like that the bill also would have allowed the Legislature to override a governor’s authority on disaster declarations. 
Republicans are vastly outnumbered in the Legislature and not as many of their bills even reach the governor’s desk, so it stands out that Assemblymember Josh Hoover, a Republican representing the Folsom area, had the most bills signed among GOP lawmakers, with nine. Hoover is out of the country this week and wasn’t available for an interview, his spokesperson said. 
Republican Assemblymember Laurie Davies had seven of her bills signed, the third-most among Republicans.

Davies’ bills weren’t particularly controversial and didn’t involve partisan politics. They included a measure that requires schools to provide educational materials to prevent drownings. Another requires the state to tell those who file complaints about a drug and alcohol treatment center the outcome of their complaint. Another of her proposals prohibits selling equipment to modify electric bicycles so they no longer classify as an e-bike. 
Davies, who represents a competitive swing district in the Oceanside area, said she wants her bills to solve problems, not take partisan hits that almost certainly won’t get signed into law under a Democratic administration.
“We don’t run bills for social media clicks or cable news invites,” she said.Newsom did veto one of her bills this year, a measure that sought to make battery storage plants beef up their fire safety plans. Davies opposes a proposed battery storage facility in her district.
Newsom’s veto message used one of his favorite words: “Duplicative.”
“This bill is largely duplicative of existing requirements and mandates a new procedural requirement that risks delaying critical clean energy projects,” he wrote.

In November, the justices will wrestle with some disputes that are years or decades in the making. Others touch on current crises. And the Legislature’s action or inaction is often a factor.  
Here’s a preview of four cases that could have wide-ranging effects, set for oral arguments before the SJC next month.  

Charter school public records fight – November 3 
A years-long legal dispute between Attorney General Andrea Campbell and the high-performing but controversial Mystic Valley Regional Charter School is hitting the high court. The Malden-based charter received at least 10 public records requests between January and November 2022 from the Malden News Network, Commonwealth Transparency, and mayoral candidate Lissette Alvarado. 
They requested information including corporate statements, contracts, ledgers, lease records, conflict of interest disclosures filed by board members, payments made to employees or professional services, and confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. Mystic Valley rebuffed each request, claiming that “as a Commonwealth charter school, it does not fall under the category of entities handling public documents” and is not subject to the state public records law. 
After the Supervisor of Records issued multiple orders for the school to comply with the record requests, Campbell’s office filed suit in Suffolk Superior Court in July 2023. The Superior Court sided with the AG’s office, declaring the school to be a government entity subject to the public records law. Mystic Valley appealed, arguing that the suit fundamentally misunderstood the nature of charter schools.  
Mystic Valley has faced controversy before, including criticism over a dress code policy banning hair extensions that disproportionately affected Black students, which led to passage of state legislation declaring such practices discriminatory. 
In this case, the school argues that charters are more like business entities, granted “significant independence” without strong enough ties to the state to make them government entities subject to public records laws.  
“The Legislature intended for charter school (sic) to chart their own course, with the freedom to experiment and test out new ways of teaching children,” the school wrote in its brief to the high court. “With these goals in mind, it is logical to treat charter schools more like private, independent organizations than governmental entities. 
But the AG’s office says the school “can only exist and operate” if the state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education allows it and continues to renew its charter, as it did in 2023, and clearly performs the “government function” of educating the Commonwealth’s young people as a public school. 
Whistleblower retaliation suit drags on – November 3 
Thomas Galvin’s wrongful termination lawsuit against Roxbury Community College is now before the SJC, more than a decade after the former security chief was fired. 
Galvin served as the college’s director of facilities and public safety from 2007 until his August 2012 termination. In a lawsuit filed in Middlesex Superior Court, he claimed he was fired as retaliation for exposing the college’s failure to report sexual assault allegations as required under the federal Clery Act. He is the brother of Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin.  
In 2010, Galvin received a letter from a student alleging she had been sexually violated by two former professors and had previously reported the incidents to college administrators. When Galvin pressed college officials about whether the complaints had been properly reported under the Clery Act, he alleges Vice President of Administration and Finance Alane Shanks told him there was nothing to report and accused him of trying to get her in trouble. 
Galvin reported what he believed to be the college’s Clery Act failures to state auditors and federal authorities in 2011. The college fired him the next year, citing security and performance concerns raised in an internal audit, including issues with Galvin’s Clery Act reporting.  
The Superior Court, considering Gavin’s claim that he was protected by the state’s whistleblower statute, rejected the college’s argument that Galvin had to prove he acted in good faith and agreed with Galvin that he engaged in protected activity. The high court will hear arguments on whether the lower court correctly found that Galvin was a whistleblower under state law. 
If lawmakers won’t raise attorney wages, can the courts? – November 5 
The bar advocate work stoppage will finally reach the full Supreme Judicial Court, which is being asked to consider whether it has the constitutional authority to raise court-appointed attorney pay rates. 
Most bar advocates, private attorneys who handle roughly 80 percent of indigent criminal defense cases in Massachusetts, stopped work in Suffolk and Middlesex county courts in June 2025, demanding higher hourly rates. Bar advocates in Massachusetts make $65 an hour, while advocates in other New England states make more than $100 an hour. The work stoppage overwhelmed the Committee for Public Counsel Services, the state’s major public defender organization. 
The Committee for Public Counsel Services is arguing that the Legislature, which rolled out a deal in late July that would raise the hourly wages $10 per year over the next two years, is shirking its responsibility to make sure that people without means still have access to counsel. Since July, more than 180 people in custody for more than a week without counsel and over 800 without representation for 45 days have been released or had charges dismissed because of the lag in finding attorneys to defend them.  
A lower court judge ordered that attorneys for five defendants be paid $100 an hour, and CPCS was able to find representation for those defendants at that rate. The question before the high court, now, is whether judges have the authority to raise rates to make sure that courts function correctly. Justice Dalila Wendlandt denied a request to raise bar advocate wages on July 3, and the matter now makes it up to the full court.
“Once again, indigent criminal defendants find themselves in an unacceptable and constitutionally intolerable position – without counsel” because of low compensation set by lawmakers, CPCS notes in its brief. The Suffolk County district attorney’s office argues that allowing judges to overrule that statutory wage, however, takes the “serious constitutional failure” and “turns it into a moral demand for judicial intervention, impermissibly blurring the line between enforcing constitutional rights and assuming the powers of the Legislature.” 
$1 billion tobacco verdict under review – November 5 
Philip Morris wants a new trial for a case that involves the largest ever jury award in the history of Massachusetts – in which a Middlesex County Superior Court jury handed down $8 million in compensatory damages and $1 billion in punitive damages – for the 2017 lung cancer death of Barbara Fontaine. 
After three-weeks of proceedings in late 2022, the jury found Philip Morris liable for Fontaine’s death at 60 years old, after 40 years of smoking Phillip Morris cigarettes. But the tobacco company argues among other things that the scale of punitive damages, which the judge reduced to just over $56 million, was constitutionally excessive and demonstrated that the jury was motivated by passion and prejudice. 
“The award is unprecedented from just about any perspective,” Philip Morris argues in its court filing. Focusing on this case, it added, “there was no justification for an award 125 times the $8 million compensatory award.” If an award is so exaggerated that it indicates a jury could be acting from a place of bias or prejudice, just reducing the amount is not enough to make the proceedings fair, the company asserts. 
Fontaine’s estate argues that the trial court judge concluded the award came after the highly educated jury listened attentively to weeks of testimony and asked thoughtful questions. It also argues that the verdict considered what it would take to deter such behavior given the company’s enormous wealth. Philip Morris’s “generational campaign to deceive and create fatally addicted addicts out of Americans worked,” the filing notes. “Preventing similar future conduct would save millions of lives.” 
Other massive punitive awards were reduced but did not lead to a new trial, like a $3 billion award in a 2005 California suit against Philip Morris, which was reduced to $50 million, the estate adds. 
Along with whether the company is entitled to a new trial, the court will consider whether trial judges generally should impose safeguards to avoid excessive damages, and whether the jury should have been told about federal law stating that cigarette labeling is considerate adequate to warn consumers about the risks of smoking.

But with more financial troubles looming, lawmakers say there’s more work to be done to protect reproductive health services.","In summary
An injection of public funding means the nonprofit organization can keep primary care clinics operating. But with more financial troubles looming, lawmakers say there’s more work to be done to protect reproductive health services. 


After months of financial strain, Planned Parenthood will get a $140 million lifeline to offset losses it sustained after Congress in July cut funding for the health system, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Thursday.
The money will help Planned Parenthood keep 109 California clinics open. In a statement, Newsom said the move reflects the state’s continued commitment to abortion and reproductive health care.
“Trump’s efforts to defund Planned Parenthood put all our communities at risk as people seek basic health care from these community providers,” Newsom said.
Lawmakers will also take up the issue in January when the Legislature reconvenes.
The news comes a week after the nonprofit organization announced it would eliminate primary care at clinics in Orange and San Bernardino counties. Five other clinics also closed in July in the Bay Area, Santa Cruz and Central Valley, all in response to federal defunding.
Planned Parenthood needs roughly $27 million monthly to operate all of its local facilities, according to Jodi Hicks, president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, the organization’s statewide advocacy group.
“We’re incredibly grateful that we’ve found a way to get some funding out to our Planned Parenthood health centers so they can remain operating and continue services,” Hicks said. 
California is the fourth state, following Washington, Colorado and New Mexico, to pledge public funds to keep Planned Parenthood afloat. Lawmakers in Oregon and New York are also considering similar moves.
Republicans have lambasted and targeted Planned Parenthood for decades over contraceptive and abortion services. A 1977 law banned federal funding for abortions, but this summer President Donald Trump took additional steps to cut down the nation’s largest abortion provider.
His sweeping tax and budget bill prohibited Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid dollars for any kinds of services, including mammograms, pap smears, birth control and sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment.
According to Planned Parenthood, abortions account for less than 10% of its services, while other reproductive health services make up the bulk of medical care provided.
Federal funding losses have forced Planned Parenthood to close clinics across the country, where half of all patients rely on Medicaid. In California, where 80% of Planned Parenthood patients have Medicaid – known as Medi-Cal in the state – the losses are even greater.
“There was definitely an outsized impact on California,” Hicks said.
Primary care closures ripple across the state
Democratic lawmakers, Newsom and Planned Parenthood have spent most of the year searching for a funding solution that protects reproductive health access without cash from federal coffers. But, faced with a multibillion-dollar state deficit, solutions have been slow to appear and challenging to maintain.
“We’ll fight like hell to maintain access to care in the coming months and years,” said Assembly Majority Leader Cecilia Aguiar-Curry, a Davis Democrat who leads the Legislative Women’s Caucus,
Even with the state’s pledge to protect sexual and reproductive health care, Planned Parenthood clinics face growing uncertainty driven by federal grant freezes, lawsuits and even some proposed state cuts.
Last week, Planned Parenthood in Orange and San Bernardino counties announced facilities would close primary care services on Dec. 13. The group, which runs nine health centers, added primary care more than a decade ago to serve low-income patients unable to find appointments elsewhere. 
Dr. Janet Jacobson, medical director of the Orange and San Bernardino counties clinics, said the federal actions are “destroying our primary care program.” She said she worries patients with urgent mental health needs or chronic conditions won’t be able to quickly find another provider. Many communities in the region have too few doctors, according to state data.
Roughly 13,000 patients will lose access to care and Planned Parenthood will lay off 77 staff.
“It’s inhumane to take away people’s health care,” Jacobson said. “Folks that have Medi-Cal should be able to see the provider of their choice for primary care.”
Aguiar-Curry called the loss of primary care “unacceptable and dangerous.” 
Seeking stability as ‘financial cliff’ still looms
Farther north, Planned Parenthood Mar Monte — which runs 30 health centers along the California coast, Central Valley and Nevada — closed five health centers in July shortly after Trump blocked Planned Parenthood’s funding.
Mar Monte Chief of Staff Andrew Adams said the organization has been working to maintain its financial stability. The closures helped preserve services at the organization’s other clinics until the end of the year, but Adams warned that it could hit a “financial cliff” in January. 
“We are planning for an environment where there is no federal funding,” Adams said. “What that looks like is having to potentially charge patients some amount of money for services we provide.”
Other Planned Parenthood groups in the state are exploring ways to cut costs and boost revenue while keeping clinics open for patients.
Dr. Neda Ashtari, a former Planned Parenthood and Medi-Cal patient, emphasized the importance of ensuring more than 1 million patients continue to have access to cancer screenings and other reproductive health services. When Ashtari was a teenager, her mother died of breast cancer after missing routine scans that could have detected the cancer earlier, she said.
“It really crystallizes that this preventative care is the difference between life or death,” Ashtari said.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Last summer, on his way to the Rich County rodeo, Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz stopped at a gas station in Evanston, Wyoming. Taking the out-of-state route allowed him to do two things — to buy a couple of lottery tickets, which are banned in Utah, and fill up his gas tank while saving 26 cents per gallon.
The gas price disparity across state lines had been on his mind before then, he said in a social media post in August, where he hinted at a legislative proposal to help find a relief. 
“A big reason is that Utah refineries produce up to 220,000 barrels a day, but about 75,000 of those are shipped out of state to meet demand elsewhere in the West—pushing our prices higher here at home,” Schultz wrote then.

A few months have passed since that post, and more details about the plan Schultz has worked on alongside Rep. Cal Roberts, R-Draper, and Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Highland, have emerged. It has to do with a longstanding tax practice for fuel exported out of state.
Currently, Utah has a $0.385 tax rate per gallon for motor fuel sold at gas pumps in the state, but has an exemption for fuel exported out of state.
A draft bill is still in the works, Roberts said, and may be introduced during the 2026 legislative session to, essentially, reassess the state’s gas tax structure.
“The idea would be, we’re going to remove that tax exemption, that special tax break that they get for (the) product that leaves the state, and we’re going to tax all fuel the same,” Roberts said. “And then by doing that, we’re going to be able to lower the gas tax for Utahns at the pump.”
How so? 
By also lowering that $0.385 tax rate that Utahns pay for fuel.
Removing the tax exemption would have an impact on Utah refineries’ ability to export their product out of state, Roberts said. “But you’re going to create enough revenue where you can drop the gas tax for Utahns in the state. And I think we’re looking at dropping the gas tax 25% to 50%.” 
That would translate to a price reduction of 10 to 20 cents per gallon, he added.
Since the bill language isn’t yet public, the Utah Petroleum Association didn’t have much to say about its position; however, Rikki Hrenko-Browning, president of the group, said in a prepared statement that “altering the state’s gas tax and other related taxes will have significant financial implications for the state of Utah. Until we have bill language that clearly lays out what the legislature wants to do, we won’t speculate on what the exact nature of those impacts will be.”
The association remains committed to conversations with lawmakers to share potential impacts on any proposals they may pursue, she added.
Regional pricing
According to the American Automobile Association, as of Thursday, the average gas price in Utah was $3.31 a gallon, over the $3.07 national average. 
In neighboring Wyoming, that’s normally cheaper with an average of $2.97 per gallon reported Thursday. Meanwhile, Colorado saw a $2.93 average. However, other surrounding states had higher gas prices on the same day. Idaho reported an average of $3.42 a gallon; Nevada had $3.80 and Arizona, $3.36. 
Roberts pointed to rural bordering counties, like San Juan in southeastern Utah, which had a $3.49 average per gallon on Thursday, while Montezuma in southwestern Colorado reported an average of $2.95.



Let us know what you think...


 


He argued that while Utah produces more gas than it consumes, prices aren’t competitive because of regional market influences. 
As other Western states like California move away from fossil fuels, leading refineries to shut down, Utah’s oil production grew 13% to 65.1 million barrels in 2024, the highest annual production on record, according to the Kem C. Gardner Policy Institute. 
“When supply goes down, or supply is not as much, what happens to price? Price goes up,” Roberts said. “And those higher prices in Nevada, California, Washington, Oregon, they’ve had a vacuum effect, where they’ve sucked barrels out of our state, because our refineries are chasing the higher margins of these other states, and it’s increasing our prices.”
Industry pushback 
An anonymous petition is circulating online opposing the proposal, arguing that “there’s no proof this would actually lower prices for Utah drivers—but it would create new costs and red tape for the energy producers who power our state.”
The refining industry, the petition says, is already dealing with global instability, market pressures and other regulatory burdens. “The last thing we need is more government interference in an industry that keeps Utah running,” petitioners wrote. 
Schultz responded to that request with an eye-rolling emoji, saying the legislative proposal would shift the tax burden off Utahns and onto oil refiners.
“These are some of the largest companies in Utah, and the world, and they’ve fought for decades to avoid paying their fair share, all while Utah families face some of the highest gas prices in the country,” Schultz wrote in a post.
Roberts is on the same page.
While he’s happy the refineries are doing well and help keep prices relatively low, he believes they get a lot of tax breaks that are paid by Utahns.
“We think it’s fair to Utahns to re-examine those tax breaks and those tax exemptions that these guys are enjoying,” Roberts said, “and then using some of that to lower the gas tax at the pump for Utahns.”

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia House Speaker Don Scott (D-Portsmouth) on Thursday called lawmakers back to Richmond for a special session Monday afternoon, setting off speculation that Democrats are preparing to act on redistricting plans just days before voters elect a new governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and all 100 members of the House of Delegates.
In a letter to legislators, Scott cited constitutional provisions and joint resolutions authorizing the General Assembly to reconvene the 2024 Special Session I “to consider matters properly before the ongoing session and any related business laid before the body.”
The House will meet at 4 p.m. Monday in the Capitol chamber, he wrote, adding that the clerk’s office will soon provide logistical details.
“My office has spoken with Senate leadership and has been assured that a similar communication … will be made by the Senate Clerk’s Office to Senate members,” Scott wrote.
He did not explain why the legislature is being recalled, and neither he nor Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell (D-Fairfax) responded to inquiries from The Mercury on Thursday.
Redistricting speculation
Several Democrats and legislative staffers told Virginia Scope that part of the session’s focus will be redistricting — a move that could reopen debate over how Virginia’s 11 congressional boundaries are drawn. Six of these are currently held by Democrats, and sources told the outlet that Democrats in Washington believe a new map could yield at least two additional Democratic-leaning seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Maryland senator introduces bill to redraw congressional districts in response to Texas

Virginia voters in 2020 approved a constitutional amendment creating an independent redistricting commission of lawmakers and citizens, but the panel deadlocked in late 2021, leaving the Virginia Supreme Court to draw the current maps.
With Democrats now holding narrow control of both legislative chambers, some strategists have discussed using their majorities to revisit that framework.
Options under discussion include breaking up heavily Democratic districts to make them more competitive while reshaping Republican-leaning areas to favor Democratic candidates.
Timing is key — under Virginia’s amendment process, a constitutional change must be approved twice by the General Assembly with a House election in between before being placed on the ballot for voter approval or rejection.
According to Virginia Scope, Democratic leaders are considering an initial vote before the Nov. 4 election, followed by a second vote during the 2026 session, potentially allowing a referendum next spring and new maps no sooner than April — two months before congressional primaries.
Still, many Democratic lawmakers remain uneasy about the plan. Senate Democrats held a caucus meeting Wednesday night, and several members told the outlet they had been “kept out of the loop” about the special-session agenda.
National backdrop
Across the country, redistricting battles are intensifying as both parties look to lock in advantages ahead of the 2026 midterms.
Earlier on Thursday, the New York Times reported that Virginia’s Democratic leaders are considering “joining a growing number of states” seeking to counter what they call partisan gerrymandering efforts encouraged by the administration of President Donald Trump.
“We are coming back to address actions by the Trump administration,” Surovell told the Times, suggesting Democrats view their move as a corrective to Republican-led redistricting maneuvers in states such as Texas, Florida and North Carolina.
Those states have recently pushed new maps designed to cement GOP control after a series of federal court rulings loosened constraints on mid-decade remapping. The Supreme Court is currently weighing a major redistricting case from Louisiana, another sign of how important the issue is to legislators and voters nationwide.

In August, Sen. Louise Lucas (D-Portsmouth) hinted publicly that Virginia could soon act. Sharing a post by former President Barack Obama on X, formerly Twitter, that praised California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s approach to mid-decade redistricting, Lucas wrote: “Every state in the nation should follow suit. Stay tuned for Virginia …”
Political fallout
Republicans swiftly accused Democrats of scheming to rewrite the rules ahead of a pivotal statewide election.
Republican Party of Virginia Chair Mark Peake, a state senator from Lynchburg, in a video on X characterized Scott’s move a sign of Democratic desperation.
“Desperate Democrats are pulling a pathetic, political stunt,” Peake said, accusing the majority of “doing anything they can to take attention away from their horrible candidates.”
He added that “the General Assembly hopes they can do something with this ruse about redistricting,” but urged voters not to “fall for it.”
The campaign of Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the GOP nominee for governor, blamed Democratic contender Abigail Spanberger for supporting the idea of dissolving the independent commission.
“In a stunning display of arrogance, Abigail Spanberger wants to overrule the will of Virginia voters in favor of a cynical power grab,” campaign spokesperson Peyton Vogel said in a statement Thursday.
“She came out in favor of abolishing Virginia’s Independent Redistricting Commission and wants to hand control back to the politicians in Richmond so they can guarantee their own reelection. … It’s never been about the voters or what’s best for Virginia. It’s always been about what’s best for Abigail Spanberger,” the statement said.
Civil rights groups vow challenge to North Carolina’s new congressional maps

In an interview with WJLA in late August, however, Spanberger said she opposed mid-decade redistricting and warned against “politicians trying to tilt the playing field in their favor,” aligning herself with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore’s call for fair-maps legislation.
And Democrats countered that they’re simply responding to an escalating nationwide power struggle over fair representation.
In a statement Thursday, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Courtney Rice said “House Republicans know they are poised to lose the majority because the public is souring on their failed agenda.”
She accused Republicans of “rigging the midterms by ramming through new, unpopular, gerrymandered maps across the country.” Rice added that Virginia’s move to reconvene and “preserve the right to consider a new map in 2026 is critical in the fight to ensure voters have fair representation,” praising state Democrats for “standing up against Republican attempts to weaken the power, and vote, of the people.”
What comes next
With the state legislature reconvening Monday afternoon, both chambers are expected to gavel in briefly before potentially taking up redistricting-related measures later in the week.
Procedural resolutions adopted earlier this year would allow lawmakers to address “matters properly before the ongoing special session,” giving Scott wide latitude to add topics to the agenda.
Any move to alter Virginia’s redistricting process would likely trigger intense legal scrutiny and political backlash — especially given the proximity to Election Day. But Democratic strategists across the country argue that Republican-led states have already rewritten maps to their advantage.

,California,2025-10-24 12:04:00+00:00,CalMatters,Should billionaires pay more? California unions want voters to decide,Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/10/billionaire-tax-initiative/,Labor and health care groups are collecting signatures to put a measure that would levy a one-time 5% tax on the wealth of about 200 billionaires in California.,"In summary
Labor and health care groups are collecting signatures to put a measure that would levy a one-time 5% tax on the wealth of about 200 billionaires in California. 


For years, Gov. Gavin Newsom has staunchly opposed increasing taxes on wealthy Californians even when the issue repeatedly reared its head during recent tough budget years. But faced with deep federal cuts to social services programs, labor and health care groups are asking voters to circumvent the governor – to tax a very small number of people.
Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West and St. John’s Community Health in Los Angeles want voters statewide to approve a “billionaires tax” to help prop up the state’s health care and education systems. 
The proposed ballot initiative would levy a one-time, 5% tax on the approximately 200 billionaires in the state, generating roughly $100 billion in revenue, according to proponents. 
Going to the ballot is a common move for advocacy groups frustrated with Sacramento politics, which, while dominated by Democrats, can still be factious. Dave Regan, president of SEIU-UHW, said at a news conference the ballot initiative is the “only solution anyone can see.” 
“We are facing literally a collapse of our health care system here in California and elsewhere,” Regan said. “This will help us keep health care facilities open. It will stabilize premiums and coverage for all Californians, protect health care jobs, and also improve public education.”
The proposed initiative would tax the 2025 net worth of billionaires residing in California, allowing them to pay off the obligation over five years. The revenue would go into a special fund with 90% reserved for health care spending and 10% reserved for K-12 education spending.
It needs 874,641 signatures to be placed before voters on the 2026 ballot, a number that the groups are confident they can reach. Getting voters to ultimately approve the tax, however, could be a hard sell.
While California has taxed the income of millionaires, lawmakers have never successfully passed a wealth tax. Instead of targeting earnings, the state would levy such a tax on the net worth of an individual, everything from investments to property value and even other assets, like jewelry and paintings. 
The governor is a big reason why. Newsom has never supported a wealth tax, at times angrily rejecting conservative efforts to link him with one as “shameful.” He quashed the most recent legislative effort last year. 
Democratic lawmakers this year had considered raising revenue to help support the state’s social services programs, which receive billions in federal funds annually, but pivoted to focus on Newsom’s Proposition 50 redistricting fight.
Regan said there are no plans to cut a deal with state lawmakers and pull the initiative from the ballot.
President Donald Trump’s sweeping tax reform and budget bill — the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — is projected to cut nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid over a decade. California is estimated to lose roughly $30 billion in federal Medicaid funds annually as a result. The state’s Medicaid agency estimates 3.4 million people will lose coverage as a result of federal eligibility changes.
The bulk of cuts won’t take effect until 2027. But states, including California, are already taking steps to shrink their health insurance programs for low-income and disabled individuals. 
California lawmakers facing a $12 billion deficit earlier this year made cuts to the state’s insurance program for immigrants without legal status, including a partial enrollment freeze that starts Jan. 1. They also reinstituted the Medi-Cal asset test, which limits how much enrollees can have in property value and savings.
Susan Shelley, vice president of communications with the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, said most Californians will probably assume that the tax will not affect them, but establishing a wealth tax in the state could create a troubling precedent. 
“We tax income at a very high level, but we don’t tax wealth and assets,” Shelley said. Nearly half of the state’s personal income tax revenue comes from just 1% of the state’s earners. Over time, she added, a wealth tax “could come all the way down to the middle class and they say you have too much equity in your house and we’re taking it.” 
Shelley also said the proposed initiative would incentivize billionaires to leave the state, creating a “huge hole in the state budget” that would hurt the economy in the long term. 
Proponents of the measure disagreed with that characterization of the proposal. They said that it would not levy taxes on the middle class nor would it affect businesses because it targets the net worth of ultrawealthy individuals. 
Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at UC Berkeley and supporter of the proposal, said the tax is structured to prevent billionaires from avoiding the bill simply by leaving the state.
It would tax their wealth established in 2025, and any billionaires who moved to the state in 2026 would not be subject to the levy.
“California billionaires are not going to be able to avoid the tax by moving their assets outside of California,” Saez said.

,California,2025-10-24 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,California’s gerrymander and generational rift could shake up its Democratic hierarchy,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/california-gerrymander-democratic-hierarchy/,"If Prop 50 succeeds, Democrats' votes will be spread more thinly to five more congressional districts at the same time younger candidates challenge senior-age incumbents.","Democratic politicians throughout California — those already in office and those who want in — assume that voters will rearrange the state’s 52 congressional districts next month and create new career opportunities.
The assumption is well grounded. A recent CBS News poll found 62% of the state’s likely voters, driven by disdain for President Donald Trump, will enact Proposition 50, a plan to shift five more congressional seats to Democrats even though they already have 43.
Gov. Gavin Newsom’s gerrymander would offset pro-Republican redistricting schemes in Texas and other states that Trump seeks to retain, or perhaps expand, the GOP’s paper-thin majority in the House next year.
With Prop. 50 seemingly a slam-dunk, current Democratic congressional members and wannabes are trying to sort out who will run for what — no small feat. To create the new seats, the Democrats’ political cartographers have to spread the party’s 10.4 million voters more thinly, reducing its margins in districts it already holds.
California also is not immune to the Democrats’ generational conflict, in the wake of their loss to Trump last year after an aged and obviously impaired President Joe Biden dropped out.
Politico declares that “fully half of the state’s older House Democrats are set to face same-party challengers next year…”
The most interesting example is in San Francisco, where 85-year-old Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker who has held her congressional seat for nearly 40 years, has already drawn two primary opponents even though she hasn’t announced whether she’ll run again.
First in was 39-year-old Saikat Chakrabarti, a former campaign aide and staffer to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, typifying the young progressives who have chafed at their party’s geriatric leadership.
His candidacy forced the issue for state Sen. Scott Wiener, who at 55 is no spring chicken. He has been waiting patiently for years for Pelosi to retire.  Wiener declared his candidacy this week, telling the New York Times, “The world changes. I made a decision that it makes sense for me to get into the race now because I’m passionate about San Francisco having the best possible representation.”
Pelosi won’t announce her intentions until after Prop. 50 is decided. But if she does retire, she likely wants to choose her successor — which is how she got her congressional seat in 1987.
San Francisco politics have a long history of control by a few powerful factions, most prominently one created in the 1950s by Willie Brown, brothers Phillip and John Burton and George Moscone.
The Burtons both served in Congress. John Burton was a long-time legislative leader and Moscone, then the city’s mayor, was assassinated in 1978.
Brown, now 91 and the only one of them still alive, wields massive influence in the city, after being the longest-tenured Assembly speaker and winning two terms as mayor. He was instrumental in the careers of  Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris.
Pelosi, born into a powerful political family in Baltimore, continued the family business in 1963 after marrying Paul Pelosi, scion of an influential San Francisco family, and moving to his city.
She integrated into the Brown-Burton-Moscone organization. When Phillip Burton died in 1983, his widow, Sala, took over his congressional seat and then, before dying in 1987, designated Pelosi as her successor.
San Francisco media have speculated that if Pelosi steps down, she might favor Connie Chan, a city supervisor, as her successor, noting that Chan was the only local official to speak alongside Pelosi at a recent Prop. 50 rally. However, it’s also been rumored that daughter Christine Pelosi might want to succeed her mother.
That’s the way things have gone in San Francisco for decades. Will it continue or is evolution in the air?",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/080825-Texas-Democrats-Presser-FG-CM-11.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-24 08:16:31.953455

Nevada is 1 of 24 states that doesn’t dedicate funding in its state budget for after-school or summer programs, meaning organizations rely on precarious federal funding and finite philanthropic dollars. 
Children’s advocacy groups and after school networks, which see the benefits of after-school programs such as increasing literacy rates and reducing chronic absenteeism, have often discussed internally how state funding would make after-school programs available to more Nevada children.
“We could impact thousands of more students with appropriated money through the state Legislature,” said Jodi Manzella, the executive director of Southern Nevada based After-School All-Stars Las Vegas.
Nevada is routinely at or near the bottom of lists gauging education outcomes and achievement, while also seeing a surge in chronic absenteeism and other conditions which hinder student performance.
After-school programs in the state, as well as across the country, have shown to fill the gaps and increase literacy rates or math scores through tutoring and other educational programing, said Kendra Gipson with Nevada Afterschool Network Youth 
”Youth who attend after-school programs are more likely to graduate high school,” Gipson said. “Youth that attend after school programs don’t struggle with absenteeism, like their peers.”
Manzella said there have been schools that saw 30% chronic absenteeism before After-School All-Stars began offering programs that have seen rates cut in half. 
The principals at those schools say they “can directly tie some of that result to the students that are in All- Stars.”
”They come to school every day because they want to be there” for the program, Manzella said. “Testing scores will increase for the kids that are in All-Stars because they get 300 additional contact hours with educators throughout the year.”
These programs also become a “lifeline” for students who might not have access to other extracurricular activities or tutoring programs, and also decrease involvement in the justice system, said Annette Dawson Owens with the Children’s Advocacy Alliance of Nevada.
“The return on investment has shown that it’s much easier to invest in students on the front end than to do some of those costly expenses on the back end,” Dawson Owens said. 
Child care in the state is also among the most expensive, which can hinder working parents.  More, and free, after school programs “means that those parents can also go to work,” Gipson said. 
Afterschool Alliance released its “America After 3 p.m.” report this month that found 29.6 million families want afterschool programs but just 7 million children are enrolled.
Roughly 65,000 children in Nevada are in after-school programs, but nearly 229,000 would participate in programs if available, according to the report. 
In a survey of 415 households in Nevada asking what barriers prevented them from after school programs, nearly half said there wasn’t a program in their community, 60% said programs are too expensive, and 60% said they lacked a safe way to get to and from programs. 
Though After-School All-Stars, one of the many programs in the state, has expanded to 21 schools in Southern Nevada and serves about 2,000 students every day, it’s obviously far from enough, Manzella said.
“We know that there are many more students out there that need support,” Manzella said. “We have waiting lists for students that would like to participate with us, and our barrier is funding.”
The Schwarzenegger of it all
President Donald Trump announced over the summer his administration would withhold $6 billion in funding nationwide for after-school and summer programs, worrying many Nevada organizations that provide resources. Nevada was at risk of losing about $60 million.  
“If those dollars were zeroed out, like they said they were going to be, then programs would have closed,” said Gipson, adding an estimated 11,000 students across the state “would not have been able to attend a program because of those dollars.”
After bipartisan backlash against Trump withholding the money, the administration changed course and released the funding.
The federal funding for the next fiscal cycle isn’t expected to change, Gipson said.
“We are always trying to advocate for an increase because of the students that are still waiting to enroll” in these after-school programs,” she added. 
After-school programs, whether administered by nonprofits or through city-run programs, rely on federal funding and philanthropic dollars to survive in Nevada. The current funding sources not only mean thousands of children can’t access these programs, but funding streams for those programs that are accessible are unstable. 
Federal grant dollars are competitive and usually organizations are competing for the same pot of money, Gipson said. 
Like many other states, Nevada used funds provided by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 enacted during the Biden administration to expand and enhance existing programs. But those dollars only provided short-term assistance. 
“Many nonprofits, and not just ours, are feeling the effects of that covid funding going away.” Manzella said.
With tourism revenue down and the state experiencing economic uncertainty, “corporations here in Nevada, when their earnings are down and their revenue is down, they’re not able to give as much in turn,” she said
Afterschool Alliance found that “state-level funding for afterschool and summer learning programs has increased twenty fold since 2000, with 26 states now collectively providing more than $5 billion in funding for local programs.”
While there have been policy discussions within organizations that comprise an after school network, Gipson was unsure what larger policy discussions are happening with state lawmakers about providing a dedicated funding as is found in half the other states in the country. 
Manzella and Gipson pointed to states like California, which passed a ballot initiative in 2002 to fund after-school programs. The reason it was successful was because former Republican California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger championed the efforts, they said. 
“We need a champion or two in this state that realizes the impact of after school, wants every child to have the opportunity to do that, and starts looking at legislation to get a state item in our budget,” Gipson said. 
Neither Gipson nor Manzella knew of any estimate of the cost reducing the number of students waiting. 
At the After-School All-Stars, for example, it cost around $140,000 “to run a school for the full year for approximately 120 kids,” Manzella said. 
But not all after school programs are equal or offer the same types of programming, so costs will vary.
“Even starting off small would give the opportunity to more students that are on waiting lists,” Manzella said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/6SzRhrow-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-24 08:16:31.953455

(Photos courtesy of candidates; graphic by Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Voters in Cullman County will go to the polls Tuesday to elect a new representative in the House District 12 special election.
Voters in the district, which covers part of Cullman County, will choose between GOP nominee Cindy Myrex and Democratic nominee Matt Glover. The seat became vacant after former Rep. Corey Harbison, R-Cullman, resigned in April. Harbison was absent for much of the 2025 legislative session.
The district is solidly Republican. Harbison took over 85% of the vote in his re-election campaign in 2022. Multiple messages seeking comment from Myrex were left in the last week.
The candidates
Myrex, 58, campaigned on listening to constituents, improving mental health care in public schools and economic growth. Voters told Myrex they were concerned about a new state law that would allow the city of Cullman, a wet city, to annex land from Cullman County, a dry county, for a “community development project” to serve alcohol. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The law drew criticism from Democratic and Republican candidates in this election and the House District 11 election. Cullman County did not have representation in the House after Harbison resigned in April and Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview, resigned in February to work for Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman.
Gudger, who co-sponsored the legislation, pre-filed a bill on Aug. 1 to repeal the law, which goes into effect on Oct. 1. Myrex supports the repeal bill, which cannot begin going through the lawmaking process until the Legislature returns in January. 
Glover, 41, said in an interview Friday that he is prioritizing eliminating state sales tax on groceries, a lottery to fund public education and expanding Medicaid. 
The Legislature this spring approved a cut in the state grocery tax from 3% to 2%. 
Glover said that expanding Medicaid has become a bigger priority for him since President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) into law in July. 
“Expanding Medicaid to try to offset the cuts that are coming from the federal bill to try to keep as many rural hospitals open as possible, and try to help with the independent doctors offices and pharmacies,” Glover said. 

Campaign finances

According to campaign finance records, Myrex raised over $157,000 and spent almost $153,000. Since Myrex was selected as the GOP nominee in August, she’s raised over $57,000. Over 62% of those funds have come from political action committees (PACs). During the primary, most of Myrex’s funds came from businesses and individuals.
According to campaign finance records, Glover has raised about $4,000 and spent about $3,500. Glover has gotten 180 donations, most of which are less than $20, from across the country.

Attorney General Dana Nessel announced Frank Prezzato, 69, of St. Clair Shores was sentenced on Wednesday after pleading guilty in September to one count of voting absentee and in person, previously acknowledging that he acted recklessly in voting twice during the same election. 
“Voting twice undermines our democratic process,” Nessel said in a previous statement. “My office will continue to prosecute those who violate our voting laws to ensure Michigan voters have confidence in the integrity of our elections.”
According to the Department of Attorney General, Prezatto appeared in person to vote on Election Day after having previously submitted a ballot for the same election. He was among seven people charged in the St. Clair Shores’ double-voting case, although five others had their cases dismissed, four of which are being appealed by the AG’s office.
A seventh person, Stacey Kramer, 56, was bound over to circuit court where a trial is set for Feb. 3, 2026.
If Prezatto meets the terms of his probation, all charges will be dismissed with prejudice at the end of his probationary period. 
A delayed sentence review for Prezatto is scheduled for April 15, 2026, in the 16th Circuit Court in Macomb County.

Sears/Maryland Matters)The statue honoring Baron Johann Dekalb is looking a little different lately.
The 139-year old bronze statue on the south side of the State House grounds is missing the blade of Dekalb’s sword. Instead of looking like he’s leading troops into battle, the Revolutionary War hero, clasping just the sword handle, looks a bit like an old man shaking his fist at the sky.
Fear not.
The removal is part of regular conservation efforts rather than theft or vandalism of the monument.
“The statue was conserved in June of this year, and during that process, it was determined that the replacement sword blade on the statue needed to be removed due to condition issues,” Chris Kintzel, director of the Maryland Commission on Artistic Property, said in an email.

“The statute receives conservation funding from the Maryland Military Monument Commission, and we work in conjunction with the Maryland Historical Trust/Maryland Department of Planning to arrange for its treatment, which is typically every two-three years,” Kintzel’s email said. “We are currently working with our partners to coordinate the installation of one of the replacement blades.”
Dekalb – or De Kalb as it is spelled on the monument and various reputable historical records — was a French general who fought with the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.
He served with Gen. George Washington at Valley Forge and was second in command under Horatio Gates in the Carolina campaign. Dekalb led troops from Maryland and Delaware during the battle of Camden in South Carolina. He was wounded multiple times during that battle and died days later as a result.
Ephraim Keyser, a Marylander considered to be a prominent sculptor in his time, was hired to create the monument. The Dekalb monument is considered a “significant example” of Keyser’s work, according to Maryland Historical Trust records.
The monument, dedicated in August 1886, cost 10,000 (more than $300,000 in 2025). Congress paid for the granite and bronze memorial, according to the Maryland Historical Trust.
The sword blade itself is removable. The one that was removed this summer during conservation work was not the original, Kintzel said.
The original blade was vandalized twice in 1990, according to the Maryland Historical Trust. Kintzel added that the blade was stolen that year.
That same year, five replacement blades made of fiberglass were made, according to Kintzel.

Launched by President Joe Biden’s administration in 2023, Welcome Corps allowed people in the United States to sponsor refugees.
“When it opened, all the Burmese, they were so excited,” she said. 
The group put money in a bank account for the expected refugee. Then in January, the program abruptly shut down. “We’re just waiting. That’s all we can do now,” Hlamyo said. 
Welcome Corps is just one facet of refugee resettlement in America that President Donald Trump changed dramatically when he began his second term Jan. 20. As part of a larger withdrawal from international humanitarian aid, Trump signed an executive order halting the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. The State Department also ended funding to local resettlement nonprofits, though a lawsuit later restored some of that money. 
Across the country, nonprofits have closed their refugee resettlement programs or are looking for new funding sources, with many waiting to see if the pipeline will reopen. 
Following the federal Refugee Act of 1980, the U.S. built a formidable bureaucracy to resettle people who face persecution abroad. Federal agencies vet applicants, many of whom live in refugee camps scattered across the globe. Once approved, a network of nonprofits uses federal funds to help newly arrived refugees get on their feet. 
Trump’s re-election last year reflects a growing animosity among Western countries toward globalization. The president has denounced international institutions like the United Nations, which partners with the U.S. and other countries to resettle refugees. 
This year’s federal budget bill made refugees without a green card ineligible for benefits including the federal food assistance program. It also affected their eligibility for full Medicaid benefits and the Children’s Health Insurance Program.
Bonnie Gay of Princeton Alliance Church in New Jersey has seen the impact of refugees whose arrivals have been blocked.
 “Every story is one of trauma and loss,” said Gay, who leads the church’s Alliance for Refugees. “They come seeking safety and a fresh start where they can put down roots in a place of welcome and peace.”
 No money for the American Dream

Some nonprofits ended their refugee resettlement programs entirely. 
Connecticut’s flagship resettlement agency, Integrated Refugee and Immigrant Services, lost $4 million in federal funding. As a result, the agency closed offices in Hartford and New Haven.
War drove a University of Connecticut student to flee from Baghdad, Iraq with her family. IRIS supplied the refugee family with food, a studio apartment and legal counsel upon their arrival. 
The second-year student, who requested anonymity, said she fears ongoing deportations, but feels supported in her new hometown of New Haven and within the community she built at the University of Connecticut. A university sorority, Mu Sigma Upsilon, held a donation drive for IRIS in late September. 
“I am grateful for the education and opportunities America has given me,” she said.
Some organizations diversified their income streams to continue offering services to refugees years after their arrival. 
Trump’s executive order contends the U.S. can’t absorb large numbers of immigrants — particularly refugees — “in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans, that protects their safety and security and that ensures the appropriate assimilation of refugees.”
Hillary Baez, the refugee services assistant program manager of Catholic Charities of Southwest Kansas saw the changes coming. “Our organization basically took that as an initiative to try and find other sources of funding to ask for more donations from our donors,” she said. 
The organization opened a thrift store and has plans to open three more “as just another way for us to keep ourselves running,” Baez said. 
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, one of 10 national organizations that partnered with the federal government to distribute resettlement funds, announced in April it would end its partnership. Two Catholic Charities affiliates — Northeast Kansas and Central and Northern Missouri — were among those that ended their local refugee resettlement programs. 
When Catholic Charities of Central and Northern Missouri in Jefferson City dissolved its refugee services in March, three of its employees moved to City of Refuge in nearby Columbia.  
Refugees that the organization helped were directed to City of Refuge and Della Lamb Community Services, another nonprofit, in Kansas City. 
Visitors touring City of Refuge on a recent morning saw civics classes where refugees prepared for the citizenship test with questions like: If the president and vice president are unable to serve, who takes over? Touring guests knew the answer (the speaker of the House) but couldn’t recall the current speaker’s name. 
“Mike Johnson,” a man seated in the class said under his breath. 
Cing Cing Hlamyo weighs ginger roots for a customer on Sept. 30 at Shwe Market International Foods in Columbia (photo by Annie George).
City of Refuge has continued to provide citizenship classes even as the Trump administration cut federal funding for similar services to other organizations. Up to $500,000 in federal funding for the nonprofit will expire in October 2026, and it’s not clear what federal funding will be available after. Because of that, the City of Refuge is looking to diversify its financial support.
Hlyamo is one example of what those who have benefited from City of Refuge have accomplished.
By many accounts, Hlamyo, one of more than 3.6 million refugees who entered the U.S. in the last 50 years, achieved the American dream. 
She was five months pregnant and owned one jacket when she and her husband arrived, their 18-month-old daughter in tow, in November 2009 to face their first Midwest winter. 
Growing up in Myanmar was fraught. Hlamyo watched soldiers beat her father – the military wanted use of his truck, but its engine was broken. They forced her family into unpaid labor. 
Hlamyo now enjoys the fruits of her hard work in America. The mother of four owns an Asian grocery store, one of the few places in mid-Missouri where shoppers can find frozen octopus, bitter melon, jackfruit chips and South Asian specialties. Her eldest daughter is applying for college.  
 No help for 2025 arrivals 

A court order required the Trump administration to admit refugees who had approved applications and confirmed travel plans by Jan. 20. 
An attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, which sued on behalf of resettlement agencies and refugees, said 70-100 people entered the country as a result of the injunction. 
Baez said Catholic Charities of Southwest Kansas welcomed three refugees from Eritrea, in East Africa, after Jan. 20 because the group already had flights to the US. 
However, federal funding cuts meant they couldn’t get assistance previously available to recent arrivals. Catholic Charities of Southwest Kansas could still provide services such as employment and English assistance. 
Tatjana Bozhinovski, resettlement program director at Ethiopian Tewahedo Social Services in Columbus, Ohio, said her organization was affected by the executive order on day one.
A single mother with four children arrived on Jan. 17, and three days later, Bozhinovski had to tell the family that the nonprofit could no longer help them find housing, enroll kids in school or find jobs. 
“You can’t possibly do that if you have a heart and if you have a soul,” Bozhinovski said. Ethiopian Tewahedo Social Services lost 75% of its staff, many of them refugees, as a result of the federal money freeze. 
Some people with confirmed travel plans were still unable to enter following the executive order.  
Tyler Reeve of Community Refugee & Immigration Services in Columbus helped some members of a family arrive on Jan. 17. The rest were unable to enter, even though they were approved as refugees and had purchased plane tickets for February. The family is separated indefinitely. Layoffs left the organization with no full-time resettlement staff. 
Jewish Family Services in Columbus lost more than $2 million.
Tariq Mohamed, the nonprofit’s senior director of refugee services, welcomed a teenage boy and girl right before Jan. 20, expecting their parents and the rest of their siblings to arrive in February. The family doesn’t know when they will see each other again.
The nonprofit has been able to continue some of its other programs, including helping refugees already in the U.S. find employment, register their kids for school and get vaccines, as federal funding still exists for those.
From Oct. 1 to Jan. 20, Jewish Family Services resettled 184 people, doing an entire year’s worth of work in three months before the order passed, in anticipation of Trump’s actions. 
Under Biden’s administration, refugee admissions for the fiscal year 2024, which ended last October, reached 100,034, the highest annual total since 1995.
“It was a big, big ramp up over the last few years,” said Paul Costigan, Missouri’s state refugee coordinator. 
 Few new arrivals

A spokesperson for the State Department, which oversees the refugee resettlement program, did not provide numbers when asked how many refugees have entered the country since Trump took office this year. 
The Trump administration is considering a new annual ceiling of 7,500 for fiscal year 2026, which started Oct. 1, according to reporting by The New York Times.
The Missouri Office of Refugee Administration used to get monthly reports from the State Department on how many refugees to expect and how many ultimately arrived. Those reports ceased in January, said Costigan. 
Princeton Alliance Church in Plainsboro, New Jersey, established refugee services in 2023 with approval from the State Department. It welcomed 135 immigrants before the executive order. The church had expected another 100 people this year, but only 26 made it in the waning days of the Biden administration.
Two people scheduled to arrive in late January had their tickets canceled, said Gay, the executive director of the church’s Alliance for Refugees. 
Final Refugee Timeline_1022
 
Under previous administrations, Jewish Vocational Service was Kansas City’s largest refugee resettlement agency. In fiscal years 2023 and 2024, the agency resettled 409 and 630 refugees, respectively. Following Jan. 20, the agency has served only 60 new arrivals.
Reese Taw’s work at Jewish Vocational Service is personal. A member of Karen, an ethnic minority group in Myanmar, Taw and his family arrived in the U.S. as refugees when he was nine. A resettlement agency helped his family adjust to life in America. 
“I get to help the same people that were in my position a while ago because I can relate to the frustration,” Taw said. “Just being able to serve the community, as a whole, it’s fulfilling to me.”
Taw was one of 12 employees the nonprofit laid off in March. He was rehired, but the organization is grappling with funding loss. “We’ll try to survive as long as we can, but we’ll see what happens,” Taw said.
 States assume larger role

Looking to the future, Costigan of the Missouri refugee office predicts an overhauled refugee resettlement program where states have more control. Some states are already putting their own funding behind programs cut by the federal government.
New Jersey Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy created the state’s Office of New Americans in 2019, amid Trump’s first-term immigration crackdown. New Jersey had at least $1 million cut since Trump returned to office in January, state budget documents show. Murphy pledged to double the state’s support for its initiatives. 
New Jersey lawmakers this year boosted the state-run Refugee Resettlement Program to $29.5 million, six times greater than the previous year. The money goes to seven nonprofits, which offer refugees cash, case management, job assistance, health expenses and other aid. 
Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont signed a bill in March allocating $2.8 million to programs targeted by the Trump administration. IRIS, New Haven’s flagship resettlement agency, and another organization received a total of approximately $500,000.
People involved in refugee resettlement say the commitment from local communities has remained steady. 
Jewish Vocational Service saw an outpouring of support from the Kansas City community after losing its federal funding for refugee services.
At a September meeting in Joplin, a city of 53,000 in southwest Missouri, people from the fire department, community college and city government showed up to coordinate assistance for recently arrived refugees. 
“The community commitment is there,” Costigan said.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican former assemblyman hoping to be elected governor on Nov. 4, wants to pull New Jersey out of a multistate compact that boosts costs for fossil fuel plants in hopes the withdrawal will control recent rises in electricity rates.
Ciattarelli, who has made rising utility bills a focus of his campaign for the governorship, says it’s time for New Jersey to leave the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative again, arguing a program created in 2005 to limit emissions is now just boosting costs for Garden State ratepayers.
“That carbon tax initiative has been a failure. Air’s no cleaner. Electricity’s only more expensive,” Ciattarelli said at a debate last month. “By pulling out of RGGI, we can save half a billion dollars a year for ratepayers.”
Governor Murphy’s energy policy scrutinized as his two terms wrap up

The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative — or RGGI, pronounced Reggie — is a cap-and-trade system meant to lower greenhouse gas emissions by requiring fossil fuel plants to purchase tradable emission allowances at annual auctions. In effect, member states require fossil fuel plants within their borders to pay to pollute.
The cost of purchasing those allowances is added to the cost of producing electricity, raising rates for fossil generators in RGGI states, which receive revenue from the sale of emission allowances.
The added costs have impacts at multiple levels. By raising operating costs for fossil generators, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative can direct grid demand to generators in other states that would be more expensive than those in New Jersey if not for the added cost of emission allowances, said Richard Tabors, president of energy consulting firm Tabors Caramanis Rudkevich.
In some cases, the dynamic results in increased emissions because the allowances can push costs for gas plants in RGGI states past those of coal plants in states not party to the initiative, leading the grid to use generators that create more pollution.
PJM Interconnection, which operates the grid used by New Jersey and 12 other states, selects power producers beginning with the lowest price and moving upward until it has drawn enough electricity to meet demand. That means some New Jersey plants run less often than competitors in non-RGGI states because of the cost of emission allowances.
“The way the math works out is that New Jersey, because it had the penalties on its high-quality [gas] units and gas prices went up again a little bit — a lot for a while — it meant that coal-fired generation in a state that did not have RGGI rules was supplying energy to the clean state of New Jersey,” said Tabors.

New Jersey has left RGGI before. Under Republican Gov. Chris Christie, the state pulled out of the initiative in 2011, then rejoined under the current governor, Phil Murphy. Murphy, a Democrat, leaves office in January.
RGGI was initially successful in reducing emissions by pushing power production away from the plants that produce the most pollution. Mostly, those were coal plants, and the last coal-fired generators in New Jersey closed in 2022.
Between 2009 and 2023, Delaware, Maryland, and New Jersey collectively reduced their carbon dioxide emissions by 46%, Tabors found in a February white paper.
But that dynamic reversed as New Jersey moved its generation toward natural gas and renewables. Because of the emission allowances and increases to the price of natural gas, among other factors, coal plants in Pennsylvania and other PJM states ran more often.
Tabor’s study estimates that in 2025, carbon dioxide emissions would rise by 2.9 million tons and electricity spending would increase by a net $436 million across the three RGGI states because of costs added by the initiative.
“The penalty was very much focused on coal-fired generation, and it was successful,” Tabors said. “Now, you have to ask the question: Is RGGI still doing what it was designed to do? For New Jersey, the answer is pretty clearly no.”
Because RGGI effectively levies a surcharge on some generators that is passed through to ratepayers, withdrawing from the program would necessarily reduce electricity costs, though the degree of savings is less clear.
There’s no guarantee that fossil generators that must buy emission allowances under RGGI would remove the full cost of those allowances from their prices if New Jersey withdraws from the program. Nothing apart from market forces would demand they do, and shifts in the price of natural gas and coal can already make RGGI gas plants cheaper than non-RGGI coal plants.
“It would definitely reduce the prices in the energy market, but I need to follow the ball a little further to see what happens after those prices go down,” said Brian Lipman, director of the state rate counsel division, which advocates for ratepayers on utility matters.
Most of the money generated by the sale of RGGI emission allowances is returned to participating states, though a small percentage is withheld to fund the organization that auctions off allowances.
The revenue can be significant. It brought New Jersey as much as $275 million in 2024, according to a New Jersey Monitor review of auction results.
Overwhelmingly, New Jersey has used that money to fund electric vehicle infrastructure and subsidize purchases of medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles, like buses, though significant portions have also gone to shore restoration, building electrification, and carbon sequestration.
The Board of Public Utilities could fund those programs through the state’s societal benefits charge, a separate surcharge applied to New Jersey utility bills, Lipman said.
More recently, revenue from the societal benefits charge and RGGI was tapped to directly reduce ratepayer bills through bill credits that will be applied to balances accrued in September and October. Murphy and other Democratic state leaders announced that plan earlier this year in response to anger about rising utility bills.
Ciattarelli’s campaign said the state could still fund those priorities absent RGGI revenue.
“The budget has gone up 70% in 8 years,” said Nick Poche, a campaign spokesperson. “The idea that we can’t prioritize how to better spend our money and make sure key priorities are taken care of is a false premise.”
Other states’ participation in RGGI could also change the impact of a withdrawal. At present, New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia are the only three PJM states to participate in the initiative. Ten states, all of them in the northeast and most run by Democrats, are enrolled in RGGI.
Pennsylvania sought to join the compact in 2022, but that bid has been marred by litigation that questions whether state regulators encroached on lawmakers’ constitutional taxing authority.
Electricity on PJM’s grid is sold along the entire 13-state market, and the financial benefits of New Jersey withdrawing from RGGI would be spread along that grid.
In the same vein, more states joining RGGI would limit its impact on the competitiveness of New Jersey plants, though there’s little indication elected leaders elsewhere would join the program as rates rise along the entirety of PJM’s grid.
“If Pennsylvania was in RGGI, they would have the same surcharge, and they would not be cheaper than the New Jersey plants,” said Lipman, whose office has not taken a formal position on RGGI.
The New Jersey Legislature’s composition — Democrats hold majorities in the Assembly and Senate — won’t directly impact efforts to withdraw from the compact. Republicans hope to gain control of the Assembly after November’s elections, but Senate seats are not on the ballot.
State law permits New Jersey to join RGGI but does not require it to do so, and it gives state energy regulators, rather than lawmakers, the authority to leave or join the initiative.
At present, three of the five Board of Public Utility seats are filled, including a seat held by Republican Commissioner Michael Bange. Confirmations could give a Ciattarelli governorship a majority on the regulator’s board.
It’s not clear how the board’s current members would respond to a gubernatorial push to withdraw from RGGI, nor is it clear whether the Democrat-held Senate would confirm Board of Public Utility nominees who would vote to depart from the compact.
The board’s commissioners serve six-year staggered terms. Bange’s term expires in 2030, while BPU President Christine Guhl-Sadovy’s term expires in 2029. Commissioner Zenon Christodoulou is set to remain until 2028.

Creating lasting livability is exactly what Vermont’s Act 181 aims to do.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Kati Gallagher: Decisions Vermonters make today will shape our communities for generations.","This commentary is by Kati Gallagher of Waterbury. She is sustainable communities program director for the Vermont Natural Resources Council.


From my home in Waterbury Center, Vermont, just a few steps across the street takes me to a park where I can walk my dog and (theoretically) play disc golf. A stroll behind my house brings me to our local pottery studio, and to the south, I can walk to a farmstand while listening to the community band practice on the green.
Hiking and mountain biking trails are also easily accessible from my house, and this proximity allows me to venture deep in the woods where Vermont’s breathtaking natural resources are on full display. This reality — being able to access a thriving community center and open spaces — is the magic that drew me to this corner of the world.
But these qualities that make Vermont communities desirable are slipping away. Rising costs and limited housing mean families can’t find homes near schools, shops or parks. Downtown businesses can’t keep staff because housing rentals are scarce and expensive. Farms are harder to hold onto due to increasing land costs, while forest habitat is being dissected by new driveways. As climate change-driven extreme weather hits harder, the way we build will either improve or hinder our resilience.
Land use ties it all together: it dictates whether or not communities can grow without losing their identity, whether or not families can afford to stay, and whether or not Vermont remains both livable and resilient for generations to come.
Creating lasting livability is exactly what Vermont’s Act 181 aims to do. Enacted in 2024, Act 181 was designed to address and modernize land use laws to help protect natural resources and working lands while advancing sustainable development. This law was built on years of research, study groups, and legislative debate focused on how to update the state’s land use and development law (Act 250) and align it with state investments and regional and local land use plans.
One of the most powerful tools Act 181 puts in our hands is regional future land use maps. In the past, these maps were largely advisory, used by Vermont’s regional planning commissions to illustrate where different areas might be designated for future growth or conservation. Now for the first time, they carry real regulatory weight by being tied to Act 250 jurisdiction and providing towns a path to seek exemptions from Act 250 review for downtowns and village centers.
In addition, the maps are tied to the State Designation Program, as the mapping process provides eligibility for state tax credits and grants to strengthen our downtowns and village centers. 
Act 181 also enhances protection of Vermont’s most critical natural resources and working lands. By requiring Act 250 review for projects outside of growth areas with especially long roads and driveways, the new law will discourage scattered development that fragments farmland and forests. Development projects that fall under Act 250 review will now assess their environmental impact on forest fragmentation and wildlife, encouraging better site design. And a current stakeholder process will identify which of the state’s most sensitive natural resources require environmental review.
In short: instead of letting growth scatter in ways that strain families, businesses and natural systems — and which requires sprawling infrastructure that costs more for local taxpayers to build and maintain — Act 181 helps communities plan for and invest in smarter, more intentional development to meet our housing needs.
The benefits of planning for sustainable and balanced growth are wide-ranging:

Stronger downtowns. Concentrating limited state funding and leveraging existing investments in historic downtowns helps local businesses succeed, supports public spaces, protects taxpayers and makes it easier for people to live close to what they need.
Connected neighborhoods. By streamlining permitting for housing in and around town and village centers, and designing those areas with sidewalks, bike lanes, and safe crossings, communities can create neighborhoods where young families can find starter homes, workers can rent affordably, older Vermonters can age in place, and everyone enjoys safe, convenient connections to schools, shops and services.
Resilient landscapes. Compact growth patterns protect farmland, forests and clean water, while reducing the emissions that come with long commutes.

But here’s the key: the land use maps that will shape future development in Vermont aren’t handed down from the Statehouse. They’re built through local conversations where residents bring their hopes and concerns to the table. Every Vermonter has a role to play.
In the months ahead, regional planning commissions (RPCs) will be asking you to help shape where growth should and shouldn’t go. Many RPCs have started, and Rutland RPC has already submitted their draft land use plan to the new Land Use Review Board for review. The Review Board will be analyzing compliance with the requirements of Act 181. Maps from the Chittenden County RPC and Northwest RPC will soon be submitted too.
The everyday magic of being able to walk to a park, grab fresh corn from a farmstand or catch up with neighbors at the store is what makes Vermont so special — and what Act 181 is designed to protect and strengthen. By showing up in these local conversations and taking an active role in community planning, we can ensure that the Vermont we pass on still feels like home: connected, vibrant and rooted in the landscapes that define us.
You can find more information through your regional planning commission or at the VNRC website.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A former landscaping supervisor at Auburn University filed a lawsuit against the school Tuesday, alleging the university fired him over social media posts related to the shooting of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk.
It is the second such lawsuit filed this month, following the university’s decision in September to fire an unspecified number of employees over social media posts related to Kirk. 
The lawsuit says that Kevin Courtwright, a former landscape supervisor who shared a Facebook post critical of Kirk, made comments that were “insensitive, offensive and inflammatory” but added that “that means they were exactly the type of speech the First Amendment protects.”
A spokesperson for Auburn University Thursday declined comment, citing a policy of not commenting on pending litigation.
The complaint names Auburn University President Christopher Roberts; Jim Carroll, vice president of facilities management for the university, and Loren Winn, the facilities human resources director for the school as defendants.
Following Kirk’s death on Sept. 10, Courtwright reposted a post on Facebook that condemned Kirk.
“So, Charlie Kirk was shot and killed at one of his events. The man who said that school shootings were just something worth living with in order to keep the 2nd amendment, who leaned into every single culture war issue to push hate and division, and who was making absurd claims about trans people being mass shooters at the time he was [Redacted], is likely going to be used for some justification to crack down on something by this regime,” the post said.
According to the lawsuit, after sharing the post, Courtwright posted “One fascist down; a whole socio-political movement go. FAFO nazi trash” to his Facebook page.
The complaint also said Courtwright reshared several other posts that condemned gun violence and Kirk’s death.
“No one should be shot, Charlie Kirk included. But let’s be real: Republican leaders crying crocodile tears about gun violence while BLOCKING every piece of gun reform are the reason it keeps happening. DOING NOTHING is the choice THEY have made,” said one of the posts shared by Courtwright.
On Sept. 15, the lawsuit said Courtwright’s wife, who is also an Auburn employee, was approached by Chris Hardman, a coordinator for behavioral threat assessment and management and Scott Forehand, director of compliance, investigations and security, to question her about her husband.
The complaint said Hardman and Forehand told Courtwright’s wife that a student filed a complaint about the Facebook posts and asked her what Courtwright would do if he “came upon a tabling event for Turning Point USA” on campus.
Turning Point USA is a non-profit organization founded by Kirk that advocates for conservative politics on high school, college and university campuses.
Courtwright alleges that after his wife was questioned, he was summoned by the facilities human resources office to speak with Clarence Stewart from Auburn’s security and compliance team.
During the meeting with Stewart, Courtwright said he was told that a complaint was made about his Facebook post and was questioned on if the post had any violent intent.
On Sept. 16, the lawsuit said Courtwright met with Winn to explain to her that there was a misunderstanding of his post. After explaining, he asked Winn if he would be fired.
Courtwright alleges that Winn told him that “Auburn tends not to move drastically, and she was inclined to think he would not be fired, but there was a chance.” 
After his meeting with Winn, the complaint said Stewart called Courtwright to tell him to make his Facebook page private so others couldn’t view it, and to take down the posts about Kirk for “damage control,” which Courtwright said he did.
The following day, Courtwright said he was pulled for another meeting where Winn, Stewart and Carroll were waiting for him. During the meeting, he was allegedly told that he violated University Code 8.3.3 and was placed on administrative leave.
The code includes:

“Intimidating or intentionally imposing on the rights and privileges of other employees”
“Engaging in grossly offensive, obscene, or immoral conduct”
“Any actions deemed by the University as constituting major misconduct.”

That same day, Roberts posted a statement on social media that multiple employees were fired for their social media posts. The university did not give a specific number of employees that were terminated.
On Sept. 22, Courtwright said he was fired from the university and the following day he received a letter stating that he was terminated.
“After a thorough review of all relevant information, it has been determined that your actions are in direct violation of Auburn University’s Personnel Policies and Procedures (Group I offenses),” the letter Courtwright got said. “Group I violations include conduct regarded as major misconduct, behavior that is grossly offensive or immoral, and a gross disregard of obligations to the University.”
The lawsuit also cites a comment by Roberts reported by the Auburn Plainsman, the university’s student newspaper, that he regretted parts of his statement that “caused confusion over ‘offensive speech vs threatening speech.’”
The complaint argues that Courtwright’s posts weren’t threatening and that his posts had no impact on how he did his job.
“However ill-considered [the] defendant[s] perceived [Courtwright’s] comments to be, his comments did not render him unfit for his job as a Landscape Supervisor,” the complaint said.
Earlier this month, Candice Hale, a former lecturer at Auburn, said she was fired for sharing her thoughts on Kirk’s death on Facebook.
Hale said in her complaint that she was also questioned by Hardman and Forehand about her post and “how students who were in the University’s Turning Point USA chapter would feel about her comments.”
She said she was not aware that the university had a Turning Point chapter.
On Sept. 24, after having another meeting with other Auburn officials, Hale said she was summoned for another meeting where she was told the school wanted to end her employment and gave her 21 days to consider a severance agreement.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Auburn-University-02-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-24 07:16:39.262051

This summer, the state of Louisiana texted just over 13,000 people enrolled in its Medicaid program with a link to a website where they could confirm their incomes.
The texts were part of a pilot run to test technology the Trump administration says will make it easier for some Medicaid enrollees to prove they meet new requirements — working, studying, job training, or volunteering at least 80 hours a month — set to take effect in just over a year.
But only 894 people completed the quarterly wage check, or just under 7% of enrollees who got the text, according to Drew Maranto, undersecretary for the Louisiana Department of Health.
“We’re hoping to get more to opt in,” Maranto said. “We plan to raise awareness.”
The clock is ticking for officials in 42 states — excluding those that did not expand Medicaid at all — and Washington, D.C., to figure out how to verify that an estimated 18.5 million Medicaid enrollees meet rules included in President Donald Trump’s tax and spending law. They have until the end of next year, and federal officials are giving those jurisdictions a total of $200 million to do so.
The policy change is one of several to free up money for Trump’s priorities, such as increased border security and tax breaks that mainly benefit the wealthy.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the work rules will be the main reason millions of people won’t be able to access health insurance over the next decade. It estimates changes to the Medicaid program will result in 10 million fewer Americans covered by 2034 — more than half of them because of the eligibility rules.
For now, state officials, health policy researchers, and consumer advocates are watching the pilot program in Louisiana and another in Arizona. Mehmet Oz, director of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, has touted those test-drives and said they will allow people to verify their incomes “within seven minutes.”
“There have been efforts to do this in the past, but they haven’t been able to achieve what we can achieve because we have technologies now,” said Oz, during a television appearance in August.
Brian Blase, the president of the conservative Paragon Health Institute and a key architect of Medicaid changes in the new law, has chimed in, saying during a recent radio appearance that with today’s artificial intelligence “people should be able to seamlessly enter how they are spending their time.”
KFF Health News found scant evidence to support such claims. Federal and state officials have offered little insight into what new technology the two pilots have tested. They do say, however, that it connects directly with the websites of Medicaid enrollees’ payroll providers, rather than using artificial intelligence to draw conclusions about their activities.
Oz said the Trump administration’s efforts started “as soon as the bill was signed” in July. But work on the pilot programs began under the Biden administration.
And Medicaid is a state-federal program: The federal government contributes most of the funds, but it is up to the states to administer them, not the federal government.
“Oz can say, ‘Oh no, we’re going to fix this. We’re going to do this.’ Well, they don’t actually run the program,” said Joan Alker, a health policy researcher at Georgetown’s Center for Children and Families.
Officials have also offered few details about the pilots’ effectiveness in assisting enrollees in Medicaid or other public benefit programs.
The shortage of information has some state officials and health policy researchers worried that the Trump administration lacks viable solutions to help states implement the work rules. As a result, they say, people with a legal right to Medicaid benefits could lose access to them.
“What actually keeps me up at night is the fear that members that are eligible for Medicaid and are trying to get health care services would fall through the cracks and lose coverage,” said Emma Sandoe, Oregon’s Medicaid director.
Officials involved in the Louisiana and Arizona projects declined to answer many specific questions about their efforts, instead directing KFF Health News to federal officials.
Spokespeople for Arizona’s Medicaid and Economic Security departments — Johnny Córdoba and Brett Bezio, respectively — did not share data on how many people participated in the state’s pilot test nor describe the outcome. They said the pilot had been used to verify eligibility only for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, a smaller program than Medicaid.
The Community Food Bank of Southern Arizona, a nonprofit that helps people sign up for such SNAP benefits, hadn’t heard of the pilot program.
State officials and health policy researchers said neither pilot program could confirm whether a person meets other qualifying activities — such as community service — or any of the numerous exemptions. The tools being tested can verify only income.
Andrew Nixon, director of communications for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Oz’s agency, wrote in a statement that the digital tools officials aim to share with states “are largely under development.”
One person doing that development is Michael Burstein, who until recently worked at the U.S. Digital Service, which later became known as the Department of Government Efficiency.
As the U.S. Digital Service was turned into DOGE, Burstein and other staffers left and started a nonprofit called Digital Public Works to finish supporting the technology to make it easier for people to verify their incomes for Medicaid enrollment.
But without permission from state officials, Burstein would not describe the tool in development, aside from saying that it’s mobile-first, can quickly verify income for a new or returning client, “and we’re pretty happy with it.”
The state agencies that manage benefit programs, such as Medicaid and SNAP, are understaffed, and they use different eligibility systems, many of which need updating, which makes improving them “a challenging task,” he said.
The $200 million in start-up costs the federal government has earmarked for systems to track work requirements equals roughly four times what it cost to administer Georgia’s Medicaid work requirement program alone.
That state, which has the nation’s only active work requirement program, called Georgia Pathways to Coverage, in September was granted a temporary extension, despite a recent report from a federal watchdog saying it hadn’t received enough federal oversight. A complicated sign-up process has kept enrollment in the program far below Georgia’s own projections.
Trump’s tax and spending law allows states to ask for extra time — until the end of 2028 — to start enforcing the rules, but only with the approval of HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It also allows counties with high unemployment rates to be exempted, but states must apply for that exemption.
Even with an app that states can use to prove people are eligible for Medicaid, enrollees would still need to know that app existed and how to use it — neither of which is a given, Alker said. There is also no guarantee they’d have reliable cell service or internet access. As KFF Health News has reported, millions of Americans live in rural areas without reliable internet.
Private vendors also have been working on such apps, said Jennifer Wagner, who researches Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Wagner said she has seen several vendors demonstrate products they plan to pitch to states for the work rules. Many are limited in scope, she said, like those in the pilot tests.
“Nobody has a magical solution that’ll make sure eligible people don’t lose coverage,” she said.

(Courtesy photo)Writing and editing for The Post, the student newspaper at Ohio University, is what made me the journalist I am today. Watching what is happening to student journalism in Indiana is devastating.
Moves at the state’s two flagships, Purdue University and Indiana University, show that college news media is in jeopardy.
Students learn the basics of the job in journalism courses. They learn the history of journalism, the ethics of being a reporter and how to use tools of the craft.
But writing for a daily or weekly publication gives you so much more. The Post is where I learned to connect with sources, build relationships, dig into data and records and put together stories that educate and connect with readers.
It gave me true experience — not like turning in a story to one professor for a grade.
At Purdue University, the administration halted on-campus distribution of The Exponent. The paper was told to remove the “Purdue” part of its name for all commercial uses. The Purdue Student Publishing Foundation currently has a trademark over the name. The Exponent’s employees are no longer allowed to buy campus parking passes, either.
But it’s way worse at Indiana University, which has a proud history of championing journalism and public transparency.
Leaders at IU’s Media School pressured the Indiana Daily Student’s adviser to remove non-homecoming stories from the special print edition set to be published on campus last week. The adviser resisted and was fired. The school then canceled all special print editions.
Look, many college papers are now digital and that’s just a sad fact. Print is expensive.
But the student media plan that IU agreed to includes special print editions. This kind of edition is especially important during homecoming, when alumni are on campus and can pick up the paper to see what’s going on at their alma mater.
Braun appointees join IU board; changes made to protest policy

Administrators don’t want alumni to see what’s up, apparently. They only wanted fluff pieces about homecoming in the edition. And when student journalists pushed back, IU canceled the entire thing with no notice.
So, what was so offensive that it sparked this blowup? The entire edition was posted online. It includes 12 pages of homecoming coverage — and more.
A feature on a wrestling club. A story on the data center boom. Dogs in costumes at a parade. A photo story on the Great Glass Pumpkin Patch. A new Habitat for Humanity build.
The only slightly controversial piece is a story on a documentary about free speech on the IU campus.
“This is not about print. This is about a breach of editorial independence,” a letter from Co-Editors Mia Hilkowitz and Andrew Miller reads. “If IU decides certain types of content are ‘bad for business,’ what stops them from prohibiting stories that hold them to account on our other platforms?”
Many say this is “just” a special print edition, but that’s how censorship starts. The next time, students could be told not to cover stories that might embarrass the administration in the online edition. And that’s not a game to play.
More than money
There is a fair discussion to be had about money. The IDS had run up a deficit of almost $1 million over a decade, which the university cleared last year. The Media School issued a student media action plan that said print editions are still important.
“We will maintain plans for existing special editions regularly published during the academic year. Preserving these high-revenue issues will yield a net savings (print expense reduction will outweigh lost revenue from weekly editions) and will enable student media to continue to provide numerous and substantial opportunities for students to learn and practice essential design and other skills associated with the print operation,” it reads.
I have seen a lot of discussion about the deficit and how it came to exist, and I just want to note that many activities on a campus individually run a deficit. Public education isn’t a business. It’s about teaching students — and let me tell you, nothing works better than doing it for real.
The entire Indiana University athletics department ran a $3.1 million deficit for the 2024 fiscal year, and I didn’t hear anyone complaining. There are absolutely individual sports that lose money but are subsidized by more high-profile sports. And that’s fine, because sports are a part of the educational experience. They teach teamwork, responsibility and commitment.
All three of those are also things that student journalists learn at the Indiana Daily Student.
The IU administration needs to review its actions, and these students deserve an apology. Gov. Mike Braun remade the board of trustees and this is a great opportunity for them to step in and reverse course.

Funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture will allow the state to keep up food benefits under the Women, Infants and Children program, known as WIC, and support the 11 workers still administering it in Washington.
“It’s definitely a relief,” said Nicole Flateboe, executive director of Nutrition First, the state’s WIC association. “It’s food benefits through Thanksgiving, hopefully.”
The estimate of assistance lasting until mid-to-late November is based on current use. If enrollees start increasing their usage, the funding could run out sooner, according to the state Department of Health. 
An agriculture department spokesperson said Thursday that the agency “utilized tariff revenue to fund WIC for the foreseeable future.” It was unclear exactly how much money the feds were providing.
WIC benefits have been among the most vulnerable to the ongoing shutdown. When the shutdown began Oct. 1, the state had about two weeks’ worth of funding to keep feeding low-income Washingtonians enrolled in WIC. 
Redirected tariff revenue from the Trump administration is allowing states to get through October, but that $300 million infusion would only last through the end of the month.
In Washington, over 200 clinics serve more than 212,000 women and their children younger than 5 years old annually under the WIC program, according to the state. WIC helps nearly one-third of all newborn babies. Nationally, the program serves nearly 7 million Americans.
WIC helps mothers with access to healthy food, breastfeeding support, nutrition education and health screenings. Research has shown participation in the program helps avoid low birth weights and reduce maternal mortality. 
The new money announced Thursday is focused on food benefits, not the program’s other services.
Earlier this month, King County and Seattle officials promised that the nearly 30,000 enrollees there would receive one-time vouchers for food and baby formula through a partnership with Safeway if funding runs out. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture funds the program, while the state Department of Health administers it in Washington. WIC participants can purchase food using electronic benefit transfer cards, which work like debit cards.
Money for the program flows from the federal government to the state and then some of it to the clinics, which provide WIC services and help to get people enrolled in the program. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has pledged to make back payments once the shutdown ends. But as of earlier this month, the state had not, Flateboe said. And the expenses are too big for some of the clinics to take on without a guarantee they’ll be made whole. 
Earlier this month, Nutrition First called on the state to adjust its contracts with the clinics to ensure reimbursement. Flateboe said Thursday that the Department of Health is now working on revising those contracts.
Still, one of those clinics, at the Spokane Regional Health District, has issued layoff notices to roughly 30 employees effective at the end of October, out of fear of not getting reimbursed.
“Without this assurance, SRHD can only support staff costs through the end of October,” spokesperson Kelli Hawkins said in an email. “We are hopeful that the federal government shutdown will end soon, allowing for WIC funding to continue. At that time, SRHD can rescind the layoff notices and continue offering this vital service to our community.”
About 50 employees at the state health department have been temporarily laid off or had their hours reduced due to the shutdown. Most were working in the division that manages WIC. With the new funding, those employees will return to work Nov. 3, but if the shutdown continues, they could be laid off again three days later, said Department of Health spokesperson Raechel Sims.
Meanwhile, funding for federal food stamps  — a program that is separate from WIC —   is set to run dry at the end of October. Washington’s U.S. Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, along with other Senate Democrats, called on Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Wednesday to open up funding to allow benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, to continue into November.
In a letter, the senators noted the way Rollins’ agency was able to open up funding to maintain WIC benefits and said the same should be done for SNAP.
“Americans are already struggling with the rising cost of groceries, and they cannot afford a sudden lapse in grocery assistance,” the letter reads. “We urge you to immediately communicate to states and committees of jurisdiction the USDA’s plans to disburse the contingency funding to state agencies and utilize all available legal authorities so that American families can get benefits without interruption.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/baby-formula-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 07:16:39.262051

A clinic planned in Hudson County would treat patients up to 34 weeks.,"New Jersey abortion clinics don't offer the procedure past 27 weeks. A clinic planned in Hudson County would treat patients up to 34 weeks. (Getty Images)Abortion foes often criticize New Jersey for allowing abortion “up until the moment of birth,” because the state is one of just nine nationally that sets no limit on when someone can end their pregnancy.
But clinics here don’t provide abortions past the second trimester, which means people who seek abortions after then must head to other states.
That’s expected to change next year, when a nonprofit aims to open an all-trimester clinic in Hudson County that will provide abortion up to 34 weeks, as well as gender-affirming care for all ages, HIV care, and other services.
Dr. Kristyn Brandi, an obstetrician-gynecologist, and Cathy Obando, a nurse practitioner, say the services they will provide at Luminosas Wellness Collective have become critically important as states around the country increasingly restrict or ban them and providers scale back services to dodge protests, funding cuts, or stigma.
“A lot of people have concerns around providing abortion and providing gender-affirming care in the political landscape right now, but we are providing care because we know people need this care and they’ve had very limited access to it,” Brandi said.
New Jersey has become known as a “safe haven” for abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, with legislators codifying abortion rights here, funding family planning, and passing laws to protect abortion patients and practitioners from states that criminalize it, among other measures.
But most New Jersey clinics cut off abortion access the later a woman goes into pregnancy, with Planned Parenthood providing it up to 16 weeks and 6 days and just two clinics, in Cherry Hill and Englewood, performing the procedure up to 27 weeks and six days into pregnancy. For New Jersey patients seeking abortions at or after 28 weeks, the closest clinics are in Maryland and Washington, D.C.
Late abortions are scarce nationally too, with only 10 providers offering them from 28 to 34 weeks, according to LaterAbortion.org.
Most people who get abortions get them in the first trimester. People seek abortions later than that often because of newly diagnosed health problems with the fetus or parent, or a change of family circumstance such as job loss, said Bonyen Lee-Gilmore of Patient Forward, a national group that advocates against gestational bans. Young people who don’t recognize they’re pregnant until later in a pregnancy also are overrepresented among second- and third-trimester abortions, she added.
And increasingly, people get abortions in the second trimester or after because some states have created hurdles that can delay getting the procedure, Lee-Gilmore said, including consent requirements, mandates for pre-abortion counseling, or ultrasounds. She added that the costs and logistics of traveling to a different state for abortions, among other things, create more challenges.
“That sort of gauntlet that patients have always had to run in order to access abortion has just gotten more and more complicated in a post-Roe world. And so people are getting pushed later into pregnancy,” she said.
Brandi and Obando know New Jersey’s abortion protections could shift too, as soon as next year when a new governor will take over from term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy. In that race, Democrat Mikie Sherrill has vowed to uphold the state’s abortion protections, but Republican Jack Ciattarelli has said he supports banning abortion after 20 weeks except for rape, incest, or when the health of the mother is in danger.
Marie Tasy, executive director of New Jersey Right to Life (Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)
Marie Tasy, who heads New Jersey Right to Life, said if Brandi and Obando are allowed to move forward with their clinic, it “would leave an indelible stain on New Jersey.”
“This clinic’s stated mission is deeply perverse, making it one of the most extreme examples of the abortion industry’s lack of humanity,” Tasy said.
Brandi and Obando remain committed to open by next summer, with a mission of serving underserved populations that have long faced barriers to health care and dismissive medical professionals. They’re still working to secure a location and aim eventually to train the next generation of providers, as abortion becomes increasingly endangered.
“We have felt the anxiety and the worry patients bring with them when they come in, especially from patients traveling out of state,” Obando said. “They’re definitely grateful for the services and the lifeline that they receive in New Jersey.”
Brandi, a former board chair of Physicians for Reproductive Health, said her commitment to reproductive rights grew after Roe was overturned.
“We need to take care of everybody in our community, and just because the politics are crazy right now, that doesn’t mean that they don’t deserve care,” she said.
She’s gotten hate mail for her work, so she’s tightened security at her home. She and Obando plan to make safety a top priority at their new clinic too.
“It’s scary,” Brandi said. “I think we’re trying to meet the moment. We know that it’s a tough moment for reproductive health care, but if we don’t do it, who will?”

This week’s news brings us another story that’s starting to get very old — especially for Montana’s existing residents.  Namely, the City of East Helena finds itself unable to “meet the demand” for water for the 6,250 new homes plus new businesses that theoretically will be built on former ASARCO lands the city annexed when the company went bankrupt. 
But here’s the rub: The land the city annexed did not come with water rights.  In Montana, no water means no new developments because we can barely provide water to existing residents.  The rapidly changing climate’s longer, hotter, and drier summers combined with lower winter snowpacks and earlier, diminished runoff is simply a reality that municipalities and developers don’t want to acknowledge.  But just because you don’t want to admit reality doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.
As reported, Montana’s Lt. Governor Kristen Juras sent a letter to the city telling them the Natural Resources Damage settlement with ASARCO for the lead smelter’s Superfund site pollution requires “natural resource restoration and long-term stewardship.” Part of that restoration process, which was public, determined that certain water rights should go to restore instream flows on Prickly Pear Creek, which flows right past the giant slag piles remaining at the smelter site. 
Ironically, the state and EPA offered the city 40% of the water rights, but the offer was refused.  Now, the state and the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks are moving forward to change those consumptive water rights to instream flows and restore the battered creek.
That the city and developers are demanding the water for future development makes little sense since the mayor was quoted saying East Helena has an “already strained municipal water system.”  Since the theoretical developments would require four times the water the city currently supplies to existing residents and businesses it may also require a new and very expensive water treatment facility for which existing residents will pay. 
If this sounds familiar, one need only look to Bozeman, where residents will soon vote on the Water Adequacy for Residential Development initiative that will require new developments to either provide lower income units or bring new water rights to the city to “meet the demand” of the new developments.
Like Bozeman, East Helena is in a “closed basin” — meaning no new water rights can be issued without harming existing water rights holders and users.  You can’t give away more water than you have — and Montana has less every year, as the record low flows and closures of our major rivers proves.
None of this is a mystery.  In 1878 John Wesley Powell, who had explored the West’s great rivers and made the first descent of the Colorado River, published his “Report on the Lands of the Arid Regions of the United States” in which he estimated only 2% of the land in the arid West could support agriculture or development due to the lack of water.  There’s simply no excuse for Montana’s development-crazed municipalities to ignore the facts of our increasingly limited water supply. 
Finally, one might wonder why the burdens of “meeting the demand” of developers – including data centers – falls on existing residents.  Or why the Superfund impacts from past extractive industries shouldn’t be remediated.  Or why existing residents and their kids in East Helena shouldn’t have a clean stream they can walk to and enjoy a genuine “Montana” experience?
There are very real limits to growth.  In the West, that’s a dwindling water supply – and it’s obviously time for Montanans to realize that fact and live with it.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/home-building-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-10-24 06:56:28.972580

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Exmainer)State Superintendent Jill Underly didn’t show up to answer questions from Wisconsin lawmakers about the process the Department of Public Instruction uses for investigating reports of sexual misconduct by educators and for determining licensing.
Underly was invited by the committee to deliver testimony and answer questions last week, after a report from The Capital Times last week found that DPI investigated over 200 cases of Wisconsin teachers, aides, substitutes and administrators accused of sexual misconduct or grooming behaviors toward students from 2018 to 2023. Underly she sent other representatives for the agency in her stead on Thursday. According to WisPolitics, Underly was out of state to accept an alumni award from Indiana University. 
The conversation surrounding the agency’s handling of sexual misconduct and grooming allegations and licensure was sparked by the CapTimes report, which  detailed a number of questions related to the system the agency uses to track data on cases, suggested the agency wasn’t making information readily available to the public and noted the few resources that the agency has to investigate cases and track information. 
In a YouTube video posted Thursday, Underly said lawmakers, law enforcement, educators and families would need to come to the table to build a “stronger system that protects every child and respects the rule of law.”  
“Let me be absolutely clear: the safety, dignity, and well-being of Wisconsin’s children is — and will always be — our first and most important responsibility,” Underly said. “We investigate every single complaint we receive. These investigations are conducted thoroughly, professionally, and within the legal authority given to us. Licensure actions — whether it is a suspension, revocation, or voluntary surrender — are not made lightly. They are based on evidence, not speculation; on due process, not headlines.” 
Last week, Underly called the report “misleading” in a letter and requested a retraction or correction from the CapTimes. In response, CapTimes Editor Mark Treinen said the paper  stands by the reporting. 
Rep. Amanda Nedweski (R-Pleasant Prairie) announced that she is working on a set of bills in response to the article. 
One bill focuses on implementing a criminal penalty for “grooming” of children by sexual predators in state statute. Nedweski also said she is drafting a bill to require school districts to adopt clear policies outlining appropriate communication boundaries between staff and students and a bill to prohibit DPI  from allowing teachers under investigation for sexual misconduct to surrender their teaching license to avoid further scrutiny. 
Lawmakers expressed concern at Underly’s absence, noting the seriousness of the issue. 
At the start of the hearing, Rep. Mike Bare (D-Verona) said he was “disappointed” by Underly’s absence. 
“I am deeply, deeply disappointed that Superintendent Underly could not bring herself to the meeting,” Nedweski, who chairs the committee, said. “These are very, very serious issues.” 
Nedweski said she had a meeting with DPI staff on Monday, but the Underly never reached out to her to ask to reschedule the hearing. She said she would have gladly accommodated a different date.
“I guess she just couldn’t find it important enough,” she added.  
At a press conference after the hearing, Nedweski, Sen. John Jagler (R-Watertown) and U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who is running for governor in 2026, criticized Underly for her absence. 
“I think it’s time for the governor to call on Jill Underly to either do her job or step aside,” U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany said. (Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)
“I would call on [Gov. Tony Evers] at this point… do you find this acceptable? Is this acceptable what has gone on here in the state of Wisconsin?” Tiffany asked. “I think it’s time for the governor to call on Jill Underly to either do her job or step aside.”
Tiffany said he would ensure proper investigations and create a public dashboard showing why teachers lose their licenses if he is elected governor. 
DPI representatives and law enforcement discuss lack of “grooming” statute
The hearing began with testimony from Kenosha Chief of Police Patrick Patton, Deputy Chief of Police Joseph Labatore and officer Kate Schaper, who addressed  the difference between investigations conducted by law enforcement and the role of the DPI. 
DPI Deputy State Superintendent Tom McCarthy delivered testimony and answered questions on behalf of Underly and the agency. He was joined by Rich Judge, who serves as DPI’s assistant superintendent of government and public affairs, and Jennifer Kammerud, who serves as the educator licensing director. 
McCarthy began his testimony by laying out the role of the agency in handling sexual misconduct and grooming allegations. He said the agency’s main role is in the state’s licensing system, which is how they can draw attention to people who shouldn’t be in the classroom. 
“When we hear about allegations … we are deadly serious,” McCarthy said. “We use all of the tools that we have available. We do not have subpoena power, but we do attempt to get information from anybody that can support a license investigation case, and given how sensitive these things are, we try to work as thoroughly and quickly as possible.” 
McCarthy noted that DPI typically receives accusations from law enforcement agencies, required reporting from local school districts, complaints from members of the public and from news media reports, which McCarthy said the agency scans frequently. 
Both McCarthy and the law enforcement officers spoke to concerns about the lack of a definition for grooming in Wisconsin state statute.
According to RAINN, grooming is the “deliberate act of building trust with a child, teen, or at-risk adult (such as an adult with a cognitive impairment) for the purpose of exploiting them sexually.”
DPI recommended in its testimony that a definition for grooming should include patterns of flirtatious behavior, making any effort to gain unreasonable access to or time alone with any student with no discernable educational purpose, engaging in any behavior that can reasonably be construed as involving an inappropriate relationship with a student and engaging in any other special treatment not in compliance with generally accepted educational practices.
McCarthy said lawmakers should consider requiring an annual training should they adopt a definition of grooming.
“We need to be reminding folks of the types of behaviors and things that we expect from them. It doesn’t matter what type of school,” McCarthy said. 
Questioning by lawmakers was tense and combative at times. 
Nedweski said she was unclear about why there is confusion over whether grooming can be used to remove a teacher’s license.
Current state law says that a teacher’s license can be revoked due to “immoral conduct,” which is defined as “conduct or behavior that is contrary to commonly accepted moral or ethical standards and that endangers the health, safety, welfare, or education of any pupil.” 
“Do we have to explicitly write the word ‘grooming’ in this law to spell out that grooming is not commonly accepted moral at ethical standards? I tend to believe that most Wisconsinites would think the law is comprehensive. Any kind of behavior that resembles grooming in any definition is already covered there,” Nedweski said. 
McCathy said the statute right now is “vague and ambiguous.” 
“When we find these things we go after them,” McCarthy said. “The department is using all of its authority to put its foot down in the spaces and revoke licenses. We’re doing that in a space right now where the authority doesn’t necessarily back us in every instance.” 
The Assembly Government Oversight, Accountability and Transparency (GOAT) committee voted unanimously to approve a motion to request that Attorney General Josh Kaul provide an opinion on two questions: whether grooming is “contrary to commonly accepted moral or ethical standards” and does grooming “endanger the health, safety, welfare or education” of a pupil.

Voluntary revocations and information on license status
McCarthy also told lawmakers that they view voluntary surrenders as an important tool for them. He said they will ask educators under investigation to do so throughout the process. 
The agency has noted that it often gives several opportunities for teachers to voluntarily surrender their licenses.
McCarthy said that voluntary surrenders related to a sexual misconduct investigation are most often lifetime surrenders, meaning that in a legal agreement they won’t be able to apply for an educator’s license again.
Revocations and voluntary surrenders are also reported to the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification (NASDTEC) — a national database that state education agencies can access that includes information about the misconduct. That database is not accessible to the public. 
McCarthy noted that information is available on the DPI website on the status of a teacher’s license, though one needs to know a licensee’s name in order to check. The information will say whether an educator’s license is under investigation, has been revoked or voluntarily surrendered, though it doesn’t include information on why. He said the agency is working with old, rigid software that makes it difficult to add additional information. 
Nedweski said she didn’t “buy” the explanation that the agency was giving.
“It’s remarkable because the Wisconsin Department of Safety and Professional Services can show you the reason for a license revocation for anyone,” Nedweski said, including explanations for manicurists. “It’s easier for me as a member of the public to find out why a cosmetologist lost their license and why it was revoked than it is for me to find out why a teacher license was revoked… Why is it so hard for us to find out critical safety information?” 
The agency requested $600,000 in the most recent state budget process to modernize its online background checks and licensing platform — a request that was rejected by the Republican-led Legislature.
The agency also suggested that lawmakers consider increasing reporting requirements to all school types and all individuals who are present in schools. McCarthy noted that the agency doesn’t have the ability to revoke licenses of people that don’t have to be licensed — including paraprofessionals and teachers in taxpayer-supported private schools. 
Lawmakers said they plan to provide Underly with other opportunities to speak in public forums about the issue. 
Jagler said the Senate Education Committee, which he chairs, will have an informational hearing on Nov. 4 where Underly will be the only invited speaker.
The Joint Audit Committee also noticed a hearing on Nov. 5 to launch an audit of educational licensure revocation, suspension, restriction and investigation at DPI.

The prospect of getting stuck with radioactive waste tops concerns, while elected officials spar over who is to blame for lack of unified support.
The post Politicized nuclear energy debate leaves residents conflicted, starving for credible answers appeared first on WyoFile .","If there were any doubts regarding a political divide around spent nuclear fuel waste in Wyoming, Gov. Mark Gordon put them to rest.
Following Radiant Industries’ announcement this month that it was pulling its proposed nuclear microreactor manufacturing facility from Natrona County and taking it to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, Gordon pinned the blame on the Wyoming Freedom Caucus.
“Members of the Freedom Caucus inspired ‘Club No’ convinced Radiant that Wyoming isn’t about leadership and problem solving,” Gordon said in a prepared statement. “‘Club No,’” he continued, “has ushered in a new culture of no matter who began or who commenced it, we’re against it. That is not the way Wyoming became the great state it is.”
Key to Radiant’s proposal was the fact that it required a change in state law to allow storage of spent nuclear fuel waste. A measure to do just that was tabled this summer by the Joint Minerals, Business and Economic Development Committee amid an outpouring of opposition from around the state.

Gillette Republican Rep. John Bear said he suspects Gordon is vying to win support from political donors associated with the nuclear industry to potentially oust Freedom Caucus members in future elections.
“He’d like to have free reign over the state of Wyoming policies, even if it’s not him in office,” Bear told WyoFile. 
As Emeritus Chairman of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, Bear pointed to the group’s statement issued in July: “Wyoming must continue to be a leader in proven energy production, not settle as a dumping ground for nuclear waste from other states.”
“I’m taking an educate-the-public [approach] and detractors are taking an opposite approach, which I believe is to make the deal and tell the public about it,” Bear said.


Wyoming nuclear waste ban
Wyoming has flirted with the prospect of nuclear fuel waste storage for several decades and, so far, has stuck with a ban on storage — with one exception. Lawmakers passed House Bill 131, “Nuclear power generation and storage-amendments,” in 2022 to accommodate TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant being built near Kemmerer. That exception allows nuclear power plants operating in the state to “temporarily” store their own radioactive waste. But it doesn’t allow waste from nuclear power plants outside the state.
Lawmakers have considered loosening the ban further. House Bill 16, “Used nuclear fuel storage-amendments,” would have potentially opened Wyoming’s doors to decades of nuclear waste that’s been accumulating at the nation’s nuclear power plants. That measure was rejected earlier this year along with Senate File 186, “​​Advanced nuclear reactor manufacturers-fuel storage,” which would have accommodated Radiant’s proposal. An attempt to revive similar legislation during the interim this year was tabled.


Though no less caustic at times, residents in Natrona and Campbell counties have grappled with nuclear energy proposals, searching for answers about a high-stakes industry they’re not familiar with and assurances about the prospect of storing highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel waste near their homes.
“We’d like to get some fair information, some unbiased information that isn’t coming from people who stand to gain from these proposals,” Bar Nunn resident Lee-Ann Newquist told WyoFile. “It’s not a for-or-against issue. There are people in the middle who are not being represented.”

Monied, outside companies eager to plant the next generation of nuclear energy facilities in and around Wyoming are moving too quickly, some residents say, while fervent supporters — including some state and local elected officials — tend to cast doubters as reactionary NIMBYs. Many residents haven’t made up their minds about nuclear energy in Wyoming, which has triggered debates even among married couples.
WyoFile interviewed a dozen residents during two recent public meetings: One on Sept. 29 at Casper College, and another on Sept. 30 in Gillette, to get a gut-check on the nuclear energy conversation in Wyoming. Though some were decidedly for and some decidedly against various aspects of nuclear energy proposals, their responses were mostly apolitical. They revealed conflicted feelings about potential benefits and risks and much frustration about who to trust for credible answers to endless questions.
Here’s what they said.
Natrona County
About 100 Natrona County residents attended, “Let’s Set The Table — Nuclear 101,” presented by retired uranium mining engineer Wayne Heili. Though the presentation, which included a question-and-answer format, didn’t focus specifically on Radiant’s proposal — which was still active in Wyoming at the time — it was top of mind.
“[Radiant] can come in if it’s the right business for the community,” Bar Nunn resident Chris Hermel told WyoFile. “But the safety issues, to me, have not been addressed — not to my satisfaction.” The company’s assurances regarding safety protocols for transporting radioactive materials in and out of the community, for example, lacked details. “It needs to come with proof, not just somebody saying, ‘It’s safe,’ and ‘Trust me.'”


Radiant Industries
California-based startup Radiant Industries announced plans early this year to build a nuclear microreactor manufacturing plant just outside the town of Bar Nunn, a few miles north of Casper. The community was an ideal location, company officials said, for its existing manufacturing and heavy industry support services — and the fact that Wyoming is already home to uranium mining, which Radiant would eventually tap for its fuel supply chain. 
Radiant’s portable, TRISO-fueled Kaleidos microreactors would be deployed to clients, including the U.S. Military, around the world. When a unit needs refueling, it would be sent back to the manufacturing plant, and the spent fuel would be stored on site and presumably moved to a permanent federal nuclear fuel waste repository if one is built.The plan would require a change to Wyoming’s decades-long ban on spent nuclear fuel waste, which lawmakers considered but so far have not taken action on. The company announced Oct. 13 that it was withdrawing its plans in Wyoming to instead build in Tennessee.


Like many others, Hermel wasn’t convinced that Radiant’s nuclear fuel waste would ever leave the Natrona County facility, noting there is no federal repository. “It seems like they’re trying to rush it through without having all of the details,” he said.
The divide over Radiant and other nuclear energy proposals in Wyoming sometimes includes disagreements within the same household.
Lisa and Wayne Kasparek of Bar Nunn, after listening to Heili’s presentation, challenged each other over the safety of storing spent nuclear fuel near their community.
“If they have so many places that are already storing waste, why can’t the waste be stored at a facility that is already storing it?” Wayne posed to his wife.

“They addressed that in there,” Lisa responded. “They’re looking to possibly have one storage facility,” she said, referring to hopes for a renewed effort to establish a federal nuclear waste repository.
“Yeah, and Wyoming might be it, since we’re wide open and we don’t have a large population,” Wayne said.
Though not opposed to nuclear energy manufacturing, both Kaspareks said they worry about other projects that would generate electricity in Wyoming but ship the power out of the state — like TerraPower’s Natrium nuclear plant under construction in Kemmerer — fearing it might increase their power bills.

“I want to hear specifics on how it’s going to affect our pocketbook,” Lisa Kasparek said. “I’m comfortable with the safety features because I think we’ve come so far in learning about nuclear power.”
Others lamented what they see as a tendency — including among elected officials — to draw lines for residents to either be for or against nuclear energy, particularly regarding Radiant’s proposal. Lee-Ann Newquist of Bar Nunn, said that tendency to draw lines amplified tensions over the issue in Bar Nunn and left many, including herself, doubtful about who can be considered a trusted, unbiased source of information. 
Rather than town hall meetings organized by elected officials, Newquist said, “maybe set up a citizens committee so we can have a roundtable discussion long before things are actually breaking ground and money is being spent.”
Campbell County
In Gillette, BWXT hosted a public information session, attracting nearly 300 attendees. The company’s director of business development, Joshua Parker, gave a short presentation, and attendees milled around to pose questions to company officials posted around the venue.
DJ Towne brought a notebook with questions and penciled in answers as she visited each station.
“I asked them about worst-case scenarios when you’re transporting the stuff: What happens if?” Towne told WyoFile. “She said there’s required packaging, so that in case of a crash in bad weather, it’s not radioactive.”


BWXT
Lynchburg, Virginia-based BWXT proposes to build a $500 million TRISO nuclear fuel manufacturing facility in Gillette. Construction of the “Category II” plant is expected to begin about a year from now, with an in-service target of 2030, according to the company.
TRISO consists of tiny enriched uranium pellets the size of poppyseeds, each encased in “carbon- and ceramic-based materials that prevent the release of radioactive fission products,” according to the Department of Energy. The facility will not produce or store any high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel in the state, according to the company. BWXT hopes to eventually tap Wyoming’s uranium mining industry to supply its fuel chain.The Wyoming Energy Authority announced earlier this month that it is recommending a $100 million state grant to support the project.


Towne was still hunting down a BWXT official to answer another question: What kind of tax breaks is the company seeking from the federal and state government? She arrived at the event uncertain about whether she might ultimately support BWXT’s project.
“I just wanted more information before I made a decision,” Towne said. “That’s what a lot of people are here for, to be informed so we don’t misunderstand what it actually is.”
Ronda Boller was equally undecided when she arrived at the event. Though she was there to learn about the proposed nuclear fuel manufacturing facility, she was also wary about a sense of enthusiasm for nuclear energy throughout the community. The town’s long boom-and-bust history instills a sense of desperation, she noted.
“When we get on a boom, we’re like, ‘Let’s run with it,'” Boller said. 
Joshua Parker of BWXT speaks to a crowd of about 300 in September 2025, in Gillette. (Dustin Bleizeffer/WyoFile)
That’s what happened with the coal-bed methane boom of the 2000s, she said. Local and state officials eagerly embraced hundreds of companies that flooded into northeast Wyoming, overlooking some important safeguards and long-term implications. “And now the state is stuck filling those wells,” Boller said. 
Millions in taxpayer dollars have been earmarked to clean up more than 2,000 orphaned wells, which can release methane, pollute groundwater and pose other hazards to people and wildlife.
Her advice to fellow residents: “Don’t get greedy. Don’t get in a hurry. Whatever you do, take your time. Make sure you understand everything and don’t think this is the next big boom.
“After watching what happened with [coal-bed methane], you can’t do that with nuclear,” Boller added. “I just want to make sure that if we do this, we do it right and we think it through.”
Kyle Van Lant was among those excited to see the nuclear energy industry come to town.

“This might not be the consensus in Gillette, but I’m a big believer in renewable energy,” the 25-year-old civil engineer said. “I think it’s extremely important that we learn how to balance our carbon output and input, and nuclear energy, I think, is probably the most feasible way for that to happen.”
Van Lant moved to Gillette from Los Angeles two years ago and has become increasingly interested in how the community — famous for its prolific coal, oil, natural gas and uranium production — might adapt to changing energy markets. “So I’ve been learning about nuclear energy and its feasibility in Gillette,” he said. “I’m excited and optimistic. I just hope people are receptive to it.”
Similar to some events in Bar Nunn this year, Van Lant said there were a handful of public meetings in Gillette that he felt were intended to incite fear rather than offer information or answer questions. 
“People were standing up and saying ‘We want experts to talk to us, because this just seems like a scare meeting with nobody actually knowing what’s going on,'” he said. 
Though BWXT’s Sept. 30 event might have included a “certain amount of fluff,” Van Lant said, company officials came with a lot of answers and explanations. “So it will be interesting to hear about how people respond to this.”
While Radiant has exited the discussion in Wyoming, there remains a possibility that nuclear waste storage will get attention during the upcoming legislative budget session, according to lawmakers close to the issue.
Though waste storage is not part of BWXT’s proposal, the Campbell County Board of Commissioners is mulling whether to put the question of spent nuclear fuel waste storage to a public vote next year. Meantime, the commission will not allow any form of spent nuclear fuel waste storage.The public can go to this website to access the draft resolution and comment on it.

Kenah, who occasionally finds horses grazing along the ridge, once found himself without a camera at a moment when the light was hitting the equine beasts just right. 
Determined not to repeat the mistake, he brought his phone along for the ride on an unseasonably warm early October Friday. Sure enough, there were the horses, and there was the light. 
Here’s how he describes getting the shots:“I barely made it for the last light as the sun was dipping behind the mountain — how Sheridanites refer to the Big Horns — to get that warm glow on the horse. The light faded right before I turned to the other three horses, but the waxing gibbous moon and half-lit clouds made a nice backdrop. They all seemed pretty indifferent to my presence and kept munching their grass, so I thanked them for their time and went on my way.”

Wyoming's biggest challenge isn't a lack of opportunity. It's a fear of change. But doing nothing won't save the state we love, writes Josh Dorrell.
The post Wyoming’s future depends on courage, optimism and action appeared first on WyoFile .","Across Wyoming, people are ready to build, grow and move forward. From Rock Springs to Sheridan and Torrington to Powell, there is a growing sense that it is time to stop talking about what is slipping away and focus on what is possible. 

Opinion

A new statewide poll conducted for the Wyoming Business Council confirms this shared belief: Opportunity, good jobs, and the chance for our children and grandchildren to stay close to home are not optional — they are essential. 
The poll shows that most Wyoming voters want their local community to take decisive action to grow jobs and the economy. A clear majority supports responsible population growth when it means more opportunity for families and neighbors. Nearly everyone agrees that retaining young people and attracting new ones is critical for Wyoming’s future. 
In the Cowboy State, decisions mean more when they reflect the voice of the people. Polling helps us listen, not politicize, showing what residents value most, what worries them and what gives them hope. It ensures every community has a seat at the table and captures the collective wisdom, optimism and grounded spirit of Wyoming. 
This data gives us confidence to make the important, and sometimes big, decisions to grow. It shows that most of Wyoming wants progress that fits our values, but also progress that keeps our families rooted here. 
More than half of the respondents have a child, grandchild or family member who has left the state for opportunities elsewhere. That fact hits home for many of us. However, the same poll shows that there is still deep hope and a desire to thrive. People want to see investment in job creation, housing and infrastructure. We want visible progress and responsible leadership. We want results, not excuses.
The greatest obstacle Wyoming faces is not a lack of opportunity. It is fear. Fear of change, conflict and the anxiety of losing the Wyoming we love. That fear often manifests as deeply damaging myths that block our path forward. 
One myth we hold onto is that our economy is just fine, and we have time to wait. The numbers tell a different story. Our state has seen a long-term decline in GDP and we have the highest rate of youth outmigration in the country. We watch businesses and our young people move to other places for better opportunities. Voters are feeling it, citing the cost of living and housing availability as top challenges. This is an urgent situation. 
Too often, those who support new ideas or projects stay quiet when the conversation turns loud or heated. We’ve seen this play out recently across the state. Even when most people support a business or development idea, many stay silent because they do not want to be caught in the crosshairs of controversy. 
That silence has a cost. It pushes opportunity away and tells the next business or investor that Wyoming might not be ready to grow. It sends the wrong message to our young people, who wonder if they can build a life here. 
We have always been pioneers, and our future must be led by a Team of Thousands — local leaders, businesses and partners who are ready to build.
Wyoming has a strong contingent of people who want progress and economic growth. The poll clearly shows that. People understand that our economy faces headwinds, but we are not giving up. We are practical, hopeful and ready to take bold action. 
Our job at the Wyoming Business Council is to help turn that collective optimism into a visible reality. These poll results are a roadmap for building stronger communities. Growth in Wyoming has always started locally. It begins with leadership at the community level and partnerships with the private sector. 
Wyoming residents are not opposed to investment. They simply want to know that their dollars are being used wisely. When local leaders and businesses work together and deliver results that matter, people respond with trust and support. 
We cannot afford to keep losing opportunities, especially when every one of us wants our children and grandchildren to live and thrive in the beauty of Wyoming. The good news is that none of us is alone in that hope. All across this state, there is a shared belief in the potential of Wyoming people and communities. 
There is opportunity everywhere, but we must make our optimism louder than the naysayers. Our challenge is to match belief with courage and take action.
The next chapter of Wyoming’s story will not be written by fear. It must be written by the people who dare to build.

(Getty Images)The private company that runs Idaho Medicaid mental health benefits is planning to cut pay rates for doctors and health care providers.
Magellan of Idaho, the contractor, plans to cut pay rates for Medicaid mental health services by at least 4% but up to 15% for partial hospitalizations, according to a notice it sent providers earlier this month. 
Idaho Medicaid cuts could force disability providers to close. The state wants to exempt services.

The cuts come after the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced 4% cuts to Medicaid provider pay rates, following Gov. Brad Little’s order for 3% midyear budget cuts across state government as state tax revenues lag behind expectations. Magellan’s cuts appear to be an attempt to offset cuts the company faces from Health and Welfare.
Many of the Medicaid mental health contractor’s cuts are scheduled to take effect in November. That leaves providers little time to plan, and it risks the state losing treatment options, especially in rural areas, said Jason Coombs, founder of Brick House Recovery, a substance abuse treatment center in Boise and Idaho Falls. 
“Idaho’s behavioral health system is built on the shoulders of dedicated providers who continue showing up for individuals and families in need,” he said in a statement. “We recognize that adjustments to Medicaid funding are complex, but they must be implemented in ways that protect continuity of care and sustain the professionals who make that care possible.”

 Idaho is working with managed care organizations to find cuts in contracts

Magellan is one of several private companies, called managed care organizations, that run Medicaid benefits in the state.
Idaho projected to end fiscal year with unconstitutional $56.6M state budget deficit 

In August, the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced 4% cuts to Medicaid provider pay rates. The agency said cuts would extend to the state’s payments to managed care organizations, and could turn into “provider rate reductions or changes to optional covered services.”
That came after Idaho Gov. Brad Little ordered all state agencies besides public schools to cut budgets midyear by 3% – which his budget chief directed agencies to extend permanently. 
The cuts were meant to avoid a projected $80 million budget shortfall, which would violate the Idaho Constitution’s requirement for the state to maintain a balanced budget. But projections released earlier this month show Idaho is still projected to have a budget deficit, to the tune of $56.6 million dollars.
It isn’t immediately clear how long Magellan’s cuts will last. 
“Magellan will continue to coordinate with (Health and Welfare) to determine how long these rate reductions must be in place or if other service changes are necessary to ensure a balanced budget,” the company wrote in its notice to providers. “Magellan understands this is a challenging budget situation and we will continue to work with the IBHP provider network to identify additional ways to reduce administrative costs so we can collectively support Idahoans.”

Magellan could not be immediately reached for comment.
The Department of Health and Welfare “has been working with managed care organizations to identify 4% decreases in their contracts,” agency spokesperson AJ McWhorter said in a statement. 
 How Idaho Medicaid’s mental health cuts work

On Oct. 2, Magellan notified Idaho Medicaid providers about the contractor’s cuts to pay rates for providers, which include 4% cuts to Diagnosis Related Group hospitals. That cut was made effective starting Sept. 1.
Starting Nov. 1, Magellan said the following cuts would take effect:

15% cuts to partial hospitalizations.
10% cuts to intensive outpatient care.
5% cuts to community-based American Society of Addiction Medicine, or ASAM, programs.
4% cuts to all other services on the contract, which is called the Idaho Behavioral Health Plan, or IBHP.

But some services would be excluded from the cuts, Magellan said, including:

Tribal providers
Children’s residential services
Institution for mental disease hospitals
Critical access hospitals, which are a designation for rural hospitals

David Lehman, a lobbyist for the Idaho Association of Community Providers and Cottonwood Creek Behavioral Hospital, said the impact of the cuts aren’t clear yet. He said he expects Health and Welfare will soon share guidance to providers.
But he thinks more cuts could come from the state.
“It is more likely than not that they’ll want to go deeper, or they’ll need to go deeper with cuts, if they’re not going to leverage the stabilization account that they have set up,” he told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview.

(Photo by Brett Carlsen/Getty Images)A nonprofit legal organization that has worked on dozens of high-profile lawsuits challenging the actions of President Donald Trump’s administration is representing Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris and other local officials in their recently filed lawsuit against Gov. Bill Lee’s deployment of the National Guard in Memphis.
The lawsuit, filed in Davidson County Chancery Court on Oct. 17, states that Lee “trampled on Tennessee law by unilaterally deploying Tennessee National Guard members in Memphis as a domestic police force,” something the state’s constitution prohibits without approval from the General Assembly. It seeks a temporary injunction to block Tennessee National Guard members from acting in Memphis until the legal challenge is settled. 
Skye Perryman, president and CEO of Democracy Forward, and litigation attorney Yenisey Rodriguez spoke alongside Harris and other plaintiffs in a Wednesday news conference.
“The Constitution is clear: No rebellion, no invasion, no deployment. State statutes are clear: No deployment, unless local government requests it or the legislature approves it,” Rodriguez, one of the lead attorneys in the lawsuit, said. “For more than 150 years, Tennessee has rejected the use of military forces to police its own civilians.”
“This isn’t a gray area or a partisan policy disagreement,” Rodriguez said. “This is a direct violation of the state constitution. Our clients have the responsibility to challenge it, and we are honored to be here with them in that challenge.”
Shelby County Mayor, elected officials sue Gov. Bill Lee over National Guard deployment

Democracy Forward formed in 2016 to challenge “threats to democracy and the wellbeing of Americans” in court and has filed more than 710 actions across more than 38 states, including 100 legal actions against Trump’s administration since he returned to office in 2025, according to its website.
Trump established the Memphis Safe Task Force in a presidential memo on Sept. 15, authorizing multiple federal agencies to work with state and local officials to “end street and violent crime in Memphis.” This memo also requested the support of Tennessee National Guard units to “support public safety and law enforcement operations.”
Lee agreed to deploy guardsmen, who joined more than 1,000 members of state and federal law enforcement agencies in Memphis beginning Oct. 10.
Harris said his office was told there are 159 National Guardsmen in Shelby County this week, up from 64 last week. The Tennessee National Guard did not respond to a request for confirmation.
Agencies that make up the task force have yet to release the names and charges of all individuals arrested since the task force’s launch.
Harris on Monday compared booking and bail data from the week of Oct. 6-12 with the data from the same week in 2023 and 2024, showing that both bookings and the number of bail determinations have roughly doubled in comparison. Felony and misdemeanor bail determinations for Oct. 6-12 are also higher this year compared to previous years. 
“We’ve seen a dramatic increase in the number of folks that have been booked — that is to say, arrested — for misdemeanor offenses,” Harris said.
In 2024, Shelby County courts set bail for 222 felony cases and 162 misdemeanor cases over that 7-day period. This year, the county logged 346 felony bail determinations and 300 misdemeanor bail determinations.

Mayor Harris: Lawsuit solely challenges National Guard deployment
In an earlier news conference on Monday, Harris emphasized that the lawsuit “is about the National Guard and deployment of military personnel, and it is not about the (other agencies that make up the) Memphis Safe Task Force.”
Shelby County officials have previously called for other state and federal agencies to “surge their investment in resources in Memphis and Shelby County,” Harris said. This includes advocating for the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation Crime Lab to remain in Shelby County, opposing the removal of the FBI Field Office from the county in December 2024 and pushing for “sensible gun legislation” from the Tennessee state legislature. 
What the city wants is collaboration, Memphis City Council member JB Smiley, Jr., one of the plaintiffs, said Monday.
“We are always prepared to discuss how federal and state resources can help decrease crime in Shelby County that do not involve the National Guard,” Smiley said.
Attorney says more plaintiffs are welcome
The lawsuit was brought by Harris, state Rep. Gabby Salina and Rep. G.A. Hardaway, both Memphis Democrats, state Sen. Jeff Yarbro, a Nashville Democrat, Shelby County Commissioners Erika Sugarmon and Henri E. Brooks, and Smiley.

The suit names Lee, Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti and Tennessee National Guard Major General Warner Ross III as defendants. 
Harris clarified Monday that the City of Memphis was not asked to join the lawsuit.
The lawsuit has underscored the different approaches taken by the Shelby County mayor and Memphis Mayor Paul Young in responding to the task force’s presence.
At an Oct. 20 town hall hosted by Vecindarios 901, Young said his strategy “has been and continues to be to keep this task force focused on violent crime as opposed to immigration.” This includes embedding task force members into Memphis Police Department units including organized crime and homicide.
Young said he does not think the lawsuit is “going to stand the legal test.”
“It’s not something that the city’s going to be involved in,” he said.
On Wednesday, Harris said he did not have any comments about the City of Memphis “signing on or not signing on.”
Rodriguez, one of the lawsuit’s lead attorneys, said the plaintiffs believe they have the “appropriate parties” to “seek the relief that’s needed here, and we welcome any of those who are interested in participating in our lawsuit moving forward.”
Attorney addresses lawsuit’s scope
Attorneys for the plaintiffs on Wednesday said they are not concerned about Davidson County Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal’s denial of a separate request for a preliminary injunction, which sought to stop National Guard activity before the lawsuit’s first hearing on Nov. 3.
“We really do believe the court will be fair in hearing all parties, and we have no concern that a denied (preliminary injunction) — from our experience in many other cases across the country — indicates any weakness in our case or anything about the future of this legislation,” Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez also addressed the lawsuit’s limited scope, in light of previous remarks from Harris and other officials about potential racial profiling during task force traffic stops.
“We know there are many issues here, and there’s many ways to tackle them,” she said. “That’s just simply not our lawsuit. We pursued the claims that we thought we could at this moment, and we are definitely committed to working on —  with all our coalition partners both locally and nationally — to figure out what other issues we can tackle.”
Harris said Monday that he has heard “troubling actions on the part of those that have been deployed to Memphis and Shelby County” as part of the task force, but he has yet to receive a response from the task force’s leaders. 
“We would love to hear some sort of response about what they’re doing to address these anecdotal claims that there has been (racial) profiling since the deployment,” Harris said, adding that he would like to see daily reports with demographic data.
“We don’t want to make claims around what is happening without information,” he said.

(Photo by Liz Cartwright for the Idaho Capital Sun) POCATELLO — The sagebrush steppe land that covers the hills around Pocatello and many parts of the Western U.S. is a beautiful, diverse landscape; it is also shrinking at a rapid rate due to drought associated with climate change, overgrazing by cattle and increasingly intense wildfires. Cheatgrass and other invasive species fuel wildfires that damage habitats and human-built structures. 
The Sagebrush Steppe Land Trust has teamed up with the Idaho Goat Grazers to test an age-old, organic method of weed control — grazing goats. 
The Century Heights portion of the land trust is made up of 266 acres of land in Bannock County that has been under its care since 2018. According to the land trust’s website, its mission is to “… protect, connect, and enhance wildlife habitat, working lands, and community spaces in Southeast Idaho, now and for future generations. Sagebrush Steppe Land Trust works with willing landowners in Southeast Idaho to conserve private land by creating tailored agreements, known as conservation easements, to protect land while keeping it in private ownership.”

This land trust area is essential grazing land for the large herds of mule deer that migrate across southeast Idaho. This makes the Century Heights land ideal for being in the trust.
“We look for land that connects wildlife migration routes,” said Carly Flandro, a spokesperson for the Sagebrush Steppe Land Trust.
 Idaho goats expertly take on cheatgrass, other invasive plant species

In recent years, cheatgrass has proliferated in the region, and the land trust has been searching for the best means of controlling that invasive species. 
Zachary Copeland of Idaho Goat Grazers has been working with the Sagebrush Steppe Land Trust for several months using his goats to clean up the cheatgrass and other invasive species.

Earlier this year, Copeland’s herd of 70 Spanish goats grazed the upper ravines of the spring growth of cheatgrass. Now, in late October the herd is back to graze the lower ravines of Century Heights. 
“We are trying to see how the cheatgrass handles spring grazing versus fall grazing and see how much of it we can eliminate,” Copeland said.  
“The reason we are doing this now, is that cheatgrass is invasive and germinates in the fall, whereas the other native plants don’t germinate until the spring,” said Hannah Clawson, Sagebrush Steppe Land Trust’s stewardship coordinator. “So cheatgrass gets a huge head start which is why it is so prolific.”
On the beautiful fall afternoon when I met with Zachary and representatives from the land trust, the goats were having a great time doing their job. In a few hours, they cleaned up large swathes of Century Heights, leaving behind only a much safer environment and a bit of goat fertilizer. 
Goats graze on invasive weeds in Bannock County. (Photo by Liz Cartwright for the Idaho Capital Sun)
Goats are particularly good at destroying the cheatgrass because of “the way they chew their cud, it breaks up the seeds better than other animals,” Copeland told me. 
In other settings, herbicides like glyphosate (Roundup-ultra) are used to control cheatgrass. These chemicals are dangerous to human health and the health of all living creatures that come in contact with them according to a 2022 systematic review of the scientific literature. There appears to be a strong linkage between glyphosate and some cancers, Parkinson’s disease and other neurological disorders, according to another 2022 scientific review in the journal Environmental Research. 
Finding ways to combat noxious weeds in a manner that is not harmful to our planet is increasingly important as humans live more closely intertwined with natural spaces and as our planet continues warming. 
Using goat grazing to control cheatgrass is a positive step forward in creating a sustainable, safe and healthy environmental solution for this invasive species problem.

(Thanasis Zovoilis | Getty Images)When Casey Russell visited her Clarksburg food pantry on Tuesday, items were already becoming scarce. She didn’t receive the normal amount of food, like fresh meat and canned goods, she relies to help feed three grandchildren and one great-grandchild who she raises full time. 
She also depends on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, but that money for food won’t come late this month due to the federal government shut down. 
“I’m very scared,” said Russell, 55, who adopted the four children in 2021. “I’m just going to try to go to different food pantries if I can. It’s hard for me because I don’t drive, so I have to find a ride. I just may not be able to pay some bills because of it to buy food, you know?”
About 270,000 — or one in six — West Virginia residents use SNAP benefits, including people 60 and older who qualify for the federal food stamp program. 
Half of all SNAP households in the state have a disabled or elderly member — a higher rate than the national average.
“I think it’s going to greatly affect quite a few of our seniors,” said Beverly Fitzgerald, executive director of the Harrison County Senior Center. 
The West Virginia Department of Human Services posted on social media that delays in issuing SNAP benefits for October should be expected. 
Asked whether the state could foot the bill to cover SNAP benefits, Drew Galang, spokesperson for Gov. Patrick Morrisey, said that West Virginia and other states do not have the money to shoulder the costs of the federal program. He blamed Senate Democrats for the “Schumer shutdown.” 
“The solution is simple: Senate Democrats can vote to pass a clean [continuing resolution] — the same one they voted to pass 13 times under Joe Biden — at any time to reopen the government and prevent further delays to SNAP benefits,” Galang wrote in an email.
He went on to encourage residents to use Family Resource Network centers and food pantries and to contact their caseworker for help finding resources. On Thursday, Morrisey said he’d expedite money to food pantries that was previously appropriated by the Legislature earlier this year. No new state money has been granted for pantries at this time. 
In Harrison County, Fitzgerald said that increased food prices have affected the senior center’s ability to keep its food pantry shelves full. Seniors rely on the pantry and its food boxes, she said, because SNAP already doesn’t cover their monthly food needs.
“We’re probably going to see an increase in people coming to the pantry for food,” Fitzgerald said. “I don’t know if we can meet the need.”
Many grandparents in West Virginia are raising their grandkids 
West Virginia has a large number of grandparents raising grandchildren; it’s largely due to the state’s drug epidemic.
More than 100,000 SNAP recipients in West Virginia are children.
C. Sergent, 58, has legal custody of two grandchildren who are 2 and 15 years old. The children receive SNAP benefits.
“I don’t know how I’m going to feed my family,” she said. “Because we already struggle, and this is going to make it worse. All of the Senate and all of these people in Washington are not understanding.”
Hanna Thurman is executive director of the Healthy Grandfamilies program, a free program housed at West Virginia State University that provides information and resources to grandparents raising grandchildren. The organization doesn’t collect information about who is using SNAP.
“Grandparents are already on a fixed income and face food insecurity often,” Thurman said. “This just makes it all the more difficult to make the choices that they’re having to make between food and medicine and utilities.”
She also noted that many grandparents they work with don’t have cars to access in-person food pickups. 
Bobbi Holland, a board member for Meals on Wheels Inc. of Charleston, said the organization serves about 50 people in the city, and is at capacity. She expects she may get calls from people because of the delay in SNAP benefits, but the organization can’t take on many more individuals. 
“We would love to do more but we are struggling to get volunteers,” Holland said. “We’ve been going over 50 years, but it’s getting harder and harder.”
SNAP benefits delay likely to continue into November 
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-West Virginia, said Thursday that she doesn’t think the government shutdown will end by the Nov. 1 deadline.

The delay in SNAP benefits is very likely to stretch into next month, according to Department of Human Services.
Capito told MetroNews earlier this week that Republicans are willing to negotiate with Democrats over health insurance premiums, but that not while the government is “held hostage.” Democrats want “guaranteed results” that are an unreasonable ask, she said.
She added that people no longer getting SNAP and other federal benefits may be the “pressure point” needed to open the government.
“It’s sad in a way it has to come to that point but in a way we’ve got to have something that’s going to pop the bubble, and so this could be it,” Capito said. 
At issue are subsidies that help thousands of West Virginians afford health insurance that would expire at the end of the year unless Congress extends them. 
According to the West Virginia Center on Budget and Policy, the 67,000 West Virginians who buy insurance through the marketplace would see their premiums increase by an average of 133% or $1,400 annually if the subsidies are not extended. About 15,000 West Virginians would lose their health care because they can no longer afford it, according to the Center on Budget and Policy. 
The McDowell County Commission on Aging, which serves seniors in the state’s poorest county, is preparing for possible increased need due to the SNAP benefits delay, according to executive director Donald Reed.
They’d already seen an increase lately in seniors eating at the center due to the grocery prices, he said. The center provides a free hot meal to more than 200 seniors on weekdays.
“If those benefits don’t hit, we are prepared to feed those additional people who show up,” Reed said.

It was her MI Bridges app — the site through which state benefits are provided — alerting her that her Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, also known as SNAP, would not be sent to her in November due to the federal government shutdown.
“What went through my head at that moment is like, ‘Wow, they’re really gonna do this to families that’s trying to feed their children,’” she said. “It just made me just go into a panic. I actually had an anxiety attack.”
The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services formally announced later Thursday morning that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has instructed them to cease payment of SNAP benefits for the month of November due to the ongoing federal shutdown. 
Now, concerns like Wilkes’s are front of mind for many of the approximately 1.4 million people in Michigan receiving SNAP benefits, about 43% of whom are families with children and 36% with members of the family who are older adults or disabled.

By definition, SNAP benefits do not allow recipients to save up for emergencies such as this.
“Benefits really aren’t all that much money,” Elinor Jordan, a public benefits law attorney at the Michigan Poverty Law Project, explained. “Every little bit is deducted. The families cannot have any cushion or their SNAP benefits would be reduced based on that cushion.”
So, as Wilkes said, “What do they expect us to do?”
State Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) said that the change is “going to trigger all the folks at the state and the local governments, and then community action agencies and nonprofits, to start to scramble for what they can do to try to make sure that folks who are depending upon SNAP for food aren’t going without, aren’t literally starving.”
As Irwin suggested, some might expect food banks and food pantries to fill in these gaps. However, Phil Knight, executive director of the Food Bank Council of Michigan, explained that food banks are meant to “supplement, not substitute” food assistance. 
“Asking charity to be the safety net to the government safety net? It’s just back-ass-ward to me,” he said. 
Jordan experienced this firsthand when her family was volunteering at their church’s food bank over the weekend — before the SNAP pause was officially announced, but as it was becoming more likely that it might happen as the federal government shutdown stretched on. 
With about 90 families still in line, she said, the food bank ran out of food.

Knight noted that the changes to SNAP will not change the purpose of Michigan’s food banks, and that they will continue to do everything that they are able.
“The mission of the Feeding America food banks here in Michigan doesn’t change,” he said. “We’re always going to come alongside our neighbors, because we’re convinced they are people worthy of investment, not necessarily a problem to be solved.”
“But I’m just trying to temper expectations, that when you pull $15 billion a month out of a national economy and expect charity to step in and nobody miss a beat,” Knight added. “That’s unrealistic.”
Many advocates were highly critical of President Donald Trump and his administration for making the decision to cut funding. 
“As this rogue administration prioritizes tax breaks for billionaires, they’re simultaneously stripping away basic healthcare, food, and social services from those who need them most,” wrote Danielle Atkinson, the executive director of Detroit-based Mothering Justice, in a statement. 
“This administration is targeting the single parents already stretching every dollar, the seniors choosing between groceries and medicine, and the workers earning too little to make ends meet in an economy stacked against them,” Atkinson continued. “Now, because of political games being played in Congress, they’re being told to wait. Lawmakers working in support of pausing SNAP will be responsible when our kids go hungry.”
And Rep. Sharon MacDonell (D-Troy) wrote to the Michigan Advance, “With President Trump claiming that the federal shutdown gives him authority to unilaterally cancel ‘Democrat programs’, I have little doubt that his administration is pausing SNAP payments because it wants to, not because it has to.”
Others called on him to activate contingency measures — including over $5 billion in funding that was appropriated in 2024 and 2025 to act as a reserve fund for SNAP specifically, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. The group estimated a month of full benefits to cost around $8 billion.
Shutdown likely to halt food benefits for 42 million in just days

“This pause and benefits is entirely avoidable. The federal government has both the authority and the tools to keep SNAP funds flowing,” Julie Cassidy, a senior policy analyst at the Michigan League for Public Policy, said. 
“We shouldn’t be making this false choice between funding food assistance and making sure people can still afford their health insurance premiums,” she added, with Affordable Care Act credits being a major piece of Congressional Democrats’ resistance to the budget. 
Partisan finger-pointing offers little comfort
As the shutdown stretches on, elected officials in both parties pointed fingers at the other side of the aisle to blame for the lack of a federal budget. 
State Sen. Jonathan Lindsey (R-Coldwater) wrote to the Advance, “Of course I can’t speak to why Chuck Schumer and the Democrats have shut down the government.”
Lindsey also added concerns about SNAP funding more broadly — concerns that are shared by high-level Trump officials, including Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. on what food is eligible to be purchased with SNAP. 
“It looks like the silver lining here is that the billions of SNAP dollars, which all come from taxpayers, will not be spent subsidizing junk food for a period of time,” Lindsey wrote.
And after posting resources, including lists of food banks, on her Facebook page, state Rep. Angela Rigas (R-Alto) added a line — in response to a commenter’s suggestion — reading, “Tell Senator Elissa Slotkin and Senator Gary Peters to vote to reopen the federal government!”
Meanwhile, Rep. Natalie Price (D-Berkley) said she didn’t accept the contention that Democrats were responsible for the current situation.
“This is fully the Republicans making the shutdown, and they need to stop trying to place blame. I think Michiganders are smarter than to buy that,” Price said.
Republicans have majorities in both houses of Congress as well as control the White House.
“Hopefully, the Republicans who run Congress and who are sitting in the office of the President get a budget done and get these funds out to the people who need them,” Irwin added. 










Lawmakers working in support of pausing SNAP will be responsible when our kids go hungry.


– Danielle Atkinson, executive director of Detroit-based Mothering Justice


But the long-term effects of the shutdown and the resulting SNAP pause are more than political. By law, Cassidy explained, all the benefits not received at this time should come to SNAP recipients once a budget is signed and SNAP funding is flowing again. 
Jennifer Garner, a professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Michigan, explained how any lapse in SNAP funding, especially if it becomes extended, can have lasting economic and health impacts.. 
“When we are in times of uncertainty like this, when we don’t know what our food resources are going to look like in the weeks and months to come, it is not unreasonable to hedge your bets by focusing on shelf-stable foods that will last a long time,” she said. “And so that’s where compromises nutritionally can come into play.”
Without SNAP funding, recipients will have less capacity to purchase fresh foods — including through programs like the Double Up Food Bucks program, which allows SNAP dollars to be spent in places like farmer’s markets. 
“We’ve been working hard over the past decade to create these bridges between SNAP participants and direct to consumer markets, and that benefits local farmers, and that specifically benefits farmers who are selling produce, growing and selling produce, which is important to support that segment of our agricultural economy,” Garner explained. “When SNAP is paused, folks can’t engage in models like that.”
That hurts farmers, as well as local grocery stores and local retailers. 
“For every dollar spent in food assistance, there’s $1.80 generated in economic activity, and a lot of that goes to our local communities, our Michigan businesses,” Price said. “This is an irresponsible, harmful decision that goes against the things that the administration claims they’re doing with these cuts.”
But for Knight at the Food Bank Council, despite any difficulties ahead, he remains encouraged by the people visiting his food bank. 
“They’re resilient, they’re smart, they’re dealing with a lot of things in life with less resources than most of us,” he said. “To be very candid, they have my admiration.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The U.S. government shutdown is affecting everything from state unemployment reports to food stamps and the judiciary, forcing U.S. Attorney’s offices in Tennessee to scale back workers while causing a bit of sniping by state lawmakers.
House Democrats are asking Gov. Bill Lee to call a special session to approve funding for federal food and energy programs as 690,000 Tennesseans face the prospects of losing November benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps, if feds drag out the budget stalemate.
“We, as state officials, have a duty to step up and lead so that innocent children and disabled and low-income adults do not go hungry or lose vital aid when our state has the means to help them,” Rep. John Ray Clemmons, chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said in a Thursday statement.
They made their request of the governor following a report that Lee and Republican leaders said they wouldn’t fill the funding gap.
Clemmons backed up his argument by saying Lee called special sessions to create a private-school voucher program, approve a “third-grade retention” bill, address public safety after The Covenant School shooting, set up a Megasite Authority and fund BlueOval City and try to deal with COVID measures. Why not help poor people?
Lee’s office didn’t respond to questions Thursday. A word to the wise: Don’t hold your breath while waiting.
Nearly 1 in 10 Tennesseans could lose SNAP benefits come November if government shutdown continues

Besides the SNAP snafu, Tennessee couldn’t file its September unemployment report this week because of the spending stalemate in Washington, D.C. 
People on unemployment will continue to receive benefits through the state’s Unemployment Insurance Program. But federal workers placed on furlough are being encouraged to file on the state’s website to expedite the process. The state’s trust fund has a balance of $1.5 billion.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office in West Tennessee is among those sending employees home, except for personnel exempt from work restrictions during an appropriations lapse, according to information obtained by the Lookout.
Citizens “can be assured” that essential federal law enforcement, criminal prosecution and national security functions will keep going without interruption, the office says. That includes handling cases brought by the Memphis Safe Task Force operation.
U.S. Attorney Mike Dunavant “is not otherwise currently available for a public comment,” the statement says.
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Nashville couldn’t be reached this week for comment to see if it’s undertaking the same furlough program, likely because of the mandated layoffs. 
(In a former life, we called this “fur-cation, even though it wasn’t very funny.)
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, a Franklin Republican, laid the blame for the shutdown at the feet of Democrats in the U.S. Senate.
“It’s a simple extension of the existing budget, and I’m tired of the Democrats playing political games with our nation, and a lot of people are going to be hurt by that,” Johnson said.
 
The U.S. Senate is short of the 60 votes it needs to approve the spending measure. Democrats and independents are using that to broker a deal extending health insurance tax credits and reversing Trump’s Medicaid reductions to the poor, elderly and disabled in the One Big Beautiful Bill.
Memphis Sen. London Lamar doesn’t see eye to eye with Johnson, pointing out Democrats don’t control any branch of the federal government.
“The problem is you’ve got members of the Republican Party who do not agree with the budget bill in front of them because so many of their constituents, business owners, independent contractors, all of these working-class, middle-class folks are also on the Affordable Care Act, who are dependent on this healthcare system to allow them to access essential care,” said Lamar, chairman of the Senate Democratic Caucus.
The big bill threatens 22 million people’s healthcare insurance.
Tossing out the first pitch
The legislature’s new Ways and Means Committee approved acceptance Thursday of a $26 million federal grant to provide services for crime victims.
In its inaugural meeting, the panel received a relative softball. Who’s going to vote against helping people who’ve been robbed or beaten?
The committee took testimony from the Office of Criminal Justice Programs, District Attorneys Conference and other crime victim advocates, who described the necessity of accepting the grant funds for people who, otherwise, would be traumatized as much by the criminal justice system as they were by the crime. Nonprofit agencies receive the majority of the money to provide services such as helping victims at crime scenes, putting them in domestic violence shelters and sitting with them in court.
Lawmakers created the committee this year after legislation was floated that would have required review of every single dollar the feds send this way. Ultimately, they settled on grants exceeding $25 million.
Considering federal funds make up at least 35% of Tennessee’s $59.5 billion budget, this committee has plenty of work ahead. 
One jaded character surmised that lawmakers simply needed another day’s worth of committees so they could collect per diem in the off season.
Looking for money
Two lawmakers joined the group, Make Our Schools Safe Tennessee, this week in the Capitol to push for full funding of Alyssa’s Law.
Adopted on a limited basis, the law is designed to equip school personnel with silent push-button alarms they can use to alert police in case of a shooting, fight or other type of serious disturbance.

Only a couple of school districts are putting the alarm devices to use this year in a pilot program. But Senate Majority Leader Johnson and Rep. Ron Gant said they want to expand the program to every public school statewide.
The law is named for Alyssa Alhadeff, a child killed in the 2018 Parkland Middle School shooting. Several states, including New Jersey, Florida and New York, adopted versions of the measure, but it’s just catching on here.
Holly Walker, co-founder of the school safety group, said the problem took on personal meaning for her seven years ago when she received a text that her niece was in a lockdown at Parkland Middle School with an active shooter on the loose at the nearby high school.
She felt the same way in March 2023 when six people, including three 9-year-olds, were killed at The Covenant School in Nashville.
“Every parent deserves confidence that their child’s school is prepared” for such emergencies, Walker said.
Gant acknowledged the biggest hurdle would be securing funding from the legislature for the panic alarms, which are expected to cost $16,000 per school, about $28.8 million for the state’s 1,800 public schools. 
The plan doesn’t call for putting them in private schools. But since the state is spending $144 million to send 20,000 students to private schools this year, shouldn’t it be just as concerned about their safety as it is about the kids in public schools? 
Funding private and charters
Barely into the state’s first year of a private-school voucher program, a new nonprofit entity called Tennessee Leads is setting lofty goals that would empty the state’s traditional public schools. The dark-money group can lobbying and spend as much as it wants on political campaigns.
Some 20,000 students are receiving $7,300 to attend private schools this year, and another 4,400 attend charter schools, which are considered public but are run by private groups.
Clearly that’s not enough.
Tennessee Leads wants 200,000 vouchers by 2031 and 250,000 students in charter schools. This would leave the state with about 550,000 students in traditional public schools.
Yet it would spend more money if it continues to pay school districts to offset the cost of losing students with vouchers to private schools. 
During debate on the initial Education Savings Account for low-income students six years ago, opponents said approving it would put the camel’s nose under the tent. If this group has its way, the camel will be carrying the tent on its hump.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)LAFAYETTE – Interim University of Louisiana Lafayette President Jaimie Hebert announced in a Thursday afternoon email to faculty and staff that 70 employees across all divisions will be cut through a combination of position eliminations, retirements, resignations and reassignments as the university seeks to close in on a $25 million structural deficit. These cuts are in addition to the six positions eliminated last month.
To date, Hebert wrote, the university has identified $20.5 million in reductions toward addressing that deficit. He said $15 million in additional reductions would be coming soon.
Below is Hebert’s email:
Over the past several months, we have worked to address the University’s structural deficit. Through careful planning, collaboration and community input – as well as difficult but necessary decisions – we have made meaningful progress. I want to update you on where we are and share our next steps.
Earlier today, I met with leaders of the University of Louisiana System to discuss our continued financial realignment and to outline the actions we will take to ensure the University’s long-term stability. Here’s what I shared. 
To date, we have identified $20.5 million in reductions toward addressing our $25 million structural deficit. As part of this broader effort, 70 employees across all divisions are affected through a combination of position eliminations, retirements, resignations and reassignments. This total does not include the six positions announced last month.
These personnel changes were not made lightly. They came after thoughtful consideration by division vice presidents, other University administrators and supervisors of needs and priorities. These decisions are rooted in the responsibility we all share to make choices that strengthen the University’s future.
Supervisors will meet with affected employees on Friday. I know this is an uncertain and emotional time and this news will certainly deepen that anxiety. We have chosen to share this information now to give our community time to process and to ensure that communication happens with care.
Each affected employee has contributed to the life and mission of this University. We are grateful for their service to our students, colleagues and community. We are committed to treating every individual with compassion, respect and support throughout this transition.
Our work is not finished, however. We must now address the remaining $5 million of the structural deficit and begin tackling the University’s recurring debt of approximately $25 million. To do so, we have established a target of $15 million in additional reductions over the coming months – enough to erase the remaining deficit and begin resolving the first $10 million of our recurring debt. This step is essential to achieving financial stability and positioning UL Lafayette for long-term health and growth.
As we navigate this period of challenge, our dedication to the University’s mission remains unwavering. We will continue to focus on teaching, research and service to the community and state, taking each next step with steadiness and purpose. Because ultimately, what defines this University is not the challenges we face, but how we face them. We have met difficult times before and emerged stronger. And we will again.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/UL-Lafayette-sign-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-24 06:17:54.074992

Despite moving up to Class 5A, the Bulldogs have out-scored opponents 282-62","Knolyn Bailey, a bright-eyed, just-turned-16-year-old, 10th grade running back, has grown up attending football games at Lanier High where his mother teaches. Most years, he says, there was little to cheer where the Bulldogs were concerned.
Rick Cleveland
“We usually got blown out,” Bailey says. “It was a sight to see, not in a good way.”
That’s an understatement. Four of the last 15 Lanier football seasons have been winless. During the first four years of Bailey’s life, the Bulldogs lost 38 consecutive games. Lanier, traditionally a basketball powerhouse with 17 state championships, has won only three football playoff games in school history and has never made it past the second round of the playoffs.
And that brings us to one of the most startling developments in Jackson Public Schools football history. The current Lanier Bulldogs are a perfect 8-0 heading into a Friday night showdown at Florence. Despite moving up to Class 5A, the Bulldogs have out-scored opponents 282-62. Bailey has run for 1,540 yards and 15 touchdowns.

Surely, Richard Wright, the famous author and a Lanier grad, would have loved to write this story. Lanier, the proud little school on Maple Street, celebrates its 100th year of existence with its best football team ever.  You can’t miss the biggest – and I mean, BIGGEST reason – for this sudden success. He is 6-feet, 6-inch, 315-pound Tommy Kelly, the former Mississippi State and NFL standout, who towers over nearly all his Lanier players.
Says Knolyn Bailey, a smart young man who already attends some college classes at Tougaloo, “Coach Kelly changed the culture here. He has given us structure.”
In the three seasons prior to Kelly’s Lanier arrival in 2024, the Bulldogs won only seven games while losing 24. In 2024, Kelly’s first Bulldogs finished 8-3 and made the Class 4A playoffs. The current eight-game win streak is the longest in school history.
First question: How did this happen?
“Discipline and structure,” Kelly answers. “What can I say? The kids have bought in. At every level of football I played, I learned from some great coaches. I try to coach these kids the way I was coached, and besides that I have a really good coaching staff.”
Second question: Why in the world is a man who once signed a $50 million NFL contract coach a high school football team for about $60,000 a year? Clearly, he doesn’t need the money.

“My players ask me that sometimes,” Kelly says. “The answer is I’ve always wanted to coach, even back when I was playing high school ball at Provine, I knew I was someday gonna coach. This is what I’ve wanted to do my whole life. This is my dream.
“You know, I played for Willie Collins, a great coach, at Provine. I played for Jackie Sherrill, a great coach, at State. I played for coaches like Bill Belichick and Bruce Arians in the pros. I’ve learned from all of them. It’d be a shame to waste all that.”
Both Collins and Wayne Brent, who coached Kelly in basketball at Provine, remember him as a teen-aged sports junkie. Says Brent, “In my 35 years of coaching, I’ve never had another one like Tommy. He knew everything there was to know about players and teams in all the sports. He was a sports encyclopedia.”

Basketball was Kelly’s first love and he played on Provine’s state championship teams. After playing football and basketball as a freshman, he concentrated on basketball as a sophomore and junior before finally returning to football as a senior, graduating in 1999. He instantly became a highly valued college football recruit. Nick Saban came to Provine from Michigan State to recruit him. Virtually every school in the country wanted him. He committed to Ole Miss first before eventually winding up at State, where Sherrill called him “a diamond in the rough who just needs to be polished.”
Sherrill now says he isn’t the least surprised by Kelly’s success as a coach. “He was very smart, especially when it came to football,” Sherrill says. “He picked up things easily.”

Kelly came to Lanier from Provine, where he was the defensive line coach and coordinator for his alma mater. And this will give you another idea of Kelly’s impact: In 2023, his last year there, Provine beat Lanier 40-0. But Kelly’s first Lanier team beat Provine 16-6 and, this season Lanier routed Provine 30-8.
Says Kelly, “I am still a Provine fan 364 days a year, but not on the day we play them.”
Darrell Roberts, a 16-year-old junior and Lanier’s starting quarterback and safety, has experienced the remarkable transformation of Lanier Bulldogs football.
“The year before Coach Kelly got here, we weren’t locked in as a team,” Roberts says. “We had a lot of guys who didn’t care about football. There’s just a lot more discipline now, at lot more focus on football.”
Jamison Kelly, a 17-year-old senior running back and cornerback, doesn’t know anything about Lanier football before Tommy Kelly. All the other Bulldogs call Tommy Kelly “Coach.” Jamison Kelly calls him “Dad.”
Jamison transferred to Lanier from Madison Central, where he had started at safety as a sophomore. Jamison, one of several Bulldogs who play both offense and defense, has committed to play college football at Southern Illinois. He expects to play a lot more Lanier football first.
“I believe we can go all the way to the state championship. I really do,” Jamison says.
At Lanier, Jamison and his teammates practice on a hardscrabble, unkempt and un-lined field, bare in some areas and ankle-high in weeds in others. They lift weights in shifts because of the weight room is so small.

“It’s what we got,” says Tommy Kelly. “You gotta make do with what you’ve got. We just go with it. I think it motivates our guys when we go to other places and see the nice facilities they have. We play with a chip on our shoulder.”
Knolyn Bailey, the sophomore who takes college classes and scores touchdowns in bunches, has had the opportunity to transfer to private schools where the facilities are much nicer. He has remained at Lanier where his friends are and where Kelly teaches life lessons.
Bailey remembers making a critical defensive mistake last year as a freshman and returning to the sideline to face Coach Kelly. Instead of a tongue lashing, he got a huge arm around his shoulder and a softly spoken but matter-of-fact explanation of what he did wrong and what he should do instead the next time.
“It’s tough love you get from Coach Kelly,” Bailey says. “He can be funny, but when it’s time to work, it’s time to work, and we work. We plan to go all the way. Why not?”
Besides Florence Friday night, Lanier has games remaining with Cleveland Central and Vicksburg. None of the three figures to be easy. Should the Bulldogs get to the Class 5A playoffs, the likes of traditional powerhouses West Point, South Jones and Brookhaven would stand in the way.

Tommy Kelly says he loves the fact that his players believe they can compete with anybody and win a championship.
“You gotta believe in yourself,” he says. “You gotta believe in your dreams.”

Scott Perry (R-10th District) and Democratic challenger Janelle Stelson (U.S. House photo/Stelson campaign)For the first time in the 2026 cycle, a Democratic challenger in Pennsylvania has outraised an incumbent in what is shaping up to be one of the most closely watched U.S. House races in the country.
Democrat Janelle Stelson, a former television anchor in central Pennsylvania, raised $1.24 million from the beginning of July to the end of September, nearly doubling the haul of GOP U.S. Rep. Scott Perry (R-10th District) over the past three months. She raised more than any other 2026 U.S. House candidate in Pennsylvania during the third quarter and is the only one to raise over $1 million in the latest finance report.
Perry, who is currently serving his seventh term in Congress, raised just under $650,000 from the beginning of July to the end of September.
In 2024, Perry defeated Stelson by 1.2 points, which was his closest race since winning a seat in Congress representing southcentral Pennsylvania.
Listen to John and Emily’s audio recap:

Christopher Borick, director of Muhlenberg College’s Institute of Public Opinion, said he believes the close race last year gives Stelson a pitch that with a different national environment, Democrats think they can flip the seat.
“That’s a big quarter for her and a sign of her strength in this race,” Borick told the Capital-Star.
However, Borick added that Perry, whose three-month haul is the third highest among Pennsylvania U.S. House candidates over the last three months, is also strong.
“If it wasn’t juxtaposed against Stelson, you might say, ‘Okay, he’s in a good position,’” Borick said. “But when you lose to a challenger by basically twice the amount, that should be some warning signs for you that you’re probably going to have to do better.”
Stelson, who formally declared for the seat in July, is supported by a number of elected officials, including Gov. Josh Shapiro. Perry, a former chairman of the conservative U.S. House Freedom Caucus who backed Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, has the president’s support.
Although a rematch may be in the cards between Perry and Stelson, there are other candidates in the race on both sides.
Two Democrats, Dauphin County Commissioner Justin Douglas and Army veteran Will Lillich, have entered the picture.
Douglas, who filed paperwork to run for the seat on Sept. 8, raised $55,000 from that point until the end of the month, while spending $5,000. Lillich did not file a campaign finance report for Q3.
Isabelle Harman, an Army veteran and registered Independent, raised $16,000 since entering the race in September, which includes a loan of just under $14,000 she gave to her campaign.
Republican Karen Dalton, an attorney who worked for the state House GOP caucus, registered to primary Perry for the nomination. She has not filed a campaign finance report yet.
Despite the strong quarter from Stelson, Perry entered October with a cash on hand advantage. Perry entered Q4 with $1.35 million on hand, while Stelson had just under $970,000, and Douglas had $50,000 on hand.
The Cook Political Report rates the race in the 10th as a “toss-up.”

Street jumps out to early fundraising lead in race to replace U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans
Multiple Philadelphia lawmakers posted strong numbers in the first fundraising report filed since U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans (D-3rd District) announced he wasn’t seeking reelection in 2026.
State Sen. Sharif Street, former chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party, led the way by raising just over $350,000, while state Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia) finished with the second highest figure by bringing in just over $255,000 during the same stretch.
Rep. Morgan Cephas, chair of the Philadelphia Caucus in the state House, raised $155,000 from the beginning of September when she launched her candidacy to the end of the month.
As of Oct. 20, nine Democratic Party candidates have filed to run for the Philadelphia-based seat, which is more than any other U.S. House race in Pennsylvania.
Borick, noting it’s a safe Democratic district, said the crowded field for the Democratic nomination is not a surprise, given the winner will likely be determined by the primary election.
Although the three members of the state General Assembly raised the most this quarter, there were other candidates that filed fundraising reports.
Dave Oxman, a physician, raised just under $110,000 from the beginning of July to the end of September. Karl Morris, a professor at Temple University, brought in just under $40,000, which includes a $10,000 loan he gave to his campaign.
Entering October, Street’s campaign also had the most cash on hand with just over $370,000. Oxman has the second highest with slightly more than $330,000 on hand, followed by Rabb’s $180,000, Cephas having just under $120,000, and Morris with just over $10,000.
Several candidates have not submitted a campaign finance report yet, including Robin Toldens, who the Philadelphia Inquirer reports is a former city government employee and real estate agent, Cole Carter, a software engineer, Isaiah T Martin III, and Dr. Ala Stanford, founder of the Black Doctors Consortium. 
PA7: Mackenzie continues to outpace challengers as Crosswell leads Dem
U.S. Rep. Ryan Mackenzie (R-7th District) continues to outraise the crowded Democratic field, although the fundraising gap is starting to narrow in comparison to previous quarters.
Mackenzie, a freshman lawmaker who defeated U.S. Rep. Susan Wild (D-Lehigh) by 1 point in 2024, raised just over $455,000 from the beginning of July to the end of September.
Of the five Democrats running for their party’s nomination, Ryan Crosswell, a former federal prosecutor, is leading the fundraising race. His campaign raised roughly $380,000 over the last three months. It’s the second quarter in a row in which Crosswell has raised more than his Democratic competitors.
Democratic 7th Congressional District candidate Ryan Crosswell (Crosswell for Congress)
Bob Brooks, a firefighters union leader, brought in the second most among Democrats in the race with just under $310,000 from his campaign launch in late August to the end of September.
Northampton County Executive Lamont McClure took in just under $230,000 from the beginning of July to the end of September, which includes a $200,000 loan he gave to his campaign. Carol Obando-Derstine, who worked as an aide to former U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, raised just under $125,000 over the last three months, while Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley picked up just over $70,000 from his campaign launch in late July to the end of September.
Of the four seats that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) is targeting to flip in Pennsylvania next year, Mackenzie has drawn the most Democratic challengers.
Noting how the 7th District race was one of the closest in the nation in 2024, coupled with the moderate history of the Lehigh Valley, Borick believes that’s the reason Democrats have a lot of interest in this seat.
“They have lots of excitement that this is exactly the type of seat that they may be able to flip in a cycle like this,” Borick said.
Mackenzie entered Q4 with a cash on hand advantage over the rest of his challengers, with $1.43 million.
Crosswell entered October with just under $435,000, which is more than any other Democratic candidate in the race.
McClure started Q4 with just under $290,000, with Brooks close behind with  just under $245,000 on hand. Obando-Derstine entered Q4 with a little under $130,000 and Pinsley began October about $55,000.
Like the 10th Congressional District, this race is also a “toss-up,” according to The Cook Political Report.

Fundraising race for PA8 under way: Bresnahan brings in $600K, Cognetti $500K
U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R-8th District) raised just under $600,000 from the beginning of July to the end of September, while spending nearly $390,000.
His haul for the quarter leads the candidates running for the northeast Pennsylvania district, although a Democratic challenger has entered the field and submitted her first campaign finance report.

Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, raised $500,000 since she launched her campaign in early September to the end of the month and spent just over $55,000.
Bresnahan is serving his first term in Congress after defeating incumbent U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Lackawanna) by roughly 1.5 points in 2024.
Borick believes Democrats are excited about Cognetti’s candidacy and raising a half million dollars in one month shows that funders and contributors are starting to show support for her bid.
“She’s the mayor of the biggest city in the district, has a pretty big regional profile and name recognition that she’s starting with,” Borick said.
Although Democrats are optimistic about Cognetti’s candidacy, Borick notes that it’s a region that has trended toward the Republican Party over the past several cycles.
Bresnahan also entered October with $1.07 million on hand, while Cognetti’s campaign has just under $445,000.
Eric Stone has also filed to run as a Democrat in the 8th Congressional District, but has not filed a fundraising report.
The race for the 8th District is described by The Cook Political Report as “leans Republican.”
Fitzpatrick raises more than any other incumbent in Q3
U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-1st District) continues to add to his steady fundraising advantage in his bid for a 6th term in the purple district in the suburbs north of Philadelphia.
He raised just over $885,000 from the beginning of July to the end of September and spent more than $425,000. With the exception of Stelson, Fitzpatrick raised more than any other congressional candidate in Pennsylvania for the past three months.

Prior to this most recent filing, he raised over $1 million back-to-back quarters in the first half of 2025.
Fitzpatrick’s campaign entered October with $6.93 million on hand, which is the most of any candidate running for Congress in Pennsylvania and is $2 million more than the next closest candidate in any race.
Borick doesn’t view Fitzpatrick’s fundraising advantage as a surprise, given Democrats often target his seat.
“He’s proven very adept at surviving difficult cycles and…  in a district that is certainly very middle of the road,” Borick said. “Once again, I think, positioned himself with the resources that will be necessary to mount a really aggressive campaign to hold his seat.”
Leading the Democratic Party’s fundraising race is Bucks County Commissioner Bob Harvie. He raised just under $220,000 from the beginning of July to the end of September and spent just over $180,000.
Since announcing his bid for Congress in early April, Harvie has brought in just under $560,000. He entered October with a little more than $230,000 on hand.
Tracy Hunt, an attorney and former Republican, is also seeking the Democratic Party’s nomination for the seat. He raised just under $37,000 since he launched his candidacy in early August to the end of September, which includes a $6,000 loan he gave to his campaign. He entered October with just over $30,000 on hand.
Rob Strickler, who manages an eyewear business, has also filed to run as a Democrat in the race. According to Levittown Now, he will not be seeking donations in the race, but instead is putting his attention to building grassroots support through direct voter engagement.
National ratings outlets describe Fitzpatrick as the favorite in the race, with the Cook Political Report rating it as “likely Republican.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/perry-and-stelson-copy-2.jpg,,,2025-10-24 05:56:40.502684

If you wanted to make a movie about the pain and progress of Kentucky’s Appalachian coalfield in the last 60 years, a key role would be that of Stephen C. Cawood, the Pineville lawyer who died of cancer Oct. 17, three days after he turned 82.
My friend Steve was an activist and a lawyer for people victimized by the coal industry, but also a lawyer for coal companies he respected; briefly a politician, a cloak that didn’t quite fit him; and forever a follower of Mark Twain’s maxim: “Always do right. It will gratify some and astonish the rest.”
Cawood came of age just as big things were happening in Appalachia. National attention focused on the region’s poverty and depredation, local people began organized opposition to strip mining, and groups of young people inside and outside the region had a vision for a better future.
One of those groups helped write the major law for the War on Poverty. Cawood was in that bunch, and the Appalachian Volunteers, who fixed up homes and schools and provided arts and recreation programs for children, then became social activists and adversaries of some local officials and other powerful people, which caused them to lose federal funding and disband.
But Steve Cawood never stopped being a volunteer for Appalachia. When Robert F. Kennedy came to Eastern Kentucky in February 1968, Cawood rode with him, and was planning to join his presidential campaign after law school, but Kennedy was assassinated. “He had a marvelous charisma,” Cawood told a friend. “At every stop, waded right in amongst ’em, very personal, even tearing up with families while alone.”
Armed with a law degree, Cawood represented countless miners seeking federal black-lung benefits, the only survivor of the 1970 mine disaster in Leslie County, and miners striking for a United Mine Workers contract in Harlan County in 1973-74. He persuaded Gov. Wendell Ford to block strip mining near Swan Pond in Knox County, likely with help from his former fellow activist Larry Greathouse, who had become Ford’s general counsel. Steve’s cousin Hap Cawood told The Courier-Journal, “Steve has made a career of helping the poor and opposing strip mining.” This was in 1972; he had been out of law school for four years.
Cawood helped draft the 1977 federal strip-mine law, and was on the White House lawn when Jimmy Carter signed it. Three years later, as a freshman state representative in Frankfort, he chaired a panel that rewrote Kentucky’s law to fit the federal statute. He had come full circle; as a law student in 1966, he had helped write the state law.
But he wasn’t cut out for elective politics, or at least for re-elective politics in a purple district.
In 1979, he had won an open seat by 4.3 percentage points, after raising campaign money from coal operators with the help of his former law professor, state Natural Resources Secretary Eugene Mooney. Cawood voted his conscience and had one of the House’s most liberal voting records in 1980, was sometimes blunt to the point of offense, and drew both Democratic and GOP opposition in 1981. In one of the first Kentucky races where religious groups used eleventh-hour mailers about social issues such as abortion and school prayer, he lost by 2%.
‘Good moral compass’ drove Steve Cawood as he championed his Eastern Kentucky home

“He was, frankly, devastated,” his widow, Jeanette “Sissy” Cawood, told me. “One of the more progressive coal companies [which had a literacy program for miners] hired him to do some lobbying and that was helpful to him because he was back up there in the mix.”
About the time he joined Terry McBrayer’s law-and-lobbying firm in Lexington, Sissy read an article about one of my journalism mentors, KET host Al Smith, in which he frankly discussed his recovery from alcoholism. She saw an opportunity to get Steve sober. She called Smith, who with another member of Alcoholics Anonymous “just saved his life, literally.” And it also “gave him a new front to work on in Appalachia.”
A few years later, Steve called Al to report that the region was suffering from what we later called the opioid epidemic, that good coal jobs were getting scarce, and that schools weren’t improving as much as they should under state education reform. He wanted Al to get one of the state’s major papers to do an update on Appalachia, but they passed.
Our friend Rudy Abramson, an Alabaman just retired from the Los Angeles Times, got a foundation fellowship to write the coal piece, and reported to Smith that newspapers in the region had become less willing to hold the industry and public officials accountable. He and Smith conceived the Institute for Rural Journalism, and Al got the University of Kentucky to adopt it in 2002. I became its first director in 2004, and when I assembled a workshop on coal coverage in 2005, Steve led me to a leading expert on the business, a West Virginia consultant known mainly to insiders.
Steve had been an unusually candid sportswriter in high school (his Pineville Sun column was titled “Let’s Face It”) and he had a great affinity for journalists, especially those with The Courier-Journal. For 30 years, a long line of C-J reporters made such use of his office that we dubbed it the Pineville Bureau. He liked people who sought the truth and told it straight. But he helped anyone who wanted help so they could help others.
Jim Branscome, a journalist and Steve’s friend for more than 50 years, said of him, “Of all the mountain advocates for miners and others in Eastern Kentucky, I don’t know of anyone who has been the source of more information for journalists, congressional staffers, fellow attorneys, organized black-lung groups, and labor leaders.”
And when you add Steve’s legal work for miners, and his authorship of strip-mine laws, you have one of the greatest bodies of work of any Kentuckian to protect people in the mountains from the adverse effects of what was their major industry. And he did much more. Steve Cawood may not have been a very good politician, but he gave us a great example to follow.

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)The Colorado officials entrusted with keeping residents safe from oil and gas production don’t think a recent safety law says what it says. And that’s only one troubling part of the larger story about how companies have avoided compliance with the law.
Enacted in 2022, the law requires oil and gas companies to reveal what toxic chemicals they’re putting into the ground. What they’ve disclosed so far only emphasizes the law’s importance — we now know they’re using fracking chemicals that are banned in the state.
Coloradans have good reason to suspect that what they’ve failed to disclose is also a catalogue of health hazards. State regulators have been slow to ensure compliance, and they’ve interpreted the law in a way that lets companies conceal some of the chemicals they use. Their role is to protect the health of Coloradans, but their performance does more to protect the profits of industry.

Oil and gas operators and the chemical vendors they work with are required to disclose to the state the chemicals they use in underground extraction operations, according to the law. Fracking, the process of “fracturing” geologic formations to release trapped oil and gas, involves the injection underground of high-pressure fluid that typically contains water, sand and other substances. Those other substances can be toxic, and even prohibited, but companies previously could conceal their presence by designating them as “trade secrets.”
The new Colorado law changed that. As Capital & Main reported this week, the measure is among the first of its kind in the country to eliminate the trade secret loophole, and it has started to yield results. Disclosures show that oil and gas companies in Colorado — the fourth largest oil producer and eighth largest natural gas producer in the country — have long been using state-banned chemicals, including the cancer-causing 1,4-Dioxane.
The disclosures were slow to come. The law went into effect more than two years ago, but a watchdog report in May found that most oil and gas companies, notably Chevron and its subsidiaries, had not complied.
“It appears that at least 30 million pounds of chemicals injected into over 600 of the state’s oil and gas wells during the first 21 months covered by the law should have been disclosed, but were not,” said the authors of the report, which was released by Physicians for Social Responsibility, PSR Colorado, Colorado Sierra Club, and FracTracker Alliance.
Release of the report appears to have encouraged greater compliance, and the disclosures are starting to force transparency. For example, they show that quaternary ammonium compounds were used at 59 sites over the last 15 months. Those banned substances pose health risks for children and pregnant women.
But there remains a huge compliance gap. State regulators interpret the disclosure law to apply to fluids used in fracking a well but not in drilling a well. That interpretation defies not only the intent of the law according to supporters but also its plain language.
The law’s own declaration of intent refers to chemicals “used by operators during the drilling and (fracking)” of wells, and it says it applies to “downhole operations.”
State regulators at the Energy and Carbon Management Commission base their interpretation on the law’s definition of downhole operations: “oil and gas production operations that are conducted underground.” 
“Neither the statute nor ECMC Rules define ‘production operations,’ but production generally begins after a well is drilled and completed,” Kristin Kemp, spokesperson for the commission, said in an email.
This strains credibility. If the drilling of a hole isn’t a downhole operation then words have no meaning.
State Rep. Meg Froelich knows something about the law’s intent, since she co-sponsored it. She told Newsline this week that drilling fluids are covered, adding that the Legislature might need to adopt another bill to clarify the scope of the disclosure requirement.
The health of community members is at stake. Drilling fluid, like fracking fluid, can also include toxic chemicals, but it can more easily contaminate ground water, as well as air and soil. 
The history of noncompliance with the disclosure law fits a decades-long pattern in which oil and gas companies avoid safety measures while state regulators appear feckless or complicit. As production expands in the state and increasingly runs up against growing communities, industry hazards threaten a greater swath of the population.
Coloradans need state leaders more than ever to protect them from those hazards.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)Virginia’s Department of Corrections and the state’s corrections ombudsman have settled on a memorandum of understanding — a formality that can help streamline the process of investigating complaints and ensure cooperation when the ombudsman office probes the department.
Corrections ombudsman Andrea Sapone was hired late last year after the state legislature created her position. She has hired additional staff to her office since then and coordinated with VADOC on the MOU. Sapone is tasked with investigating complaints regarding Virginia’s correctional facilities and already has a high-profile investigation on the horizon into Red Onion State Prison.
Virginia’s new corrections ombudsman to prioritize Red Onion prison probe

From June to August, Office of the Inspector General data shows 568 complaints have been filed, with 77 stemming from Wallens Ridge State Prison and 113 stemming from Red Onion. 
Inmates, along with their friends and family and other advocates, have also reached out to The Mercury over the past year to relay concerns of mistreatment and poor living conditions at both facilities, particularly Red Onion. 
Allegations in the complaints include excessive use of force, delayed medical care and prolonged isolation. 
Though Virginia technically does not have solitary confinement, it has “restorative housing,” wherein inmates are isolated but are supposed to be permitted a few hours of time outside per day. Some inmates have said that is not happening and that frequent lockdowns also make many inmates feel isolated because they lose access to programming and must remain in their cells. 
Accusations of racism and religious discrimination have also surfaced — reaching a tipping point last year when a handful of Red Onion inmates burned themselves. Some inmates and advocates say the burns were acts of protest or desperate attempts to seek transfer to a different facility. At a December meeting with state lawmakers, VADOC director Chad Dotson attributed the incidents to mental health issues or attempts to be housed in facilities closer to their families.
Some of the frequent lockdowns around the state might be attributable to prisons having insufficient staffing, a  2024 report to lawmakers suggested. The report described staffing levels has “dangerously low” leading to “very few” education programs operating and some facilities being unable to provide the time outside of cells that inmates are legally entitled to.
The new MOU outlines assurance that OSIG can subpoena the department for records and data to investigate problems. On the flip side, department staff are able to have their legal counsel with them during any testimony during investigations and VADOC is permitted to review OSIG’s findings prior to publication, to ensure information that   “could jeopardize the safety or security of the facility, staff or inmates” isn’t disclosed.
The department’s data on inmate and staff deaths, suicides, suicide attempts in custody, physical and sexual assaults in custody, amount of inmates in “restorative housing,” amount of facility lockdowns lasting longer than 24 hours, and the number of in-person visits to inmates that have been made and denied will all be subject to sharing with OSIG. Officials will also need to include the amount of complaints or grievances submitted to VADOC along with documentation of their resolution and how long it took to resolve them. 
OSIG will be able to view body camera or facility camera footage at mutually agreed-upon dates and times, the MOU stated.
Additionally, OSIG can request data on staff vacancies per facility, inmate to staff ratios per facility, as well as staff tenure, turnover and compensation.
It also allows the ombudsman team to follow up on VADOC’s internal affairs investigations and review their findings with a set of external eyes — although an OSIG spokesperson said granting that request “would depend on the nature of the internal investigation and if it fell within the Ombudsman’s jurisdiction.”
The Mercury first learned an MOU was in the works when Sapone held a community meeting this summer where she shared how her office was bulking up its staff and preparing to more formally launch into the work it was created to do. 
In the meantime a “backlog” of complaints have piled up that the office’s staff is processing. 
As Sapone noted during the meeting, some complaints are duplicates that stem from mass emailing campaigns. Since OSIG staff are required by law to process and enter information for each complaint they receive, the spokesperson said in a recent email staff must spend more time at desks and less timeout investigating complaints. 
“We ask for the public’s continued patience, and to refrain from submitting duplicates of complaints as this exacerbates the backlog,” they said.

(Photo by Charles Paullin/Inside Climate News)SCOTTSVILLE, Va.—In rural Fluvanna County about an hour west of the state capital, a proposed natural gas power plant offers a window into a multi-state effort to speed more electricity sources onto the grid.
All but a handful of the projects in the initiative by PJM Interconnection, which runs the regional grid, would belch carbon pollution. Tenaska Energy’s proposal is among those dubbed by PJM as “shovel-ready, high-reliability” generation projects that would get a faster path through the clogged queue to connect to a grid increasingly stressed by power-hungry data centers.
But power plants need local approval, too. Tenaska’s proposal, which has some support, also faces concerns from residents about health effects, noise and transparency.
Last week the Fluvanna County Planning Commission deferred until November any decision on whether the 1.5-gigawatt plant is in “substantial accord” with the county’s comprehensive plan, a crucial step needed along with a special-use permit that will be voted on in January.



“I think we’d like to rely on science and independent judgment before we’re asked to take what is a very critical step for this community and its long-term future,” said commission member Kathleen Kilpatrick.
The company wants to build the project next to a gas plant it already operates in the county, the Tenaska Virginia Generating Station. Amber Kidd, a Fluvanna resident, told Inside Climate News that she supports the Nebraska-based developer’s proposal, given that her family has worked at the existing plant without any safety issues.
“We are a fossil-fuel family,” said Kidd. “I’m very proud of where we work and want to see this come. Rural areas that continue to refuse growth, they die off. … I support the jobs.”
In a county of about 30,000 people that President Donald Trump won by about six points, his staunch support for fossil fuels is far from universally shared by its residents. Lauren Banning, at the planning commission meeting last week, said she is concerned about toxic emissions more than a “negligible tax break, a few jobs, not even 50.”
“My kids love playing outside all day long, but if I’m scared of the air not being breathable, how is this helping our county and our community?” Banning said.
 The proposal 

The proposed $2.2 billion plant, called the Expedition Generating Station, is expected to come online in 2031 after obtaining local, state and federal permits. It would be built on 50 acres within a 425-acre parcel directly adjacent to Tenaska’s 1-gigawatt gas plant in Fluvanna that began operations in 2004.
Timberly Ross, a spokesperson for the company, told Inside Climate News that the planning commission vote deferral “pushes us back a few months, but we remain committed to bringing this much-needed development to Fluvanna County.”
Tenaska said the new plant could power up to 1.5 million homes. It’s part of PJM’s Reliability Resource Initiative, called RRI for short. PJM, which oversees a competitive market for wholesale electricity in all or part of 13 states and the District of Columbia, is inserting RRI projects into its backlogged queue of interconnection requests.

Most of the non-RRI projects waiting to connect to the grid are renewables.
PJM created the initiative to ensure ample electric generating capacity and avoid shortages resulting from data centers’ surging demands. But clean energy supporters have decried that projects that are mostly fueled by natural gas will leapfrog renewables that have long waited their turn to start cranking out electricity.
Virginia’s largest utility, Dominion Energy, is planning for several gas plants alongside a number of renewable energy projects of its own to meet demand. Tenaska is an independent power producer that would sell electricity from Expedition either directly into the regional grid or to Dominion through a power purchase agreement.
Since the Virginia Clean Economy Act’s goal to decarbonize the electric grid by 2050 applies to only Dominion and utility Appalachian Power, Tenaska is not bound by requirements to prove the need for the plant or retire it within the next 25 years.
“This location is attractive due to access to existing transmission corridors, water supply and natural gas pipelines,” the company said in a presentation before the planning commission.
Tenaska also builds renewables projects. But a Fluvanna County ordinance passed last year sets requirements on solar development that have effectively banned it.
“Tenaska submitted a variety of projects and technologies into that [PJM] process, including battery projects, which were accepted,” said Ross, Tenaska’s spokesperson. But in Fluvanna, given local hostility to renewables, Ross said the gas plant “is the appropriate technology for this location.”
 Questions about air pollution, noise 

Tenaska hasn’t yet disclosed expected pollution levels from the new plant. Nor has it shared in planning meetings what its current plant’s emissions have been.
Instead, at the planning commission meeting, Tenaska representatives noted what the company had anticipated its existing plant’s emissions of nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and two types of fine particle pollution would be, estimated years before the project was built. They said it showed rates “less than 15 percent of the applicable standard.”
All of those pollutants can cause serious health problems, particularly involving the lungs.
Josephus Allmond, a resident of Fluvanna and an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, shared information on cancer rates at a meeting in October held by Chris Fairchild, the Board of Supervisors’ chairman. Allmond cited a 2012 report by the regional health district showing that lung cancer incidents in Fluvanna County between 2004 to 2008, the period just after Tenaska built its first plant, increased more than 30 percent compared with 1999 to 2003.
“My question for the folks at Tenaska: That was for a plant slightly under 1,000 megawatts—can we expect an even bigger increase in incidents of lung cancer if this plant is approved?” said Allmond.
Residents asked the company at that meeting why it wasn’t sharing actual pollution figures from its operating plants around the country. Tenaska officials said they would share more emissions data later, through the state’s pollution permitting process.

The company on its website also states that “claims regarding the plant and local cancer cases are ridiculous and defamatory.” Federal air standards protect against health impacts, including cancer, the company contends, and it says the new plant will be categorized as a “minor source of hazardous air pollutants” under the Clean Air Act.
Another worry raised by residents at that meeting was noise. Fairchild said the existing gas plant can be heard from his nearby Cunningham Creek Winery.
“I have the same concerns,” Fairchild told the residents. “But we don’t deal with a $2 billion item every day. There are a lot of concerns that haven’t been addressed.”
The company’s spokesperson told Inside Climate News that the current plant is a net positive for the area.
“Tenaska has operated in Fluvanna County for more than 20 years, consistently meeting stringent air quality standards, operating under the county-mandated sound levels and providing roughly $35 million in tax revenue to the county,” Ross said. “Our application … not only provided those facts but also included robust supplemental materials, including an independent sound study, economic impact study, traffic plan and visual renderings.”
Laurie Partner, a local real estate agent whose husband works at the plant, said to the planning commission that the smoke coming from the stacks was “steam,” and cancer can come from other sources like smoking and microwaving plastics.
“It was almost sickening to me to hear all the misinformation that was stated there,” Partner said in an interview with Inside Climate News.
Sharon Harris, a Fluvanna resident, said she sees a lot of misinformation floating around the county about a main alternative to new gas plants: solar. As a founding member of the Fluvanna Horizons Alliance, which opposes Tenaska’s project, she wants to raise awareness of who needs the power—data centers, not local residents—and a better understanding of how solar works.
Local resentment toward clean energy has grown through hours-long county meetings discussing potential harms to farmland from solar, stormwater runoff concerns and a presentation from the Citizen Defenders of Fluvanna County on what to do with solar panels after they’ve reached the end of their life. Some residents still see it as an expensive form of energy, even though financial advisory firm Lazard’s widely cited research on electricity costs shows solar is now the cheapest option.
“There’s definitely a lack of knowledge and information in our community,” said Harris.

Bagshaw, a metal parts manufacturer based in Hudson, found out that its health insurance policies with Anthem would increase approximately 38% in 2026. Anthem specifically cited the expiration of Affordable Care Act tax credits at the center of the current federal government shutdown.
The notice from the company’s insurance broker, which the company provided to the Bulletin, said Anthem is raising rates due to the “elimination of individual subsidies, and (a) resulting decline in individual market membership” as well as “higher-than-expected medical and pharmacy utilization.”
A letter notifies the WH Bagshaw Company that its health plan premiums would increase 38%. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)
The ACA Enhanced Premium Tax Credits — which were established in 2021 as an upgrade to tax credits that were already available — subsidize health care for Americans who buy their coverage through the ACA Marketplace on HealthCare.gov. Nearly 50,000 people in New Hampshire used the credits in 2025, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. They’re set to expire in December, and when they do, premiums are expected to skyrocket.
New Futures, a New Hampshire-based health policy advocacy organization, estimates that if and when the subsidies expire, a single person in their mid-40s in New Hampshire who earns $31,300 annually could see their total annual premiums increase $1,344. The effects vary greatly based on income and demographic factors. For a New Hampshire couple in their 60s earning $90,000 annually, premiums could increase $14,712, per the same analysis.
Senate Democrats, seeking to avoid that fate, elevated the issue during budget negotiations. They refused to vote for any spending plan that didn’t extend the tax credits. Republicans, who hold slim majorities in both the House and Senate, never acceded, and without a federal spending plan in place on Oct. 1, the federal government shut down.
Some experts have warned the expiration could impact more than just those using the subsidies. As their premiums skyrocket, many healthy people who use the credits will likely forgo coverage. That in turn affects insurance companies’ bottom lines, and so rates will go up for customers like W.H. Bagshaw and other employers.
W.H. Bagshaw is owned and operated by Aaron and Adria Bagshaw. The company, which was founded by Aaron’s great-great-grandfather, employs 32 full-time employees and is attempting to hire more. The manufacturing company creates small, precise metal parts used in a variety of industries, including aerospace and medical technology. The company recently relocated from Nashua into an upgraded facility in Hudson.
Adria Bagshaw said the company spends more on their employees’ health care than on raw materials. She said that’s “partly by business design.”
“We’ve made a values-based decision here to pay 100% of the premium for our employees, so our employees have free health insurance,” she said. “It’s very generous, but it’s really, really important to us that we cover them. The easy answer is, everyone’s telling us, ‘Just push the cost on to your employees.’ And I’m like, ‘That doesn’t work.’ … If you put 20% of the cost on the employee that’s taking money out of their pocket, it’s like reducing their pay.”
She said they’re meeting with their broker next week and hope to find a creative solution.

U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, who visited W.H. Bagshaw Thursday, said he’s heard from a lot of businesses and constituents that their premiums are rising. Pappas, whose family owns the Puritan restaurant in Manchester, evoked his own health insurance experiences as an employer.
“It was customary that you would sort of see a 10, 12, 15% increase on an annual basis,” Pappas said. “And, you know, you just sort of got used to that, and would have to factor that into your planning, but we never saw anything like 40% — that’s crazy.”
He argued Republicans’ decision not to renew the tax credits have “real-world consequences.”
“By not renewing the tax credits for ACA plans, it’s having a ripple effect across markets,” he said. “And so whether you have an individual policy or are on a group plan, insurance costs are going to go up. You’re going to have people dropping their insurance. That’s going to impact all of us.”
Pappas said he supports his Senate colleagues’ decision not to vote for a spending plan to open the government without the tax credits. Asked how he squares his desire to extend the tax credits with the pain of federal employees not receiving a paycheck or families who likely won’t receive food assistance and other federal benefits, Pappas said he would support congressional fixes to those things.
“I don’t think we have to choose,” he said. “There are bills we can pass to pay the military, to pay federal workers, to make sure that furloughed workers and contractors are made whole, to make sure that important programs like fuel assistance and food stamps continue to roll forward.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bagshaw1-1024x766.jpg,,,2025-10-24 05:17:43.997458

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)In recent years, hundreds of thousands of Californians have purchased home insurance from a state-managed “last resort” insurance pool that has grown rapidly as private insurance companies have fled the market.
Now, in the wake of the devastating Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year, the Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan is seeking approval from the state for an average 36% rate hike, which would further squeeze homeowners who have no other options for coverage.
Insurance experts say it’s a national warning sign, as the effects of climate change cause private insurance companies to pull back on coverage in disaster-prone areas, leaving states and their residents to assume more of the risk. Fewer homeowners will be able to purchase private insurance in the future, and even those who do may face higher premiums as companies charge more to pay for the FAIR Plan losses.
In some states, these state-managed insurance plans have grown from a handful of policies, as originally intended, to hundreds of thousands of homeowners. The plans charge high premiums and provide limited coverage.
California fires show states’ ‘last resort’ insurance plans could be overwhelmed

“It was supposed to be a stopgap measure. People are supposed to be on a FAIR Plan policy for a short amount of time, but with climate change and these extreme weather events, that’s not going to happen,” said Alfonso Pating, global financial regulation analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental nonprofit.
At present, 35 states and the District of Columbia offer FAIR Plans or Citizens Plans to homeowners who can’t find coverage on the private market. The plans are managed by state governments, with the financial backing of the private insurers doing business in that state.
The plans maintain enough reserves to cover payouts for an average year. But when the plans take heavy losses, they impose an assessment on a pool of the insurance companies doing business in the state, based on their market share.
These state-managed plans were initially created to cover a small number of properties as a temporary, last-resort option. But now, as wildfires and hurricanes have pushed insurance companies to retreat from certain areas, FAIR Plans cover nearly 3 million properties nationwide, with an exposure exceeding $1 trillion, according to data issued last year by the Insurance Information Institute.
“If it’s going to keep on growing, it becomes impossible to manage the risk,” Douglas Heller, director of insurance with the Consumer Federation of America, a research and advocacy nonprofit, said in an interview earlier this year. “It’s OK if the high risk is just a small pool, but if the private sector is unwilling to take any of the high-risk [policies], that model doesn’t work anymore.”
States beg insurers not to drop climate-threatened homes

In California, the FAIR Plan reached its breaking point following the January wildfires that devastated Los Angeles. In the months before the fires, insurance companies had dropped coverage in many neighborhoods of the city, causing the state-backed insurer to take on policies covering billions of dollars.
The FAIR Plan was hit with $4 billion in losses when the fires wiped out many of the properties that had recently turned to the plan for coverage. After the plan’s reserves were exhausted, state regulators imposed a $1 billion assessment on insurance companies in the state. Some of those companies received permission to impose a surcharge on all their customers, residents not covered by the FAIR Plan, totaling more than $150 million so far, according to the Los Angeles Times.
This mechanism, which allows an assessment on all insurance policyholders in a state to make a state-managed plan solvent again, is known in Florida as the “hurricane tax.”
In the wake of the California wildfires, the FAIR Plan is seeking an average 36% rate hike on homeowners in the plan, which the insurance pool says is necessary to keep up with the growing risks. That proposal will be reviewed by state Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara.
FAIR Plans typically provide only bare-bones coverage, and California’s plan is facing lawsuits over its smoke damage policy. Now, the homeowners who rely on that plan could be facing much higher premiums for their coverage.
Some observers say the dire situation in California shows the unsustainable path many states are on as more and more residents lose coverage on the private market. California, Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts and North Carolina all have more than 100,000 properties insured by their state plans, according to the Insurance Information Institute’s data.
A report authored by Pating, of the Natural Resources Defense Council, described a potential “cycle of doom” in which FAIR Plans assume more and more risk, taking heavy losses as climate change-driven weather events batter their states. Under this scenario, when the plans are forced to charge assessments on private insurers to replenish their reserves, more insurance companies retreat from doing business in the state, pushing even more residents on to the FAIR Plan.











The private market isn't going to insure properties they know will be flooded 10 times in a row or burn down multiple times.


– Alfonso Pating, global financial regulation analyst with the Natural Resources Defense Council



“You’ll see continued growth of these policies,” Pating said. “The private market isn’t going to insure properties they know will be flooded 10 times in a row or burn down multiple times. Every time an event happens, it’s just going to get worse and worse.”
Pating called on states to use their FAIR Plans to incentivize hazard mitigation work — lowering premiums for property owners and communities who take steps to protect themselves from storms and wildfires. He said state regulators should also require more transparency from insurers about where they’re dropping policies and raising premiums, which would help state officials better understand the risks.
Dave Jones, a former California insurance commissioner, has called for a federal reinsurance program for state FAIR Plans — using taxpayer-funded reserves to backstop the plans.
“We’re going to have to look at shoring up FAIR Plans,” Jones said in an interview earlier this year. “The future is not a good one with regard to insurance availability and pricing because we’re not dealing with the root cause of climate change.”
Jones now serves as director of the Climate Risk Initiative at the University of California, Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy & the Environment.

More than 183,000 Franklin County residents receive SNAP benefits and most of them are children and seniors, said Joy Bivens, deputy Franklin County administrator of health and human services. The Franklin County Commissioners expect more than 4,100 residents — including 1,700 children — will be impacted by the SNAP changes. 
Immigrants and refugees made up about 56% of Franklin County’s population growth between 2020 and 2023, said Franklin County Commissioner Erica Crawley. 
“The proposed changes to SNAP benefits will put many of these families in jeopardy,” she said. “They are people who have endured trauma, made tremendous sacrifices and risked their lives to give their families security and freedom. These individuals often arrive with no local family connections and no established community. Without this support, they are often left to navigate life in an unfamiliar country with very limited resources, they face food insecurity, housing instability and limited access to health care.”
Approximately 1.39 million Ohioans receive an average of $190 of SNAP benefits each month, ODJFS Spokesperson Tom Betti said. Ohioans must have a net income at or below federal poverty guidelines —  $32,150 a year for a family of four — to qualify for SNAP.
“When families can’t rely on SNAP, they are forced to spend their limited income on food, and often at the expense of medical care, rent or utilities, perpetuating a cycle of poverty,” said Franklin County Commissioner John O’Grady. “Losing SNAP benefits isn’t just about hunger, it’s about health, stability and opportunity. Children may face developmental display delays. Families may confront chronic health issues.”
SNAP helps stabilize families when they are new to the U.S., said Jewish Family Services CEO Karen Mozenter. 
“They have done everything right, and they are eager to contribute as Americans,” she said. “Cutting off the support that helps them feed their families and care for them while they find their footing in a new country, that hurts them and that hurts all of us.”
The Mid-Ohio Food Collective is serving 58% more families now than at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, said President and CEO Matt Habash. 
“Unfortunately, we don’t expect those numbers to go down,” he said. “The cost of housing, the cost of groceries, the cost of health care, and more are all putting pressure on household budgets, and now we’re dealing with cuts to SNAP — America’s first line of defense against hunger.”

This story was originally published by Canary Media.
A new law in Ohio will fast-track energy projects in places that are hard to argue with: former coal mines and brownfields.
But how much the legislation benefits clean energy will depend on the final rules for its implementation, which the state is working out now.


House Bill 15, which took effect Aug. 14, lets the state’s Department of Development designate such properties as ​“priority investment areas” at the request of a local government.


The law aims to boost energy production to meet growing demand from data centers and increasing electrification, while applying competitive pressure to rein in power prices.


Targeting former coal mines and brownfields as priority investment areas furthers that goal while encouraging the productive use of land after mining, manufacturing, or other industrial activity ends. Buyers are often wary of acquiring these properties due to the risk of lingering pollution.


SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe new law could also help developers sidestep the bitter land-use battles that have bogged down other clean-energy projects in Ohio, particularly those looking to use farmland.


Priority areas might ​“otherwise not see these investments, which can breathe new life into communities, improve energy reliability, provide tax revenue, and lower electricity costs,” said Diane Cherry, deputy director of MAREC Action, a clean-energy industry group.


Ohio has more than 567,000 acres of mine lands and about 50,000 acres of brownfields that are potentially suitable for renewable-energy development, according to a 2024 report from The Nature Conservancy. Federal funding to clean up abandoned mine lands has continued so far under the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law, so yet more sites may become available. Overall, remediating documented hazards at Ohio’s abandoned mine lands is estimated to cost nearly $586 million, said spokesperson Karina Cheung at the state Department of Natural Resources.


But two Ohio agencies still need to finalize rules before companies can start building energy projects in these underutilized spaces and benefiting from the new law.


The Department of Development has not yet proposed standards for approving requests to designate priority investment areas, said spokesperson Mason Waldvogel. However, in late August, the Ohio Power Siting Board proposed rules to implement HB 15, and the public comment period just closed.


Under the law, approved priority investment areas will get a five-year tax exemption for equipment used to transport electricity or natural gas. The sites will also be eligible for grants of up to $10 million for cleanup and construction preparation.


HB 15 also calls for accelerated regulatory permit review of proposed energy projects in priority investment areas. The Power Siting Board will have 45 days to determine if a permit application is complete, plus another 45 days to make a decision on it.


Those timelines are shorter than the approximately five months HB 15 allows for standard projects. And it’s substantially faster than recent projects where it took the board more than a year to grant or deny applications after they were filed.


 The debate over HB 15 rules

Advocates and industry groups generally applaud the new law but want tweaks to the Power Siting Board’s proposed rules.

A big concern is making sure the board will allow wind and solar developments on mine lands and brownfields throughout Ohio, regardless of which county they’re in. Roughly one-third of Ohio’s 88 counties ban wind, solar, or both in all or a significant part of their jurisdiction. This authority was granted to them by a 2021 law, Senate Bill 52.


However, the language and legislative history of HB 15 make clear that it ​“was meant to be technology-neutral,” said Rebecca Mellino, a climate and energy policy associate for The Nature Conservancy.


HB 15 even states that its terms for permitting energy projects in priority investment areas apply ​“notwithstanding” some other parts of Ohio law.


“That clause is meant to bypass some of the typical Ohio Power Siting Board procedures — including the procedures for siting in restricted areas” under SB 52, wrote Bill Stanley, Ohio director for The Nature Conservancy, in comments filed with the board.


But the exemption provided by the ​“notwithstanding” clause is narrow, Mellino added, because local government authorities must ask for a priority investment area designation. That means, for example, that in a county with a solar and wind ban in place, officials would need to choose to request that a former coal mine or brownfield become a priority investment area.


The Nature Conservancy has asked the Power Siting Board to add language making it crystal-clear that renewable-energy projects can be built on any land marked a priority investment area — even if a solar and wind ban otherwise exists in a county.


Industry groups are pushing for additional clarifications to make sure the Power Siting Board meets the permitting deadlines set by the new law, both for expedited and standard projects.


For example, Open Road Renewables, which builds large-scale solar and battery storage, said in comments that, in order to align with HB 15, the board’s rules should require energy developers to notify the public of an application when it is filed, rather than after it is deemed complete.


Separate comments from the American Clean Power Association, MAREC Action, and the Utility Scale Solar Energy Coalition of Ohio ask for tweaks to provisions regarding notices on public hearings and for clarifications on application fees. The board should also promptly issue certificates for projects that are automatically approved, say comments by Robert Brundrett, president of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association.


The Department of Development hopes to finish draft standards and invite public comments on them soon, Waldvogel said. Meanwhile, the department has received its first request to designate a priority investment area. The ask comes from Jefferson County’s board of commissioners, which did not specify the type of energy that may be built in the area.


That request deals with land where FirstEnergy’s former Sammis coal plant is undergoing demolition, as well as the Hollow Rock Landfill, which received waste from the site. HB 15 gives the department 90 days to act on designation requests.


The Ohio Power Siting Board, for its part, is expected to finalize its rules within the next couple of months. Ultimately, said Cherry of MAREC Action, the law ​“clears the path for developers to bring energy projects online quickly and affordably, something Ohio’s consumers and businesses desperately need.”

(Photo by Morgan Trau/ WEWS)The Ohio House overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan bill reforming both the marijuana and hemp industries.
When voters chose to legalize recreational cannabis in 2023, they knew what they wanted — that’s what marijuana industry spokesperson Adrienne Robbins said.
“We want to see that stay put,” Robbins, with Ohio Cannabis Coalition, said.
That is why she is supporting the marijuana policy inside amended Senate Bill 56 — the House’s latest effort to pass changes to THC policy.
“You have both parties, all factions of this issue coming together to get this bill done,” House Finance Chair Brian Stewart (R-Ashville) said. “And I think it’s a big success.”
Since the start of the year, Stewart and other marijuana supporters have been trying to compromise with the Senate on separate cannabis bills. The Senate wanted to make dozens of restrictions, but the House said that wasn’t what the Ohioans chose.
Stewart, working with House reps. Jamie Callender (R-Concord) and Tex Fischer (R-Boardman) tried to negotiate with the Senate. Callender is known as the marijuana expert, while Fischer calls himself a “hemp-resentative.”
Finally, a deal was crafted between the two chambers this summer, but the Senate pulled out at the last minute.
“Do you think that this is closer to the will of the voters?” I asked Stewart.
“Oh, absolutely,” he responded.
The House’s bill keeps home growing the same, restricts marketing that would appeal to kids and finally gives cities with dispensaries part of the tax revenue from sales.
“That is something these communities have been waiting for,” Robbins said. “It is something they were promised.”
The City of Cleveland said it appreciated this step by the House.
“We remain hopeful that this will advance through the Legislature and that we receive these funds soon, which will go towards pressing needs in our community — including public safety,” city spokesperson Tyler Sinclair said.
But hemp seller Doug Strahm said this legislation isn’t fair.
“They’re looking at trying to financially knock people out of the business, and that’s not what this country’s all about,” Strahm said.
The legislation generally bans intoxicating hemp products, low-level THC that’s been commonly available at gas stations and smoke shops. It’s also frequently packaged to look like candy and doesn’t have age restrictions. But under the bill, there are some exceptions for low-level products, and stores can still sell THC-infused drinks to people 21 and older.
The bill also sets up a legal framework to regulate hemp products similar to marijuana. But Strahm complained it comes at a high cost — $5,000 more than a license for cannabis dispenseries.
“To try to come into the hemp business at $75,000 for a new license, even though it’s over a two year period, that makes it really difficult,” he said.
Stewart argued that this is about safety — making sure children don’t get THC and that adults know what’s in the products they are buying.
“It kind of balances — keep it away from kids, but also doesn’t put people out of business arbitrarily,” Stewart said.
Now the bill goes back to the Senate for negotiations — and Senate President Rob McColley (R-Napoleon) wasn’t thrilled with the bill.
“There are going to be some things that are probably some members of our caucus will have issues with,” McColley said.
I asked him what the concerns are so far.
“It’s a brand new regulatory scheme for hemp, relative to what we had been talking about… Some of the other items regarding how they’re treating products and everything, we have some concerns about that,” McColley said.
After the story aired, Robbins added that while she supports the marijuana provisions in the bill, she doesn’t support the hemp portion. When asked why, she said she still needs to look through the bill further to see what changes she wants to see regarding the hemp regulation, but has some concerns already — similar to McColley.
The marijuana industry and the hemp industry are rivals, and several dispensaries have previously told us that they don’t think hemp should be sold without having a full marijuana license.
Hemp industry coalition leader Dakota Sawyer said he is trying to talk to convince the Senate not to concur.
When asked about how to tackle the conference committee, the House said they knew their priorities and would represent the people of Ohio — while also making sure that all THC products are safe and regulated.

(Eric Thomas illustration / Kansas Reflector)As a middle-aged instructor at the front of a college lecture hall, I feel like a pivot point — a human crossroads around which academic writing has shifted, yet again. 
That’s a big thesis. 
Let me explain. 
In college courses, we educators have a few standard assignment types. There’s the multiple-choice exam, whether on mimeographed paper, Scantron answer sheets or an online exam. 
There’s the group project, the titanic, looming assignment that everyone loves to hate.
And then there is the writing assignment. Maybe it’s a literary interpretation of a Shakespeare sonnet. Or a research paper about the formation of sedimentary rocks. Or an essay comparing communism with socialism. 
Happily, I confess my love for slogging away at academic writing. (Maybe that’s why I sit before you at 11:38 p.m. writing this column as my side gig.) 
During my senior year of high school, the writing bug bit me hard. My teacher invited us to choose a topic — any topic — and spend weeks writing a research paper. Requirement: it had to be longer than 10 pages. (God bless you, Mr. Parr, and your grading stamina.) 
I found myself, two months later, on the floor of my Midwestern basement at 2 a.m. with index cards spread around me, each scrap of paper a detail about the Watts Riots of 1965. 
Facts pulled from microfilm at the local library. Anecdotes from Life Magazine. Quotes from historians. I shuffled and sorted and stacked the cards endlessly until they added up to an 18-page research paper. 
By the end, I was dazzled by what I had learned (if not my grade from the imposing Mr. Parr). That kind of research and writing defined the next four years of college for me as well: Dive in and figure out something novel to say about, well, whatever was assigned.
The pursuit that I found in many of those assignments fuels my nostalgia today. I fear we are watching the experience of academic writing being shrugged off by artificial intelligence. 
Before we get to that, let’s rewind.
There are three generations of academic writers alive today, in my thinking. I’m not talking about Boomers and Gen Xers and Millennials. These cohorts are based on what writing was like for them in high school and college.  
 
The Linear Marvels
Each generation wonders how the previous one did it. That’s how I feel about the Linear Marvels. 
For college students even a few years older than me, the tools were elegantly simple: their notes, a typewriter and paper.
How did they marshal their facts so orderly and calmly? How did they start their writing at the beginning, continue toward the middle and finish with an ending? No cursor-ing up and down through shambling sentences. No repairing broken logic. No parachuting a paragraph into a new location. 
It’s beyond me how the Linear Marvels did it. I could more easily pick a lock with a water balloon.   
 
The Cutters-and-Pasters 
By the time I did any kind of ambitious writing, word processors queued up in columns in high school and college classrooms. These machines allowed us to move backward and forward in what we hoped to write, fixing our errors and inserting examples that we omitted. 
Soon, software and desktop computers allowed us to see an entire essay or research paper on the screen. We scrolled through paragraphs and added footnotes with ease. We meddled with the point size and margins to push the essay to three pages. 
Eventually we used the internet — cutting and pasting the perfect quote from an academic journal or literary criticism. While it’s tempting to consider the advent of the internet as a whole new phase in academic writing, we were still doing essentially the same intellectual activity of cobbling together an argument as we had with other sources. 
However, it was still fundamentally different from the Linear Marvels — and certainly a different way from my students this semester. 
 
The Un-Assessables 
So we arrive at the smash-up of artificial intelligence and academic writing.
If you are a skeptic of artificial intelligence, park your doubt for a moment. Consider the magnitude of change: Within a few years, academic writing in undergraduate classrooms has been scrambled by AI. 
My classroom assignments from three years ago are imminently hackable because I gave students time away from class (and away from my supervision) to write. If a college instructor hopes for the student to be the source of the words and ideas on the page in 2025, you can seldom — if ever — let them do the writing outside of class. 
It’s simply too easy to ask ChatGPT: “Please generate a 1,000-word essay about Blah-Blah-Blah. Be sure that it has some language errors and diction choices that would be appropriate for an undergraduate student at a mid-sized state university.” 
It’s almost folksy to remember a few years ago when students would pay another student — or a web-based service — to provide a completed essay for them. I don’t even need to type a username or password into ChatGPT. It’s happy to give me A-level undergrad work for free. 
Providing one of my course’s essay questions to artificial intelligence a few years ago yielded an essay with the sophistication of mashed carrots. Back then, when I tested the prompts on different AI models, factual errors infested the sentences. 
“Use AI,” I said to my class, “if you enjoy reading essays that would earn a C- on the exam.” 
Students giddily pointed out the AI hallucinations. On the eve of taking the exam, they knew more than AI. 
Today, not so much. The AI answers are direct, correct and subtly different each time you ask. There are some funky formatting quirks. For instance, every answer has more headings than a BuzzFeed listicle. Otherwise, the AI content (at least in my subject area) has rapidly improved.
Many of today’s instructors threaten to suss out the AI papers submitted by their students. The reality? These instructors are likely to catch honest writers in their dragnet and alienate them with flimsy accusations of academic dishonesty. Enraged students tell me about honest writing that got flagged by dubious instructors. 
If not the out-of-class writing, then what? 
Here’s another reliable method, but one soon to be obsolete, that we have used in academia. Perhaps you remember it. The instructor provides students with five different essay prompts but only one of them will appear on the exam. 
The educational allure is obvious. Students must research and outline — if not write — five different essays to be prepared for the mystical chosen one on exam day. (“I hope it’s No. 5!”) 
AI has broken this option as well. The researching, outline and writing has been replaced by a much more nefarious cut-and-paste. Cut the question. Paste it into AI. 
Just memorize the content of five essays. Heave the book out the window. Who needs extraneous details when I can mainline the slender lineup of facts that slays the question? 
Where does that leave us? The research paper: gutted. The critical essay: old-fashioned. The randomly chosen in-class essay: obsolete. 
No wonder universities are sponsoring AI everything — but especially AI teaching summits to help us figure out what is next for writing within higher education. Assessing students in the age of AI is an increasingly elaborate cat-and-mouse game with instructors scurrying to keep up.  
However, it’s vital that we do, because when powered by AI, undergraduate writing will never be the same.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom) At Miami University, my colleagues and I are alarmed that the federal government has invited all universities to sign its so-called “Compact for Academic Excellence in Higher Education.” 
This invitation came quickly upon the heels of MIT’s rejection of the compact and the threat that the other eight universities originally selected for the compact would also refuse to sign. This compact is no less than a federal loyalty oath: President Donald Trump has said that failing to sign would jeopardize federal funding. Compliance would be subject to ongoing review by the U.S. Department of Justice, and insufficient compliance would result in a loss of access to student loans, grant programs, federal contracts, funding for research, approval of visas and tax exemption. 
When an invitation is accompanied by consequences for not accepting it, it is in fact a threat. University decisions are made according to shared governance procedures that are essential to our independence, academic freedom and to democracy as a whole.
Ohio’s public colleges and universities are already reeling from the erosion of academic independence that has accompanied the implementation of Ohio’s Senate Bill 1. In the few short months since that law has been in effect, we’ve already seen public colleges and universities eliminate degree programs, close student centers that serve marginalized student populations, restrict the use of land acknowledgements, and roll back the rights of academic workers.
Miami University must not allow itself to be threatened into ceding what is left of our self-determination. Whatever the consequences of refusal, agreeing would threaten the very mission of the university. That’s why our union, the Faculty Alliance of Miami (FAM, AAUP-AFT, Local 375), is urging our university’s administration to refuse to sign this compact, and faculty in other public universities in Ohio are calling on their universities to do the same.
This attempt at coercion is just one of the many examples of intensifying political interference in higher education. Going far beyond Senate Bill 1’s limitations on diversity efforts, the compact makes other demands about admission that undermine the Civil Rights Act of 1964, like requiring the use of standardized tests and limiting the admission of international students. These decisions should be left to our university in consultation with faculty. 
It requires our university to make certain ideological commitments regarding sex and gender that are incompatible with both science and Miami’s values, and orders that bathrooms, locker rooms and sports be segregated accordingly. It claims to ensure a vibrant marketplace of ideas on campus, but requires our university to screen out foreign students with “noxious values” or “hostility to the United States, its allies, or its values.” It requires “serious” disciplinary action and the use of force “if necessary” to prevent disruption by demonstrators, and requires open-ended information sharing with the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of State. 
Given recent government actions to suppress the expression of ideas with which it disagrees, such as the unconstitutional policy of arresting, detaining, and deporting noncitizen students and faculty members for their pro-Palestinian advocacy, this can only be interpreted as a thinly-veiled attempt to restrict academic freedom to those who express government-approved views, defeating the very purpose of academic freedom and of higher education as a whole.

While the loss of federal funding would threaten Miami’s ability to perform its vital education and research work, agreeing to this compact would not forestall that outcome. A concession to threats will simply embolden the Trump administration to come back for more. 
Funding cuts are not insurmountable. For example, the university could temporarily raise the rate of spending on its generous endowment, while collaborating with other institutions to sue for the restoration of unconstitutionally withheld funds. Sacrificing our values, on the other hand, would irreparably damage our university. Miami’s motto, love and honor, obligates us to defend liberal education as a public good and care about all of our students, staff, and faculty. Now is the time to put that principle into practice.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Anti-hunger organizations say they are flying blind as they scramble to address growing food assistance needs after the U.S. Department of Agriculture canceled a longstanding food insecurity survey last month.
Groups across the country and in Maine have long used the Household Food Security Report, started under former President Bill Clinton, to measure rates of food insecurity and say it’s an essential tool to understand the scope of hunger in order to address it, according to four experts who spoke to Maine Morning Star. 
But the USDA announcement canceling the survey said the program has “failed to present anything more than subjective, liberal fodder.” 
“This data was really important to have an understanding of what the situation is with food insecurity in every community and, without it, it’s really hard to know for anti-hunger organizations whether the work that we’re doing is having any meaningful impact,” said Anna Korsen, deputy director at Full Plates, Full Potential.
“It also means that we can’t see the trends in food insecurity,” she added, noting that by having the survey terminated right after Republicans in Congress passed significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, it “means that they’re basically hiding the evidence.” 
The impact of the myriad cuts to SNAP — whether they are temporary like the pause to benefits driven by the government shutdown, or broader limits on the program, including recently imposed work requirements — will almost certainly make more households food insecure, several experts said. 
The final year captured by the survey is 2024, which means organizations will have to rely on local or state-level data to help direct their efforts going forward.
Increasing reliance on food pantries
Already, food banks are seeing increased demand ahead of their typically busy winter months, according to Hannah Chatalbash, executive director of the Mid Coast Hunger Prevention Program.
The Brunswick-based nonprofit that helps people access food throughout Maine observed a 40% increase in demand in the first quarter of the fiscal year, which starts in July, compared to the same time period last year. They attribute that to inflation and the rising cost of rent, health care and heating bills for communities, which then turn to food pantries for assistance, Chatalbash said.

“I think families are really getting hit from all sides right now, and when the household budget feels strain, one of the first places people turn to is the local food pantry,” she said.
“We expect that trend to continue to potentially get significantly worse with the news that came out this week about SNAP benefits potentially not being available in November.”
Robin McCarthy, chief advancement officer at Good Shepherd Food Bank, which supplies food to pantries across the state, said there has been roughly a 10% increase this year in the demand at food pantries. That coincides with the slight increase in statewide food insecurity in 2023, the latest year that the USDA data is available for.










All of these cuts and changes together are going to create this tidal wave of food insecurity that is coming towards us. We see it coming, and yet we've just cut the most effective food nutrition assistance program that we have and then hid the evidence of how that will impact households.


– Anna Korsen, Full Plates, Full Potential


It is too soon to tell what the impact of the SNAP cuts will be so far, since many changes to the federal program have not gone into effect yet.  But while food insecurity is on the rise, pantries across the state are seeing a decrease in their food supply because of cuts earlier this year to the Emergency Food Assistance Program, which provided banks and pantries with food at no cost, according to Korsen and Chatalbash.
“All of these cuts and changes together are going to create this tidal wave of food insecurity that is coming towards us,” Korsen said. “We see it coming, and yet we’ve just cut the most effective food nutrition assistance program that we have and then hid the evidence of how that will impact households.”
No comprehensive substitute 
The USDA survey was used widely by state and national nonprofit organizations to inform policy that meets the needs of communities that rely on food banks, and more broadly to tackle the issue of food insecurity. 
“There is really no independent reporting that is as comprehensive or of a similar scale to the USDA Household Food Security Report,” Chatalbash said. “It is by far the largest and most comprehensive data set that we have for tracking food insecurity in this country, and so eliminating this report does create a gap in the information that’s available that helps us analyze the problem.”
The Maine Center for Economic Policy (MECEP) has used the USDA survey data in several ways as an overall indicator of economic hardship, according to Economic Policy Analyst James Myall.
For example, in the 2025 legislative fact sheet, USDA survey data helped MECEP map out the percentage of food insecure households in each Maine House of Representatives district. 
The data also informs advocates about the demographics of those most likely to face food insecurity. In Maine, food insecurity is more prevalent in rural parts of the state, especially parts of Aroostook, Piscataquis and Washington counties, where approximately 20% of households lack access to nutritious food, according to the MECEP analysis. 
National trends have shown that single-parent households and people of color are more likely to be food insecure.  
Veterans, rural residents, older adults may lose food stamps due to Trump work requirements

“How do we want to help folks not go hungry? You need to know who some of those people are,” Myall said. “So you can sort of identify some of those subgroups and think about what are the barriers that they’re facing in particular, and what are the things we can do to help target them.”
State-level data alternatives
There are some options at the state level to track food insecurity and determine which families need assistance, including the Maine Integrated Youth Health Survey, 
However, that survey, which is administered in schools every two years to measure students’ overall well-being, only includes a snapshot of nutrition.
Myall said the state should consider adding a question “that that would get at food security more broadly.”
“Because that is one of the biggest statewide surveys we have. But the limitation is that it doesn’t get to parents.”
While families with children tend to be less food secure, often it is not children that go hungry, because parents will skip meals if food is limited, Myall said. But that survey, along with free and reduced lunch data collected by schools, are the only ways to ask broad populations in the state about food security currently. 
Feeding America, a national nonprofit organization focused on publishing comprehensive nutrition data, is working on finding alternatives, according to a statement by CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot.
“As USDA’s report sunsets, there is a risk of losing consistent national benchmarks that have helped guide solutions,” the statement said. “Feeding America is committed to working alongside partners to ensure we continue building on that foundation.”
Feeding America’s Map the Meal Gap study provides data that Good Shepherd already relies on and the group, which partners with 600 food assistance organizations across Maine, may start reporting data it collects from those pantries to the national nonprofit to help make up for the lost dataset.
“What that would mean is hopefully being able to use some of the data that we’re already collecting from some of the pantries that we work with,” McCarthy said. “But it’s not comprehensive, and it’s not the same as the USDA data.”

It came two years after voters approved a referendum changing the superintendent position to an elected one. For the previous 50 years, members of the local school board chose who would lead the district. In making that transition, Lee has joined the majority of school districts in Florida (38) that elect their superintendents.
But while that may be the norm in Florida, it’s a complete outlier in the rest of the United States. Among the more than 13,000 school districts in the country, Alabama is the only other state with elected school superintendents.
The state’s largest school districts (such as Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach) have their school superintendents chosen by their school board members. Now a Republican state lawmaker would like to make Hillsborough — the third largest school district in the state and seventh largest in the nation — the latest district with an elected superintendent.

Rep. Michael Owen, a Republican represents southwest Hillsborough and northwest Manatee counties, presented a local bill during a Hillsborough County legislative delegation meeting Tuesday to asscomplish the shift, subject to voter approval.
“I believe Hillsborough County should mirror the majority of the counties in the state of Florida and allow the parents to pick the CEO of their kid’s education,” he said.
When prompted about why he saw the need for such a change, he said he “had a problem” with the fact that the sitting superintendent is less accountable to the voters than he is to members of the school board.
“I believe that having more a independent superintendent will allow them not to necessarily do the wishes of the majority of the board, but the wishes of the parents of Hillsborough County,” he said — stressing that he meant nothing personal against the sitting superintendent, Van Ayres.
If the measure was ultimately approved by the Legislature and then approved in a referendum by the voters, Hillsborough would become the largest school district in the nation that elects its superintendent.
The proposal was attacked by Democrats and some public education advocates in the audience, who said they want less politics in the classroom. Florida voters rejected a constitutional amendment on the 2024 ballot that would have made school board races officially partisan (the measure did win 55% of the vote, short of the 60% required for passage).
House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell of Tampa noted that Gov. Ron DeSantis appoints the state education commissioner — as has every governor for the past two decades. The last time that the state Education Commissioner was elected, it was Charlie Crist in 2000. The state revised its Constitution in 2003 to make the position appointive.
Rep. Michele Rayner, D-St. Petersburg, attacked the idea, calling it “the ultimate DEI move.”
“Because what we would find, more likely than not, is someone who may not be qualified and may not understand what is important to the people, and most importantly, the children of Hillsborough County when it comes to education,” she said, adding that she was concerned about injecting partisan politics into education.
“What this feels like is a power grab,” she said. “What this feels like is — and I’m going to say the quiet part out loud, because our county is shifting a different way — let’s make sure that we can encapsulate power, and that does not serve students,” she said as the audience cheered.
That change in the power structure of the county was also referenced by Julie Gebhards, a Hillsborough parent and member of Moms for Liberty. She noted that the Hillsborough School Board now consists of five Democrats and two Republicans. As an appointed superintendent, she said, Ayres has to answer to them to maintain job security, while the county itself is more balanced in terms of partisanship (Republicans lead Democrats in voter registration in the county by slightly more than 2%).
“I think it comes down to: Is our superintendent going to be accountable to our students or the board?” she said.
Sen. Danny Burgess, R-Zephyrhills, said that while there is common ground that politics does not belong in schools, it is absurd to believe that this specific proposal would lead to an infusion of politics within the classroom.
“The reality is folks, that ship sailed a long time ago,” he said. “I can’t miss the opportunity to just sort of emphasize and draw the point that those arguments can be very easily turned and twisted in the exact opposite direction. So, what’s before you today is not that make-or-break.”
The delegation will meet again before the regular legislative session takes place in January to vote on the proposal. If approved, Rep. Owen will file the measure as a local bill in the House, where it will be assigned to committees and move through the process before going to the full House for consideration. House members are limited to filling seven bills each session but local bills do not count towards this limit.

Call it what you will. It is for everyone. It protects everyone.","Though we needed no reminders, the latest outrages out of Washington have proven that would-be dictators and their empowered henchmen will seek to shut down free speech and hide their misdeeds whenever they can.
But fortunately in Connecticut, government by and for the people has remained much healthier because there are heroes ensuring that our state and municipal meetings, records and officials remain open and accessible and the freedom to speak — to critique and criticize — remains robust.
I am on the board of the Connecticut Foundation for Open Government, which for more than three decades has sought to educate the public about the vital need for freedom of information and, as part of that effort, to honor its champions. We are journalists, lawyers, professors, state and local officials and others dedicated to the notion, as Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis famously asserted, “If the broad light of day could be let in upon men’s actions, it would purify them as the sun disinfects.”
We know — and we want the public to know — that open government benefits liberals and conservatives, Democrats and Republicans and everyone in between. All parties and people should be able to see what their public officials are doing and both take part in their decisions or comment on them. 
If they could, they’d understand government better and stop believing the wild conspiracy theories, myths and misinformation that bad actors peddle. Open, transparent, accessible government is bipartisan, or nonpartisan. Call it what you will. It is for everyone. It protects everyone.
President Trump, sadly, dangerously, doesn’t agree.
In just the last month, he’s had his FCC chairman threaten TV networks unless they stifle Jimmy Kimmel and other critics. He’s had his Attorney General threaten to prosecute people for “hate” speech — ie. commentary that criticizes Trump — and has had his Defense Secretary attempt to deny press credentials to journalists who fail to pledge that they will eschew independent fact-gathering and report only the information offered via press release by the Pentagon. His vice president has told everyone to report critiques of Charlie Kirk and other matters to their employers in hopes those uttering them will be fired.
Meanwhile, Congressional Republicans and the Justice Department refuse to release the Epstein files, the FBI refuses to release the tape of immigration czar Tom Homan allegedly accepting cash in a paper bag from those wanting border security contracts and the administration refuses to produce documents, tapes or other evidence that the Venezuelan boats it’s blown out of the water were actually smuggling drugs.
Information is not free in this administration. Government is not transparent.
But here in Connecticut, the Freedom of Information Act is celebrating its 50th anniversary. There are those, to be sure, that want to limit access to public records and keep government meetings closed to the public. But the overwhelming majority of state and local officials — led by the Freedom of Information Commission, leadership in the General Assembly and hundreds of sterling mayors, first selectmen, town clerks and town councilors — are keeping records available and meetings open.
Last week, more than 100 guardians of those rights gathered at the Mark Twain House & Museum to honor some of those heroes. 
Among them:
The Republican and Democratic leaders of the state House of Representatives, Vincent Candelora and Jason Rojas, who have distinguished themselves in recent years, but particularly this year, by defending government transparency in the face of determined efforts to shield government actions from the public. 
As leaders admired by their respective caucuses, they are both uncommonly influential when they take a stand on issues, and have proven their philosophical opposition to government secrecy when they review proposed legislation. This year, in contrast to Washington, where compromise and bipartisan agreement is almost nonexistent, they were instrumental in promoting sincere caucus-to-caucus discussion that ultimately defeated bills that would have kept hidden higher education records pertaining to teaching or research; restricted access to voter records; permitted public review of complaints against police and corrections officers only after they had been “investigated and adjudicated by the proper legal authority;” and allowed school superintendents to attend closed executive sessions of boards of education, without limitation, creating a slippery slope that in future years might have unleashed unlimited closed sessions by councils, boards of selectmen and other public bodies.
The Housing Collective, which works to create affordable homes across Connecticut. Each week, it publishes a comprehensive listing of land-use commission meetings’ times, locations and agendas — where housing creation decisions are made so residents can attend and voice concerns, along with a list of vacancies on land-use boards so residents can seek appointment or election, and complemented by explanations of what land-use boards are empowered to decide and information on how to understand their actions and offer input. 
If every policy organization in Connecticut — environmental, public health, education — did the same, government would be more visible and less mysterious, and Connecticut residents would be less inclined to believe the misinformation and conspiracy theories fed to them by those trying to mislead them.
Journalist Katherine Revello, of CT Inside Investigator, who wrote more than 150 pieces in the last year explaining the Freedom of Information Act and open meetings law.
Colleen M. Murphy, the current executive director and general counsel of the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission, received a special award for her steadfast advocacy of open government in her 35 years as an FOI attorney and her 20 years as the commission’s leader. She is widely respected as a fair, objective, brilliant attorney, and is a sought-after speaker nationally on government transparency, privacy and FOI issues.
The honor they all received — The Mitchell W. Pearlman Freedom of Information Award — is named after the first executive director of the state FOI Commission and the father of the state’s FOI Act. He attended the ceremony, standing to the side, smiling.
We will all have a reason to keep smiling if government records, officials and meetings remain open and accessible. But “government of the people, by the people, for the people” will, as Lincoln understood, perish from the earth if the abuses out of Washington continue and spread. Democracy will only remain alive if we ensure that “We the People” — all the people — can see, petition and shape their government.
The heroes honored last week were richly deserving. But they can’t do it alone. We have to be heroes, too.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-24 04:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Setting the record straight on UConn paid leave provisions,Stephanie Reitz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/24/setting-the-record-straight-on-uconn-paid-leave-provisions/,Being able to recruit and retain the best faculty means ensuring the negotiated pay and benefits the university offers are highly competitive.,"UConn is home to about 1,700 tenured, tenure-track, and non-tenure track faculty on its Storrs and regional campuses. They are responsible for delivering a world-class education to our 34,000-plus students, along with conducting research and producing meaningful scholarship in their fields.
 Based on statements in Monday’s op-ed (“This is UConn: Zero Paid Leave for Professors”), the University wants to ensure that our faculty, elected officials, and other Connecticut residents have accurate, precise information on medical and family leave afforded to faculty, along with their free speech and academic freedom protections.
Specifically, the provisions applicable to faculty are as follows:

UConn abides by all federal and state laws for its employees, including those providing job-protected family and medical leave, disability accommodations, and paid sick leave.
Every tenured and tenure-track UConn faculty member is entitled to six months of paid leave for their own qualifying medical condition, with potential for up to 24 months. The same provision applies for CIRE (clinical, in-residence, and extension) faculty with at least three years of UConn employment.
An employee’s own qualifying medical condition includes the six to eight weeks of recovery following childbirth, and may also apply to other pregnancy-related conditions such as postpartum depression.
For CIRE faculty not yet eligible for the six-month paid leave, six to eight weeks of paid sick leave is typically granted for the employee’s own medical condition, including post-childbirth recovery. UConn is aware of no cases in which a faculty member or any other employee was expected to return to work only a short duration after giving birth.
Faculty who experience a major life event – including birth or adoption of a child – can have their duties modified in the semester or year following the event. A faculty member who is a birth/adoptive parent or primary caregiver is eligible for release from on-site duties such as classroom teaching, and would be assigned alternative duties that can be performed more flexibly. A faculty member who is a secondary caregiver may similarly work with their department head to modify their duties.
To ensure that such instances don’t derail their career path, tenure-track faculty are granted an additional year on their tenure clock if they have taken qualified family and/or medical leave, or experience a qualifying major life event as defined in federal and/or state family and/or medical leave laws.
These provisions are available whether faculty work on a full-year appointment or the nine-month term, which runs concurrent with the academic year without summer duties.

UConn administrators are covered by other provisions which may, but do not necessarily, provide for full pay during family leave:

Management and confidential (non-union) employees at UConn receive or accrue paid time off, such as sick, vacation, and personal leave. These leave balances may be used to continue an employee’s pay during a qualifying family or medical leave.
There are no provisions for modification of work duties for management or confidential employees.
They are subject to a 0.5% payroll tax to help fund the Connecticut Paid Leave program, and therefore may avail themselves of that program under qualifying circumstances. It provides up to 12 weeks of paid leave benefits, but does not fully replace wages.
The UConn faculty union, like other state employee unions, could negotiate to have its members participate in the program and be subject to the payroll tax in return for the benefit, but the union has not proposed to do so.

Separately, UConn has been informed through media outlet inquiries, including the Connecticut Mirror, of questions about protection of academic freedom. UConn is deeply committed to academic freedom, seeing it as fundamental to our mission as a public research university.
As such, its importance is enshrined in the current AAUP contract and in the University Bylaws, which provide significant detail on the full freedom to teach, research, publish, and engage in open inquiry and expression, consistent with the 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure.
Prospective students apply to UConn for many reasons, including our vibrant campuses, an outstanding student experience, and the exceptional value we offer Connecticut residents compared to other institutions. But the single most important reason our students want to attend and graduate from UConn is the outstanding education we offer. This is in part why a record-breaking 62,000 people applied to UConn this year.
The key to this is our exceptional faculty, supported by our hard-working staff. Being able to recruit and retain the very best means ensuring that the negotiated pay and benefits we offer are highly competitive and that, at UConn, faculty are guaranteed the academic freedom that is an essential component of their teaching and research.
We are proud that we are able to continue to offer both, supporting our workforce and helping UConn to successfully carry out its mission on behalf of Connecticut.

Republicans want to account for a pending U.S. Supreme Court ruling on a case that could dramatically reshape Louisiana’s six congressional districts ahead of next year’s midterm elections – a ruling that several other states are watching as they ponder redrawing their maps.
The front-running proposals from the Republican-run legislature – House Bill 1 and identical Senate Bill 1 – push next year’s primary schedule back by roughly one month. Instead of an April 18 party primary for Louisiana’s congressional races and some municipal elections, the new date would be May 16. Primary runoffs would be moved from May 30 to June 27.

Procedural efforts from Democrats in both chambers failed to keep the bills from being moved to their committees.

It remains to be seen whether this one-month adjustment would be enough time to account for whatever ruling the Supreme Court issues on Callais v. Louisiana. A group of white voters have challenged the constitutionality of the 6th Congressional District, which state lawmakers crafted in 2024 to account for the state’s Black population reaching nearly one-third according to the 2020 census. U.S. Rep. Cleo Fields, D-New Orleans, won an election later in the year to fill that seat, giving Louisiana two Black members in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Republicans might be banking on a ruling from justices before Dec. 8, the end of the monthlong congressional qualifying period in Texas, said Rep. Edmond Jordan, D-Baton Rouge, chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus. The Texas Legislature switched five of its U.S. House seats to favor Republicans earlier this year in a map that’s also being challenged in federal court.
Jordan said a ruling on the Callais case in the coming weeks would play into Republicans’ strategy in both states and others that want to update their maps to add more GOP districts.
“What they’re doing is trying to give themselves the greatest amount of time in an effort to really take away the voting strength of minority voters,” he said.
Debate began in earnest on Senate Bill 1 in a Thursday afternoon committee hearing that grew heated when Sens. Gary Carter of New Orleans and Sam Jenkins of Lake Charles, both Black Democrats, grilled Kleinpeter on his date-changing proposal.
“This is like you’re a kid and finding out there’s no Santa Claus,” Carter said, arguing the date changes would illegally “interfere” with next year’s congressional elections.
Carter’s uncle, U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, D-New Orleans, also testified at the hearing and urged senators to “pump the breaks.”
“Let’s answer the tough questions. Let’s hear everyone out and then proceed with caution,” Troy Carter said in an interview. “But to act prematurely before the Supreme Court has even digested fully the arguments [in Callais] is probably not a good way to do it.”
The Senate and Governmental Affairs Committee advanced the Senate Bill 1 to the floor in an 5-3 party-line vote. The panel also approved Senate Bill 2, which moves the election date for five constitutional amendments from the April 18 ballot to May 16.
Through the first day of the session, lawmakers have not yet discussed at length the scenario of a Supreme Court decision in the Callais case coming later in the spring. Robert Collins, a public policy professor at Dillard University, said Gov. Jeff Landry’s decision to convene lawmakers to move election dates comes with some political risk. It depends on justices ruling in time for the legislature to redraw congressional maps before the start of the 2026 election calendar.
“He’s gambling that he’s going to get the ruling when he needs it, and you can only push back the date so far,” Collins said.
The stage for the current special session was set in early January 2024 when Landry urged lawmakers to add the second Black district rather than allow a federal court to redraw a map from 2022 that had just one majority-Black congressional district. The governor convened legislators just days after he took office for what was the third redistricting special session in 14 months. Republicans had previously rejected any map that added a second majority-Black congressional district.
Republican Attorney General Murrill, who defended Louisiana second Black district, has since sided with the plaintiffs to argue the process used to craft its boundaries – which zig-zags horizontally between Baton Rouge and Shreveport – is an illegal racial gerrymander. Specifically, she maintains Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act clashes with the 14th and 15th Amendments of the U.S. Constitution.
Section 2 prohibits voting laws or procedures that discriminate based on race, color or membership in a language minority group. ​The two amendments cover, in part, representation in Congress and racial discrimination in voting.
Murrill’s solicitor general, Benjamin Aguiñaga, argued Oct. 15 before the Supreme Court that race was illegally used to create Louisiana’s 6th Congressional District. Questions from conservative justices seemed to align with his points.
As recently as this August, Landry had been pushing lawmakers to meet for yet another special redistricting session, well before the Supreme Court heard arguments in the Louisiana case. But legislative leaders pushed back, arguing that it would be pointless to draw new maps without knowing whether justices would require Louisiana to include two, one or no majority-Black congressional districts.

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune)The first of two days of evidentiary hearings in Utah’s court-ordered redistricting process was consumed by hours of testimony from the plaintiffs’ map drawing experts on why the congressional boundaries submitted to a judge by the Utah Legislature were problematic — and why the court should, instead, pick one of the plaintiffs’ preferred maps for the 2026 election. 
Third District Judge Dianna Gibson rarely spoke during Thursday’s hearing, except a few times to sustain objections from legislative attorneys about leading questions. Largely, Gibson listened quietly as plaintiffs questioned their experts’ methods in painstaking detail. 
Utah lawmakers and plaintiffs accuse each other of gerrymandering with dueling redistricting experts

Early Friday, the evidentiary hearing is expected to continue with testimony from the Legislature’s retained experts. 
But Thursday morning, the hearing started with Jowei Chen, an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Michigan, calling the map advanced by the Republican-controlled Utah Legislature — known as map C — an “extreme partisan outlier” that favors Republicans. 
Chen said that when he analyzed 10,000 computer simulated maps drawn with a program designed to prioritize the neutral redistricting criteria listed by Proposition 4 — the 2018 voter-approved law requiring an independent redistricting process in Utah — more than 99% of the program’s map simulations created a Democratic-leaning district because of the state’s “political geography.”
In GOP-dominated Utah, Republicans for years have consistently won statewide races, with Republican voters making up about two-thirds of registered voters. Democrats, however, are concentrated in the state’s most populated county, Salt Lake County, and make up roughly a third of the state’s voters. 
Map C, Chen said, “cracked” Democratic voters by splitting Salt Lake County in half and creating four safe Republican districts — a result he said almost never observed in his 10,000-map simulation that was programmed to follow Proposition 4’s map-drawing criteria.

“That is what makes it an extreme partisan outlier,” Chen said. 
Chen also picked apart methods used by the Legislature’s redistricting expert, Sean Trende, a senior elections analyst for Real Clear Politics, who drew map C. Chen said Trende’s maps were flawed from the beginning because they were drawn with software that was not programmed to prioritize Proposition 4’s criteria, which calls for the prioritization of minimizing city and county splits, maximizing geographic compactness, and keeping communities of interest together. 
Chen said Trende’s use of a statistical tool called the partisan bias test effectively “filters out” any map with a Democratic-leaing district. 
“Essentially if a plan has a Democratic district, it’s almost certainly going to fail the partisan bias test,” Chen said. “That partisan bias test is essentially just a filter for whether or not a map has a Democratic district or not.”
Chen and another one of the plaintiffs’ experts — Chris Warshaw, a professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University — also testified that the partisan bias test is not an “appropriate” tool to use in a state like Utah that has only four congressional seats and has uncompetitive statewide races (for years Republicans have won by wide margins).

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune)
Trende and the Legislature’s other redistricting experts are expected to testify and be cross-examined during the second day of the hearing on Friday. 
Warshaw said the partisan bias test and the mean-median difference metrics — tests that Utah lawmakers required in a recently-passed law, SB1011, to analyze congressional maps — both “don’t work well in Utah.” Gibson is also expected to weigh in on a separate request from the plaintiffs to block that law from taking effect following a hearing scheduled for Nov. 5.

“I believe it’s not among the best available measures,” Warshaw said of the mean-median difference test. “In fact it’s among the worst measures and is not applicable in Utah.” 
Though Warshaw acknowledged that his preferred method, the efficiency gap test, has its limitations because Utah only has four congressional districts, he said it’s a better metric to test for fairness — and that map-drawers should also pair it with other statistical tests. 
“Where it’s appropriate we should use multiple metrics to push on the robustness of our conclusions,” he said. 
Victoria and Malcolm Reid, two of the plaintiffs that are suing the state, also testified Thursday. The Reids live in Millcreek — a city that was split four times by the 2021 congressional map that has since been struck down by the courts. 
The Legislature’s preferred map that’s been submitted to the court would still split Millcreek, but only once compared to four times. Still, Malcolm Reid said he believes the two alternative maps drawn by the plaintiffs would be more fair because they would keep his community whole and not “dilute” his voice. 
“It hurts half as much,” Malcolm Reid said of the Legislature’s map C. “We’re down to two congressional districts instead of four, (but) we can still walk to the east, walk to the south, walk to the north, and be in a different congressional district. … It effectively keeps Millcreek divided.”

Gableman faces a suspension of his law license for his conduct during his widely derided review of the 2020 presidential election. The Supreme Court is responsible for delivering the length of his suspension and determining any monetary penalties he’s responsible for paying. 
Crawford’s recusal comes after Gableman had filed a motion requesting that she not participate in the case because of comments she made about him on the campaign trail earlier this year. However, Crawford isn’t recusing at Gableman’s request. 
Instead, Crawford wrote, she is stepping aside from weighing in on the case because part of the allegations against Gableman are his actions during an open records lawsuit against him in the circuit court of Dane County Judge Frank Remington. Crawford, formerly a judge in that circuit, said that because of her proximity to Remington’s court, she learned facts about that case that are not considered part of the official record in the disciplinary matter. 
“I believe it is likely I was exposed to information and impressions related to Attorney Gableman’s conduct and demeanor in the circuit court that fall outside of the record before this court,” she wrote. “Because I may have been exposed to factual allegations beyond those Attorney Gableman has chosen not to contest, I may have ‘personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding.’”
Because she recused herself for another reason, Crawford dismissed Gableman’s request as moot.
Gableman had also requested the recusal of Justice Rebecca Dallet, arguing that comments she made about his judicial record when she announced her campaign for the Court in 2017 meant she couldn’t impartially assess his case. In an order, Dallet denied the request, writing that her comments about him in 2017 have nothing to do with how she assesses actions he took in 2021. 
“Although Gableman tries to characterize my comments as reflecting a view of ‘Gableman’s moral turpitude,’ and his ‘professional judgment and character,’ no objective reasonable observer would understand them as such,” she wrote. “Simply put, I expressed my disagreement with Gableman’s actions as a candidate and justice between 2008 and 2018. That disagreement is irrelevant to whether he engaged in attorney misconduct in 2021 and 2022, and whether I can impartially adjudicate claims that he did so now.”
With Crawford recusing, the Court is divided 3-3 between liberals and conservatives — though conservative Justice Brian Hagedorn has previously sided with the Court’s liberals in cases relating to the 2020 presidential election.

At an event in Washington, D.C. that was dubbed “Alaska Day” by the federal department, Burgum signed a series of documents pertaining to all three projects as well as an ongoing effort by the federal government to give land to the families of Alaska Native Vietnam War veterans.
“This is our first, this won’t be our last, Alaska Day. We have a lot more things to accomplish, a lot more things to celebrate going forward,” said Burgum, flanked by Gov. Mike Dunleavy and all three members of the state’s congressional delegation.
“I told the president, it’s like Christmas every morning,” said Dunleavy. “I wake up, I go to look at what’s under the proverbial Christmas tree to see what’s happening. And here’s another example of more presents for not just Alaska, but for this country.”
Tribal and environmental groups opposed to the three development projects saw Thursday’s action differently, with Defenders of Wildlife, a national group, dubbing the event “Alaska Sellout Day.”
“Today’s announcements are the latest step in Donald Trump’s plan to sell out our wildest landscape and natural heritage to corporate polluters,” said Dan Ritzman, director of conservation for the Sierra Club. 
What was done on Thursday
Burgum signed previously announced permits for the 211-mile Ambler Road, which is intended to connect the Dalton Highway with a series of potential mine sites in the Brooks Range of northern Alaska.
He also signed a record of decision for the federal government’s oil and gas drilling program in the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge of northeast Alaska. 
That re-establishes a program that had been in place during the first term of President Donald Trump but which was subsequently reversed by President Joe Biden.
Burgum also reversed the Biden administration’s decision to suspend oil and gas leases issued by the federal government in 2020 to the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority.
Barring further litigation, that move clears the way for AIDEA — Alaska’s state-owned development bank — to begin seismic surveys that could reveal the amount of oil available within parts of the Arctic refuge’s coastal plain.
While the Ambler and ANWR actions effectively took the projects back to where they stood in 2020, the King Cove road is now closer to construction at any point in its decades-long development process.
Envisioned as a gravel road between King Cove and an all-weather airport at Cold Bay, the road would pass through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, a nationally important bird sanctuary. 
Eleven miles of new road are needed to link existing roads to the two towns, but those 11 miles would pass through a wilderness area. 
On Thursday, Burgum signed documents that complete a land exchange between King Cove Corp., the local Alaska Native corporation, and the federal government. King Cove Corp. gives up about 31,200 acres to expand the refuge, and in return, it receives the 490 acres of refuge land needed to complete the road.
In a move with more limited statewide impact, Burgum signed paperwork awarding three Alaska Native Vietnam War veterans with 160-acre plots of land under a federal allotment program. As of March, 453 veterans and their families had requested plots authorized under legislation authored by Alaska Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan.
For King Cove, a medevac-avoiding road moves forward
King Cove’s airport is frequently closed by bad weather, and since 2014, there have been more than 100 Coast Guard medevacs from the community because regular air ambulance service was unavailable. 
Murkowski, who has previously vowed to complete the road, noted that this is the third time that the federal government has embarked on a land exchange for the road, with the prior two attempts blocked and reversed by litigation.
“We’ve reached a point with the King Cove exchange that we haven’t yet before, and that’s actually the official patent being issued to KCC, so we’re one step further. I think that’s important,” she said.
The road, though supported by local residents, is opposed by some Yukon-Kuskokwim river delta tribal leaders and subsistence bird hunters who fear its effects on wildlife.
“Surely, the people of King Cove can see the value of leaving the habitat for so many species intact would be far more valuable than any road could be,” said  Angutekaraq Estelle Thomson, Traditional Council President of the Native Village of Paimiut, one of several communities that have supported lawsuits seeking to prevent road construction.
Rebecca Noblin, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity who has fought the road on behalf of several area villages, said Thursday that “we have significant questions about the legality of the exchange. We, along with the Native Villages of Hooper Bay and Paimiut, expect to bring those issues to court soon. Road construction will also require additional permits, including an Army Corps 404 permit and Endangered Species Act consultation, so this is far from a done deal.”
With Ambler and ANWR, a triumph of economics over environment
On the first day of his second term in office, Trump issued an executive order seeking to encourage oil and gas development, mining and logging in Alaska.

Elected officials said they see Thursday’s actions in line with that decision. 
Alaska Republican Rep. Nick Begich said projects like the Ambler Road and ANWR drilling matter because they create jobs.
“We need the jobs. We need high-paying, good jobs, and these resource industry jobs fit that bill completely. And so whether it’s mining, timber, oil and gas development or other resources, these are necessary for the functioning of Alaska’s economy,” he said.
The coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is believed to contain billions of barrels of recoverable oil that could be sold on global markets. 
Sullivan noted that previous North Slope oil development has been good for the region’s residents. 
“The life expectancy, mostly of the Native people in our state, has increased in the North Slope and the Northwest Arctic Borough and by dramatic numbers … and a lot of that is due to the benefits that come from responsible resource development: jobs, revenues, water and sewer, gymnasiums, health clinics. So it’s a real life and death issue,” he said.
The predominantly Alaska Native town of Kaktovik is located on Barter Island, within the refuge.
“Developing ANWR’s Coastal Plain is vital for Kaktovik’s future,” said the town’s mayor, Nathan Gordon Jr., in a written statement. “Taxation of development infrastructure in our region funds essential services across the North Slope, including water and sewer systems to clinics, roads, and first responders. Today’s actions by the federal government create the conditions for these services to remain available and for continued progress for our communities.”
To date, no oil companies have shown interest in drilling within the refuge, leaving only Alaska’s state-owned development bank, which won leases in a 2020 sale, to work there.
So far, no actual work has taken place because of repeated lawsuits seeking to overturn the sale.
The bank, which has filed several lawsuits over federal restrictions on drilling within the refuge, did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday.
Several legal challenges to the 2020 ANWR plan of development — which was restored Thursday — are still pending in federal court. 
Some of those challenges revolve around the possible effects that ANWR development and the burning of those fossil fuels will have on climate change.
Thursday’s announcement came just a week after the remnants of Typhoon Halong devastated coastal communities in southwestern Alaska. Experts say that storm was worsened by climate change.
Murkowski said she does not shy away “from the fact that the impact of that typhoon was made more fierce and more destructive because it was able to travel over a large body of what is now warmer, open ocean with lack of ice. I get that, and I call it climate change.”
At the same time, people worldwide are continuing to consume fossil fuels. Murkowski said that for her, the choice is straightforward: Will they get those fossil fuels from Alaska or some place with worse environmental standards?
“I’d much rather be producing in Alaska, than just across the Bering Strait there, over in Russia, where I don’t think that they respect the same level of environmental standards and safeguards,” she said. “So is it complicated? Yes. But am I proud of how Alaska has led in terms of meeting environmental standards that are amongst the highest in the world? I am.” 
What comes next for Ambler, King Cove and ANWR?
All three development projects boosted by the federal government on Thursday are a long way from construction, both supporters and detractors say.
In all three cases, proponents need to obtain additional federal permits and will have to cope with lawsuits brought by opponents.
The environmental law firm Earthjustice has repeatedly been involved in lawsuits against the federal government over the issue of arctic refuge drilling.
“Interior has re-adopted the maximally destructive plan from President Trump’s first term,” said Earthjustice attorney Erik Grafe, by email on Thursday. “That plan was unlawful in 2020 and is still unlawful today. The bedrock environmental laws that protect the Arctic Refuge’s irreplaceable natural resources remain despite Congress passing reconciliation bills on leasing in the refuge.” 
The Gwich’in Steering Committee, represented by attorneys from Trustees for Alaska, is among the organizations that have repeatedly sued to block drilling in ANWR. 
The committee is concerned about the effect that refuge development would have on local caribou herds used by subsistence hunters. In a statement, the committee’s executive director, Kristen Moreland, implied that further litigation will come.
“This action by the Trump administration is a direct attack on the Gwich’in, who have for decades been a voice for the caribou and stood against the destruction of the Arctic Refuge. A leasing program that would open the entire Coastal Plain completely ignores the impacts that oil and gas development would have on the land, on wildlife, and on our communities,” she said.
“We condemn these efforts by the Trump administration to exploit the calving grounds of the Porcupine Caribou herd for short-term gain, and we know that we are not alone. We will continue to raise our voices and fight for the protection of this sacred land and for our way of life.”

Gov. Kelly Armstrong argued the Ethics Commission needs a “general reset,” citing a strained relationship with executive branch agencies. Armstrong also strongly disagreed with a response Sagsveen gave during the selection process in which he said the North Dakota Legislature has passed laws to limit the commission’s authority, in violation of the state constitution. 
“I just won’t vote for him,” Armstrong said.

However, Senate Majority Leader David Hogue and Senate Minority Leader Kathy Hogan, the other two members of the selection committee, strongly support reappointing Sagsveen. The appointment requires a consensus of the three members, not a majority vote.
Hogan, D-Fargo, cited the need to maintain continuity on the commission because it has only begun finding its feet seven years after it was created. Hogue, R-Minot, said he was impressed by Sagsveen’s written responses to a questionnaire issued by the committee.
“I think he’s the top pick,” Hogue said of Sagsveen, even though the two men don’t agree on everything. “He’s too strong in so many other areas to overlook him.”
Sagsveen, a Bismarck attorney with extensive government experience, was appointed to the Ethics Commission last September to fill the remainder of a term for Paul Richard, who retired. Sagsveen is seeking a four-year term.
The terms of commissioner Ward Koeser and Sagsveen expired Aug. 31 but they are continuing to serve until vacancies are filled. The third vacancy was caused by the death of Dave Anderson, the board chair, in May. The appointment to fill that seat will expire Aug. 31, 2026.
The finalists supported by all three members of the selection committee are Pam Sharp, former director of the North Dakota Office of Management and Budget, Jared Huibregtse, a project manager for a Mandan engineering firm, and Mark Western, a Fargo attorney. 
The committee adjourned without making a decision, with Hogan and Hogue continuing to advocate for Sagsveen.
“We’ve actually seen him working in this position,” Hogan said, emphasizing the need to maintain continuity on the Ethics Commission now that the board and legislative leadership have begun establishing a positive working relationship. “I feel like we have been moving in a good direction together.”
Armstrong referenced the strained relationship between the Ethics Commission and the Attorney General’s Office as he suggested the need for a “level reset” to improve communication with legislative and executive branches. 
“Drew is an incredibly intense advocate who is very passionate about the things he’s passionate about,” said Armstrong, referring to Attorney General Drew Wrigley. 
Sagsveen in his written response to questions called the relationship with the attorney general  “problematic” because he “consistently disparages the professionalism and competence of the Commission’s Executive Director.”
Sagsveen also cited the state constitution, which says laws may not hamper or restrict the Ethics Commission, which was created by the voters. “However, laws have been enacted to limit the authority of the Commission,” he wrote.
ND Ethics Commission has no authority to punish officials violating ethics laws, state leaders argue

Armstrong pushed back on that answer during Thursday’s meeting. 
“I don’t think the Legislature has acted unconstitutionally,” Armstrong said. “I think the answer, I mean, really quite frankly bothers me.”
Armstrong and Hogue said they oppose a recent advisory opinion issued by the commission because it has a significant impact on the secretary of state’s administration of campaign finance law and encroaches on the Legislature’s authority to enact laws. 
Hogue, however, said he was pleased by Sagsveen’s “constructive response” after Armstrong voiced his concerns about the opinion during a public hearing.
“What impressed me was he was pretty open and shared a willingness to say, ‘All right, we should have collaborations because we had no idea those concerns were out there in the executive branch,’” Hogue said. 
Sagsveen, reached after the selection committee’s meeting, declined to comment. 
“I don’t want to say anything to interfere with the selection process,” Sagsveen said.
The committee will reconvene at 2 p.m. Friday to resume its discussion. 
The Legislature earlier this year rejected the Ethics Commission’s request for an additional staff member and a bill the commission said would have helped speed up investigations. The offices of the governor and attorney general also argued this year that the commission does not have the authority to create or impose penalties for ethics-related violations.

(Matthew Perschall for Louisiana Illuminator) The LSU presidential search committee has announced that six individuals will be invited to formally apply for the position — on the condition that their identities become public by Wednesday.
Interim LSU President Matt Lee, McNeese State President Wade Rousse, former University of Arizona President Robert Robbins, University of South Carolina Vice President of Research Julius Fridriksson and Tulane University Vice President of Research Giovanni Piedimonte were identified on the list of candidates invited to apply. 
One of the candidates on the committee’s list of top five applicants for matching their desired qualifications, identified only by a number, will be invited to apply only if they disclose their name publicly. 
“Whether they apply or not is up to them, and if so, they’ll be invited to interview,” LSU general counsel Trey Jones said. 
Rousse is the favored candidate of LSU Board Vice Chairman Lee Mallett, who is also a Lake Charles resident. He is rumored to be the most likely candidate to get the job. Rousse has been president of McNeese State University since May 2024. He’s held several administrative positions at the university since 2019. 
Lee, who has served as interim since former President William Tate left the position in June, is LSU’s vice president for agriculture and dean of the College of Agriculture. Lee has worked at LSU, first as a sociology professor and then as an administrator, since 2004. He also received his doctorate degree from LSU. 
The decision to go public with applicants’ names comes days after search committee members were asked to sign non-disclosure agreements that would have required them to remain silent on candidate names until they officially applied.  LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard indicated Thursday the university had moved away from that stance, saying the original intent of the agreements was to protect the applicants.
“We just said, ‘Y’all are on record.’ We’re tired,” Ballard said.
The search committee is expected to meet again Oct. 29 to publicly interview the applicants and select three finalists. Those finalists will then meet with various university interest groups, including as faculty and students, with the Board of Supervisors meeting shortly afterward to make the final hiring decision.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/3-20-23_LSU_MP-10-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 20:16:47.810651

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho’s DOGE Task Force is preparing to recommend potential state employee position eliminations as well as agency, board and commission repeals or mergers. 
The legislative task force, named for the federal Department of Government Efficiency, voted Thursday at a meeting in Boise to allow the co-chairs to provide state budget writers with information on long-term vacancies at the interim budget meeting in November. 
DOGE members also heard a staff report on the first 13 potential agency eliminations or consolidations, with more planned for consideration. 
Task force co-Chair Rep. Jeff Ehlers, R-Meridian, said Thursday the members would evaluate information compiled by legislative staff and hear from heads of the agencies to make recommendations at next month’s meeting. 
The task force may study issues and provide recommendations, but cannot pass legislation. Its recommendations will go to the germane legislative committee for consideration and a vote before going through the rest of the legislative process through the Idaho House and Idaho Senate. 
 Task force considers recommending elimination of longstanding vacant positions statewide 

Legislative staff compiled and presented a list of all the agency employee positions that had been authorized and funded but not filled for the past six months, which totaled 381 positions.
Ehlers noted to lawmakers that he and co-Chair Sen. Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, would be presenting findings from the task force at the budget-writing Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee, or JFAC, meeting in early November, and said he’d entertain a motion to provide the report to the budget writers with the recommendation that the positions and their associated funding be eliminated. 
The task force’s sole Democrat, Sen. Carrie Semmelroth of Boise, asked if there was a way that agencies could be reached about the necessity of each position to the functioning of the agency before the group recommended elimination. 
Republican Rep. Dustin Manwaring of Pocatello, also thought the task force didn’t have enough information to recommend a full elimination, but thought JFAC members should have the information. 
“That’s what I think JFAC’s job will be, is to dig into the weeds on some of these,” Manwaring said. 
Some of the vacant positions included trial attorneys for the newly established State Public Defender’s Office, which Manwaring highlighted as wanting to have more time for those to be filled before removing their funding. 
Other positions included in the report were Idaho State Police troopers, several nurses with the Division of Veterans Services, Idaho Department of Transportation engineers and technicians, and a number of health care provider and social worker-related positions at the Department of Health and Welfare. 
Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, made a motion that the task force direct the co-chairs to provide the report to JFAC for its members’ “review, consideration and research” for possible removal of positions. 
Members unanimously voted to provide the report without a specific recommendation.

 DOGE members look to eliminate seven state entities, move seven more under other agencies

Jared Tatro, of the Legislative Services Office’s Impact Review Team, provided an overview of items legislators on the task force had identified as “low-hanging fruit,” for elimination and consolidation, many of which are no longer used or active: 

Eliminate OnePlan Executive Group; a now-defunct conservation planner. 
Eliminate Big Payette Lake Water Quality Council and Citizens Committee 
Eliminate Columbia Compact Commission 
Eliminate Junior College District – Dormitory Housing Commision 
Merge Bingo-Raffle Advisory Board with Idaho Lottery Commission 
Move STEM Action Center into Workforce Development Council 
Merge Sheep and Goat Health Board with Department of Agriculture 
Eliminate State Brand Board 
Eliminate Idaho Honey Commission 
Move State Brand Inspector into Department of Agriculture
Move Soil & Water Commission into Department of Water Resources
Move Office of Species Conservation into Office of Energy and Mineral Resources 
Eliminate Regional Committees for Early Intervention Services 

Some of the eliminations may be done through work under the Idaho Code Cleanup Act, which passed this year and directed agencies to identify sections of code that are redundant, unnecessary or out-of-date. 
Tatro told lawmakers staff would be diving into questions about feasibility, such as whether lottery commissioners had adequate knowledge and resources to advise charitable gaming and that lawmakers would need to consider questions such as if bingo and raffles needed to be regulated at the same level going forward. 
 North Idaho representative urges task force not to eliminate lake commission 

In addition to the 13 elimination and merging options presented, Ehlers asked task force members Thursday to look at a larger list of about 70 possibilities that he previously presented, and recommend 10 more to research and consider. 
The list to consider “further review” included the Pend Oreille Basin Commission, which advises the state on North Idaho water quality and quantity issues. 
Rep. Mark Sauter, R-Sandpoint, who is not a member of the task force, told its members during the public comment period that the commission is vital to the area, and urged them not to remove it. He said it deals with issues related to federal authorities over a dam in the area. 
“It started out as an issue with Army Corps of Engineers, federal Fish and Game, federal endangered species, you name it,” Sauter said. “So it was just to push back against federal overreach, and we’ve been fighting ever since.” 
The DOGE Task Force plans to meet again Nov. 19.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins asked the Trump administration to consider all potential options for continuing the country’s largest nutrition assistance program that is set to be paused next month due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. 
Collins, who is chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins Thursday, asking her to explore the possibility of using contingency funds, offering partial payments or other legal options for ensuring the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, continues next month. 
The letter comes after the U.S. Department of Agriculture informed states earlier this week that the program’s November benefits won’t be issued because of the federal shutdown, which has now persisted for more than three weeks. More than 42 million low-income Americans, including 170,000 in Maine, rely on the program to buy food each month. 
“The needless and reckless government shutdown directed by Senator Schumer is putting federal nutrition assistance for these individuals at risk,” Collins said in her letter.
Maine food security advocates call on Collins to release contingency funds for SNAP benefits

While Collins said she will continue to work with her colleagues to “end this damaging shutdown,” she asked Rollins to take swift action to maintain the benefits in the interim. 
On Wednesday, a new coalition of food security advocates and organizations in Maine made a similar request of Collins in a letter asking her to release SNAP’s contingency funds to allow for the continuation of partial payments. 
Collins’ request to Rollins echoes that of Senate Democrats, who also sent a letter to Rollins Wednesday that contended the agency has the resources to keep payments flowing.
“We were deeply disturbed to hear that the USDA has instructed states to stop processing SNAP benefits for November and were surprised by your recent comments that the program will ‘run out of money in two weeks,’” reads the letter. “In fact, the USDA has several tools available which would enable SNAP benefits to be paid through or close to the end of November.”
Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill Wednesday to continue SNAP funding through the shutdown. During Thursday’s briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration would “absolutely support” the legislation.

(Courtesy of Conzett Architecture and Collective Development) OMAHA — A quilt mural reflecting assorted cultures and populations of an Omaha neighborhood will be featured on a $2.5 million townhome project funded in part with a state grant.
Ground preparation is underway at the long vacant 29th and Jackson Streets site, where six market-rate rental townhomes are to rise in a historically diverse section of Nebraska’s largest city.
Supporters gathered Thursday at a different venue to share details of the initiative, which is part of a three-pronged application by Marta Sonia Lodoño Mejía of Midwest Businesses &  Projects LLC. In all, the applicant was awarded $5.8 million from the $235 million North and South Omaha Recovery Grant program administered by the Nebraska Department of Economic Development and targeting neighborhoods hurt disproportionately by the COVID-19 pandemic.
$5.8 million state award helps launch ‘Global Market’ in South Omaha

About $1 million of the $5.8 million will fuel development of the townhomes led by Max Honaker and Ben Katt of Collective Development. The remainder goes to creation of the South Omaha Global Market and an expansion of the International Bakery, both along the South 24th Street corridor.
Also assisting the “29th and Jackson Townhomes” is $200,445 in public tax-increment financing approved by the City of Omaha. 
Designed for families, each townhome will include four bedrooms, about 2,000 square feet and a two-car tandem garage. Rent is expected to be $2,500, said Honaker.
A highlight of the housing is the mural that will be coordinated by the South Omaha Mural Project, a force behind 16 other murals and one sculpture that dot the “Magic City” known as a landing spot for immigrant and newcomer groups, including Irish, Polish, Czech, Lithuanian, African American, Mexican and Maya.
The future mural will be different in that it is to be a patchwork of designs — each representing a distinct culture or population — pieced together to convey unity, said Richard Harrison, an artist and business owner who created the South Omaha Mural Project series. 
“We are woven together,” he said of the theme. 
Harrison said he is hoping to assemble about 20 artists who each will design and produce a piece of the art that will face Highway 75. The overall quilt mural, he said, is to be 32 feet tall and 44 feet wide. 
Mural expenses are to be covered in part by the state award.  Harrison said he is applying for other community grants as well.
The funding source for the broader North-South recovery grant program started with deadline-strapped COVID-19 federal dollars, but a swap with state dollars later occurred to allow more time for a complex slate of projects to develop. Sharing the $235 million are about 130 groups and businesses, whose selection by state officials were based on potential for helping to reverse disinvestment.
When Midwest Businesses & Projects tapped Harrison, he was told to consider the diversity of residents in the area. Harrison said he had been intrigued with a quilt design he’d seen in a different city, and thought that the “unity” concept fit well in this case.
Lodoño Mejía said job creation and international flavor are common denominators of the three projects that share the state award. 
“On the housing, we wanted a mural to show the importance of working together, the many people from South Omaha that contribute,” she said.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)A new Montana law requiring a voter’s birth year has led to county election officials rejecting an abnormal number of ballots for this year’s local elections.
Ballots sent to Montana voters this election year look a little different than in years past. Underneath the ballot envelope’s signature line are four rectangles, with instructions to fill in a voter’s birth year.
The change comes from a law passed by the 2025 legislature that was intended to increase voter security by adding another layer of verification to absentee ballots.
In one county that had a practice run with the requirement, voters have adjusted, although a county official said the federal election next year will require significant outreach.
However, the law also gives voters an additional chance to make a mistake, and some counties are seeing rejection rates soar as a result. 
“This was our concern at the Legislature, that this law could cause otherwise valid ballots to be rejected, and unfortunately we’re just seeing it come to fruition,” Missoula County election administrator Bradley Seaman told the Daily Montanan on Wednesday. “We’ve got about a 4% rate of rejected ballots, up from just fractions of a percent we normally see. We have a very high rejection rate this year, and the main reason is people are missing the dates.”
Seaman said that as of Wednesday, with another week and a half to go before Election Day, his office in Missoula had rejected 467 ballots — 357 of them due to a missing or incorrect birth year. 
By comparison, in Missoula county’s 2023 municipal election, only 142 total ballots were rejected due to a missing or mismatched signature, out of nearly 25,000.
“It’s critical that every vote matters,” Seaman said, pointing to the previous city council election where one race ended in an exact tie. 
If a ballot is rejected, a county elections office will send a letter to the voter’s address, and if possible, send an email or call them. Once notified, voters are able to resolve issues with their ballot until 5 p.m. the day after the election, either in person, or by mail or email, by following the directions sent by election officials. 
Montana voters can check the status of their ballots by going to myvoterpage.com, which Seaman recommends everyone do, regardless of how sure they are that their ballot was correctly filled out.

While Missoula County is seeing a higher than normal rejection rate, not all counties are in the same boat. 
In Lewis and Clark County, the elections department, and voters, benefitted from having a “soft launch” of the birth year requirement during a school bond and city of Helena primary election in September, and widespread voter outreach. 
Connor Fitzpatrick, the county’s elections supervisor, said voters in the September election were instructed to put their birth year on their ballot envelope, even though the law didn’t take effect until Oct. 1. Missing dates, in that case, didn’t mean ballots would be rejected, but it gave voters the opportunity to practice. 
In addition, the week prior to mailing out ballots, the department sent a mailer to every address involved in the election “as a reminder for city of Helena folk, and to bring it to the attention of anyone not in Helena, that this new law is fully implemented and in play this election,” Fitzpatrick said. 
As of Thursday, Fitzpatrick said his department had only rejected 15 ballots, which he attributed to the soft launch and directed outreach by the elections team. 
“Anytime you change the process for voters, even if it’s a minor change, you’re going to want to find a way to tell them about it,” Fitzpatrick said. “And this is more than a minor change.”
“At the end of the day, we want you to vote, that’s why we’re here,” he added. “But we don’t want to have to deal with a lot of folks coming in at the last minute saying ‘goodness gracious, my ballot was rejected because of this new item.’”
Fitzpatrick said that the double-verification requirement added a little bit of time to ballot processing — a few minutes for each batch — but said that since this year is only a local election, it’s a smaller lift for the department to begin with. 
“A few years from now, in the next presidential election, that will be a good question to ask again, and see if we know how much more time this could add,” Fitzpatrick said. 
In Yellowstone County, where the most ballots have been sent out to voters, election officials told the Daily Montanan that of the 9,700 ballots returned as of Wednesday, 5.6% had been rejected — up from 0.8% in 2023. 
“For those who did not complete the requirement, it adds an extra burden to them to have to fix it,” said Dayna Causby, the county’s new election administrator. “And it’s a strain on our office as well. Our office is having to reach out to a much larger number of them than before.”
Flathead County, which is conducting its largest all-mail election ever, said they’re seeing ballots returned at an extremely slow pace. Of the roughly 1,100 received through Wednesday, about 1.5% were rejected. That’s about twice the rate seen during the 2024 election, though the election administrator noted that last year was a presidential election so it’s not a perfect comparison.
Strengthening election integrity
House Bill 719 was carried by Rep. Braxton Mitchell, R-Columbia Falls at the request of the Secretary of State’s office. 
Mitchell couldn’t be reached for comment on Thursday, but said during the Legislature that the law is a “common-sense practice,” that aligns absentee voting with in-person requirements. The bill is aimed at increasing voter confidence, reducing errors and preventing fraud, he said.
Montana has had just two known cases of election fraud since 1997, according to the Heritage Foundation’s election fraud tracker. 
In May, the law was challenged in Lewis and Clark District Court by two organizations, Big Sky 55+ and Disability Rights Montana, which allege the law is unnecessary and adds a hurdle to the process that will disenfranchise voters. 
More than 80% of Montanans vote using absentee ballots, all of whom would be subject to the new requirement, the lawsuit states, and have more chances for error. 
“Researchers found that, as the number of ‘verification’ requirements increases, so do ballot rejection rates,” the lawsuit states. According to an MIT study, states that just require a signature verification have an average rejection rate of 0.77%; but having two verification requirements increases the rejection rate 2.5 times. 
“Ultimately, in its effort to fix a non-existent problem, HB 719 creates a problem that is very real: the exclusion of qualified voters,” the suit states. “And while it was vaunted by its proponents as an election integrity measure, HB 719 undermines democracy in Montana by excluding qualified voters from the process.”
No action has been taken by the district court on the lawsuit yet, and the law remains in place.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/montana-election-day-2024-31-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 19:57:35.450220

(Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)Large scale federal changes to funding, both through the reconciliation bill passed this summer and other actions President Donald Trump’s administration has taken, will have significant impacts on Montana, state agencies reported on Wednesday.
Legislators heard the report from the state’s legislative support divisions, as well as agency staff during an eight-hour meeting on Wednesday in Helena. Food assistance and government-funded healthcare will see changes and the state could see less tax revenue through new rules in that area.
The Legislative Fiscal Divisions report, “Federal Budget Impacts to State,” is 45 pages long and specifically gets into what federal grants have changed. A report this summer estimated a nearly $160 million hit to the state’s budget.
About 44.5% of the House Bill 2 budget comes from the federal government, the report states. That bill included certain “triggers” that would bring the finance committee together with interim committees and interim budget committees.
“We’ve well established that those triggers have happened in (the federal reconciliation bill),” Amy Carlson, with Legislative Fiscal, told legislators on Wednesday.”… I think that we as a state are going to be having this conversation about how the federal government changes in funding affect Montana’s budget, and how you all feel about that, and what changes you may or may not want to do as a result of that.”
Marcia Howard, the executive director of Federal Funds Information for States, also gave the legislators an overview of federal changes. Her organization helps states analyze the impact of federal changes on their budget. 
She said the president’s administration has made it clear where their priorities lie.
“To cut taxes, to cut mandatory programs, to cut discretionary grants, to shrink the federal footprint generally, to make the federal government smaller and to vastly expand executive branch power,” Howard said. “And there are a lot of tools available to do these things, and the administration has used all of them to some degree.”
She said those changes have not been as “transparent” as they would be “in a normal year.” Howard added that many grant programs have been restructured, and that timelines have been shortened if they get reopened. Some actions the Trump administration has taken to stop grant programs may or may not be legal, she added.
“It may be that by the time all of this runs its course, the clock has just run out, that it becomes irrelevant whether it was legal or illegal, because it was two or three or four years ago, and the funds just never made their way to the recipients,” Howard said.
Susie Hedalen, the state’s superintendent of public instruction, said federal funds only make up 13.7% of a school district’s budget in the state and told legislators they “were not too worried” about potential federal education cuts. The federal Department of Education has been marked for shutdown by the Trump administration.
There was also concern funding could dip for the Montana State Library, the Montana Arts Council and the Montana Historical Society. They have small budgets to begin with and federal money makes up a huge percentage of their funding, representatives for those organizations noted.
Legislators and the presenters discussed what they could do to cover food assistance programs during the federal shutdown. House Bill 924, asking the Governor’s Office to use certain funds or even taking a loan against another pot of state money were all discussed as potential pathways for food assistance funding.
“The Legislative Fiscal Division memo today shows an estimated biennial revenue loss from the individual income tax provisions of around 230 million each biennium,” Rose Bender, with the Montana Budget and Policy Center, said during a public comment. “Moving forward, we think there is additional risk of revenue loss within this budget window from changes not listed in that memo, and on top of that, lost tax revenue, these tax cuts come while our state is being required to cover additional pieces of the SNAP and Medicaid programs.”
New rules on Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Programs ask states to contribute more and ties what’s called an “error rate” to that money. Montana’s error rate, which includes both overallotting and underallotting money for food, is between  7% and 8%, the report noted.
“There are less federal dollars coming in for SNAP administration, more state funds required as we move forward in SNAP, there is that state responsibility tied to the error rate in SNAP, right,” said Josh Platt, with Legislative Fiscal. “And so that work has already started at the agency level to work on getting that error rate down.”
Other changes discussed included coal and oil leases — new rules will have companies paying less, so less tax revenue — and transportation funding.
Two large state transportation projects, Nine Pipes along Highway 93 and another in East Missoula, were impacted in the cuts. Department of Transportation head Chris Dorrington said Nine Pipes would likely be reduced in scale and that he “didn’t see” the East Missoula project coming back.
The justice system is also seeing cuts, Walker Hopkins, with Legislative Fiscal, added.
“What we’ve been able to identify so far is areas that would be hit in terms of federal funding is our assistance and services for victims of domestic violence, dating violence and sexual assault,” Hopkins said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/HB-2-Folder-2-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-23 19:57:35.450220

Of the 1,625 claims the state Employment Security Department had received by Tuesday, 411 had been paid. The rest were pending. 
The state’s goal is no more than 21 days from getting an unemployment insurance application to the applicant receiving benefits. 
“Our No. 1 goal is to get people paid as quickly as possible,” Employment Security Commissioner Cami Feek said. “We understand the stress involved in being furloughed or laid off.”
The agency is receiving dozens more claims each day. This tracks with what the state saw during the last shutdown in late 2018 and early 2019. The current shutdown was in its 23rd day on Thursday and is now the second-longest in U.S. history.
King, Pierce, Kitsap and Thurston counties are home to the most federal employees filing claims. An Employment Security Department spokesperson said information about which federal agencies employed the laid-off workers is confidential. But the departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security and Transportation, along with the Postal Service, are among the agencies with the most workers in Washington. 
As of the first quarter of this year, Washington had nearly 80,000 federal workers in total.
Nearly 500 people attended an Employment Security Department webinar Thursday focused on helping federal workers and others affected by the government shutdown. 
Congress has shown no signs of coming close to a compromise to reopen the government as they disagree on the future of health care subsidies.
Once the shutdown ends, federal workers are meant to receive back pay under a 2019 law, but the Trump administration has signaled it wouldn’t compensate employees for their forced time off. If they do receive that back pay, they’d have to repay unemployment benefits to the state.
President Donald Trump has also tried to fire thousands of federal workers during the shutdown, but a judge has halted that move.
Federal workers who are continuing to work without compensation aren’t eligible for unemployment, a change from the previous prolonged shutdown in late 2018 and early 2019. 
Senators on Thursday failed to pass either Republican- or Democratic-backed proposals to pay federal employees and contractors who continue to work despite the shutdown, meaning they won’t be paid until the government is reopened.
Most federal employees will miss their first full paycheck either Friday or early next week. 
The state Department of Financial Institutions has compiled a list of resources for federal workers during the shutdown. And there will be another webinar to answer questions Oct. 30.

Meanwhile, Washington state employees who work on the food stamp program could see layoffs if the shutdown continues into November. Benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, are set to run out if the shutdown stretches into November.
The Department of Social and Health Services is “looking at ways to address” the funding issue to minimize the impact to state workers and food stamp enrollees, said spokesperson Norah West.

(Jeniffer Solis / Nevada Current)Two New Mexico Congressional delegation members on Thursday helped lead a letter with other Democratic lawmakers demanding the federal government reverse its decision to furlough federal workers overseeing nuclear weapons work and stockpile.
On Monday, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Chris Wright confirmed 1,400 employees across the nation had been furloughed as part of the ongoing federal government shutdown that began Oct. 1.
As Source reported on Wednesday, those employees included  152 National Nuclear Security Agency workers in New Mexico, leaving only 14 employees split between the NNSA’s Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories locations. The furloughs are the agency’s first since its creation in 2000, and none occurred during previous shutdowns.

Democratic U.S. Reps. Melanie Stansbury and Teresa Leger Fernández, representing the 1st and 3rd congressional districts respectively, signed an Oct. 23 letter, along with Reps. Eric Swalwell from California, Dina Titus from Nevada and more than 20 other members of Congress.
The letter, addressed to Wright and NNSA Administrator Brandon Williams, asks for an explanation of why more NNSA employees were not kept on as essential workers, “given the gravity of their duties” in overseeing the nuclear weapons stockpile and nonproliferation work overseas.
“Furloughing the vast majority of the agency’s personnel is not only an unprecedented step, it is deeply harmful to U.S. national security,” the letter states. “Undermining the agency’s workforce at such a challenging time for U.S. global leadership diminishes our credible deterrence, emboldens our international adversaries, and makes the world a more dangerous place.”
Other questions the letter asks to be answered by Nov. 7 include the administration’s legal basis for furloughing NNSA staff, along with an accounting for the total numbers of staff furloughed and remaining on duty.
“Congress has a right to know exactly how much more dangerous our lives are now that you have sent the vast majority of NNSA’s staff home,” the letter states.
The letter, which notes the unprecedented nature of the NNSA furloughs, concludes with a request that the agency reverse its decision.
“We urgently demand that you rescind this furlough notice and return NNSA employees to the important job of ensuring our nuclear stockpile is safe, secure, and reliable.”

Ned Lamont are aligned on most portions of a new housing bill, written to replace the vetoed House Bill 5002. But a handful of the most substantial pieces of the measure are still up for debate.
State legislative leaders say they won’t bring a weak bill to the floor during a special session of the General Assembly planned for next month.
At the state Department of Housing’s annual conference at Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket on Thursday, top state officials said negotiations are almost wrapped up.
“I think we’re still talking. I think we’re pretty close,” Lamont said.
The new bill seeks to replace H.B. 5002, the most significant piece of housing legislation to come across the governor’s desk during his years in office, which tackled homelessness, zoning and parking, among other topics. Lawmakers narrowly passed the measure in the waning days of this year’s legislative session. The governor then surprised many Democrats when he vetoed the measure in June.
The veto caused anger and disappointment among many Democrats who said Lamont’s staff had worked on the bill with them, and they’d been assured he would sign it.
Lamont issued the veto under pressure from outside groups and town officials. Opponents feared the bill would dilute local control and put unrealistic expectations on towns for building more housing.
On Thursday, Lamont gave some of the clearest details released so far on the new version of the bill — including changes to a parking reform measure, more regional resources, and state aid to build sewer and water systems.
Lamont said after Thursday’s event that he was still discussing some of the same measures he’d taken issue with when he vetoed the bill — parking reform and a requirement for towns to plan and zone for a set number of units known as fair share. Those were among the most controversial measures in the bill.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, said he wants to find a solution — and he also wants to see housing built more quickly. 
“I hope we can get there, but we will not bring a weak bill to the floor of the Senate,” Duff said.

House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said he thinks lawmakers and the governor agree on about 85% of the bill, but the 15% they don’t agree on is substantive.
“Knowing that we were talking about 15% of the bill … maybe 13%? I’m not just saying that for the sake of saying that, I truly believe that,” Rojas said. “A bill ain’t dead until it’s dead, and it ain’t dead yet.”
Rojas said he’s optimistic that officials will have a housing bill ready for the Nov. 12 and 13 special session. Lawmakers also plan to debate a financial plan to respond to federal human services cuts at the session.
Lamont said he agreed there was little of the bill left to negotiate but “the final two yards is always the toughest.”
“I want to do everything I can to make it easier and faster for developers to build. I want towns to take the lead,” he said.
He said the new bill aims to have towns select areas to “pre-zone” for more housing, such as locations close to public transit — a description similar to elements of the portion of the old bill known as Work, Live Ride.
He said the state will provide regional councils of government with planners who have “the skills they need to work with the towns” and to work “as a region.” He said towns will be able to work collectively on housing, sewer and water resources under the approach. The state will help with the projects, and for towns that build more housing and need to expand their schools, Lamont said the state will be ready to help.
According to Lamont, town officials have said they’re OK with allowing the conversion of commercial properties to residential without a special hearing in certain districts and — as long as the first floor can remain commercial so residents can access restaurants and shops. The previous proposal had allowed those conversions as of right without the qualification regarding the first floor.
H.B. 5002 had also removed mandates for developers to build off-street parking for residential buildings with up to 24 units. Lamont said under the new bill, that number will likely be lowered to 16 units.
“The parking requirements are overdone, and that’s one of the things we’re looking at with this bill,” Lamont said. “Maybe 16 units, you don’t have to have additional parking, but we’ll give the towns a little bit of flexibility if there’s a particular need.”
Rojas and Duff weren’t as specific.
“I think the big picture of the bill is: How do we get more bang for our buck? How do we reduce regulations and all the other obstacles and needle points that exist in our housing development process?” Rojas said. He said the legislature had done its job during the session and passed a good bill.

“This is an issue that literally impacts everybody across the state of Connecticut,” Duff said. “And while you have people in communities who don’t want growth and don’t want housing, it’s really important for us to say ‘But there are actually more people who want growth and who want housing, who can’t afford a place to live.’”
Rojas has often characterized other housing bills as painfully incremental. Both lawmakers said they want to see bigger moves.
“Incremental legislation is not putting shovels in the ground, and that’s why we have to go forward faster,” Duff said.
Lamont and Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz praised a few towns such as West Hartford that have taken steps to build more affordable housing. 
They also pushed back against ideas that have spread widely among some who opposed H.B. 5002 — that more affordable housing in towns is a problem for current residents.
“I love Mayor Shari Cantor, and people come up to her a little grumpy sometimes, and go ‘I like West Hartford just the way it is.’ She goes, ‘I know. You’re going to love it the way it will be,’” Lamont said. “That’s what we’re trying to think about in this state.”
“I think there’s a myth out there that if your town has affordable housing in it, that somehow that affordable housing makes that town or city undesirable, and the exact opposite is true,” Bysiewicz said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1023_SR_HousingConvention_162-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 19:01:39.950344

Average annual tuition at the state universities is about $7,000 for a full-time student. Tuition at the community colleges is about $5,200 for full-time, in-state students. The regents voted unanimously to keep those rates steady in the coming school year. Housing fees will also remain flat this year.
Food service fees will increase by about $200 at Central Connecticut State University and Eastern Connecticut State University, by about $270 at Southern Connecticut State University and by $300 at Western Connecticut State University. And several specialized programs will incur additional fees between $100 and $300 annually.
“We are not proposing increases in tuition for academic year 26-27. Nor are we proposing any changes in the mandatory fees. However, we do face increased costs. And so the institutions are proposing a select few number of fees that they’d like to see increased to cover those increased costs,” said CSCU Chief Financial Officer Lloyd Blanchard. 
The move comes as public colleges and universities elsewhere the country have been raising tuition to offset declining revenues, slowing state investments and anticipated federal funding cuts. According to The Hechinger Report, tuition at public colleges this fall have risen as much as 10% after a period in which tuition increases were generally below the rate of inflation.
Connecticut has bucked that trend. This is the second year in a row that the state Board of Regents has frozen tuition — although housing costs rose last year between 2.75% and 12%. The previous year, tuition increased 5% as the colleges and universities faced the loss of federal COVID emergency funding. 
With tuition frozen at last year’s rates, the CSCU system saw its student population rise. Student enrollment at the four state universities is nearly 10% higher than it was in the fall of 2024. Enrollment at the community colleges is 4.3% higher than at the same time last year. 
Reserve funds
The boost in student enrollment could mean additional revenues for the state colleges and universities. But the system also has reserve funds to help keep things steady.
In March, CT Mirror reported that CSCU was sitting on about $600 million in budget reserves. The system plans to tap into its reserves in order to pay for expected shortfalls next year. So far this year, CSCU officials said they’ve used about $155 million in reserve funds.
“We are not sitting on a treasure trove. We are being strategic and responsible as it relates to our finances,” O. John Maduko, CSCU’s interim chancellor, said at Thursday’s regents’ meeting. “But we need to be cautious and we need to be conservative.” 
The board also voted Thursday to approve several partnerships between local companies and state universities that would allow employees at the companies to receive a 5% discount if they enroll in the local state university. 
Zulma Toro, president of Central CT State, said the university expected to enroll as many as 20 students through a partnership with Hanwha Aerospace. She said the college’s investment, for the 5% tuition discount, would equal about $5,700, and the college would receive about $109,600 in tuition. 
“Even though higher education is not a business, in any business, this could be a nice investment,” said Toro. 
She noted that Hanwha Aerospace had a long-standing partnership with Central, having donated $200,000 for the naming of the campus’ aerospace mechanical engineering lab, and that the company had pledged to put aside spaces for internships for seven Central students. The college is also partnering with Advanced Behavioral Care, which is working with students in the school’s College of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences. 
The board approved three partnerships at Western CT State — with the Danbury Chamber of Commerce, Newtown Savings Bank and Ives Bank. 
At the Oct. 15 finance committee meeting, Western CT State President Jesse Bernal told the committee that the partnerships were part of the university’s strategy to get out of its $23 million deficit. “These kinds of arrangements are going to be central for us to be able to generate revenue,” said Bernal. 
On Thursday, Ari Santiago, one of the regents, expressed support for the arrangements. “This is an opportunity to get our name out through people in the workforce who are looking to improve their position, gain more education,” Santiago said. “It opens us up to get marketing inside these organizations, and … we can gain additional students down the line.”  
Financial insecurity
Still, many CSCU students struggle to afford necessities. Monthly visits to the college food pantries has grown by 40% over the past year. Recently, grocery chain Stop and Shop donated $200,000 to CSCU’s food pantries. 
According to a survey of students at Central CT State last fall, nearly half said they ate less because they couldn’t afford enough food. About a quarter of the students said they skipped eating at least one day a week because of financial insecurity. 
Looming federal cuts could make things even more challenging. Karen Hynick, acting provost at CT State Community College, told lawmakers in September that about 6,000 students, or about 11% of the student body, were eligible for SNAP benefits — a program that’s at risk of being cut off after this month due to the federal government shutdown. 
And many students will face additional fees for the programs they’re enrolled in.
The Board of Regents also voted Thursday to add fees for specialized programs, including a $300 fee at Central for the college’s doctor of nurse anesthesia practice program and a $125 fee for the bachelors of nursing program.
Blanchard, CSCU’s CFO, said the fees would cover things like virtual reality software and equipment, as well as supplies like needles. 
Additional fees will also apply to several programs at Southern CT State, including a $100 fee for the social work bachelors program, a $300 fee for the social work masters program and $300 for the occupational therapy program. 
Lillian Wanjagi, Southern’s Chief Financial Officer, said at the Oct. 15 meeting that the masters in social work fee was connected to accreditation requirements, and the occupational therapy costs were connected to specialized tools used in the program. 
Southern CT State Interim President Sandra Bulmer said that the cost of social work programs had increased “dramatically” because of the necessary clinical placements.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023_1109_SR_AllinMilford_158-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-23 19:01:39.950344

(Photo by Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)Two days after a U.S. senator from South Dakota said he was encouraged by the desire of President Donald Trump to “do right” by American ranchers, Trump outraged many of them by rolling out a policy to import more beef from Argentina.
A White House official told Reuters on Thursday that the Trump administration will quadruple the amount of beef that can be imported from Argentina at a lower tariff rate. 
Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said in response to a reporter’s question at a White House briefing Thursday that Trump “loves our ranchers and he also loves American consumers, and he wants to do right by both.”
“So the immediate solution to the problem of the rising cost of beef — the president wants to bring that down — is we have to increase our supply, and so that’s what he’s doing with respect to these imports,” Leavitt said.

The policy announcement came amid a sudden and rapidly escalating feud between Trump and ranchers — many of whom are Trump supporters — after Trump said Sunday that buying more Argentinian beef would “bring our beef prices down.” The average price of ground chuck is up by more than $1 per pound so far this year.
U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, issued a statement Tuesday that he’d met with the president and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and came away “encouraged by the desire of President Trump and Secretary Rollins to do right by the American producer.”
Wednesday, as tempers flared against Trump in cattle country, the president posted on social media that “Cattle Ranchers, who I love, don’t understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States, including a 50% Tariff on Brazil,” adding “It would be nice if they would understand that.”
Thursday, after the news broke that Trump was following through on his suggestion to import more Argentinian beef, Rounds’ office did not offer a comment and told South Dakota Searchlight he was unavailable for an interview.  
Cattle industry representative calls action ‘ludicrous’
Ranchers and their trade-industry representatives in South Dakota, which has more than 3 million cattle and gave Trump 63% support in the last election, did not hold back.
Craig Bieber, vice president of the South Dakota Cattlemen’s Association, said the messaging from Trump landed hard. 
“This has all been a bit of a gut punch to producers. I mean, I really feel like producers are shocked because we’ve supported him consistently,” Bieber said. “We finally got prices that we can make some headway on, and it just seems ludicrous that President Trump thinks that now that we’re finally at good prices, he needs to do something about it.”
Senator ‘encouraged’ Trump will ‘do right’ amid backlash over Argentinian beef comments

U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-South Dakota, and seven of his House Republican colleagues sent a letter to Trump on Wednesday, urging the administration to ensure that any future trade decisions are made with “full transparency, sound science, and a firm commitment to the U.S. cattle industry.” 
“I understand the president’s efforts to strengthen trade and keep food affordable, but those efforts should not undermine the farmers and ranchers who put dinner on our tables,” Johnson said in a statement at the time. 
Thursday, Johnson’s office sent Searchlight an updated statement: “I’ve been public about my concerns with this plan. The best way to lower prices at the meat counter is through more American beef, not more Argentinian beef.”
Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, said Thursday that he is concerned and wants a say in how the import policy is implemented.
“We’re paying close attention to it, and we’ve been in touch with the White House, Department of Agriculture, U.S. trade rep on all this stuff, trying to figure out where it’s headed,” Thune told reporters, according to Reuters.
‘Suite of actions’ welcomed, but seen as insufficient
In addition to Trump’s social media post Wednesday, the White House announced what it called “a suite of actions to strengthen the American beef industry.” They include boosting access to federal grazing lands, expanding indemnity payments for livestock lost to predators, strengthening “Product of USA” labeling, increasing funding and loans for small meat processors, reducing inspection fees, encouraging schools to buy locally raised beef, and working to open additional export markets.
Rancher and South Dakota state Rep. Liz May, R-Kyle, said the proposals will help, but won’t solve all the problems in the cattle industry. 
“You can nibble around the edges, or you can go to the big issue: breaking up the monopoly structure that lets meatpackers dictate markets,” she said. “Restore true market competition.”
USDA announces plan to ‘strengthen’ beef industry

May said it’s simple: “Enforce the Packers and Stockyards Act and dust off the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Act.” The first law is designed to prevent unfair, deceptive and anti-competitive practices in the livestock and meatpacking industries, and the latter is intended to prevent monopolistic practices. 
“Do that and the rest will take care of itself,” she said. 
Amanda Radke, a rancher near Mitchell and co-owner of Radke Cattle Co., made similar observations while saying she is excited about a number of the Trump administration’s “suite of actions” to strengthen the beef industry. 
“We have a packer monopoly where 85% of our beef supply is held captive by four major players, two that are foreign-owned,” she said. “Ranchers don’t want a handout — they just want a free and fair market.”
Packer concentration, as many ranchers describe it, has worsened in recent decades. In 1980, the top four beef packers accounted for about 35% of cattle purchases. 
May, Radke and others in the industry have said greater imports of beef from Argentina are unlikely to push down retail prices.
“The packers will benefit from this, not consumers,” May said.
Parade-area rancher and Democratic former state lawmaker Oren Lesmeister said Trump’s comments on social media show an ignorance of cattle industry economics.


Let us know what you think...


 

Lesmeister said prices are high because cattle numbers have declined due to droughts, ranchers aging out of the business and other factors. The Agriculture Department’s own Wednesday announcement said the national herd is at a 75-year low while consumer demand for beef has grown 9% over the past decade. 
Lesmeister said he hopes ranchers take the moment to reflect and see that it’s Democratic politicians working to break up monopolies, not Trump. 
Lesmeister also said an unpredictable president who seems indifferent to the effects of his words on markets “makes it really tough to operate.” He said beef prices have traditionally been influenced by weather, production and the export market.
“Now, it doesn’t matter. It’s, ‘What’s the president going to say tomorrow?’” Lesmeister said. 
Soybean farmers also angry about Argentina aid
Ranchers aren’t the only members of the agriculture community upset with Trump’s efforts to help Argentina.
Trump has praised Argentina’s Libertarian president, Javier Milei, including at Mar-a-Lago last year and during a White House meeting this month. Trump has also pledged $20 billion worth of aid to bolster the country’s collapsing currency and has discussed increasing the figure to $40 billion. 
Meanwhile, Argentina and the U.S. are rival soybean producers, and Argentina is reportedly increasing its soybean exports to China while that country boycotts U.S. soybean purchases in retaliation for Trump-imposed tariffs.
National Farmers Union President Rob Larew said the Trump administration was already hurting American agricultural producers while helping Argentinians.
“The last thing we need is to reward them by importing more of their beef,” Larew said in a statement.

(Photo by Joshua Haiar/South Dakota Searchlight)A South Dakota couple want an Iowa carbon pipeline company to pay them for surveying their land against their will.
Jared and Tara Bossly, of rural Aberdeen, filed a trespassing lawsuit this week in Brown County against Summit Carbon Solutions and a handful of affiliated companies they say acted as agents of the company.
That Iowa-based company hopes to build a multi-state underground pipeline to collect carbon dioxide from ethanol plants for transport and sequestration. Fierce opposition to the project by some South Dakota landowners helped spur the ballot box repeal of a law seen as too friendly to pipeline companies in 2024 and to the passage of a law barring the use of eminent domain by carbon pipeline companies this year. Summit has also been denied a permit by South Dakota’s Public Utilities Commission.
Eminent domain is the right to access private property for projects that benefit the public, with compensation determined by a court.
The Bossly family, whose land was included in Summit’s original pipeline path, have been vocal opponents of Summit since 2022. The family was among several to sue Summit in an attempt to block it from using eminent domain to survey land or use it for the pipeline project.
The landowners won at the South Dakota Supreme Court level in August of 2023.
Court ruling complicates carbon pipeline company’s push for land

Two months before that, however, Summit arrived at the Bossly property to survey it. At that point, a circuit court judge had twice issued rulings allowing such surveys to take place, but the landowners had an appeal pending before the state’s high court.
In the Bosslys’ new lawsuit, the family says Summit’s actions on the day of the survey amounted to trespass because the company knew of the pending appeal.
The lawsuit says Jared Bossly was a “prisoner on his own land” as the surveying took place in June of 2023, because private security guards and sheriff’s deputies prevented him from being within 300 feet of the surveyors.
“I would never want anyone else to feel that way on their own land,” Bossly said in a press release on the lawsuit. “We are bringing this case in hopes a Brown County jury will do justice by finding Summit and the other defendants liable for what they did.”
The lawsuit seeks monetary damages for the June 2023 surveying, for what the case says was permanent property damage from drilling and surveying. The Bosslys are alleging the company trespassed, acted as a nuisance, and was negligent in training its employees.
The Bosslys are also seeking damages based on a visit to the Bossly farm in May of 2023, a day on which they say company representatives unlawfully entered an outbuilding while Jared Bossly was away and frightened his wife Tara Bossly by hollering into their house while she was inside taking a shower. 
A representative from Summit said the company does not comment on pending litigation.
Ed Fischbach, another vocal pipeline opponent who lives near the Bosslys, arrived at the Bossly farm before Jared on the day of the June survey. He said he hopes the case will “send the message that what Summit has done is wrong.”

Efforts to reconfigure the state’s legislative districts to adhere to county lines came to a halt Wednesday. 
The post Wyoming lawmakers hit pause on redrawing voting maps appeared first on WyoFile .","Wyoming lawmakers are pumping the brakes on efforts to redraw the state’s legislative district maps to match county lines. 
The Joint Reapportionment Subcommittee met virtually Wednesday to hear public comment and to discuss several proposals Weston County voters presented to lawmakers last month in Newcastle. 
Since 2022, when Wyoming redrew its legislative districts following the last census, some Weston County voters have argued they’re inadequately represented in the statehouse because their lawmakers also represent varying portions of surrounding counties. 
The subcommittee, however, chose not to recommend any of the proposals to the Joint Corporations, Elections and Political Subdivisions Committee for sponsorship in the 2026 budget session. Instead, the subcommittee chose to draft and forward a report to lawmakers to consider down the line. 
“We’re coming in on a recommendation here that the present system seems satisfactory for now, but we’re willing to put in more effort to keep looking,” Lander Republican Sen. Cale Case said at the virtual meeting. 
For decades, Wyoming’s legislative districts adhered to county lines, as specified in the state’s constitution. However, that legal requirement was upended in 1991 when a federal court ruled that Wyoming’s legislative maps violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution — also known as “one person, one vote.” 
Since then, the Legislature has shifted away from strict adherence to county boundaries and toward population. As a result, Weston County — one of the state’s least populated counties — is represented in the House and Senate by lawmakers who also speak for voters in certain parts of Campbell, Crook, Goshen and Niobrara. 
“It’s got to be a hard job for a senator to represent more than one community of interest in Wyoming at the same time, equally on all things,” Newcastle resident William Curley told the subcommittee in September. 
At that meeting, public testimony was nearly unanimous in its support for county conformity, though support varied on how exactly to achieve that. One proposal would involve weighted votes, while another would dramatically expand the number of lawmakers.

Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, who represents all of Crook County and the northern half of Weston County, attended the meeting in Newcastle. 
“Our ruralness is what, many times, makes us, I would say, makes us Wyoming,” Neiman said. 
Over the course of three terms in the Legislature, Neiman has ascended to Speaker of the House, the most powerful position in the lower chamber. Still, he and his constituents argue that “rural voices” are diminishing in Cheyenne. 
Wednesday meeting
The meeting this week offered a different perspective. 
“I am the Gorin of Gorin v Karpan,” Laramie resident Sarah Gorin told the committee. “I was unable to attend your first meeting, and so I asked to testify today just briefly to fill you in on some of the background of that case and to speak for the basic fairness of the principle of one person, one vote.”
In 1991, Gorin was lead plaintiff in the case that would ultimately result in a U.S. District Court directing the Legislature to disregard the provision in the Wyoming Constitution that required each county to constitute a senatorial and representative district.
“While there can be little doubt that many Wyoming counties possess a sense of identity, a sense of neighborhood, and a sense of community interests, the bottom line is that citizens and not governmental units or regional interests are entitled to elect lawmakers,” according to a section of the ruling Gorin read to the committee. 
The ruling has held up, including in a 2012 legal challenge, according to a Legislative Service Office memo. In that case, the court ruled that the plaintiffs presented no evidence that county-based districts resulted in different electoral rights compared to those drawn based on population.  
Gorin told the committee that lawmakers are treading into similar territory. 
“We haven’t yet heard a description of a problem that is so big that we need to turn the entire legislative system on its head and embark on something that is almost guaranteed to engender litigation,” Gorin said. 
A New Jersey resident, who provided virtual testimony, was the one person at Wednesday’s meeting to urge Wyoming lawmakers forward.
“I know many of you might be thinking, ‘What brings a 26-year-old New Jerseyian all the way to Wyoming to testify about apportionment?’ The answer is the same reason I testified in my home state, which was to ensure that our state constitutions are followed as faithfully as possible,” Todd Lund Jr. told the committee. 
Lund works as a policy director for Paul Kanitra, a Republican New Jersey Assemblyman, according to his LinkedIn.  
While the panel did not proceed with legislation, the door’s not entirely closed on redrawing the state’s legislative lines. Individual lawmakers could bring their own bills, though such knotty legislation is likely to face significant challenges during a budget session when time is limited and bills face a steeper, initial hurdle. 
The 2026 session starts Feb. 9.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)An 18-year-old Des Moines Public Schools student was detained and deported by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to an immigrant rights group.
The student, whose name was not released, had attended a routine immigration check-in at the Federal Building in Des Moines on Sept. 30, according to advocates with the Iowa Migrant Movement for Justice, and was detained by ICE officials at the building briefly before being taken to the Hardin County Jail in Eldora.
After being transferred to the Iowa jail, the student was later sent to a detention center in Louisiana before being deported to a Central American country, according to the advocacy group. Iowa MMJ did not respond to further questions about the student’s immigration status or background; though the Des Moines Register reported his guardian was not able to speak with him for four days following his detainment, and then did not hear from him until Oct. 12, when he had been deported.
DMPS officials said in a statement shared with media that the school district was “aware that one of our high school students was detained by federal immigration authorities late last month.”
“This situation did not occur on or near school property,” The statement said. “We understand that news like this can cause concern among our students, families, and staff. Our schools are committed to being safe, welcoming places for every student with principals, teachers and staff who care about their well-being.”
The news of the DMPS student’s deportation comes after the school district has faced the high-profile arrest of former superintendent Ian Roberts, a native of Guyana who was also arrested and detained by ICE officials in late September. Since his arrest, information has been released through reporting and federal authorities showing Roberts was given an order of removal by an immigration judge in May 2024, and faced previous criminal charges.
The Des Moines school board is suing the consulting firm JG Consulting contracted for the search that led to Roberts’ hire. Additionally, Iowa Auditor Rob Sand has said his office has received requests to reaudit DMPS, as well as audit the Iowa Department of Education and state Board of Educational Examiners which granted Roberts’ an administrative license in 2023, in relation to the situation.
There have been several other ICE arrests in Iowa in recent weeks. According to reporting from the New York Times, immigration arrests have increased by 276% in Iowa since President Donald Trump has taken office compared with rates in 2024.
Another immigrant rights group, Escucha Mi Voz, held demonstrations in Davenport Monday in Iowa City calling for workers’ protections against ICE raids, and in Davenport protesting the detainment of Jorge González, a worker at the Bread Garden Market in Iowa City who was detained by ICE agents Sept. 25.
“We will not stand by while ICE unlawfully targets our communities,” Escucha Mi Voz Iowa member Eva Castro, González’s mother-in-law, said in a statement. “Jorge complied with every condition of the asylum process and Alternatives to Detention program. We are going to court to make sure he walks free.”

With the Legislature set to consider statewide school redistricting efforts this coming session, some school boards and supervisory unions are pushing to set their own course.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  A southern Vermont school district will weigh whether to close two elementary schools.","Danby, Mt. Tabor and Sunderland residents could soon see their community elementary schools shutter. On Tuesday, residents of the three towns will vote in a non-binding referendum over whether to close the Sunderland and Currier Memorial schools.
The Taconic and Green School District oversees four elementary schools and an elementary-middle school for nine towns including Manchester. Residents will vote by Australian ballot on Oct. 28. The district board will then have the final say on closing the two schools during its Nov. 4 meeting.
The board will need 10 of its 13 members to vote in favor of closure — a rule that was enacted during the 2017 merger and creation of the Taconic and Green School District under Act 46. Taconic and Green school board chair Melanie Virgilio, of Sunderland, said the board will consider the results of the referendum but is not bound by them.

“We’ll vote however the entirety of the board chooses to vote in November, but we’ll be given the results, and we’ll have to consider that,” she said. “It’s a huge consideration for board members.”
The move to consolidate the southern Vermont school district’s facilities comes amid declining enrollment and persistent costs to repair and maintain aging infrastructure at the schools — a common dilemma for school districts across the state.
The Bennington-Rutland Supervisory Union, which encompasses the Taconic and Green, the Mettawee and Winhall school districts, is also simultaneously developing plans for a regional middle school. Superintendent Randi Lowe said she expects the supervisory union will request voter approval in the spring or summer of 2026 to bid for that work.
“We’re moving to consolidation, just because we don’t need as many schools as we’ve got,” she said. “We want to update our facilities, because, just like everybody in the state, we’re facing really, really aging facilities.”
The supervisory union pays tuition to send its high school-aged students out of the district, many to two nearby private schools, Burr and Burton Academy in Manchester and the Long Trail School in Dorset.
Both the Sunderland School and Currier Memorial School in Danby, which respectively serve grades K-6 and pre-K through 5, currently have fewer than 50 students at each school. The closures are necessary, district officials say, to give all of the kids in the district’s schools equal learning opportunities.
The district’s other schools — the Flood Brook School in Londonderry, the Dorset School and the Manchester Elementary-Middle School — each have 30 to 40 kids per grade, and Virgilio said those schools enjoy more robust programming. Staff at the Sunderland and Currier Memorial schools, meanwhile, have a difficult time providing the same resources, which creates an “inequity of opportunity” for students in the smaller schools.
“There’s just so few kids that they’re not really able to build learning communities,” Virgilio said. “That just is inequitable as a district. If there are kids in the district that are having access to this kind of elevated level of programming and then the smaller schools aren’t, that’s not really fair.”
If the school district board votes to approve the closure, both schools would shutter on July 1, 2026. The remaining students at the two schools would transfer to the Dorset Elementary School, while the district would shift all of its seventh and eighth grade students from the Dorset School to the Manchester Elementary-Middle School, Lowe said.

Getting ahead
The move to close the two schools, and the plans to build a regional middle school, represent a microcosm of sorts of the changes currently underway on the state level.
Act 73, the education reform bill signed into law in July, has set Vermont on a course to transform its public education system and rework how the state pays for it. But the first step is to consolidate the state’s 119 school districts and 52 supervisory unions into anywhere from 10 to 25 future districts.
The school redistricting task force is currently working to create no more than three possible map configurations for the Legislature to consider, and will meet again on Monday.
While Act 73 has a ways to go before its full implementation, its effects are already being felt. Future ramifications in the law around class size minimums and other provisions are pushing school districts like Taconic and Green to try and exert control over their future. 
More than a dozen school districts in the last two months have written letters to the state’s redistricting task force to convey their preferences around merging.
In the Bennington-Rutland Supervisory Union, the reorganization efforts serve as a preemptive step to get ahead of the consolidation efforts underway at the state level, its superintendent said.
The state’s push to reform its education system, Lowe said, provides “a greater context that says, ‘Hey, this is the right thing for our community, no matter what.'”
“As far as I’m concerned, we know we spend a lot of money on education,” she said. “We are an operationally inefficient state, and we are an expensive state.”
“If we can stabilize our programming for our students and be as efficient as possible with our budget, then we have an opportunity to really make the best decisions for our community, independent of what the state does or doesn’t do,” Lowe said.

Urging caution
Not everyone appears to be on board with the plans. At one of several recent community forums, residents expressed fears that closure of the schools could have a wider impact on their communities. Without schools, why would young families settle in their town?
But residents also expressed a sense of futility that there was little they could do to influence the process — both at the local level and on the state level, according to reporting from the Bennington Banner.
Sandy Pinsonault, R-Dorset, who represents some of the areas that would be affected by the closures, said she hoped that the Taconic and Green school board would “weigh the opinions and concerns of their stakeholders carefully.”
“I think it’s difficult for most people to wrap their minds around the complete picture and how it will affect their families,” she said in an email.
She specifically pointed to uncertainties and “variables” at the state level. The Legislature will ultimately need to vote to approve a new school district map. Without that, much of the provisions in Act 73 would not move forward.
Pinsonault urged caution, and said the board should follow the results of the public referendum. 
“If support is low, the board should pause and regroup,” she wrote. “If support is high, I would recommend deferring any formal action until after the legislative session and committees complete their work.”
Nonetheless, school district leaders point to the uncertainty around what the Legislature will decide as a reason to move forward.
Act 73 sets parameters around class size minimums, requiring at least 12 students in grades 2 through 5, for example — below the current enrollment at the Sunderland and Currier Memorial schools.
District members and community members also fear the district could lose access to their school choice system.
“There’s every reason to believe that when the state reconfigures our boards, that a new board will be forced to close the schools anyway,” Virgilio, the school district chair, said. 
The Taconic and Green board can at least move forward now with some community input, but they can’t guarantee the same with the state’s reconfiguration.
“There is a protectionist methodology to this,” she said. “If we do this now and come together, it hopefully fortifies the boundaries of our district.”

(Photo via Google Earth)State officials have cited an Oskaloosa nursing home where a resident died after the staff couldn’t locate a crash cart, forgot to summon an ambulance and failed to realize the resident had standing orders in place for CPR to be administered.
The Oskaloosa Care Center, a 76-resident nursing home in Mahaska County, has been cited by the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing with failing to carry out cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or CPR, in accordance with a resident’s wishes, and for workers’ inability to locate the facility’s crash cart, which had a defibrillator on board for restoring a patient’s heartbeat in cases of cardiac arrest.
According to the state agency, these failures placed residents of the home in immediate jeopardy.

State inspectors allege that on the morning of Sept. 8, 2025, a certified nursing assistant and registered nurse entered a male resident’s room and found the man slumped over in his recliner and in distress – gasping, sweating profusely and stating he needed to sit.
According to the inspectors’ reports, one of the workers left the room to obtain equipment to check the man’s vital signs, at which point the man’s eyes rolled back in his head as if he was having a seizure.
The director of nursing arrived in the room and instructed a licensed practical nurse to call an ambulance and verify the resident’s “code status,” which would indicate whether the resident either had a do-not-resuscitate, or DNR, order in place, or wished to have potentially lifesaving measures, such as CPR, administered.
After one worker left the room to check the resident’s code status, a nurse communicated over a two-way radio that the resident had a do-not-resuscitate order in place. The staff then concluded the resident was dead and began to clean and clothe the body for the family’s viewing, according to inspectors.
While one worker began the process of contacting the resident’s family, she noticed in the resident’s chart that the man was listed as “full code” — indicating life-saving procedures were to have been performed. She then reviewed other records and confirmed that information.
According to state inspectors, the staff elected not to perform CPR at that point due to the man’s lack of responsiveness, ashen color, blotchy skin and lack of a pulse.
A certified nursing assistant later told inspectors that shortly after the resident was found in distress, two of her co-workers began looking for the home’s crash cart but could not find it. The aide told inspectors she was able to locate the cart, noting that it was marked with a sign that read “AED,” for automated external defibrillator.
According to the inspectors, the CNA noted that for residents designated “full code,” there was supposed to be a green sticker on the outside of their door — adding that there was such a sticker in this case, but it was located on the roommate’s side of the door, so the staff presumed the resident who died had a DNR order in place.
The director of nursing allegedly told inspectors the resident’s door did not contain the correct sticker due to a recent room change, adding that she would have started CPR had she known the man was “full code” but believed she could trust the information given to her by the nurse.
It was later determined that no one had ever called the ambulance and, according to inspectors, the worker who was tasked with that responsibility explained she “forgot to call” while searching for the crash cart.
As a result of the incident, the inspections department proposed, but then held in a suspension, a $10,000 fine. The state fine is being held in suspension so that the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services can determine whether a federal penalty should be imposed in its place.
Fine proposed for separate incident
The inspections department also proposed, and held in suspension, a fine for a separate incident involving the staff’s failure to adequately respond to a lethargic female resident’s complaints of chest pain. The resident was later taken to a hospital where it was determined she had suffered a heart attack.
Workers at the home allegedly told inspectors they had reported the resident’s worsening condition to a nurse. The nurse, they said, “dismissed” their concerns, “acted like it was no big deal,” and then asserted the resident was merely “playing possum.”
According to inspectors, when they later interviewed the nurse and asked whether she thought she should have notified the woman’s physician of the situation, the nurse refused to answer.
State records provide conflicting information as the size of the suspended fine stemming from that incident, with some of the records stating $9,000 and some stating $9,500.

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — In shadows of the massive Holcomb coal-fired power plant in southwest Kansas, researchers with the Kansas Geological Survey installed solar panels to test a theory about generating electricity on underused corners of center-pivot irrigated crop fields.
The experiment would blend interests of corn, sorghum and soybean farmers and address goals of renewable energy enthusiasts. The idea would be to supplement irrigated crops while producing solar energy on adjacent ground and collecting moisture with gutters affixed to solar panels so water could be directed to the underground aquifer.
“What we hypothesize is that these systems could enhance groundwater recharge, generate substantial amounts of energy, reduce the climate footprint of agriculture while simultaneously providing economic benefits to the farm without displacing any production agriculture,” said Sam Zipper, assistant scientist at KGS and a geologist at KU.
He estimated adding solar panels to corners of 110 center-pivot fields could match production of electricity at the Holcomb plant.
The project was part of an $880,000 grant from the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research’s program known as Seeding Solutions. It involves KU, Kansas State University, Michigan State University and Wheatland Electric Cooperative.
Zipper shared the integrated vision Thursday at the 2025 Kansas Economic Policy Conference at KU, “Ripple Effect: Water and the Kansas Economy.”
Other researchers delved into research on minimizing algae blooms tainting Kansas reservoirs that are key to supplying the state with drinking water and on development of plans for delivery of quality water in quantities necessary for the state’s well-being.
Donna Ginther, director of the KU Institute for Policy and Social Research, delivered a primer on the Kansas agriculture economy and its reliance on water access. Cattle prices, given a national beef shortage, continued to rise at the same time market prices of wheat, corn and sorghum tumbled.
In the past three years, she said, the price of sorghum fell 61%, the value of wheat declined 53% and the price paid for corn slumped 44%. China, traditionally a key destination for U.S. soybeans, has refused to purchase any in wake of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. Many countries responded with tariffs of their own.
“A lot of this is retaliatory tariffs,” Ginther said. “If there are retaliatory tariffs, and there’s not international demand for Kansas products, those markets don’t necessarily come back. Sorting out the tariff situation is going to be really important to the ag economy going forward.”

Water policy development
Susan Metzger, director of the Kansas Water Institute at Kansas State, said water was a public good that warranted public investment.
“Water is the backbone to the rural Kansas economy. It’s in all of our best interests, no matter where we live in the state, that we invest in securing the future of that water supply,” Metzger said.
She said leadership of Kansas water policy was shared among the Kansas Water Office, Kansas Water Authority, Kansas Department of Agriculture, Kansas Department of Health and Environment, as well as the Kansas Legislature and governor. The Legislature approved a two-year study of water issues, with the final report due in January 2027.
“With the organization we have, it makes it really hard to find your elbow room if you have a new idea,” Metzger said. “It’s really confusing to figure out whose space is whose, but nobody has really figured out the best reorganization strategy that would make it more efficient.”
Paul Johnson, a farmer serving as policy analyst for the Kansas Rural Center, said the conference ought to be used as a catalyst for a comprehensive debate about the state’s water resources. He said Kansas’ local, state and federal officials had to recognize the result of federal Farm Bill policy delivering $1.3 billion annually in payments to farmers. Those payments incentivize wheat, corn, sorghum and soybeans, he said.
He said about 5,300 farmers in Kansas were responsible for irrigating 2.3 million acres of crops and consuming an estimated two-thirds of the state’s water. In addition, he said, commitment to these crops led to farming practices that washed away topsoil that eventually became sediment in reservoirs central to Kansas’ water supply.
“The Farm Bill drives cropping patterns in Kansas,” Johnson said. “We have to have a meaningful debate.”
He said Kansas policymakers had to accept that too many water rights were issued to landowners from the 1940s to 1980s. Excessive deployment of water rights fueled withdrawal of too much water from the Ogallala Aquifer, which has been in decline for decades. It could be time for the state to determine whether water rights were legally a property right and if the state was willing to buy back a portion of water rights, he said.
Katie Durham, manager of Western Kansas Groundwater Management District No. 1, said compelling top-down changes to use of water by Kansas agriculture could backfire.
“The producers want it to be a local solution,” she said. “The producers want it to be something they come up with.”
 
Urban water priorities
Hays city manager Toby Dougherty, who presides over the only major city in Kansas without an adequate local source of water, said the Legislature ought to come to the aid of Hays. In 1995, Hays bought a 7,000-acre parcel about 70 miles south of the city that included 8,000 acre feet of water rights. The city of Russell, which has also been susceptible to drought, bought an 18% stake in that property.
In 2014, Dougherty was authorized by the two city governments to begin the regulatory process of converting those water rights to municipal use. That triggered an 11-year legal and regulatory conflict tied to the Kansas Water Transfer Act, which outlined the oversight process for transfer of more than 2,000 acre feet of water rights a distance greater than 35 miles.
He said the Legislature ought to repeal the statute because it improperly interfered in Hays and Russell securing a reliable water supply.
“If you have time, Google ‘pipeline map of Kansas’ and look at the amount of oil and gas pipelines we have across Kansas moving commodities,” he said. “Look at a train as it goes by next time. Look at all the grain cars on that train. When you see trucks going down the road, look at the cattle and the beef in those trucks. Yet somehow, when two cities, who are trying to provide water for the future, want to move that water more than 35 miles, we are kind of treated as a foreign actor.”
Gary Janzen, director of public works and utilities in Wichita, said more research should be conducted in purification systems that result in water safe for human consumption.
“Our goal is to lead the way on developing state regulations,” he said. “Right now, Kansas doesn’t have anything in place. It’s a big lift. It’s a big ask, we recognize that. But from a policy perspective we’re hoping to have that in place soon as we can. It’s not for everybody. It’s expensive. There’s a lot of issues of public outreach. Those regulations need to be in place before any of that happens.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Paul-Johnson-Katie-Durham-Susan-Metzger-water-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-23 19:01:39.950344

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) As federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is days away from running out, food banks, pantries and charitable groups across Iowa are bracing for what they anticipate will be “unprecedented” need. 
SNAP serves around than 270,000 Iowans each month and is a federally supported program. But as politicians in Washington, D.C., squabble over budget decisions that determine when the government will reopen, food banks across the state have been asked to support hungry Iowans when current federal funding ends on Nov. 1.
Despite the daunting task ahead, food bank officials have said they are determined to continue their mission to keep folks fed. That mission, they said, can be supported by everyday Iowans via donations of time, funds, nonperishable goods and advocacy to members of Congress. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“There is literally no precedent for this,” said Kathy Underhill, the CEO of Des Moines Area Religious Council, or DMARC. “I wish that there was, because that would make it a lot easier for us to predict what we think is going to happen next … In the history of the SNAP program, benefits have never been delayed or not issued, ever.” 
The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services said earlier this month the federal Food and Nutrition Services department instructed states not to issue November SNAP benefits. HHS, in the same news release, said it informed food banks and community organizations to “prepare to provide additional support to impacted Iowans.”
Food banks across the state said they hope the shutdown will end before benefits run out, but will work to keep Iowans fed. That mission, they said, will require creativity and additional support from every community.
Aron Brecht, the community food systems manager with Hawkeye Area Community Action Program, or HACAP, a food bank serving eastern Iowa, said there is no “wrong way” for Iowans to help the sector.
“If you have not given time, or given money, or given food and have always been interested, please allow this to be a scenario where you do that,” Brecht said. “Food banks who provide food to food pantries and meal sites — anybody that’s opening up to help their community right now — we’re all going to need some more help.”
The stakes 
The charitable sector, according to Feeding America, is able to provide one meal to every nine meals provided by SNAP dollars. 
“I want to be really clear that nonprofits cannot replace SNAP benefits,” Underhill with DMARC, said Thursday at a press conference. 
In Polk County alone, where DMARC serves, 50,000 residents receive SNAP benefits. According to DMARC, about half of those recipients are children and seniors. 
While food bank and pantry leaders each said the situation was “unprecedented” they also said they plan to do everything they can to meet the need in their communities. 
“Regardless of what the future holds we will be here, and we’ll be prepared to help meet the need,” Underhill said. “… if you’re one of our neighbors who is losing sleep about how you and your household will be able to get by, please know that there’s a network here to help you.”


Food security vocabulary: 
Food bank: is a broader coalition that transports large quantities of food within a given region. There are six main food banks serving Iowa.
Food pantry: the drive-by windows, charitable closets,  free grocery store setups and the like that serve individuals experiencing hunger. 
SNAP eligibility: The gross income limit for SNAP eligibility in Iowa is 160% of the federal poverty level, which is $25,040 for a single individual or $51,440 for a family of four.


In addition to stocking food pantries, food banks are often involved in after school and weekend feeding programs that help keep children fed when schools are closed.
Barb Prather, executive director for Northeast Iowa Food Bank, said these programs, along with mobile food pantries, are some of the most important programs her food bank does to serve rural communities. 
The word “unprecedented” was used consistently to describe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Prather said the current situation feels “worse to some degree” because during the pandemic there were additional resources available for food banks to tap into. 
“Food banks can’t make up the difference in SNAP or WIC or any of those government programs, but we at the Northeast Iowa Food Bank have a commitment to feed people, and we’ll do everything in our power to be able to hopefully meet that commitment and encourage communities to rise up and help us in doing that,” Prather said. 
Stephanie Sullivan, the assistant director of communications and marketing for Food Bank for the Heartland, which serves western Iowa and eastern Nebraska, said the impact of the shutdown will have “ripple” effects for thousands of people in her region, for months to come.
“We know that our neighbors are already making unthinkable decisions whether they choose between going to the grocery store or paying their medical bills and no one should be forced into that decision,” Sullivan said. 
Beyond the food security sector, SNAP has an economic multiplier factor of up to 1.5, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Under that multiplier, the estimated $45 million in SNAP dollars spent in Iowa each month generates nearly $70 million in economic activity. 
The timing of the shutdown also follows historic cuts to the SNAP program from the Republican-led “one big beautiful” law, which a nonpartisan government analysis estimates will cut 20% of funding to the program through 2034. 
It’s estimated the cuts will result in a loss of $50 million in funding for the program in Iowa for 2026, with greater losses in subsequent years. 


Women, Infants and Children program 
While the Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, program was originally slated to run out of funds early into the government shutdown, the U.S. Department of Agriculture authorized $300 million into the program to keep it operational through the end of October.


Sullivan said the cuts to SNAP while her food bank faces historic need makes it feel like the food bank is “climbing an uphill battle” to deploy its mission. 
“Because we haven’t seen a need this high in our history, on top of all the other challenges we’re facing, this is a hunger epidemic, what we’re facing right now,” Sullivan said.
Three ways to help 
Underhill with DMARC, which is the largest food pantry in Des Moines, said the pantry is increasing its food on hand by about 25% and remaining in contact with partners across the metro to “ensure that there are no interruptions in daily service.” 
According to Underhill, the pantry has no intentions to limit the amount of food it guarantees to visitors, nor to alter its services. 
Brecht with HACAP said need increases in the food sector any time there is a real or perceived threat to benefits. He said partners in his region have said their communities are already preparing for that lapse in benefits to occur. For SNAP recipients, that might mean trying to stretch their October allotments, or making an extra trip to the food pantry. 
“We’re purchasing more food in anticipation for any sort of expanded shutdown to try to at least bolster our inventory and do our best to meet whatever need comes through the next week, month, etc.” Brecht said. 
Brecht said eligible Iowans can continue to sign up for SNAP, and he said they also should keep their electronic benefits cards — even if the shutdown persists into November — so that funds can be distributed quickly when they do become available.

Brecht and the other food bank officials pointed to advocacy as one of the most important ways that Iowans can help during this time. 
“Local, state, federally elected officials all need that education from folks that are that are concerned and folks that are either utilizing programs or have some insight,” Brecht said.
Gov. Kim Reynolds singled out congressional Democrats Thursday morning in a news release and called on her opposing party to end the shutdown before it caused “disruption” to SNAP benefits. 
“Because SNAP is fully funded and operated by the federal government, states are unable to step in and keep it running,” Reynolds said in the release. “But this issue could be resolved today if Senate Democrats would vote to reopen the government. If they continue to refuse, they’ll be choosing to put low-income American families at risk.” 
Republicans and Democrats in D.C. continue to be at odds and stalemate on key bills that would reopen the government. 
In addition to calling for an end to the shutdown, Reynolds directed Iowa HHS to remain in “regular contact” with Iowa food banks about their current inventories and abilities to increase distribution if necessary. 
“Our focus in Iowa will be on understanding the needs of food banks and pantries across the state and applying what we learned during the pandemic to support SNAP households if benefits are delayed,” Reynolds said. 
Prather with Northeast Iowa Food Bank said the state has been a “great partner” in the past and she appreciates the governor’s actions. 
“It takes all of us to make a difference in the lives of people in Iowa, not only private but also public support in that as well,” Prather said. “I’m optimistic that we’ll be able to work with her to help alleviate the need if the government continues to be closed.”
As Underhill put it, “many hands make light work.” In addition to calling and emailing congressional leaders, food bank leaders said Iowans can also volunteer at their local food pantries to help pack and organize donations, or they can make monetary or nonperishable food item donations.

While all donations are appreciated, the food bank leaders said monetary donations are especially prioritized because food banks and pantries have wholesale partnerships that allow them to spread each dollar further. 
If an organization is planning to host a food drive, or someone wants to donate food items instead, Underhill said things like canned goods, peanut butter, rice, boxed pasta, cereal, canned chicken and dried beans are some of the most useful items to donate. 
Other food banks echoed the same sentiments and said they are doing all they can to beef up their warehouses in anticipation of the need. 
Annette Hacker, communications manager for Food Bank of Iowa said while the food bank has “sound financial footing,” its resources are “not unlimited.” 
“We really can’t continue at the rate we’re going with purchased food,” Hacker said. “That said … we’ve been here a long time and will continue to be here, but we’re going to have to get more and more creative on how we source that food, how we deliver that food, how we fundraise. It is a very very challenging time.”

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
The Vermont Department for Children and Families said Wednesday it was directed by the federal government earlier this month to pause food stamp distribution for November due to the continued shutdown in Washington, D.C. State officials said Thursday that they’re rushing to deliver stopgaps for food and heating assistance.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture informed Vermont and other states in recent weeks that it did not have sufficient funds during the shutdown to operate its Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through November. U.S. Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. and Peter Welch, D-Vt. co-signed a letter Wednesday calling on the USDA to use tools the legislators say are available to protect the program past the end of the month.

“Due to the current lack of funding, Vermonters receiving benefits are encouraged to plan ahead,” said the Wednesday release from the Vermont Department for Children and Families, which administers 3SquaresVT, the state’s nutrition assistance program.
The department said it could not provide further information on Thursday, and encouraged benefit recipients to “contact their local food shelves and community resources.”
As the federal stalemate wears on, state officials are focusing on how they can get funds to households relying on food stamps, as well as heating benefits, if the shutdown continues into November. So far, plans are not finalized, but lawmakers say state-funded stopgap measures for those benefits could be active by mid-November.
Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, who chairs the legislature’s Joint Fiscal Committee, said she and her colleagues have been “doing everything we can to guarantee” that Vermonters are able to receive state funds to buy groceries.
“As someone who’s been on food stamps and gotten (heat assistance) dollars … I understand how scary it is to just read that everything’s going to be shut off without any information,” Kornheiser said.
The state’s Emergency Board — a body that includes the governor and heads of four legislative committees that manage public money — will be meeting to determine a solution next week, lawmakers said. 
Sen. Andrew Perchlik, D/P-Washington, who serves on the Emergency Board as the head of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said he’s “confident that money will go out.”
What’s less certain, he said, is whether it will be the full amount of the original benefit, given the state has “little confidence” of federal reimbursement. Perchlik and House leaders expressed support Thursday for fully funded state coverage of 3SquaresVT.
Amanda Wheeler, a spokesperson for the governor, said Thursday that the Scott administration will be presenting a plan to the Emergency Board in the coming days that “we hope they approve.”
Kornheiser said she has also been working to ensure that Low Income Heat Energy Assistance Program funds, which provide support to Vermonters during the cold winter months, will continue as normal. She expects the program, which like SNAP may see an absence of its normal influx of federal money, to be paid out as normal using state funds.
Rep. Theresa Wood, D-Waterbury, said the electronic benefit cards used to dispense the benefits are federally controlled, which adds to the complexity of the state’s challenge. 
“It’s not an unlimited amount of levers that we can pull,” Wood said. But like Kornheiser, she expressed cautious confidence about the state’s ability to get support to those in need, even if unusual means of dispensing funds become necessary.
Vermont’s 3SquaresVT program costs about $12 million each month, according to documents released last week by the state’s Legislative Joint Fiscal Office.
Ivy Enoch, the policy and advocacy director at Hunger Free Vermont, called the USDA’s messaging a “manufactured crisis.” In an open letter Thursday morning, Enoch’s organization called on Gov. Phil Scott to urge the USDA to keep SNAP benefits flowing into November.
“People are wondering how they’re going to buy groceries next week,” Enoch said, adding that the absence of federal cashflow will also hurt the state’s food vendors and broader economy.
“These are folks that don’t have the ability to simply plan ahead for an issue like this,” State Treasurer Mike Pieciak said Thursday. The vast majority of Vermonters who receive food stamps are older, have disabilities, or live in households with children, he said.
“We have the money,” Pieciak said, referencing money that Vermont has set aside to fill gaps in federal funding. “We just have to have a plan.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)NORTH CHARLESTON — On the wall at the front of Sydney Carroll’s classroom is a blue cutout reading “100%.”
The meaning is twofold: It’s a reminder to her eighth grade class that they should be giving 100% to their classwork, but it’s also a reminder to herself that she’s trying to get 100% of her students to read on grade level by the end of the year.
The more students Carroll moves toward that goal, the bigger her end-of-year bonus will be.
Carroll, who teaches English at Meeting Street’s Brentwood elementary and middle school, was one of 526 teachers across 39 schools to receive an Excellence in Teaching Award this year, totaling more than $4.6 million for kindergarten through eighth grade teachers whose students showed improvement and proficiency on end-of-year math and reading tests.
The average bonus totaled $8,800, according to Beemok Education in Charleston, which runs the program for many of the schools.
The pay-for-performance model has expanded since its 2021 inception in Charleston County to dozens of schools. The program’s leaders see it as a way of rewarding the best teachers and keeping them in the classroom. They want to see it expand to even more schools, using a mixture of private and public funds.

Carroll, who is in her sixth year of teaching, knew her students did well last year. She saw how hard they worked throughout the year, and their end-of-year test results reflected that.
Still, Carroll wasn’t expecting the phone call notifying her she won the year’s top award winner. Her prize: $57,250.
“I’m a teacher,” Carroll said. “I’ve never heard that amount — or even close to it.”
She cried when she heard the number.
She got used to living paycheck to paycheck, never saving more than a couple thousand dollars at a time. The lump sum was more than her annual salary for the first few years she spent teaching, she said.
Her bonus is more than the salary of many teachers across the state. This year, teachers can make no less than $48,500. Under the state-paid salary schedule, teachers with a bachelor’s degree don’t surpass $57,000 until their 18th year in the classroom.
With the bonus, Carroll, who is also a full-time graduate student, paid for a semester of school in cash, paid off debt, and saved the rest, she said.
She saw the bonus as a reflection of how much work she put into getting her students on grade level, including early mornings rehearsing lesson plans with principal Roger Michael and after-school grading sessions with friends.
Just 7% of Carroll’s 75 students, spread out across multiple classes throughout the day, were reading at an eighth grade level when they started last school year. By the end of the year, 45% were on grade level, with her students gaining, on average, about two years of progress.
‘What they deserve’
On a recent rainy Friday, Carroll told her students to grab their pencils and turn their attention to the front of the room.
“Alrighty, eighth grade,” Carroll said to start a reading assignment. Heads looked up from the poems students were reading to watch her.
“I love today,” Carroll continued. “It’s a challenge for us today, for sure, and that is OK, because that means we’re going to learn something.”
Fridays, especially one with a challenging lesson headed into a four-day weekend, can be tough, Carroll said. But her class remained rapt with attention as Carroll displayed one student’s responses to questions about the poem “This Is Just To Say” by William Carlos Williams, a personal favorite of the teacher’s.
Carroll asked her students: What was Williams literally saying in his poem? How did he change the style? What could the reader learn?
Carroll didn’t give the correct answers. During the two minutes the eighth graders had to read and analyze a poem, Carroll roamed the room, asking struggling students more questions to help them think about the assignment in a different way.

That’s what Carroll calls the “productive struggle,” and it’s what helps her students succeed, she said.
Reading, for them, is not just about seeing the words on the page but about constantly thinking and asking themselves questions. Her class moves at a quick clip, never giving students a moment to get bored.
“If I just stand up there and I’m like, ‘OK, so here are all the rules of poetry normally,’ none of them are doing the thinking,” Carroll later told the SC Daily Gazette.
Knowing she might get a bonus at the end of the year is not the reason Carroll wants to be a great teacher, she said.
The reason she gets to school over an hour before doors open, the reason she rehearses lesson plans with her principal, the reason she printed out the “100%” that hangs over her whiteboard, is because she sees how smart and hard-working her students are, and she wants to help them thrive.
Her bonus was a reflection of the time and effort she was already putting into her work, she said. But the idea of extra cash totaling tens of thousands of dollars is an extra incentive for her and other teachers to dig even deeper and work even harder, she said.
“Everyone’s really hungry,” Carroll said. “Everyone’s hungry to succeed for themselves and for the kiddos. That’s what they deserve.”
Bonuses
Brentwood was one of the original four “schools of innovation” to offer the bonuses in 2021. The program started in Meeting Street Schools, neighborhood schools that operate under a public-private partnership in an effort to give low-income students the support they need to succeed.
Since then, the approach has expanded, with 75 schools across the state offering bonuses using various funding sources.
The four Meeting Street Schools, along with 22 high-poverty elementary schools in Charleston County School District, receive funding from philanthropist Ben Navarro, who supports various education initiatives through Beemok Education.
That includes Brentwood, where more than 87% of students live in poverty.
Using federal funds, the state Department of Education began offering performance-based bonuses at schools in Allendale in Williamsburg counties, which the department manages, during the 2023-2024 school year. The state’s program grew to 37 schools last school year, with the help of $5 million from legislators, the department announced in March.
More K-12 teachers in SC can earn bonuses in $5M pilot program

Of the 34 schools added, 11 chose to use Beemok’s model, which compares students’ scores on district-level tests taken at the beginning and end of the school year. That model looks at both student growth and proficiency, rewarding teachers for how many grade levels their students advance in a single year and for how many students start testing on par with the grade they are in, according to their test results, said Josh Bell, president of Beemok Education.
Other schools opted to use results on state-standardized math and reading tests that every third- through eighth-grade student takes in the spring or create their own model to measure growth.
With another $5 million in the current year’s budget, the state-run pilot program could continue to expand. The Department of Education has not yet said where that money will go or released the results of its first year of the program.
Interest in expanding the program is there, Bell said. The Beemok Education-run program is continuing to grow, though a final number of schools eligible for the current school year is not yet finalized, he said. More than 110 schools applied for the state-run program last year, according to the Department of Education.
Whether state legislators continue to offer the bonuses will depend on what those results look like, said Rep. Neal Collins, an Easley Republican who sits on the House budget-writing panel for K-12 education.
“As with any new pilot program, I’d like to see the impact it has before drastic expansion,” said Collins, who’s also a member of the Education Oversight Committee.
Bell argues the data already exists through the privately funded bonuses in Meeting Street Schools.
And the results are promising, Bell said.
On average, student progress jumped forward about a year and a half in their reading and math skills during the most recent school year — the best outcomes so far in the program’s history, Bell said. And the program encourages outstanding teachers to stay in the profession, he said.
For Brentwood teacher Malik Anderson, who declined to disclose the amount he received, getting a bonus meant the difference between going on vacation during the school’s summer break and working a seasonal job to make ends meet.

Despite the seventh grade English teacher’s passion for the profession, he had to make hard decisions about whether to stay in the classroom or look for work elsewhere because of the pay, he said. Although he didn’t choose teaching for the money, the promise of bonuses if his students perform well means less stress over finances, he said.
“I don’t think anybody gets out of education because they don’t like it,” Anderson said. “I honestly think one of the determining factors is simply, sometimes you just simply can’t afford it, especially depending on where you live.”
Instead of telling great teachers they need to find an administrative job or take on the debt required to earn another degree, the bonuses allow them to stay in the classroom, where they are making a day-to-day impact on students, Bell said.
The Navarros haven’t capped total bonuses. They’re willing to fund whatever amount teachers earn, but they did decide to limit rewards to improvements in reading and math at high-poverty schools, Bell said.
That’s because math and reading are the foundational skills for all other subjects, Bell said.
More than half of the state’s third- through eighth-grade students can’t do math on grade level. And although reading scores jumped significantly during the most recent school year, 45% of students still are not reading on grade level, according to state test results. Students also tend to perform worse in poorer school districts, where the program is focused, according to state data.
“It’s undeniable that that’s what too many students are lacking skills in,” Bell said. “And those are the building blocks of almost everything else that you need to learn later.”
How teachers are paid
If legislators really want to make a change, they need to revamp how teachers are paid, Bell said.
For decades, teachers have been paid according to their years of classroom experience and level of college degree — making more annually as they move up the so-called salary schedule.
But years of experience and degrees don’t always correlate to student success, Bell said.
“What’s true is that some of the highest-performing teachers in our state are currently paid much less than some of the lowest-performing teachers in our state,” Bell said. “If you were building a school system from the start, you wouldn’t design it that way.”
But any change to that system is guaranteed to meet opposition. In 2019, a proposal directing the state Department of Education to come up with a way to eventually replace the salary steps met so much resistance, legislators quickly ditched the idea.
It’s unclear if legislators are willing to try again.
Teachers’ advocates, who have long fought proposed changes to how teachers are paid, aren’t against rewarding teachers for a job well done. The problem is figuring out how to do so fairly, said Patrick Kelly, lobbyist for the Palmetto State Teachers Association.
Paying one teacher more than another with the same experience and same job solely because of student test scores would be unfair, he said.
But a bonus program that rewards excellent teachers for taking on extra duties outside of their classroom could be a way to move forward, he said.
“The key and the challenge is determining the criteria for awarding merit-based pay,” Kelly said.
A 2023 study legislators commissioned and Kelly helped craft recommended giving exemplary teachers assignments outside their normal work, then paying them stipends to cover the cost.
Under that model, teachers’ base pay would come from the number of years they’ve spent teaching, with additional amounts for getting additional degrees or working at underperforming schools. After a certain number of years in the classroom, teachers could then receive up to $10,000 on top of their normal salary if they agreed to help evaluate and coach fellow teachers.
That would allow teachers to expand their impact beyond their classroom, giving the state a better return on its investment, Kelly said.
“To me, that is the kind of performance pay I would like to see the state move toward,” Kelly said.
Legislators might be open to working through a way to pay teachers based on performance, but they would first need to see a proposal and study results, Collins said.
“I’m certainly open to the idea of making teacher pay less rigid than it is now,” Collins said.
Any sort of performance-based teacher pay would require hefty backing in the state budget. Legislators have put millions into raising the base pay for teachers in recent years, “but this is a whole another level of investment,” Kelly said.
“To have the impact that Meeting Street is having, you’re going to need substantial money behind it, and that’s going to be hard to find, especially in a fiscal environment where a lot of the conversation is around tax cuts, not around spending increases,” Kelly said.
Fairness concerns
Beemok’s Excellence in Teaching Awards model uses a formula based on how well students perform on district-wide tests at the beginning of the year versus the end. But how well a student does on a test is not always an accurate reflection of the quality of their teacher, Kelly said.
For instance, every teacher wants their students to show up to class every day, Kelly said, but that doesn’t happen.
A statewide study by the Education Oversight Committee found 1 in 5 students missed at least 10% of their school days during the 2022-2023 school year and that those students performed worse on end-of-year assessments than their peers.
Other teachers may be doing a stellar job but lack the testing with which to measure student growth, cutting them out of potential bonuses. Band and choir teachers, for example, can make a huge difference in a student’s life but would likely get left out of bonuses, said Kelly, who teaches Advanced Placement government at Blythewood High School.
SC students skip school a lot. The problem helps explain their dismal test scores, report finds.

“I know for a fact that some of the highest performing students in my AP (government) class thrive in school because of their fine arts instructors,” Kelly said. “That is the thing that keeps them engaged and thriving in school.”
A more consistent way of doling out bonuses for teachers could be looking at their annual reviews, which would give a clearer picture of how well they performed in metrics other than test scores, Kelly said.
Even that would require adjustment.
In some districts, principals simply rubber stamp their teachers’ evaluations. If that were to become the basis for a bonus, teachers in schools with less involved principals might receive higher bonuses than teachers whose principals took the time and effort to scrutinize their progress over the course of the year, which also isn’t fair, Kelly said. Teachers would need a more standardized system to be sure they were actually getting paid based on their success, he said.
“I think we have to tackle that first, and then we can have, I think, a more meaningful conversation about something like merit-based pay,” Kelly said.
Rewarding some teachers while others fall by the wayside for reasons that may be outside their control can cause divisions and unnecessary competition among teachers, said Dena Crews, president of the South Carolina Education Association.
Crews knows what it’s like to be the teacher not receiving an award. During her first year teaching a grade level with an end-of-year test, she was the only teacher in the school who didn’t meet the threshold of students on grade level to receive a gift bag at the end of the year, she said.
Crews’ students performed well in other ways, even if they didn’t necessarily meet their testing benchmarks, she said. Merit-based pay doesn’t account for all the other skills a student learns in class that may not show up on a test, she said.
“It was like I got slapped in the face, like the work that I did was meaningless because my kids didn’t perform on a one-time test,” Crews said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4827-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 18:16:39.121744

“Unless UAMS receives federal funding and a new federal contract to administer the Head Start program, this program will have to remain closed,” Head Start Program Director Tyra Larkin wrote to families in the program. “We understand how disruptive this will be for your family, and we are deeply sorry for the stress this may cause.”

Letter to Families 2_ 
The six facilities in Little Rock and North Little Rock serve 446 children and their families, and 130 employees will be furloughed due to the closures, UAMS spokesperson Leslie Taylor said.
Head Start provides free early childhood education to children between infancy and 5 years of age from low-income families. UAMS is one of 16 grantees for Head Start services throughout Arkansas.
Five percent of 4-year-olds and 7% of 3-year-olds in Arkansas were enrolled in Head Start during the 2023-24 academic year, according to a report from the National Institute for Early Education Research earlier this year.
The announcement comes as child care providers throughout Arkansas have been petitioning the state Department of Education for help in light of both the government shutdown and changes to the state’s School Readiness Assistance Program. The financial aid program for low-income families to access child care relies on a federal grant that the shutdown has withheld, and federal funding for child care was already steadily decreasing, state Division of Elementary and Secondary Education officials said.
The Arkansas Early Childhood Commission created an emergency working group of researchers, lawmakers and child care providers with the goal of assisting and advising the state Office of Early Childhood on how to keep child care services afloat and sustainable by Nov. 1.
As of Thursday, an end to the shutdown remained out of reach as congressional Democrats and Republicans continued not to make progress on federal budget negotiations. The 23-day shutdown is the second-longest in American history.

Three members of New Mexico’s congressional delegation said Thursday that the United States Department of Agriculture has all the money it needs to keep food assistance flowing to 42 million Americans in November, despite officials’ claims otherwise.
In a little more than a week, more than 450,000 New Mexicans will likely not receive SNAP payments, according to state officials. That’s because the USDA on Oct. 10 sent state SNAP administrators a letter ordering them not to send SNAP recipient information to statewide vendors due to “insufficient funds” resulting from the ongoing federal government shutdown.
But U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, who represents New Mexico’s 3rd Congressional District, said Thursday that the USDA has access to $5 billion in SNAP “contingency funds” it could use to keep SNAP recipients fed.
With SNAP cuts looming, a growing Albuquerque food line may foreshadow future need

“President Trump could act today to make sure families don’t go hungry — but instead he’s using hunger as punishment while taking $200 million from billionaires for a gilded ballroom and sending a $40 billion bailout to Argentina. That’s cruel. That’s un-American,” Leger Fernández said in a statement. 
Food and Nutrition Services, the USDA division that runs SNAP, did not respond to Source New Mexico’s request for comment Thursday about why it isn’t using contingency funds — money Leger Fernández said was “set aside specifically for emergencies like this” — to keep benefits flowing through Thanksgiving despite the shutdown. 
In addition to the statement, Leger Fernández joined about 180 colleagues in signing a letter regarding SNAP expected to be sent tomorrow, according to her spokesperson. Democratic members of the Senate, including U.S. Sens. Ben Ray Luján and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, sent their own letter to USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins earlier Thursday. 
The latter letter also notes the USDA’s contingency funding as one example of the agency having sufficient funding and authority to avoid any lapse in SNAP funding. 
“Americans are already struggling with the rising cost of groceries, and they cannot afford a sudden lapse in grocery assistance,” the letter reads. 
NM food banks say they have no time to prepare for Nov. 1 SNAP stoppage 

New Mexico has the highest rate of SNAP reliance in the country, with $90 million in benefits serving 250,000 households hanging in the balance come Nov. 1. Food banks across the state are gearing up to meet the increased demand, though food bank leaders told state lawmakers Wednesday they do not have the capacity to meet an increase in demand for food. 
Michael Coleman, Gov. Michellle Lujan Grisham’s communications director, told Source in a statement Wednesday evening that the governor is “carefully assessing options for those whose benefits could be abruptly cut off Nov. 1.” 
However, spokespersons from the Health Care Authority, which administers SNAP, and the governor’s office did not provide further comment Thursday about how the state might intervene to save the benefits. 
“Gov. Lujan Grisham is fully aware and deeply concerned that food security is in grave jeopardy for nearly a half-million New Mexicans who rely on the SNAP program,” Coleman said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0931-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 18:16:39.121744

Federal cuts will make it harder,Sophia Paffenroth,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/23/federal-cuts-medicaid-access/,"Kimberly Todd qualifies for Medicaid, but the difficulty she has faced getting on the program over the last few months reveals the cracks poor people fall through when trying to get assistance from the social programs that purportedly exist to help them.","LAMAR – Kimberly Todd sat in a brown and gold upholstered chair on her front porch at the end of a long dirt driveway on a cloudy September afternoon. Wearing jeans and a crimson blouse, it’s the most dressed up she’s been in months, she says. 
Tight clothing, socks and shoes make her skin feel like it’s on fire – a symptom of fibromyalgia she has lived with for four years without health insurance. A single mother of five, Todd also has endured numbness in her abdomen, pain in her uterus and two periods a month as a result of complications from a C-section in 2021. 
Todd qualifies for Medicaid, but the difficulty she has faced getting on the program over the last few months reveals the cracks poor people fall through when trying to get assistance from the social programs that purportedly exist to help them. Mississippi has among the strictest Medicaid income eligibility requirements in the nation. People must meet the income threshold, which amounts to less than $500 per month for a family of three and is a fraction of the federal poverty level. They also face bureaucratic red tape and punitive measures for missteps that often force them into deeper holes. 
Her most recent barrier to getting health care? The state has asked Todd to file for child support from her ex-boyfriend. This little-known Medicaid requirement has translated to four months of back-and-forth with caseworkers, miscommunication among state agencies, delayed medical care and the possibility of sending the father of her two youngest children to jail. 
“I want to take care of my family – that’s it,” Todd said. “Something I never had growing up.”
Whether or not it’s intentional, social safety net programs end up shutting out eligible people through “unnecessary complexity,” explained Daniel Dawes, an attorney and founding dean of Meharry Medical College in Nashville who helped write the Affordable Care Act, widely considered the most progressive health care legislation since the formation of Medicaid and Medicare in 1965. 
“Many of these programs are designed as if they’re intended to keep people in perpetual poverty,” Dawes said. “Instead of making allowances and helping people to maneuver out of that.”
By all accounts, people in circumstances like Todd motivated lawmakers to create the Medicaid program. Todd has worked multiple jobs – from cleaning houses and hotels and working in convenience stores to fixing cars and broken phones. She has worked in grueling conditions so that she can care for the three children ages 4 to 18 in her custody – two of whom have autism. 
She has no family in the state and lives in what she calls “a shack” on an acre of wooded land without the resources to put her kids in afterschool activities like art classes or programs for autistic children. Todd and her children lack the community safety net most people take for granted. 
“Most people have family, friends – I don’t even have a friend,” Todd said. “I don’t have one friend.”
Medicaid would be her safety net – at least in theory. But the system has been failing her. 
“I will work myself literally to death and not have any health care coverage,” Todd said. “Who’s going to take care of my autistic child when I pass away? Where is she going to go? She can’t talk. Who’s going to hurt her while I’m not here?”
‘I didn’t want that for my kids’
The child support requirement aims to help single parents. In practice, research suggests it can be harmful for families – yet it pervades most social safety net programs. 
“It may be that a family already has informal arrangements for all the parents to financially contribute to the child’s wellbeing, and complying with this requirement through the state can disrupt those informal arrangements that are working better for families in many cases,” explained Matt Williams, director of research with the Mississippi Low-Income Child Care Initiative. 
That’s the case with Todd. She said she is on good terms with her ex-boyfriend and often gives him a place to stay. She said she is hoping to help him get back on his feet so he can start working again after his own mental health conditions and lack of insurance made working impossible. He doesn’t qualify for Medicaid because his biological children are not in his custody. Mississippi’s version of Medicaid does not insure childless adults. 
In other cases, being forced to file for child support with the non-custodial parent could have dangerous repercussions. 
“For any one of a number of reasons, including concern for their own physical wellbeing, they might be reluctant to identify someone,” said Sen. Hob Bryan, a Democrat from Amory, who previously told Mississippi Today “the child support system in Mississippi is f-cked up, and no one knows how to unf-ck it.”
Exemptions to the rule technically exist for those who are concerned for their own or their children’s safety. In practice they are very difficult to obtain, explained Williams. 
“It’s not always the case that they are granted that exemption if they don’t have the right kind of legal paper trail, court documents or restraining orders,” he said. “If they’re unable to prove through documentation that they are experiencing domestic violence or fleeing domestic violence, they may not get that exemption.”
In Todd’s case, filing for child support from her former partner in August was an impossible decision. She worries the missed payments she knows he will incur will put him in jail. 
“How is he going to help me from jail?” Todd asked. “What sense does that make?”
She knows this situation all too well. Her own driver’s license was revoked twice in the last year after she fell behind on child support payments to the father of her two children who are not in her custody. She has not been able to pay off the most recent fine since she is out of work, making it harder for her to find work and to take her non-verbal autistic daughter to therapy. 
What makes the child support requirement even more harmful in Todd’s case is that evidence suggests it was implemented incorrectly. States are only allowed to ask applicants to agree to comply with requirements at the time of application, according to several national Medicaid experts who spoke to Mississippi Today. States cannot force applicants to file for child support before they are approved for Medicaid. But according to Todd, they did. 
“Part of that’s just practicality,” said Jennifer Wagner, director of Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “In the application timeframe, filing for child support is not something that can always be completed before the state’s deadline and it’s counter to the concept of Medicaid and providing timely care.”
Mississippi Division of Medicaid Spokesperson Matt Westerfield confirmed applicants cannot be required to file for child support until after their Medicaid application is approved. He did not respond to a request for comment on Todd’s case. 
Once Mississippi Today informed her of state and federal law, Todd went back to her case worker in mid-October with the information, at which point they told her she should expect an approval letter in the mail in a week.
According to Todd, the caseworker alleged over the phone that Todd had been approved for Medicaid in August, failed to comply with the child support requirement, and had her coverage rescinded. But Todd says the application in her online portal went from “processing” to “denied,” and she never got an approval letter in the mail. 
Her online portal finally said “eligible” on Wednesday – nearly four months after her initial application. But Todd has yet to receive her official approval letter and insurance card in the mail  – and she can’t start using her coverage until then, according to the Mississippi Division of Medicaid site.  
It’s not uncommon for Medicaid requirements to be implemented incorrectly at the local level, according to Tricia Brooks, a research professor at the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University. 
“Although we don’t have hard data, we consistently hear about errors made by eligibility workers or misinformation provided by call center staff,” Brooks said. “Unfortunately, applicants and enrollees are often unaware of their right to a fair hearing and hit roadblocks in getting accurate information.”
Before Todd got sick, life wasn’t much easier. 
The last time Todd and her former partner were working full-time, they were told they made too much money to qualify for Medicaid. Together, they struggled to cover rent and utilities and had no money left over for food – much less health insurance. They got by on provisions from a nearby church, but they only ever ate “peanut butter and jelly and noodles,” Todd said. 
Since then, her health has deteriorated to the point that she can no longer work. As a result, Todd qualifies for Medicaid. Advocates for Medicaid expansion in Mississippi have long sounded the alarms on this paradox. In one of 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid, Mississippi could have covered tens of thousands more working people who do not earn enough to pay for their own insurance – people like Todd. 
Nearly a quarter of people in Marshall County, where Todd lives in the northern part of the state, are living below the poverty line, according to the Mississippi Department of Employment Security. That’s more than double the national average. Todd grew up in poverty, but she always thought it was an escapable fate. She’s since lost all faith in the system.
“I grew up in nasty houses with roaches and rats and holes in the floor and no money and starving – I grew up like that,” Todd reflected. “I didn’t want that for my kids. But there’s nothing I can do. I see how hard it is now.”
Widening gaps
Government programs are not universally difficult to apply for. Those serving poor people tend to be far more wrapped up in red tape, unequally levying what’s called “the time tax.” A 2021 Atlantic article written by Annie Lowrey sums it up: the time tax is regressive. 
“Programs for the wealthy tend to be easy, automatic, and guaranteed. You do not need to prostrate yourself before a caseworker to get the benefits of a 529 college-savings plan. You do not need to urinate in a cup to get a tax write-off for your home, boat, or plane. You do not need to find a former partner to get a child-support determination as a prerequisite for profiting from a 401(k).”
Application processes for government programs aimed at the wealthy are so much easier that many affluent people don’t even realize they’re benefiting from them, according to a survey conducted by political scientist Suzanne Mettler at Cornell University. 
In Mettler’s survey, the majority of high-income participants initially said they had never used a government safety net program. When told what counted as a government program, 96% reported they had. 
The wealth gap will widen and the time tax inequality will increase under President Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act, experts warn. The new law contains the largest cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, or food stamps, in history. 
“We know that programs like SNAP and Medicaid reduce poverty, and so if they’re less available, we can expect poverty and hardships to rise,” said Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow in the Tax and Income Supports Division at the Urban Institute. “And we also know that the tax cuts for higher income groups are designed to boost those incomes, so you can just do the math without even having to do the math.”
Strict policies and cuts to Medicaid and food aid disproportionately harm women – a fact Todd knows firsthand. In her community, she says many mothers she knows are dropping dead because of heart attacks, too sick to take care of their kids, or committing suicide – a fate she almost fell prey to except that she didn’t want to repeat the generational trauma with which she grew up. 
“I know how it is to live without a parent because my mom mentally and emotionally wasn’t there, and I would never do that to my kids,” Todd said. “That’s the only reason why I’m here. I promise you, if it wasn’t for them, I would not be here. This world is too much for me, trying to just survive with nobody.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/02125852/for-sophia.jpg,,,2025-10-23 18:16:39.121744

The western bridge has been demolished. (Rhode Island Department of Transportation Traffic Camera)As new details surface about the state’s failure to evaluate and repair longstanding problems with the Washington Bridge, Rhode Island lawmakers are enlisting a former federal law enforcement officer to probe deeper.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson announced late Thursday that former U.S. Attorney Zachary A. Cunha has been brought on to help the General Assembly conduct an upcoming oversight hearing on the bridge failure – now scheduled for Thursday, Nov. 13.

Cunha served as U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island from 2021 to 2025, ousted after President Donald Trump took office. He now works in private practice as a partner at Nixon & Peabody LLP in Providence.  
“A career public servant, Attorney Cunha’s vast experience will enhance the conduct of a fair and robust inquiry by our oversight committees without unnecessary impact on the state’s ongoing lawsuit related to the Washington Bridge,” Shekarchi and Lawson said in a joint statement Thursday. “He has consistently demonstrated impartiality, integrity and a high degree of skill across the legal landscape while serving as U.S. Attorney.”
The news comes less than one month after the Rhode Island Attorney General’s office lifted the veil on a long-sequestered audit of the bridge’s condition. The 64-page report was posted on the AG’s website on Sept. 26 after pieces were leaked by an anonymous social media account. It paints a damning picture for state officials and administrators for failing to notice or remedy the highway’s deteriorating condition, despite nearly two decades of inspections and repairs exposing the structural problems.
Since the document went public, additional details have come to light, including omitted excerpts from the analysis and correspondence between members of the consulting company hired to perform the review, as first reported by the Providence Journal on Oct. 21. 
Shekarchi and Lawson said the upcoming legislative probe was prompted by the audit report and other new information about the bridge. 
Since the westbound highway’s abrupt closure in December 2023, the Rhode Island General Assembly has already exercised its oversight authority twice — in February 2024 and February 2025 — though the latter served more as an information session than a grilling of state leaders. In neither instance were witnesses put under oath during their testimony.
This time, lawmakers expect to formally swear in witnesses before taking their comments and asking questions. 
It remains undecided whether subpoenas will be issued for the upcoming probe, Larry Berman, a spokesperson for Shekarchi, said in an email Thursday.
Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti is expected to cooperate and attend the hearing, given that Alviti attended the last two rounds of probes voluntarily, Berman said.
A spokesperson for the state transportation agency did not immediately respond to inquiries for comment late Thursday.
McKee has already signaled his opposition to putting state employees, including Alviti, under oath, warning it could jeopardize the state’s ongoing lawsuit against contractors involved in bridge inspection and repairs. 
But Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, whose office is leading the state’s lawsuit, has already made clear that swearing in state employees to testify about the bridge will not impede the state’s legal case.
“The people of Rhode Island deserve transparency and accountability, and I support Speaker Shekarchi and Senate President Lawson in their mission here,” Neronha said in a statement. “Though my office seeks to hold accountable several contractor companies for what we allege was negligent behavior, that doesn’t mean those in state leadership charged with maintaining our roads and bridges get a free pass. We must know the full truth, and these hearings can absolutely provide helpful insight.”
The complaint seeking damages for the state’s losses from the bridge closure is tentatively scheduled to go to trial in late 2027.
The meeting on Nov. 13 will be held in the State House’s basement, televised live by Capitol TV, and live streamed at https://capitoltvri.cablecast.tv/. A time has not been set as of Thursday.

This story by John Lippman was first published in the Valley News on Oct. 22, 2025.
NORTH HAVERHILL — The man serving a mandatory life sentence for murdering two Dartmouth College professors 24 years ago has cleared another legal hurdle in his effort to become eligible for parole.
A state Superior Court judge this week denied a request by prosecutors to reconsider his ruling on the constitutionality of the New Hampshire law mandating minors guilty of certain crimes be sentenced to life without the possibility of being released from prison.
Robert Tulloch, 43, of Chelsea, is serving two consecutive life sentences after pleading guilty to first-degree murder in the stabbing deaths of Dartmouth professors Half and Susanne Zantop at their Etna home in 2001 when he was 17 years old.
James Parker, Tulloch’s accomplice in the stabbings, who was 16 at the time and pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, was paroled from prison in 2024 after serving nearly all the minimum length of his 25-years-to-life sentence.
Under state law, the sentence Tulloch received was automatic given the crime, despite his age. For years, he has been seeking a new sentencing hearing on grounds that mandatory life sentences without the possibility of parole for minors are illegal. In July, Judge Lawrence MacLeod of Grafton County Superior Court agreed.
The judge found that the state law that requires lifetime prison sentences for defendants convicted of capital offenses violates the “cruel and unusual” clause under the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution when imposed on a juvenile.
State prosecutors quickly filed a motion asking MacLeod to reconsider his ruling and submitted several arguments they contended undercut the judge’s opinion. But MacLeod, in an eight-page decision dated Oct. 20, remained unpersuaded by the state’s arguments that he erred in applying the “evolving standards of decency” that in part led him to conclude that denying any hope for parole to a juvenile violated the state’s constitution.
The ruling was within the bounds of statutes and case law that “allow consideration of facts outside of New Hampshire legislative history in determining whether LWOP sentences for minors were both ‘cruel’ and ‘unusual,’” MacLeod wrote, using an acronym for “life without parole.”
He agreed with the defense’s claim that “juvenile LWOP could not have been understood or accepted as a penalty for crimes to the framers in 1784,” when neither sentences of life imprisonment nor prisons fitting any modern definition of the term existed.
Michael Garrity, spokesman for the New Hampshire Department of Justice, said via email that department officials “will review the order and respond as appropriate in court.”
What happens next is unclear but there are at least three possible paths.
The first is the state could accept the ruling and agree to a new sentencing hearing for Tulloch. A hearing date has not yet been set but the clerk’s office is required to set a date within 30 days of the Oct. 20 decision.
The second path is that prosecutors appeal MacLeod’s ruling to the state Supreme Court, which has not yet addressed the sentencing issue and could settle the questions once and for all.
A third possibility is that prosecutors and defense attorneys avoid the uncertainty of returning to court and enter into settlement discussions to negotiate a new sentence for Tulloch.

The revised pleading that Anné Minard entered Thursday in Ingham County Circuit Court will see her accept guilt for filing a fraudulent income tax return and another charge of embezzlement from a nonprofit campaign and organizing fund she and Robert Minard controlled in conjunction with Lee Chatfield and his wife, Stephanie.
Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office issued a news release on the agreement following a hearing before Ingham Circuit Judge James Jamo.
Anné Minard and the attorney general’s office agreed that she would serve six months in jail on a suspended sentence with 36 months probation and fines, Bridge Michigan reported.
“As a condition of the plea agreement, Minard has agreed to provide truthful testimony in future hearings,” the attorney general’s office said. “Minard is additionally required to pay full restitution for amounts owed to the Michigan Department of Treasury.”
She will next appear in court before Jamo for sentencing on Dec. 3. The judge has the latitude to deviate from the agreed upon sentence if he pleases.
There was no plea deal entered for Robert Minard, who still faces trial on multiple felonies related to running a criminal enterprise and misappropriating funds connected to Lee Chatfield.
With Anné Minard’s new plea deal, she will likely testify during trial proceedings for both Lee and Stephanie Chatfield, which have been set for Sept. 21, 2026, through Oct. 9, 2026.

It is alleged that Lee and Stephanie Chatfield, beginning in 2021, used nonprofit money to reimburse themselves for purchases at luxe stores like Coach, items at amusement parks like Universal Studios, while Lee Chatfield also spent lavishly at strip clubs and partied with his associates and brothers.
An investigation into Chatfield began after his former sister-in-law reported to Lansing police an allegation that he had sexually assaulted her for years, starting when she was 14 or 15 years old.
Although those allegations did not result in criminal charges, it did ensnare the Chatfields in the financial crimes investigation, and by proxy, the Minards.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, on Thursday called lawmakers back to Richmond for a special session Monday afternoon, setting off speculation that Democrats are preparing to act on redistricting plans just days before voters elect a new governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and all 100 members of the House of Delegates.
In a letter to legislators, Scott cited constitutional provisions and joint resolutions authorizing the General Assembly to reconvene the 2024 Special Session I “to consider matters properly before the ongoing session and any related business laid before the body.” 
The House will meet at 4 p.m. Monday in the Capitol chamber, he wrote, adding that the clerk’s office will soon provide logistical details.
“My office has spoken with Senate leadership and has been assured that a similar communication … will be made by the Senate Clerk’s Office to Senate members,” Scott wrote. 
He did not explain why the legislature is being recalled, and neither he nor Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, responded to inquiries from The Mercury on Thursday.
 Redistricting speculation

Several Democrats and legislative staffers told Virginia Scope that part of the session’s focus will be redistricting — a move that could reopen debate over how Virginia’s 11 congressional boundaries are drawn. Six of these are currently held by Democrats, and sources told the outlet that Democrats in Washington believe a new map could yield at least two additional Democratic-leaning seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Virginia voters in 2020 approved a constitutional amendment creating an independent redistricting commission of lawmakers and citizens, but the panel deadlocked in late 2021, leaving the Virginia Supreme Court to draw the current maps. 
With Democrats now holding narrow control of both legislative chambers, some strategists have discussed using their majorities to revisit that framework.
Options under discussion include breaking up heavily Democratic districts to make them more competitive while reshaping Republican-leaning areas to favor Democratic candidates. 
Timing is key — under Virginia’s amendment process, a constitutional change must be approved twice by the General Assembly with a House election in between before being placed on the ballot for voter approval or rejection.
According to Virginia Scope, Democratic leaders are considering an initial vote before the Nov. 4 election, followed by a second vote during the 2026 session, potentially allowing a referendum next spring and new maps as early as April — two months before congressional primaries.
Still, many Democratic lawmakers remain uneasy about the plan. Senate Democrats held a caucus meeting Wednesday night, and several members told the outlet they had been “kept out of the loop” about the special-session agenda.
 National backdrop

Across the country, redistricting battles are intensifying as both parties look to lock in advantages ahead of the 2026 midterms. 
Earlier on Thursday, the New York Times reported that Virginia’s Democratic leaders are considering “joining a growing number of states” seeking to counter what they call partisan gerrymandering efforts encouraged by the administration of President Donald Trump.
“We are coming back to address actions by the Trump administration,” Surovell told the Times, suggesting Democrats view their move as a corrective to Republican-led redistricting maneuvers in states such as Texas, Florida, and North Carolina. 
Those states have recently pushed new maps designed to cement GOP control after a series of federal court rulings loosened constraints on mid-decade remapping. The Supreme Court is currently weighing a major redistricting case from Louisiana, another sign of how important the issue is to legislators and voters nationwide.
In August, Sen. Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, hinted publicly that Virginia could soon act. 
Sharing a post by former President Barack Obama on X, formerly Twitter, praising California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s approach to mid-decade redistricting, Lucas wrote: “Every state in the nation should follow suit. Stay tuned for Virginia …”
 Political fallout

Republicans swiftly accused Democrats of scheming to rewrite the rules ahead of a pivotal statewide election. 
Republican Party of Virginia Chair Mark Peake, a state senator from Lynchburg, in a video on X characterized Scott’s move a sign of Democratic desperation. 
“Desperate Democrats are pulling a pathetic, political stunt,” Peake said, accusing the majority of “doing anything they can to take attention away from their horrible candidates.” 
He added that “the General Assembly hopes they can do something with this ruse about redistricting,” but urged voters not to “fall for it.” 
The campaign of Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, the GOP nominee for governor, blamed Democratic contender Abigail Spanberger for supporting the idea of dissolving the independent commission.
“In a stunning display of arrogance, Abigail Spanberger wants to overrule the will of Virginia voters in favor of a cynical power grab,” campaign spokesperson Peyton Vogel said in a statement Thursday. 
“She came out in favor of abolishing Virginia’s Independent Redistricting Commission and wants to hand control back to the politicians in Richmond so they can guarantee their own reelection. … It’s never been about the voters or what’s best for Virginia. It’s always been about what’s best for Abigail Spanberger.”
However, in an interview with WJLA in late August, Spanberger said she opposed mid-decade redistricting and warned against “politicians trying to tilt the playing field in their favor,” aligning herself with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore’s call for fair-maps legislation.
 What comes next

With the state legislature reconvening Monday afternoon, both chambers are expected to gavel in briefly before potentially taking up redistricting-related measures later in the week. 
Procedural resolutions adopted earlier this year would allow lawmakers to address “matters properly before the ongoing special session,” giving Scott wide latitude to add topics to the agenda.
Any move to alter Virginia’s redistricting process would likely trigger intense legal scrutiny and political backlash — especially given the proximity to Election Day. But Democratic strategists across the country argue that Republican-led states have already rewritten maps to their advantage.

Idahoans may visit voteidaho.gov until 5 p.m. local time Friday to request an absentee ballot for free or pre-register to vote for the Nov. 4 election, the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office said in a news release issued Thursday. 
“As the election approaches, I encourage every Idahoan to make a plan and be ready to vote in the local elections on Tuesday, November 4th,” Idaho Secretary of State Phil McGrane said in a written statement. “Pre-registering at VoteIdaho.gov is quick and straightforward, and it’s the best way to ensure you’re prepared for Election Day. For those voting absentee, this Friday is especially important, as it’s also the deadline to request your ballot. VoteIdaho.gov is your trusted resource to get the information you need and to make your voice heard in your community.”
Idahoans who request an absentee ballot by Friday’s deadline will receive their ballot in the mail and must complete it and return it so it is received by local elections officials by the time polls close at 8 p.m. local time Nov. 4. It is not enough to simply have the absentee ballot postmarked by Election Day; instead local election officials must physically receive the absentee ballot by the time polls close in order for the ballot to be counted.

Depending on where they live, Idahoans may have a mayor’s race, city council election, school board election, school district levy, a public safety levey, an open spaces levy, cemetery district or other local taxing district election to vote on during the Nov. 4 election. 
Voters can visit voteidaho.gov to view their sample ballot and find out in advance what will be on their ballot. 
In Idaho, voting by absentee ballot is one of several options for voting. If voters miss Friday’s deadline or do not want to vote by absentee ballot, they may participate in early voting until Oct. 31 or vote in-person at their local polling place from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day, Nov. 4.
Eligible voters who do not pre-register to vote online by the Oct. 24 deadline still have the option to register to vote in person at their polling place when they go to vote. To register to vote, Idahoans must present a current valid photo ID and proof of residence. According to the Idaho Secretary of State’s Office, a current valid Idaho driver’s license with the voter’s current address satisfies both the photo ID and proof of residency requirements. Other acceptable forms of photo ID include an Idaho identification card, a passport or federal ID, a Tribal ID or a concealed weapons permit issued by an Idaho sheriff’s office. Acceptable forms of proof of residency include a lease agreement or mortgage, proof of insurance, a bank or credit card statement, a pay stub, a utility bill that is not a cell phone bill, or an enrollment letter from an Idaho high school or college.

Brian Kemp's office on Oct. 23, 2025 in Atlanta. Alander Rocha/Georgia Recorder A coalition of environmental organizations delivered more than 24,000 petition signatures and nearly 300 pieces of artwork from children to Gov. Brian Kemp’s office Thursday, urging him to permanently protect the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.
The groups, which included Environment Georgia, Garden Club of Georgia, Georgia Interfaith Power and Light and others, called on the governor to support pending legislation to ban future surface mining on the refuge’s Trail Ridge, a geological feature that contains valuable minerals but also serves as a barrier protecting the Okefenokee. House Bill 561, known as the “Okefenokee Protection Act” and sponsored by Rep. Darlene Taylor, a Thomasville Republican, has not yet passed out of the House Natural Resources and Environment Committee.
An Alabama-based company, Twin Pines Minerals, dropped its plans to mine Trail Ridge this summer and said that it would instead sell 8,000 acres near the refuge. In the 1990s, DuPont also attempted to mine near the swamp. 
“The immediate threat to the swamp has been resolved, but that does not mean the Okefenokee is safeguarded for future generations,” said Jennette Gayer, state director of Environment Georgia, which collected a large majority of the signatures.

The legislation aims to prohibit the state’s Environmental Protection Division from issuing future mining permits in the area. The bill states that the director of the division “shall not issue, modify, or renew any permit or accept any bond to conduct surface mining operations on Trail Ridge for any permit application or permit amendment.”  The bill makes the case that the Okefenokee Swamp “is of equal importance to all citizens of the state, is of state-wide concern, and consequently is properly a matter for regulation and protection.”
The bill also warns that surface mining “risks adverse impacts to the wetlands, water quality and quantity, wildlife habitat, air quality, and wilderness values of the Okefenokee Swamp.” Taylor pointed to those concerns in a phone interview Thursday, warning that a drained swamp could lead to catastrophic forest fires and change the entire ecosystem.
“My big fear, especially with the mining, was once you perforate and get into the underneath, it won’t be what you see on the surface to begin with. It would drain out of the swamp, and as it would drain out, the swamp would become drier,” she said.
Supporters argue that Kemp’s backing is needed to move the legislation through the House and Senate. Aside from passing Taylor’s bill, Gayer said Kemp could support designating the Okefenokee as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, a designation former Gov. Sonny Perdue supported and one that proponents say would spur economic development through tourism. Gayer also suggested Kemp could support or allocate funds for the purchase of land or mineral rights along the rest of Trail Ridge to permanently protect the area for conservation.

Josh Marks of Georgians for the Okefenokee, who has been involved with conservation efforts for nearly 30 years, criticized the governor’s silence on the issue. Marks said that he was disappointed the governor has not publicly addressed the issue and challenged the governor to “put the word conserve back into conservative and lead the charge to permanently protect Trail Ridge.”
“We’re here today to tell Gov. Kemp to protect the Okefenokee Swamp once and for all,” Marks said.
A spokesperson for the governor’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
But Rep. John Corbett, a Lake Park Republican whose district includes the refuge, said that if signed into law, the bill would impose on landowners’ property rights, saying that it would be equal to “taking (property) without compensating the owner.”
“To go in there and take their right, you’re taking somebody’s property,” he said.
Corbett, however, said that he supports protecting the Okefenokee Swamp by selling the land that could be mined, whether to environmental groups, the state or the federal government, if they can work out a deal with the landowners.
Despite opposition over concerns about property rights, Taylor said she has received more calls on the issue than on any other in her 15 years as a lawmaker in south Georgia, adding that they have come not only from Georgia but also “from across the country and even internationally.”
“It is important to the world, to Georgia and to our country. It is a very important issue. There’s only one Okefenokee,” she said.
Marqus Cole, organizing director for Georgia Interfaith Power and Light, approached the issue as a matter of morality, saying that people of faith across Georgia “recognize the Okefenokee as a sacred trust” that must be passed onto future generations.
“The Okefenokee is more than just a landscape. It’s a living testament to creations, beauty and balance,” Cole said. “There’s a piece of faith wisdom that says we don’t inherit the earth from our ancestors, we steward it for the next generation.”",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/92f610f2-a5e5-4d0c-b173-70596d9ab1061-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-10-23 17:57:21.293207

A Scott administration return-to-office mandate will kick in December 1. The employees’ union says the Waterbury office lacks enough desks to accommodate workers assigned there. Administration officials say they’re working to address the space needs.

WATERBURY — Emily Weidman and her fiance planned to pare down to one car in order to save for a home. 
But that plan changed when Gov. Phil Scott announced state employees would need to return to the office at least three days per week starting Dec. 1. 
“We can’t do that now,” said Weidman, a Department of Vermont Health Access employee.

Weidman, who typically works in person once a month, was one of hundreds of employees within the Agency of Human Services who showed up to the state office complex in Waterbury Thursday to demonstrate the impact of the looming return-to-office order. Many wore green or union T-shirts to show their solidarity in opposition to the mandate. 
After first previewing the hybrid return-to-office plan this summer, Scott and his administration have released additional details sporadically, recently specifying the limited exceptions to the mandate for state workers currently living outside Vermont. 
Administration officials say working in person will increase collaboration and preserve institutional knowledge, while also improving customer service for Vermonters who want to interact with their government face-to-face. 
The Vermont State Employees’ Association, the union representing state workers, has fiercely criticized the initiative, arguing it will cause experienced employees to quit, decreasing the quality of state departments’ work. State surveys conducted by the Vermont Department of Human Resources show the vast majority of state employees who work at least sometimes remotely say the flexibility helps their productivity and still allows them to collaborate effectively.

Despite the financial impact on her, Weidman said she was more concerned about the hybrid plan’s impact on her colleagues who live farther from Waterbury or out of state. She expects to lose colleagues who can’t meet the initiative’s requirements.
“Lot’s going to change if we lose these people who have been here 15 years,” she said.

Then there’s the matter of space. Thursday’s demonstration coincided with a Vermont Department of Health all-team meeting, and the employees’ union said the department is short more than 250 desks in Waterbury to accommodate all the Health Department’s staff assigned to the office complex. 
“This is an attempt to show what this would be like,” Noah Detzer, a Health Department employee, said of the union’s organizing effort. “It’s going to be people on top of each other, multiple people at a desk.”
An internal evaluation by the Vermont Department of Health last month identified a gap of 254 desks at the Waterbury office, according to Kyle Casteel, a department spokesperson.
In an email, Sarah Clark, Vermont’s secretary of administration and the face of the administration’s hybrid mandate, wrote that state leaders are “actively working to address the space needs and develop solutions to accommodate the (Agency of Human Services) workforce.” She also acknowledged that the closure of a state office building in Burlington added to the Health Department’s space constraints.
But Clark noted that Thursday’s union demonstration, which requested 100% in-person attendance, may not accurately reflect what will happen starting Dec. 1, because the two remote days built into the administration’s plan will allow employees to work in the office on a staggered schedule. And on average, 199 employees currently work at the central complex in Waterbury, which has 881 seats, producing an average daily vacancy rate of 77%, according to data Clark shared. 
Detzer and other Health Department employees said they were concerned the return-to-office requirements would limit staff recruitment to the I-89 highway corridor, inhibiting people in rural Vermont from being able to work for the state. And they expect to lose institutional knowledge as employees who can’t meet the order retire or find other jobs, they said, a setback taxpayers will feel.

“It’s going to be a very different health department,” said Detzer, who typically commutes once a week from Essex.  
Samantha Stalford, another Health Department employee, said concerns about vacancies spurred by the return-to-office mandate threatened to overshadow the daily work of state government. Recruiting new workers and figuring out how to divide up the responsibilities of people who are leaving would take its toll, she said. 
“There’s just been a lot of chaos,” Stalford said, “rather than just doing our jobs.”

The Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program is running on funds left over from the previous fiscal year, and the health department spends $5 million per month on the program, Adams told the State Board of Health at its quarterly meeting.
“There is some discussion from USDA [the U.S. Department of Agriculture] that we may receive some additional dollars that would allow us to operate beyond that,” Adams said. “So right now, that program is fully functioning uninterrupted, but we do have a finite number of funds there.”
USDA officials said Oct. 13 that WIC would stay afloat until the end of this month thanks to a $300 million transfer from the agency’s child nutrition programs account.
Adams’ statement came a day after the Department of Human Services warned Arkansans to prepare themselves for possible interruptions to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) payments due to the shutdown.
Shutdown likely to halt food benefits for 42 million in just days

More than 222,000 individuals and over 118,000 households received SNAP benefits, formerly known as food stamps, as of Sept. 1, according to a DHS press release.
Nationally, more than 42 million low-income Americans are at risk of losing food assistance Nov. 1 if the government shutdown continues.
SNAP-eligible Arkansans currently must have a gross income below 130% of the federal poverty guidelines — currently $19,578 for an individual and $40,560 for a family of four — and a net income below 100% of this threshold.
However, WIC-eligible Arkansans’ income must be below 185% of the federal poverty line, which is $27,861 for an individual and $57,720 for a family of four. 66,689 Arkansans currently receive WIC benefits, Health Department spokesperson Ashley Whitlow said Thursday.
Arkansas has the nation’s highest rate of food insecurity, according to a USDA report released in September 2024.
Even if members of Congress reached a deal to end the 23-day shutdown immediately, the time needed to process SNAP payments and make them available for recipients means benefits would likely be delayed.
Adams told the Board of Health that the Health Department’s only area directly affected by the shutdown is its certification and survey program that receives funding from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Sixteen employees have been partially furloughed and one has been fully furloughed since Oct. 1, Adams said. As a result, the department is “not doing routine inspections” of Medicare and Medicaid certifications, but is still able to respond to complaints and questions, he said.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Mom-and-child-stock-GettyImages-1339053707-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-23 17:57:21.293207

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)The Utah Food Bank is working to bring in more donations and push them out to its network of pantries around the state, anticipating a jump in demand when about 87,000 Utah households go without food assistance next month. 
Meeting the need won’t be easy, said Ginette Bott, the food bank’s president and CEO. She and her employees were hammering out the logistics Thursday of how to ramp up their work with their existing staff and fleet of trucks.
“We can ask for more donations of food, but we have no guarantee those donations will come,” Bott added.

Utah’s Department of Workforce Services, which manages the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, in the state announced Wednesday that November payments will not be made because of the government shutdown. 
Utah Senate President Stuart Adams said the state “is not equipped to fund federal programs for weeks or months in the absence of congressional action.” The stalemate is now in its 23rd day. 
Some Utahns enrolled in SNAP receive payment on the 11th or 15th of every month. Others get theirs on the 5th, meaning they’ll feel the effects in less than two weeks.  
The amount varies, depending on a household’s net income. For a family of four, the maximum monthly allotment is about $1,000; for an individual, the cap is just under $300. 
Across Utah’s 29 counties, the food bank distributes to 309 local agencies. All have limited resources, Bott said.

“They don’t have a lot of storage space, they don’t have a lot of refrigeration. Many of them are staffed by volunteers,” Bott said. 
Some pantries may have to reduce the number of times people can visit every month, she said, which will impose extra challenges for Utahns living far from grocery and big box stores. 
“Not only is it incredibly frustrating, it’s incredibly sad,” Bott said. 
As need increases, the nonprofit Switchpoint’s two pantries in St. George and Tooele may have to transition from clients choosing their own groceries to receiving prepackaged boxes in an effort to better ration donated items, said Switchpoint spokesperson Zachary Almaguer. 
“We will do everything in our power not to turn individuals away,” Almaguer added, noting the organization also operates kitchens serving free meals in both cities.
“We’re watching closely, we are concerned, but we’re doing our best not to listen to what might be or what could be, but we’re planning for what we know we can do,” Almaguer said. 
For Bott, the pause in benefits reminds her in some ways of the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when many Utahns were suddenly out of work and visited food pantries to get by.
Asked if her organization can fill the need next month, she said no one entity can do it alone. She noted churches and faith-based organizations in the state also accept and distribute grocery donations. 
Said Bott: “It’s going to take all of us coming together to be able to make the best situation that we possibly can for people.”

Ron DeSantis, Sen. Blaise Ingoglia, and Jenell Flynn, a Jacksonville resident, hosted a rountable discussion on property taxes in Jacksonville on May 9, 2025. (Screenshot via governor's X livestream)A week after Republican members of the Florida House offered seven proposed constitutional amendments to address property tax reform on the 2026 ballot, Gov. Ron DeSantis has dismissed all of them, saying they reflect a lack of seriousness from the chamber.
“Placing more than one property tax measure on the ballot represents an attempt to kill anything on property taxes,” DeSantis said in his first comments since the proposals were unveiled in a message on his X account on Wednesday night. “It’s a political game, not a serious attempt to get it done for the people.”
In dismissing the proposals so cavalierly, the governor indicated he is still willing to play hardball with House Republicans, with whom he feuded often during the regular 2025 legislative session earlier this year.
In explaining the various proposals, House Speaker Daniel Perez said in a memo last week that it was his position that “the House does not need to limit itself in presenting one plan, but instead allow the people of Florida the ability to choose some, all, or none of the proposals on the 2026 ballot.”
All of the proposals filed last week exempted the portion of property taxes that fund K-12 schools, and they all had language specifically prohibiting local governments from reducing funding for law enforcement. Property taxes comprise around 46% of school funding, according to the Florida Education Association.
Senate President Ben Albritton still has not commented on the House proposals, which were filed as resolutions. They would need to be approved by three-fifths of each chamber to make it on the statewide ballot, where they must get 60% support for passage.
“Stay tuned,” the governor added on social media about what comes next in this discussion.
DeSantis and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Blaise Ingoglia have been on the campaign trail for months insisting that Floridians need property tax relief, promising they will get the chance to vote on such a proposal in the form of a constitutional amendment on the 2026 November ballot.
Ingoglia and his team of auditors inside the CFO’s office have traveled throughout the state to highlight what he claims is excessive spending by local governments. The events seem intended to preempt arguments by local governments that to eliminate or substantially reduce property taxes would pose an existential threat to essential services such as police protection, firefighter services, roads, and parks.
In the case of the City of Tampa for example, Mayor Jane Castor’s proposed fiscal year 2026 budget shows that every dollar of Tampa’s $380 million in property tax revenue is allocated to police and fire services.
Meanwhile, Ingoglia took his campaign promoting the yet-to-be written constitutional amendment to Miami Thursday.
The CFO said that the city had “excessively” spent $94 million over the amount that would account for population and inflation in its general fund budget in the 2024-25 fiscal year. He added that going back to the 2019-20 fiscal year, the general fund budget had increased by $358 million in five years.
“If this was a business, the City of Miami would go bankrupt,” he said, declaring that elected officials in the city had engaged in fiscal irresponsibility.
When asked by a reporter if he was essentially “big footing” local communities by questioning the spending priorities of elected officials who were voted in by the public, Ingoglia said he thought it was “highly suspect” that people were “voting for priorities for wasteful and excessive spending.”
He then acknowleged that it would “up to the taxpayers” to decide what they want to do with the information his office is providing in the press conferences he is conducting.
The Phoenix reached out to Miami Mayor Francis Suarez office for comment, but did not receive an immediate response.

JXN Water, the city’s third-party water manager, raised the alarm several times this year over funding shortfalls and said last month the system was “insolvent.” The utility is losing $3 million a month, it says.
“We think that the state’s assistance is going to be required,” Horhn told members of the Capital City Revitalization Select Committee. “We have to come up with an additional revenue stream, at least temporarily, over the next few years until we can get the water system back to solvency.” 
The mayor listed a few avenues for funding, such as increasing tax diversions from the Capital City Improvement District or increasing the city’s one-percent sales tax. The latter, though, may put local businesses in a tough position, he added. 
JXN Water’s funding shortfall includes funds for debt payments. The utility warned in September that if it can’t make debt payments, the state would have to start diverting some of the city’s sales tax revenue. Horhn confirmed that was the case, but said Jackson was able to pay the $5 million owed by December. It’s unclear how much longer the city would be able to cover those payments without additional water funding.

The mayor went on to address what happens to the city’s water and sewer systems, which are both under the control of JXN Water, after the third-party manager steps aside. Horhn said he wants control of the systems to return to the city, and laid out a plan for an independent advisory board to run them separately from Jackson’s public works department.
His vision of the advisory board includes a majority of appointees from the Jackson mayor’s office. Because the city serves places outside of Jackson, such as Ridgeland and Byram, Horhn said a minority of appointees could come from the state or from those other municipalities. The board would then hire a third-party company to manage and operate the utilities. 
Rep. Shanda Yates, a Republican from Jackson and the committee’s chairwoman, asked how Horhn’s plan would differ from lawmakers’ past attempts to put the city’s utilities under a separate utility authority. Those plans, the mayor said, gave the state a majority control. Moreover, a bill last year from Sen. David Parker, a Republican from Olive Branch, would have taken away Jackson’s ownership of the systems. 
The governor would have likely vetoed Parker’s bill because it would have made the state responsible for Jackson’s debts, added Horhn, who served in the state Senate at the time.

Ted Henifin, who runs JXN Water, was invited to speak at Thursday’s hearing but couldn’t attend because of a “traveling conflict,” Yates said. 
Both the mayor and Rep. Fabian Nelson, a Democrat whose district includes part of Jackson, criticized JXN Water over its handling of billing issues. The utility, for instance, doesn’t have a process to challenge bill amounts, Horhn said, adding his proposal would include an “appeals judge” to handle such cases.
“I have 10 constituents that have reached out to me in the last 24 hours with $37,000 water bills, $70,000 water bills, and they’ve all been told that it’s due to a leak,” Nelson said. “Every last one of them has had plumbers verify that it’s not a leak.”
Adding to the challenges, the utility doesn’t have anyone who customers can talk with in-person about billing issues, and constituents are having trouble getting answers through JXN Water’s phone helpline, he said.

“I have a lot of questions, but these are mainly geared toward JXN Water, which did not show up today,” Nelson went on to say. “This has to stop. We have people whose water is being turned off every single day.”
JXN Water told Mississippi Today earlier this month that it was shutting off about 1,000 accounts per week over nonpayment.
Yates said she would coordinate another time to bring Henifin before the committee. The chairwoman asked Horhn about a Jackson City Council vote earlier this month, which approved a resolution asking U.S. District Court Judge Henry Wingate to place control of the water and sewer systems back under the city. Council members echoed similar concerns from residents about communicating with the utility.
Wingate, though, has the ultimate say about when to turn over management of the systems, the mayor said. Henifin has projected he’ll be the third-party manager until 2027.
JXN Water is still awaiting a decision from the judge, who appointed Henifin to his role in 2022, regarding a proposed rate increase the utility first requested in April. The current water bill rates, even with perfect collections, wouldn’t be enough to fund operations and pay for the system’s debt, Henifin has said. The collection rate is now about 70%.
In a statement after Thursday’s hearing, the utility said it had told lawmakers ahead of time that Henifin couldn’t attend.
“The creation of JXN Water itself was born out of a period when collaboration and coordination around solutions for Jackson’s water system were lacking,” the statement said. “We welcome any dialogue aimed at strengthening the system for the people of Jackson and ensuring that future governance structures are grounded in transparency, accountability, and apolitical leadership.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/27124544/3X0A3389.jpg,,,2025-10-23 17:18:11.560227

Bishop William Barber speaks to a crowd outside the N.C. General Assembly on Oct. 23, 2025. (Photo: Ahmed Jallow/NC Newsline)Civil rights attorneys announced plans Thursday to challenge North Carolina’s newly drawn congressional districts, arguing the Republican-led map is designed to weaken Black voting power in the state’s northeast.
Lawyers with the nonprofit firm Forward Justice, speaking at a press conference in front of the General Assembly building in Raleigh, said they will file a legal challenge targeting changes to the 1st congressional district, a predominantly rural region that has elected a Black representative since 1992.
“These maps will erode the voting rights advances achieved over decades in the Black Belt region. The new maps dismantle a district that is over 40% Black, and it has consistently elected a Black representative,” said Kathleen Roblez, senior voting rights counsel at Forward Justice.
The legislature this week finalized new congressional district lines designed to create an additional Republican seat.
Republicans drew the new congressional district boundaries at the behest of President Donald Trump, who is looking to prevent Democrats from taking a majority in the U.S. House after next year’s midterm elections.
The new plan will bring the state congressional delegation from 10 Republicans and four Democrats to 11 Republicans and three Democrats.
Critics of the new plan claim that it violates the federal Voting Rights Act by preventing Black voters from electing the candidate of their choice.
Republican legislators denied that claim, and maintained they did not use racial data in crafting the new plan. They said they believe the new map will be upheld by the courts.
US Rep. Don Davis (D-N.C.) narrowly won reelection to a second term last year.
The district as legislators created it for the 2024 election is the subject of an ongoing federal lawsuit. A three-judge panel is deciding whether the 1st District, other congressional districts, and state Senate districts dilute Black voting power.
Speaking at the event, Rev. William Barber, founder of Repairers of the Breach, called the redistricting “political robbery.”
“It is a boldfaced lie when they say that they don’t know what this is doing to Black voters and poor voters,” Barber said. “They know exactly what they’re doing. It’s the data that they use to make these decisions.”
Barber framed the changes as a continuation of efforts to suppress Black political participation in eastern North Carolina. “This effort is racist,” he said. “This is a direct attack on the state’s Black Belt district and marginalized community.”
Neither Senate Leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) nor House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) immediately responded to a request for comment.
Ashley Mitchell, an attorney with Forward Justice, said the new maps follow years of efforts to limit voter participation in North Carolina, including voter ID requirements, attempts to shorten early voting, restrictions on voter registration, and attacks on absentee ballots.
“This most likely will not be the last attempt to silence voters, especially Black voters across the state, though this devastating attack had intentions of silencing us,” Mitchell said.” We are not going to sit back. We are going to fight back.”
Forward Justice attorneys declined to disclose the details of their legal strategy.
Even though Republicans have said race played no role in redrawing the district, Barber said that racial intent must be judged by a policy’s consequences, not just the language used to justify it. “You look at the impact, and what they have done will directly impact the Black Belt of North Carolina,” he said.

Sam Douglass, the now-former state senator from Orleans County, submitted his official resignation Wednesday following countrywide backlash to leaked, hateful comments he and others made in a national Young Republicans group chat.
Douglass’ letter of resignation mirrored a statement he released last week apologizing for the “offense” his comments caused and describing nasty messages he’d received since news of his involvement first broke.  
Gov. Phil Scott will appoint a replacement for Douglass, though the timeline for that process is unknown.

Douglass did not respond to a request for comment. 
A Politico story last week revealed remarks Young Republican leaders, including Douglass and his wife, Brianna Douglass, made in a Telegram group chat. According to the report, Douglass said that an Indian woman wasn’t actually Indian, “She just didn’t bathe often.” The story quoted Brianna characterizing Jews as dishonest.
The Politico exposé included members of the Young Republicans chat referring to rape as “epic” and expressing “love” for Hitler, in addition to a slew of other racist and homophobic comments.
Douglass faced immediate calls for his resignation from across the political spectrum that only escalated in the days that followed. 
Amid that cacophony, an online fundraiser purportedly created by Douglass is seeking to raise $30,000 to support his family. On the webpage, Douglass wrote that he was “targeted by a coordinated media and political barrage that purposefully took my words out of context and colluded to remove me from all my positions, fire us both from our jobs, and slander our reputation.”
Jennifer Stratton, the CEO of Lamoille County Mental Health Services, where Douglass was previously employed, confirmed that he no longer works at the organization. 
As of Monday, Douglass remained chair of the Orleans County Republican Committee, which will help develop a list of potential Senate replacements to submit to the governor. 
On Thursday, Anya Tynio, the committee’s vice chair, declined to comment on whether Douglass remained in his leadership position. She said the county Republican committee planned to hold a meeting Oct. 30, and she said she’d share a statement at that time.

(Alison Miller/MNS)WASHINGTON — Hamtramck Mayor Amer Ghalib forcefully defended past comments and years of social media activity during intense questioning by lawmakers at his confirmation hearing to be the next U.S. Ambassador to Kuwait on Thursday.
Ghalib faced scrutiny from eight members of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations over his past statements on conflicts in the Middle East, including the war in Gaza. His nomination hearing was postponed in September after criticism from several groups committed to fighting antisemitism, including the Anti-Defamation League, the American Jewish Committee, and StopAntisemitism.
Ranking Member Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) told Ghalib, “I have grave concerns about some of the statements that you have made, particularly those that seem to justify the October 7th attack against Israel.”
Shaheen referenced quotes from Ghalib’s “hometown news outlet.” The Hamtramck Review reported in May that at a pro-Palestinian rally in 2023, Ghalib allegedly “justified Palestinian violence against Israel for its brutality against Palestinians, and denied that sexual violence happened against Israelis when Hamas militants invaded Israel on Oct. 7.”
Ghalib said he “totally condemn[s] what happened on October 7th.” He also said some of his statements were taken out of context and claimed the “media was biased in translating.”
Despite Ghalib’s reassurances, senators from both parties said they would not support his nomination, including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who said he was “concerned that [Ghalib’s] stated public positions are markedly in conflict with the views of President Trump and with the positions of the United States.”
Ghalib replied, “I wouldn’t go against the President and his policies.”
Other Republican senators also said they’re worried Ghalib’s perspectives on the Middle East will contradict the messages the Trump administration hopes to convey overseas.
Sens. Dave McCormick (R-Penn.) and Cruz questioned Ghalib about allegedly liking a social media post comparing Jewish people to monkeys.
Ghalib called his previous social media activity, including his tendency to like every comment underneath his posts, a “bad habit.” He also said many of his controversial posts were made while he was a “private citizen,” before he was elected Hamtramck Mayor in 2021.
Multiple senators also referenced a post in which Ghalib allegedly called Saddam Hussein, the former leader of Iraq, a “martyr.” Ghalib said he made the post “in a moment of anger” after Iran launched missile strikes aimed at U.S. troops in Iraq in response to the U.S. killing of top Iranian general Quassem Suleimani in January 2020.
“As a private citizen, it is fine for you to have those views,” Sen. Shaheen said. “But it is very different when you are an ambassador representing the United States of America, particularly in a country that Saddam Hussein invaded.”
“I complimented Saddam because he kept Iran in check,” Ghalib said, “and probably that’s the only positive thing he did in his life.”
Ghalib, a Democrat and immigrant from Yemen, endorsed Trump for president and campaigned with him in Hamtramck in October 2024. Trump credited the Hamtramck mayor with helping him win Michigan and nominated Ghalib for the ambassador role in March.

Ghalib is the third Michigander appointed to a diplomatic position in the Middle East by the Trump administration this year. Bill Bazzi, former mayor of Dearborn Heights, was confirmed as the U.S. Ambassador to Tunisia this month. This week, Trump also appointed Mark Savaya, owner of Leaf and Bud dispensaries throughout southeast Michigan, as the U.S. special envoy to Iraq.
According to Ghalib, the president personally reaffirmed his commitment to the nominee earlier in the month following criticism from several groups. 
“President Trump has just called me and emphasized his unwavering support to me to serve as the next Ambassador of the United States to the state of Kuwait, and he thanked our community for their support,” Ghalib wrote in a Facebook post.
Ghalib’s confirmation could take weeks or even months. Ghalib must receive a majority of votes from the committee before his nomination can be voted on by the full Senate. It is unclear when that will take place.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-23 20:39:46+00:00,CT Mirror,Mostly dead Crystal Mall tries on something new: nuclear sub manufacturing,P.R. Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/23/electric-boat-crystal-mall-expansion-southeastern-ct/,"Electric Boat will convert the mall into a facility for 3,000 to 5,000 staff in engineering, training, software development and other roles.","Nuclear submarine manufacturer General Dynamics Electric Boat announced Thursday that it is acquiring the majority of the largely vacant Crystal Mall in Waterford. 
The acquisition comes a few months after Electric Boat purchased the mall’s former Macy’s location. The company now owns most of the mall, with a former Sears location being the only exception. 
Speaking to reporters and a small crowd of community members outside the mall Thursday, Electric Boat President Mark Rayha said the property will be renovated, with groundbreaking expected in mid-2026. 
Once complete, the company expects to move engineering, training, software development and other support staff into the building. Somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000 workers are expected to use the property, which is estimated to open in 2027. 
Submarine production, including that of Virginia-class and Columbia-class submarines, will continue at the company’s Groton facility, roughly five miles away from the mall.
Rayha said the mall acquisition will bring economic benefits to both Electric Boat and the Southeastern Connecticut region. “You build a mall in a location where you can track a lot of people from a lot of areas,” he said. “So doing this here is a great opportunity.”
Local officials echoed the sentiment, saying the company’s expansion would boost the region’s status as hub in the submarine supply chain. 
“We are repurposing a regional destination into a dynamic engine of opportunity again,“ said Waterford First Selectman Rob Brule. 
‘Malls… going the way of the dodo’
Officials hope the redevelopment will breathe new life into the mall property, which has been on a decline. When the Crystal Mall was listed for sale in 2023, the property was said to be 64% full. By September of this year, just around 25% of the mall was still in use, according to CT Insider.  
Keeping stores open has been a struggle for malls across the country, as the rise of online commerce reduced foot traffic and sales. As a result, malls have become popular sites for redevelopment projects, both in Connecticut and nationwide.

Many of these projects have involved transforming properties into public gathering spaces, mixed-use developments, entertainment hubs or housing. The Electric Boat acquisition is different, instead revamping the large property for use by a single company — specifically, a manufacturer. 
Still, state officials said the move, which comes as Electric Boat continues a streak of acquisition and expansion in Southeastern Connecticut, is a smart one. 
“Malls across the state and across the country are falling a little out of favor. They’re going the way of the dodo,” said Gov. Ned Lamont. “And you’ve got to figure out how you repurpose and make sense of this. This will be hundreds of thousands of square feet of space to make sure that our submarine fleet stays the very best in the world.”
Electric Boat has grown significantly over the past few years, and the company’s rapid expansion has spurred calls for more parking and housing space in the areas near its Groton production facility, which has brought on thousands of new workers. 
That hiring shows little sign of slowing down. Rayha said the company is expected to hire close to 500 workers before the end of 2025 with an additional 2,000 hires expected in 2026. When the Crystal Mall facility does come online, it will house both current workers and new employees.
The mall, officials and company leaders said, is the perfect place to support that growth. 
“The demand and the need for more space, more parking — which, again, is also a big issue in Groton — fits perfectly with the Crystal Mall as a solution,” said U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District. “It really just solves so many problems for what is going to be a huge era in terms of the industrial base growth.” 
For thriving shops, ‘a real kick in the gut’
Converting a mall to a large defense industrial facility requires some creative thinking. Electric Boat leaders said they expect standalone restaurants near the mall to continue operating with little change. And the mall’s exterior will largely be maintained, according to Rayha. 
“If you work at Electric Boat and this has been your mall for a number of years, you’ll be able to notice the uniqueness of the mall even when you’re working in it as an engineer,” Rayha said. 
But other details are less clear. There are still open stores in Crystal Mall, which raised questions about exactly what will happen to those businesses when Electric Boat begins renovations next year. 
Aed Powell, a manager at Toy Vault, a collectibles and toy store that has operated out of the mall for more than a decade, said he wondered what might become of his store and other mall tenants. Powell has managed the Crystal Mall location since late spring. On Thursday, he told reporters that while officials framed the mall as in dire need of help, his store is performing well. 
“I have staff who love to be here. I have staff who love to work here, who are excited to come in day after day,” he said in an interview after the morning press conference. 
Powell has had little time to process the announcement, only finding out Wednesday evening. The news of the acquisition was hard to swallow in the moment. “It’s a real kick in the gut,” he said, noting that the defense contractor’s expansion shouldn’t come at the expense of other local workers. 
For now, Powell expects his store to remain open until he is told otherwise. After the press conference, city officials and business groups passed him their cards, hoping to connect and offer assistance.
With the redevelopment project still taking shape, local officials said the change will be a net positive to the area. 
“For decades, the Crystal Mall served as a hub of commerce and connection,” Brule said. “Now, through this remarkable redevelopment, it will once again serve the region, this time as a center for innovation, skilled jobs and continued economic growth.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1023_MN_CrystalMall_014-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 17:01:11.653288

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma is losing out on millions in sports betting revenue to other states and illegal operators, a Senate panel was told Thursday.
Sports betting is legal in 39 states, creates about 2 million jobs and has about a $325 billion dollar impact, said Frank Sizemore, who is with the Sports Betting Alliance, which is made up of five companies.
His comments were made during a Senate interim study by Sen. Bill Coleman, R-Ponca City, that brought many of the key players together, including an executive with the Oklahoma City Thunder NBA team. Lawmakers often use those studies to help craft legislation.
“Sports betting is happening now in the state,” Sizemore said. “It is just on illegal platforms and with bookies down the street.”
Illegal markets have no taxes, accountability or regulation, Sizemore said.
“Weakening the illegal market strengthens the legal one,” he said.
States that allow sports betting tax it at an average of about 16%, Sizemore said.
When states have high taxes, those who bet stay in the illegal market, he said.
For years, Oklahoma lawmakers have unsuccessfully sought to legalize sports betting, but faced obstacles, such as setting up a system that complies with gaming compacts that give tribes exclusive rights in exchange for fees. 
The tribes pay the state between 4% and 10% of adjusted gross revenue, said Matthew Morgan, Oklahoma Indian Gaming Association chairman. The organization represents 25 of the 35 tribal governments that offer gaming.

The 35 tribal nations operate more than 130 gaming facilities, according to the association.
In fiscal year 2025, Oklahoma collected over $221 million in tribal exclusivity fees, a 5% increase over the prior year, according to the Oklahoma Gaming Compliance Unit Annual Report.
“The state made a promise,” Morgan said, adding that it agreed to protect the tribes’ substantial exclusivity to operate gaming in exchange for a share fees. He said that over the life of the compacts, tribes have paid over $2.2 billion to the state.
Failure to comply with the compacts could result in monetary damages against the state, Morgan said.
Morgan said only the Oklahoma Lottery and tribes are authorized to conduct gaming in the state.
“Any breakdown in the gaming compacts would create major uncertainty for both the casino industry in Oklahoma, a major economic driver for both the tribes and the state, leading to legal challenges, legal costs that threaten the operational stability of the casinos,” said Rep. Ken Luttrell, R-Ponca City.

Luttrell and Coleman have both worked to legalize sports betting.
Will Syring, Oklahoma City Thunder vice president of corporate partnerships, said legislative efforts to legalize sport betting would have to be done within the boundaries of the gaming compacts.
Syring said the Oklahoma City Thunder is seeking 0.25% of total bets.
“Because in other markets, teams are getting a direct license,” he said. “If they’re getting licenses, they’re getting paid off those bets. The league also only allows you to take a percentage off of the top.”
Diversification of revenue streams allow the NBA organization to be competitive, he said. 
“It’s not just hot dogs and foam fingers and tickets and sponsorships,” he said. 
Sports betting would elevate fan engagement, he said. 
“We have 20 million social media followers, so when we do something, people listen,” Syring said. “When we announce a new product or a player move, people hear about it because they are following our feeds.”
When sports betting is legalized, the organization can use its “megaphone” to tell followers how to legally and safely bet through the existing compacting process, he said.

(Photo by Lori Kersey/West Virginia Watch)West Virginia’s public employees would see their health insurance costs increase yet again next year under a proposal outlined Thursday.
The finance board of the West Virginia Public Employees Insurance Agency on Thursday proposed the following increases for fiscal year 2027, which begins in July:

For state employees: a 3% aggregate premium increase for employees and employers, a $200 increase in the average family’s spousal surcharge, and a $2.50 increase of the employer administrative fee.
For non-state employees, a 3% aggregate premium increase for employers and employees. The administrative fee would increase by $2.50. Non-state employers would also be required to have at least 50% of their employees enrolled in a PEIA health plan. 
For both Medicare and non-Medicare retirees, a 3% premium increase. PEIA would also designate $30 million of fiscal year 2025 investment gain for the retiree premium stabilization reserve.

More details on the proposed increases are available in the board presentation from Thursday. 
The proposal comes after state workers employees have seen health insurance increases over the last few years. 
In July, PEIA premiums went up by 14% for state employees and by 16% for local government employees. Out-of-pocket and copay costs also went up. The agency also raised premiums by 12% for retirees.
PEIA leaders have said that the rising cost of health care — particularly inflation on prescription GLP-1 drugs that treat obesity and diabetes — are a major driver of the rate increases.
Speaking to the finance board Thursday, PEIA director Brent Wolfingbarger pointed out that 96.7% of PEIA revenue goes to PEIA claim payments and capitation, and the agency has low overhead. 
He referenced a report from the firm BDO that indicated that the sharp rate increases that public workers have had in recent years had been caused in large part because between the years 2018- 2022, rates had been frozen.
“If you look at that graph, you can see that there’s a much sharper, steep curve at the end of the period where we were required to increase premiums because we had failed to keep pace with rising premium levels,” he said, pointing to a presentation. 
He also noted that PEIA is required by law to charge a spousal surcharge equal to the total actuarial value of the plan for PEIA spouses who have the option of health insurance through an employer but choose to enroll in a PEIA plan.
“Our agency is obligated to estimate what the actuarial value of the health care expenses that our employee spouses will incur, and pass that on to the employees,” he said. “That is not something that we have discretion over. It is something that is an obligation established for us in the code.”
Dale Lee, president of Education West Virginia, a teachers’ union, pointed out that public employees are not to blame for premiums being stagnant from 2018 and 2022. Gov. Jim Justice had pledged to keep rates flat. 
“It was the governor at that time saying that increases will not happen on his watch,” Lee said. “And that necessitated then in 2021 a 24.5% premium increase on employees. And I would much rather have small increments along the way than to have no increases [and] all of a sudden, a huge increase. So while that’s an accurate statement, it wasn’t our fault.”
Lee said he would push lawmakers to make the spousal surcharge based on a percentage rather than a flat fee.  
“Because the custodian, making $22,000 a year, whose spouse works at Go-Mart, is paid a much higher percentage on the spousal surcharge than the superintendent of a county, making $180,000 a year,” Lee said. 
He added that the Legislature, not the finance board, is responsible for improving PEIA. 
“I’m trying to deflect early some of the anger that’s going to be at the finance board at these public hearings,” Lee said. “Because changes can be made, but you all don’t have the ability to make those changes. You have to deal with what you’re given. The ability to make the changes comes from the Legislature. And if we want to express concern or anger or frustration, that’s where we need to express that.”
The increases for retirees are equal to about $4 million, which the Legislature could “easily” find to prevent a cost increase, Lee said. 
The PEIA board finance is planning public hearings about the rate increases across the state in November. They are scheduled for 6 p.m. on the following dates:

The Highlands Event Center in Wheeling on Nov. 3
The Beckley-Raleigh Convention Center on Nov. 6 
Holiday Inn in Martinsburg on Nov. 10
The Culture Center in Charleston on Nov. 13
Virtual meeting via Google Meet on Nov. 20

Registration for each meeting will begin at 5:30 p.m. More information on the public hearings is available at the PEIA website. 
The board is expected to vote on the proposals at its meeting Dec. 4.

State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, a vocal opponent, drove more than four hours from her home district to learn more about the facility than has been shared with Democratic lawmakers. (Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen announced Thursday that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement inspectors have certified a Nebraska state prison to begin receiving federal detainees as it becomes a migrant detention facility.
Pillen said ICE inspectors completed a final walkthrough of the former McCook Work Ethic Camp this week, and the timeline for the first detainees to come to Nebraska is still being coordinated. Pillen said getting the final pieces together had been “a moving target” with the federal shutdown now on day 23.
“Given the many tasks that had to be completed, including the transfer of remaining inmates, building modifications, training of staff and other components, we have made significant progress,” Pillen said in a statement.

Final security upgrades will continue in McCook “over the next day or so,” Pillen said, and additional modifications will allow the facility to house up to 300 detainees, from a maximum of about 200.
Pillen’s update comes less than 24 hours before a Red Willow County District Court judge will hear arguments on a lawsuit seeking to temporarily stop the Nebraska-ICE partnership. The lawsuit is from 13 McCook residents and former State Sen. DiAnna Schimek of Lincoln. It argues the Nebraska-ICE contract is unconstitutional without legislative approval because of language they say delegates management of the state’s prisons to the Legislature.
The lawsuit also argues that lawmakers had specified and funded the purpose of the McCook facility in law. The detention center remains state-owned and operated.
Pillen and Rob Jeffreys, director of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services, are named in the lawsuit.
Attorney General’s Office arguments
Nebraska signed contract with ICE on Sept. 30 to turn state prison into migrant detention center

The Nebraska Attorney General’s Office, on behalf of Pillen and Jeffreys in court filings this week, asked for the lawsuit to be dismissed and all but said the train has left the station. 
“Should the court void the state’s contract with the federal government, that would release the federal government from its obligations to compensate the state for this work. Taxpayers would therefore suffer a greater injury from preliminary relief than without it,” the brief states. “Not to mention the damage that preliminary relief would do to the state’s relationship with the federal government.”
Under the contract, ICE plans to pay Nebraska around $2.5 million monthly. Pillen’s office estimates the deal could net Nebraska $14.25 million annually. The contract was not publicly available until Oct. 17. It was signed Sept. 30. Pillen announced the initial plan Aug. 19. The lawsuit was filed Oct. 15.
The AG’s Office said the Legislature “broadly” delegated the day-to-day operations of state facilities to the executive branch and said the contract doesn’t change McCook’s “overarching purpose” as a detention center, so “any change is one of degree, not kind.”
Pillen’s office defends 17-day delay in releasing Nebraska-ICE detention contract

State attorneys said the McCook residents and Schimek are not best-suited to challenge the facility, suggesting a more proper lawsuit could come instead from the Legislature, state inmates transferred from the Work Ethic Camp to other state facilities or federal detainees. The AG’s Office said a better “check” on separation of powers concerns is the Legislature and the political process, not by going through the courts or by “random taxpayers.”
“Taxpayers who object to the defendants’ actions have the same remedy as any other Nebraskan: the ballot box,” the AG’s Office wrote.
‘Every state is a border state’
Nick Grandgenett, an attorney for the McCook residents and Schimek, framed the case last week as “not about immigration” but “our constitutional republican form of government.”
The AG’s Office criticized the lawsuit for not including all “indispensable parties” — the U.S. government, as well as a fencing company contracted to build a razor wire around the facility.
“Plaintiffs cannot use purportedly illegal expenditures related to the McCook facility — costs that the federal government will reimburse — as a bootstrap to obtain the standing necessary to present their real challenge, which is aimed at the entire cooperative agreements and federal immigration enforcement activity,” the state’s attorneys wrote.
Jeffreys, in a Thursday statement, said his department’s “attention to detail” at the Work Ethic Camp and a strong partnership and cooperation with ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security made certification possible.
“Passing these inspections is a testament to our team’s commitment to safety, security and professionalism,” Jeffreys said. He signed the initial two-year Nebraska-ICE contract Sept. 30 for the state.
Pillen said that once operational, the rebranded “Cornhusker Clink” will regionally support ICE officials “who are working tirelessly to identify illegal criminals and get them off our streets.”

Members of the House Regulatory Reform Committee discussed but did not amend or advance House Bill House 5104, Bill 5105, House Bill 5106 and House Bill 5107.
Derek Sova, a policy and legislative assistant for the Cannabis Regulatory Agency, told the committee previously that Michigan’s legal marijuana industry faced several challenges, and that two of those big hurdles were large illicit grow operations and the agency’s inability to go after bad actors because their licenses had expired.
The series of bills before the committee would address those concerns.
House Bill 5105 and House Bill 5107 are sponsored by state Reps. Pauline Wendzel (R-Watervliet) and Mike Hoadley (R-Au Gres), respectively. The bills would in tandem create new penalties for cultivating, delivering and processing black market marijuana, but also change the amount of marijuana a person is legally allowed to possess in plant and concentrate form.
The bills are tie-barred together, meaning both would have to jointly clear the Legislature and be signed by the governor to become law.
Under Wendzel’s bill, a person would be guilty of a misdemeanor if they possess between 10 and 25 kilograms, or between 50 and 100 plants, or between one and 2.5 kilograms of marijuana concentrate. The penalty would change to up to one year in jail or a $20,000 fine, or both.
Keeping between 25 and 125 kilograms, or between 100 and 500 plants, or between 2.5 and 12.5 kilograms of marijuana concentrate would become a felony punishable by two years in prison or a $500,000 fine, or both.
It would also be a felony offense to:

Keep between 125 and 250 kilograms, or between 500 and 1,000 plants, or between 12.5 and 25 kilograms. That could net a person four years in prison or a $2 million fine or both; and
Keep 250 kilograms or more, or 1,000 plants or more, or 25 kilograms or more of marijuana concentrate. The punishment there would be up to 10 years in prison or a $10 million fine, or both.

Sponsored by state Rep. Kristian Grant (D-Grand Rapids), House Bill 5104 would allow the Cannabis Regulatory Agency to sanction a person even if they are no longer a licensee or if they are no longer operating a marijuana facility.
At present, the Medical Marihuana Facilities Licensing Act holds that the expiration of a state-issued license terminates the authority of the agency to impose sanctions. The bill from Grant would retain that position but would add that the authority to impose sanctions would continue if there was already a pending action against a former licensee or facility operator.
War of words continues over who greenlit Michigan wholesale pot tax: Brinks or Hall?

House Bill 5106, sponsored by state Rep. Jerry Neyer (R-Shepherd), would amend the state’s Regulation and Taxation of Marihuana Act to similarly address disciplinary action on recreational licenses. The bill would let the agency summarily suspend a license if the licensee’s conduct poses a risk to the health, safety or welfare of the public. 
Much like House Bill 5104, Neyer’s legislation would also give the agency authority to take disciplinary action against a person who no longer holds a license or if their license has recently expired.
The risks that could lead to license suspension or discipline, as outlined in the bill, include possessing marijuana from a source that cannot be determined, keeping marijuana stashes obtained in violation of the act, obstructing an agency investigation, and failing to provide the agency with required records.
Neyer’s bill affects growers, processors, retailers, microbusinesses, safety compliance facilities and secure transporters.
State Rep. Emily Dievendorf (D-Lansing) said they were concerned about upticks in enforcement given that some industry folk were previously on the negative end of marijuana enforcement when it was illegal in Michigan. She questioned whether it was right to increase enforcement when the state was actively beginning to tax marijuana sales at a higher rate, which some have warned will ultimately push consumers to the black market.
Sova said that the point of the package was to support the licensed industry, as much as possible, especially those following the rules.
“That’s the purpose of giving us the greater enforcement authority over the bad actors in the licensed space who are cheating, who are undermining the folks who are trying to do it the right way,” Sova said. “This has been an issue, I believe, in communities where you’ve had a lot of these large illicit outdoor growers. You’re talking sometimes thousands or tens of thousands of plants that, the way the statutes are set up right now, there’s really no disincentive to continue doing that.”
Sova added that Michigan has “become, in a lot of ways, sort of a central location for illicit operations, because the penalties for illicit activity are so low here.”
State Rep. Joseph Aragona (R-Clinton Township), the committee’s chair, said he agreed with Dievendorf.
“The 24% tax was difficult,” he said. “We obviously did not want to do in the House, but this could definitely help those legal growers who are going to be paying it, because, if I’m mistaken, the black market won’t be paying that tax.”
Sova said that was certainly the intention of the pending legislation.
Hoadley also testified along with Iosco County Prosecutor Jim Bacarella and Branch County Prosecutor Zach Stempien, both of whom supported the legislation and expressed concern for those working in the industry. Some of that concern had to deal with the exploitation of migrant workers or foreign nationals, which were issues brought up by the prosecutors during testimony.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced on Thursday she had granted a pardon request for Lue Yang, a Hmong refugee and president of the Hmong Family Association of Lansing who was detained by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement in July over a decades-old criminal conviction.
Yang was born in a refugee camp in Thailand, and came to the U.S. in 1979 as his parents fled Laos due to war and persecution for their support of the United States during the Vietnam War. In 1997, Yang was convicted on a home burglary charge, accepting a plea bargain and served a 10-month sentence. 
In 2018, Yang’s conviction was expunged, however, the federal government does not recognize the expungement. Yang’s conviction complicated his immigration status, and he has been denied while applying for citizenship, State Rep. Mai Xiong (D-Warren), explained in a video advocating for Yang’s release. On July 15, Yang was detained by ICE while at work, and he has remained in custody since. 
“Yesterday, I granted a pardon for Lue Yang, a devoted family man and respected leader in Michigan’s Hmong community,” Whitmer said in a statement issued Thursday morning. 

Whitmer’s statement explained that the pardon sets aside Yang’s conviction, allowing him to move forward without the conviction on his record. 
Despite the pardon, Yang still faces threats of deportation, as he was slated to depart on an ICE flight to Laos as of Wednesday night. 
However, Aisa Villarosa of the Asian Law Caucus, which has been working with Yang’s attorney, told the Michigan Advance that, to the best of their knowledge, Yang remains in the U.S., noting that the lack of transparency from ICE leaves family members lawyers and advocates to cobble together his location. 
Xiong, who was also a Hmong refugee, has strongly advocated for Yang’s return. Xiong said she was extremely grateful for the pardon, noting that his family is still facing difficulties in navigating the legal system to have him released. 
“I’m grateful for that pardon from the Governor, because that means that [Yang] will have an opportunity to fight for his release, yes, but we can only do that if he is still on U.S. soil or in U.S. air,” Xiong said.
Yang’s attorney is working to vacate his case through the county court system, Xiong said.

Rising Voices, a nonprofit organization focusing on increasing civic participation among Michigan’s Asian American residents, cheered the decision in a statement while addressing the urgent action to keep Yang in the U.S. 
“My family and I need Lue to return home where he belongs. This pardon shows the power of humanity and community,” Ann Vue, Yang’s wife said in a statement. “So many people stood with us, checked in on us, and refused to allow us to give up. We applaud and thank Governor Whitmer for her courage in granting Lue this pardon. Now we demand ICE and [the U.S. Department of Homeland Security] to bring Lue home to Michigan.”
On Thursday morning, state Sen. Stephanie Chang (D-Detroit) spoke out on the Senate floor about the deportation of several Hmong and Lao men, sharing the story of Khone Segmany, who like Yang, committed a low-level offense as a young man,  as well as another man named Khamsay.
“On behalf of Khone’s son, Khamsay’s sister, Lue Yang’s wife, Ann, and their families, we are all urging ICE to bring these men home. They are members of our community, they are fathers, and their families deserve to have them by their side,” Chang said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/gettyimages-2219519292-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 15:56:53.657833

The MBTA alone reported more than 600 assaults last year, including 33 assaults with weapons, 72 physical assaults and batteries, and 38 assaults and batteries with bodily fluids, Rep. Michael Day said as he introduced the bill (H 4645) that emerged from the Judiciary Committee he chairs.
The bill adds transit workers to the list of employees covered under the state law that imposes heightened penalties for assault and battery against public employees. It also makes clear that use of a bodily substance like saliva is covered under the assault charge. Rep. Joseph McGonagle of Everett, who sponsored the bill, said he’s seen the “injuries, scars and invisible wounds” of dozens of transit workers who were harmed on the job.
“I’ve met with workers who have been stabbed, threatened with firearms, spit on, and much more,” he said. “I’ve heard from a worker who has been left paralyzed and permanently disabled from one of these assaults.”
Under the House bill, which now goes to the Senate for consideration, offenders would face a sentence ranging from 90 days to two and a half years in a house of correction, a fine of between $500 and $5,000, or both. The head of the union that represents many MBTA operators said it hopes to see the Senate pass the same bill.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Two days after stepping down as chair of the state’s Cannabis Control Commission amid speculation she’d run for higher office, Kim Ahern made it official: She is running to be Rhode Island’s next attorney general.
Ahern on Thursday announced she had filed paperwork to join the Democratic primary to succeed Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, whose second and final term as the state’s top prosecutor ends after 2026. 
“Our fundamental rights are under attack, and we need an attorney general who will fight back,” she said in a statement.
Ahern, a former special assistant attorney general, said the ongoing legal battles with the Trump administration are deeply personal to her — pointing to the need to protect the legality of her marriage to her wife, Jenna, and to ensure their three daughters grow up with the same freedoms she has.
“The stakes are too high to sit on the sidelines,” she said.
Her campaign statement was issued by Josh Block, who is the spokesperson for Providence Mayor Brett Smiley’s campaign. Ahern’s website is “going up in the next day or so,” Block said in an email to Rhode Island Current.
A Providence resident, Ahern is a graduate of Providence College and Roger Williams University School of Law. She was a clerk for Rhode Island Supreme Court Justice Maureen McKenna Goldberg. 
From 2010 through 2019, Ahern served as a special assistant AG under three attorneys general: Neronha, Peter Kilmartin, and Patrick Lynch. She then went on to serve as deputy counsel for former Gov. Gina Raimondo and went on to become the deputy chief of staff for Gov. Dan McKee.
Ahern most recently served as the head of the three-member Cannabis Control Commission, a position she held since the panel’s inception by the state in 2023. As chair, she has helped craft the inaugural set of regulations governing Rhode Island’s budding recreational industry and oversaw the launch of applications for the state’s available 24 retail licenses.
She left her $204,069-a-year post Tuesday, one day after setting the timeline for regulators to review applications at the start of 2026, with the intention to start issuing new licenses by next May.
After stepping down as the state’s top pot regulator, Ahern now jumps into a race that included two other Democrats who have announced their intent to run in the 2026 AG primary: State Rep. Jason Knight of Barrington and Keith Hoffmann of Providence, who worked as the chief of policy and senior counsel under Neronha.
State Rep. Robert Craven, a North Kingstown Democrat, was the first to announce a bid for AG, but exited four days later after past allegations of domestic violence were brought to light.
Charles Calenda, who ran unsuccessfully against Neronha in 2022, posted to X on Oct. 17 that he was exploring another bid for the Republican nomination.
Knight had $90,419 in his campaign account as of the most recent filing from the end of June. Hoffmann’s campaign announced Oct. 6 that his account has raised $210,000 since he entered the race.
Ahern filed “initial notice of organization” papers with the Rhode Island Board of Elections to create her campaign account Wednesday. No contributions have yet been reported.
Third quarter filings, which date from July 1 through Sept. 30 are due to state election officials at the end of the month. Fourth quarter reports, which range from Oct. 1 through the end of 2025, are due Feb. 2, 2026.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s new chief of public schools said changes could be coming to the controversial academic standards for social studies that the state passed earlier this year.
State Superintendent Lindel Fields said Thursday he intends to restart the process of reviewing the social studies standards, obtaining public input, and presenting a draft to the Oklahoma State Board of Education and the state Legislature for approval. Typically updated every six years, academic standards are a lengthy list of topics that Oklahoma public schools must teach to students at each grade level.
Oklahoma already adopted new social studies standards this year under Fields’ predecessor, Ryan Walters, but they faced significant criticism over the last-minute addition of dubious content and for their inclusion of Bible teachings. The Oklahoma Supreme Court has blocked schools from implementing Walters’ social studies standards while two lawsuits are pending over them. 
Fields said his administration will ask the Court to extend that pause through the rest of the current school year, leaving state officials time to review the standards and potentially make rewrites.
“I think there will be some changes to them, yes,” Fields told news reporters Thursday after an Oklahoma State Board of Education meeting.
The board voted unanimously during the meeting to start a 60-day review period for “consideration and possible further action” on the social studies standards.
Fields said he believes the Court’s decision to pause the standards enables his administration and the board to make potential changes, even though the board and the Legislature already approved Walters’ version.

Walters’ standards claim there were “discrepancies” in the results of the 2020 presidential election between former President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump, whom Walters had endorsed. Walters said he didn’t intend to support or deny the 2020 election results, though his standards appeared to connect to Trump’s unverified claims of election fraud.
The former state superintendent, who resigned Sept. 30 to lead a conservative teacher organization, also added a claim that COVID-19 originated in a Chinese lab. The origin of the virus has not been determined, according to the World Health Organization.
Half of the state Board of Education members at the time said they had no idea the new language had been included until after they voted to approve Walters’ standards. Walters and his staff did not point out the new content before the board took a vote, and the Education Department didn’t publicly post the updated standards until weeks later.
Multiple lawsuits contend this violated state transparency laws and would enable misinformation to be taught in schools. The standards’ requirement that public schools teach students Bible stories also faces a legal challenge.
“I think we need to look at all of the things that were added to see if they’re germane to what kids need to learn,” said Fields, whom the governor appointed to finish Walters’ term.

,DC,2025-10-23 19:45:15+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump press secretary defends White House ballroom project amid East Wing teardown,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-press-secretary-defends-white-house-ballroom-project-amid-east-wing-teardown,,"WASHINGTON — Workers this week demolished the East Wing of the White House, originally built in 1942, to make room for construction of a ballroom that President Donald Trump had said wouldn’t impact the building. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended the roughly $300 million project during a Thursday briefing, saying it is the next in a long line of additions and renovations to the campus that have taken place throughout the country’s history. “Just trust the process,” Leavitt said. “This is going to be a magnificent addition to the White House for many years to come and it’s not costing the taxpayers anything.”The project is being fully financed by Trump and several private donors, including Amazon, Apple, Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., Caterpillar Inc., Comcast Corporation, Google, Lockheed Martin, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, T-Mobile, Union Pacific Railroad, investors Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss, among others. Photos from The Associated Press appeared to show the demolition, which was first reported Monday, complete.Leavitt said tearing down the East Wing did not need approval from the National Capital Planning Commission, according to a legal opinion from that organization, an executive-branch agency responsible for managing federal construction projects in and around Washington, D.C. “Their general counsel has said when it comes to phase one of this project, the tearing down of the current East Wing structure, a submission is not required legally for that,” Leavitt said. “Only for vertical construction will a submission be required and that’s a legal opinion from them and we are following that legal opinion.”Design modifiedTrump said in late July that construction of the ballroom “won't interfere with the current building” and ballparked the price at $200 million.  “It will be near it but not touching it. And pays total respect to the existing building, which I'm the biggest fan of,” Trump said at the time. “It's my favorite. It's my favorite place. I love it.”Leavitt, when pressed Thursday why the president didn’t tell Americans he would need to demolish the entire East Wing, said designs were modified throughout the process. “The plans changed when the president heard counsel from the architects and the construction companies, who said that in order for this East Wing to be modern and beautiful for many, many years to come, for it to be a truly strong and stable structure, this phase one that we’re now in was necessary,” Leavitt said.She didn’t offer an explanation for why the price had increased by $100 million, repeatedly saying no taxpayer money would go toward the ballroom. Security plans, official name unknownLeavitt declined to say whether the project will include upgrades to the bunker that sits below the East Wing, known as the president’s emergency operations center, citing security concerns. “Like any security enhancements that are made on the White House grounds, those will be made and maintained by the United States Secret Service,” she said. Trump is also deciding what exactly to name the new ballroom, though Leavitt declined to detail what he’s considering.  “There will be an official name,” she said. “I will let the president announce that once he firmly decides on it.”Trump is not currently considering any other major construction or renovation projects on the White House grounds, though Leavitt didn’t rule out that could happen during the remainder of his term, which will last until Jan. 20, 2029. “Not to my knowledge, no,” Leavitt said. “But he is a builder at heart, clearly. And so his heart and his mind is always churning about how to improve things here on the White House grounds. But at this point in time, of course, the ballroom is really the president’s main priority.” Call for preservationThe nonprofit National Trust for Historic Preservation sent a letter earlier this week urging an immediate halt to demolition of the East Wing “until plans for the proposed ballroom go through the legally required public review processes, including consultation and review by the National Capital Planning Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts, and to invite comment from the public.”President and CEO Carol Quillen wrote the 90,000-square-foot ballroom could easily dwarf the 55,000-square-foot White House. “As we approach the 250th Anniversary of our country’s founding, the preservation of historic places that represent our nation’s history has never been more relevant or important,” Quillen wrote. “We urge you to take into account the deep reverence that all Americans hold for this iconic place, and to initiate the review process that can ensure the preservation of the historic White House for future generations.”The National Capital Planning Commission could not be reached for comment Thursday since it is closed due to the ongoing government shutdown. The Commission of Fine Arts did not immediately return a request for comment. The White House Historical Association writes on its website that the East Wing was constructed in 1942 “to house additional staff and offices, reflecting the growing complexity of the federal government during World War II.” “The East Wing’s construction was highly controversial due to its timing during wartime,” the website states. “Congressional Republicans labeled the expenditure as wasteful, with some accusing (President Franklin D.) Roosevelt of using the project to bolster his presidency’s image. The secretive nature of the construction, tied to military purposes, further fueled suspicions. However, the East Wing’s utility in supporting the modern presidency eventually quieted critics.”",,,,2025-10-23 15:56:53.657833

The Minneapolis contract calls for Zencity to design a digital survey to measure community perception of the MPD and public safety. It then analyzes the response data to ‘improve’ police-community relations. Zencity presents itself as a partner of municipalities and law enforcement. 
When not using digital surveys, Zencity says it helps customers by gathering and analyzing millions of data points from the social media and internet activity of residents.
Whether through millions of collected data points or digital survey responses, Zencity says it enables law enforcement to hear from the entire community, not just the small number of people that show up at community meetings.
I see this as slick, sophisticated marketing — because the reality is very different.   
I believe that the Minneapolis Police Department should not be allowed to partner with a company like Zencity whose surveillance technology has its roots in Israel’s notorious military intelligence unit, Unit 8200, in which Eyal Feder-Levy, the founder of Zencity, served. 
Israel’s all-encompassing surveillance of Palestinians has led to the development of facial recognition, cell phone hacking and AI-powered technology that is now spilling into non-military use. 
The long-standing partnership between U.S. police and the Israeli military, which, until the current ceasefire, was carrying out a genocide, has created a backwash of violence and brutality into our Black and Indigenous communities.  
Zencity’s surveillance technology has been used by police departments throughout the U.S. to surveil social media during protests for racial justice, and monitor criticism of police and community outrage over police killings of Black people. 
MPD should not be allowed to partner with a company whose surveillance technology could easily be a tool of  racist law enforcement, especially given MPD’s own history of brutality and violence against those same communities.
Without that context, the Minneapolis contract with Zencity seems innocuous, as it is limited to online surveys. But Zencity uses existing digital advertising networks, like Meta, Google and X, to target digital advertisements to the local community. I object to police use of those ad algorithms on privacy grounds, based as they are on people’s social media and internet activity.  
Although Minneapolis is not currently using it, Zencity markets a product called “Organic” and a program called “Organic for Social Listening.” There’s no survey you decide whether or not to take — it’s a surveillance technology that law enforcement can use to collect millions of data points from social media platforms like Facebook, X, Instagram, Nextdoor and LinkedIn.  
Zencity then uses its advanced artificial intelligence capability “to surface important trends, sentiment, interactions, and summaries… This feature ensures that critical changes in community sentiment or conversation volume are quickly noticed.” In other words, it can analyze the data it collected without people’s knowledge and determine what you are posting about and what your opinions might be on any topic that law enforcement wants to zero in on.
I believe both the current and potential future use of Zencity by MPD pose a threat to the online privacy of Minneapolis residents. Beyond that, even the city’s selection of an Israeli company that is associated with apartheid Israel, a state found by the International Court of Justice to be committing a “’plausible’ genocide” in Gaza, I find to be unacceptable.
Like all Israeli companies it has benefited from the occupation and the apartheid system that provides resources and connections for Israeli high tech startups while denying the same to Palestinians.
As of October of 2025, survey results posted on the mayor’s dashboard show that Black and Indigenous residents feel significantly less safe than their white counterparts. Nor is there any improvement in those scores from the prior year. For anyone familiar with Minneapolis, this is not exactly earthshaking news.
I believe the $500,000 should have been used to address the real issues faced by residents of Minneapolis — housing, infrastructure, child care and health care. Instead it is being squandered on MPD’s “community perception” surveys. The residents of Minneapolis need a real solution to MPD’s history of racist and violent policing. Not some survey.  
The contract can be cancelled for any reason on 30 days notice. The city of Minneapolis and the MPD will have already wasted $350,000 — but we can still save $150,000 taxpayer dollars if the City Council and the Mayor act by December 1.

(Courtesy of WDTC)South Dakota’s four technical colleges continue to see increased enrollment in both full-time and dual credit programs, according to the 2025 fall enrollment report.
The state Board of Technical Education reviewed the report during its online meeting on Thursday.
Total enrollment increased 367 over last year, or 5%, with 7,774 students enrolled either as full-time or dual credit students (high-schoolers can take dual credit courses for high school and college credit). Jenna Reis, policy and data analyst for the board, said the increase is a “strong indicator that outreach and program investments on campuses are paying off.”


That increase contrasts with a fall enrollment report for South Dakota public universities with flat enrollment system-wide. The university system’s dual credit enrollment increased by 167, or just above 3%, with 5,335 students enrolled this year, said South Dakota Board of Regents spokeswoman Shuree Mortenson. 
Dual credit enrollment at technical colleges grew by 127 students, up to 1,474 — a 9.4% increase. 
At Lake Area Technical College in Watertown, dual credit enrollment includes more than 500 students from 78 South Dakota high schools, and 11 seniors are attending full-time, according to a news release from the school.


Health services remain the most popular programs at technical colleges, while agriculture, information technology and manufacturing all decreased in system-wide enrollment — by 62, 50 and 29, respectively.
Those decreased enrollments could be attributed to economic factors, especially regarding agriculture, board members and college presidents suggested. Trade policies, especially tariff discussions with China, continue to impact prices and profitability for farmers after a high crop production season in the state.
For Lake Area — the only college where information technology program enrollment increased — President Tiffany Sanderson credited the increase to a business and information technology partnership with Dakota State University, which specializes in computer science and information technology fields.
The partnership allows students to “climb the education ladder seamlessly from Watertown to Madison” in those fields, she said.
The other technical colleges are in Sioux Falls, Mitchell and Rapid City.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/western_dakota_technical_institute_cover-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 15:56:53.657833

Delaware’s ninth straight rate reduction highlights a continuing success story in controlling costs for businesses.
DOVER, Del. (Oct. 23, 2025) — Delaware Insurance Commissioner Trinidad Navarro on Thursday announced that workers’ compensation insurance rates will decrease for the ninth consecutive year, effective Dec. 1, marking another win for businesses but raising questions about the long-term effects of how those savings are achieved.
The Delaware Compensation Rating Bureau’s latest filing, confirmed by independent actuaries and approved after a public hearing, calls for an average loss-cost reduction of 11.6 percent in the voluntary market and 9.08 percent in the residual market, often considered the insurer of last resort. Actual savings will vary by policy.
“For nearly ten years, my administration has been able to approve rate decreases that help local businesses, and can attract new companies and jobs to Delaware,” Navarro said. “Delaware’s businesses used to pay some of the highest workers’ compensation premiums in the country, but bold policy changes have been successful in addressing that problem.”
Workers’ compensation insurance covers medical treatment and wage replacement for employees injured on the job. The new rates do not reduce benefits paid to workers but are expected to lower premiums for employers statewide.
Delaware Still Above National Average
Despite nine straight annual decreases, Delaware’s rates remain about 6 percent higher than the national average, ranking the state as the 23rd most expensive for coverage according to a national insurance tracking firm ( Workers Compensation Rates in Delaware). Just three years ago, Delaware ranked 7th, indicating substantial improvement but still lagging behind many peers.
Rates are set through data collected by the National Council on Compensation Insurance (NCCI), which reviews claims, payroll, and class-code data before recommending rates to the Delaware Department of Insurance. Insurers can apply credits or debits up to 25 percent based on each employer’s safety record and claims history.
Safety Programs and Savings
At the end of 2024, 932 employers participated in the department’s Workplace Safety Program, saving nearly $4.9 million through inspections and compliance measures. Businesses can apply for the program up to seven months before policy renewal.
Policy Roots and Unintended Consequences
Observers credit Delaware’s steady decline in premiums largely to House Bill 373, a 2014 reform that capped medical reimbursement rates for workers’ compensation cases. The law aimed to control costs and stabilize the insurance market, and many agree it succeeded in lowering premiums.
But critics warn that the law may have side effects.
“It’s good news that prices are going down—that helps many businesses right now,” said Charles Copeland of the Caesar Rodney Institute. “But it’s also important to ask how the prices went down. The 2014 law limits how much doctors and hospitals get paid for workers’ comp treatment. That probably played a big part in driving rates lower year after year. The concern is that if reimbursements stay too low, some doctors may stop taking these cases—leading to longer wait times or forcing injured workers to travel farther for care.”
While no statewide data yet tracks treatment delays, Copeland and others say policymakers should monitor access issues closely to ensure savings for employers do not come at the expense of timely care for employees.
The Bottom Line
Delaware’s ninth straight rate reduction highlights a continuing success story in controlling costs for businesses. Yet with rates still above the national average—and questions about how sustainable the savings model is—stakeholders agree the next challenge is balance: keeping premiums affordable while maintaining fair compensation and access to care for injured workers.

Editor’s Fact Box: How HB 373 Changed Workers’ Comp in Delaware
What It Is:House Bill 373, enacted in 2014, overhauled Delaware’s workers’ compensation medical fee schedule. It capped how much doctors, hospitals, and clinics can be reimbursed for treating work-related injuries.
Why It Was Passed:In the early 2010s, Delaware ranked among the top five most expensive states for workers’ compensation. Lawmakers sought to curb rapidly rising medical costs, which made up more than 60% of claims expenses at the time.
What It Did:


Tied reimbursements to Medicare rates plus a fixed percentage markup.


Required the Department of Labor to update fee schedules regularly.


Established medical cost containment committees and billing review procedures.


Results:


Workers’ comp insurance premiums have fallen for nine straight years.


Delaware dropped from 7th to 23rd most expensive state for coverage.


Concerns:


Some doctors and specialists say low reimbursements make it harder to justify accepting workers’ comp patients.


Possible delays in care or limited treatment options could emerge over time.


In Summary:HB 373 helped reduce costs for businesses but may be creating new access challenges for injured workers—a trade-off that could shape future legislative debate.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Workers-Comp-Insurance-Rates.jpg,,,2025-10-23 15:56:53.657833

(Photo provided by McConnell's office)The U.S. Senate has confirmed Stephen Chad Meredith as a federal judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky, succeeding Judge Danny C. Reeves who is retiring. 
U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, who recommended Meredith for the federal bench, released a statement Thursday congratulating him. “Chad’s impressive legal background in the private sector and devotion to serving the public make him an excellent addition to the federal bench. His thoughtfulness and commitment to our Constitution will serve him well as he carries out his new duties.”
The son of state Sen. Stephen Merdith, R-Leitchfield, Chad Meredith is a partner in the international law firm Squire Patton Boggs, working in its Cincinnati office..
Meredith served in the Republican administrations of Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin and state Attorney General Daniel Cameron, 
Meredith’s chance to be nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden in 2022 was tanked by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican. Biden abandoned his plans to nominate Meredith after Paul vowed to block his confirmation in the Senate.
This time Paul supported Meredith, the Associated Press has reported. The Senate approved Meredith’s appointment Thursday by unanimous consent.
Meredith served as Kentucky’s solicitor general from 2019 to 2021 when Cameron was attorney general and before that as chief deputy counsel in Bevin’s administration.
As part of Bevin’s legal team, Meredith was involved in decisions about hundreds of controversial criminal pardons and commutations Bevin issued after losing reelection to Democrat Andy Beshear in 2019. Among those pardoned was a man convicted of reckless homicide during a robbery whose family had held a fundraiser for Bevin. 
In his prior roles, Meredith also defended laws and policies restricting abortion, a record that drew loud objections from Democrats when Biden considered nominating him. At that time Meredith had enthusiastic support from McConnell, then the Senate’s Republican leader.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image002-4-e1761245659240.jpg,,,2025-10-23 15:16:57.731491

The lawsuit, which was filed Thursday, accuses Missouri lawmakers of trying to trick voters by writing an intentionally deceptive summary that includes three provisions that already are part of state law, such as a ban on foreign campaign contributions. 
The first three bullet points of the summary make no mention of the proposal’s main purpose, which is to require constitutional amendments put on the ballot by voters to obtain both a simple majority statewide and a majority in all eight congressional districts to pass.
Currently, constitutional amendments only require a simple majority statewide. 
“The General Assembly elected to include these provisions in bullet points one, two, and three to conceal the central purpose,” the lawsuit states, “which is to limit citizens’ ability to approve citizen-led initiative petitions to amend the constitution.”
As few as 5% of voters could defeat initiative petitions under Missouri GOP legislation

The proposed ballot measure, which was approved by state lawmakers last month, “impacts a fundamental right,” the lawsuit says. “Voters must be notified that the measure will repeal this existing right.”
If approved by voters next year, the initiative petition changes would allow a small percentage of the state’s voters to defeat any ballot measure. During last year’s general election, 311,915 votes were cast in the 1st District out of the state’s 2,960,266 votes. So 156,000 voters — or about 5.3% of the statewide vote — could prevent a measure from passing.
Only citizen-led initiative petitions would be affected. Amendments placed on the ballot by state lawmakers are not included in the change. 
The lawsuit argues the ballot summary fails to inform voters that “their votes would be counted differently, based upon the congressional district in which they live.”
Missouri is one of 24 states that allows citizen initiative petitions. They can be used to either amend the constitution or change state law, though the path to successfully doing so is often arduous and expensive, requiring tens of thousands of signatures to even land on the ballot. 
Through recent ballot measures, Missourians have legalized abortion and recreational use of marijuana and voted to increase the minimum wage and mandate paid-sick leave. In November, the abortion-rights amendment passed with just shy of 52% of the vote with large support from the state’s urban, more-populated areas. Voters in all but eight of Missouri’s 115 counties opposed the amendment.
Republicans have argued for years that the process is dominated by out-of-state, liberal interest groups. The proposed constitutional amendment was approved by lawmakers alongside a separate bill that gerrymandered Missouri’s congressional map. 
It will appear on the statewide ballot next year.
The Missouri Realtors have vowed to oppose the changes to the initiative petition process. And the group has proven it will spend big to convince voters. 
In 2010, the Realtors raised $4.4 million to amend the Missouri Constitution to prohibit sales taxes on real estate transfers. That was followed in 2016 by a $5.6 million campaign to prevent lawmakers from extending the sales tax to services.
“The citizen initiative process is a power Missouri voters approved for themselves more than a century ago, which our association has been able to use to fight for Missouri homeowners and families,” Bobbi Howe, current president of Missouri Realtors, said in a press release. “We are committed to protecting the rights and the availability of this important tool for everyone.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/080624_Vote1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-10-23 15:16:57.731491

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/Maine Morning Star)With federal immigration enforcement actions picking up in cities across the country, a coalition of groups in Maine is launching a hotline to protect immigrant families from potential harassment and detention.
“The Maine ICE Watch Hotline is a lifeline for families, a bridge for neighbors and a promise that no one in our community will face fear alone,” said Portland at-large city councilor Pious Ali, speaking at a press event at City Hall Thursday.
The goal of the project, which is organized by the Maine Immigrant Rights Coalition and People’s Coalition for Safety and Justice, is to provide accurate, real-time information about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol activity and connect Maine families to resources and support services.
“This isn’t about panic — it’s about protection,” Crystal Cron, executive director of Presente! Maine said. “It’s about staying informed, connected and ready to act together. When ICE shows up, we show up too — not with fear but with solidarity. This hotline is a step towards the community we all deserve, one rooted in trust, care and collective defense.”
The hotline has already trained over 150 volunteers, both as operators to receive calls as well as verifiers to confirm or refute reported sightings of immigrant enforcement activity, Cron said. While there are already volunteers across the state, Cron said they are seeking more in rural areas.

Federal actions targeting Democratic-led cities and states have been on the rise. The press conference was held two days after 50 federal agents descended on New York City’s Canal Street, reportedly arresting nine men.
Last month, a Portland resident was detained by ICE agents after dropping off their child at the Gerald E. Talbot Community School. Nationally, schools, like workplaces, have become frequent targets and there is research tying the raids to increased student absences. 
Wes Pelletier said at the press event that, as councilor for Portland District 2, he represents some of the city’s more diverse neighborhoods and has “seen firsthand how fear has taken hold of our communities. Truancy is on the rise… our parks and playgrounds and our streets are more quiet.”
Pelletier, who is among the volunteers that have taken the verifier training, said over the past few months there’s been quiet organizing but there’s been a growing need for a “unified network to share information that doesn’t cause undo panic, is integrated in the communities it serves, and that balances safety with accessibility.”
After the hotline receives a call of a potential sighting, the report is passed to a regional verifier response group. If they confirm that immigration agents are present, an alert will go out through texts and social media. Verifiers are also trained to observe enforcement actions and gather more information. Afterwards, the hotline will help track the detainee through the immigration system while connecting impacted people with legal representation, financial and other support.
Similar grassroots efforts have been launched elsewhere to protect immigrant communities and push back against federal enforcement actions.
Ahead of the Trump administration’s deployment of immigration authorities last month to Chicago, community groups similarly launched a hotline to help keep tabs on agent activity. Since then, volunteers have organized a vast rapid response network that includes blowing whistles to alert neighbors if ICE or Border Patrol agents are spotted nearby and documenting encounters with federal agents on their phones.  
Cron said they’ve connected with and learned from groups in other states, including Siembra NC, in North Carolina, and LUCE Immigrant Justice Network in Massachusetts.
The role of local law enforcement
While the speakers focused on federal immigration activity, enforcement in Maine has routinely been initiated by local law enforcement.
Since March, the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only statewide immigration legal services organization, has tracked 22 minor traffic stops and similar incidents where more than 50 Maine residents and workers were handed over to immigration officials by state and local law enforcement based on suspected immigration status alone. This is not a complete picture of such incidents, but rather the organization’s best estimate based on verifiable reports.
“What is known shows a concerning and broad pattern of Maine law enforcement agencies across the state stepping outside of their roles and voluntarily diverting Maine’s resources to assist the federal administration with indiscriminate immigration enforcement, threatening the rights and safety of some of Maine’s most vulnerable residents,” ILAP shared in a statement. 
While ICE arrests in Maine double, governor delays deciding on limits for local police cooperation

The state Legislature has considered prohibiting or restricting state and local law enforcement agencies from carrying out the work of federal immigration authorities, though both remain in limbo heading into the next session in January. One of those bills passed the Legislature and rests with Gov. Janet Mills.
“When our governor refuses to sign a bill that will prevent local and state law enforcement from being used to enforce harsh federal immigration laws, it sends the wrong message,” said Ali. “It tells the federal agencies that they can come into our neighborhoods and act without restraint.”
Cron said the hotline guidance is the same regardless of whether it is a federal or local officer and people should call in if they see any suspicious law enforcement activity.
An estimated 70% of ICE arrests nationwide over the past decade have been handoffs from state or local authorities. 
As of Tuesday night, no police departments in Maine have formal agreements with federal immigration authorities, after Wells Police Department terminated its agreement under the 287(g) program.
This means departments in Maine have local discretion regarding when to involve federal officials.
Another layer is where immigration detainees are housed. The public has for months been calling for the board to end Cumberland County Jail’s contract with the U.S. Marshal Service to house federal detainees, which includes immigration detainees, arguing that cooperation with federal immigration authorities makes the county complicit with their increasingly aggressive tactics. 
Earlier this week, the board postponed its decision, with some members raising concern that ending the contract would only take people farther away from their families and legal counsel. 
Legal experts say that already occurs, as it’s common practice for federal authorities to transfer immigration detainees from facility to facility. 
As Maine Morning Star reported in April, the majority of immigration detainees in Cumberland County Jail are not residents of nor were they arrested in Maine. Most were transferred to the facility from out of state, and they are often quickly transferred out, too.
The hotline is currently available from 6-9 a.m. and 5-9 p.m. Monday through Friday. The coalition is encouraging interested parties to volunteer or share information about the hotline on social media or by displaying one of their posters.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)EDMOND — The Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education on Thursday unanimously approved a request for an additional $426 million from the state Legislature for next budget year.
Regents said they will need hundreds of millions more on top of their over $1 billion current legislative allocation for deferred maintenance, workforce development programs and research projects. 
The agency’s request includes $347 million in one-time requests, $21.5 million to pay for legislative initiatives and increasing the agency’s base operating budget by $57 million, an increase of 5.5%. 
The $57 million increase to the base operating budget includes $13.5 million to meet “critical workforce” needs in education, health care and engineering. They also want $43.5 million for student success programs like scholarships, student support, campus safety and “performance-based formula allocations.”  
“Our budget request reflects continued investment to meet growing workforce needs in STEM, education and health care,” said board Chair Courtney Warmington in a statement. “Increasing college degree completion in high-demand fields remains public higher education’s top priority.” 
The $347 million in one-time requests would be for “institution-specific allocations.” 
Over $56 million of this would pay for deferred maintenance across all institutions. To address all deferred maintenance at Oklahoma’s public colleges and universities would cost the state $1.9 billion, according to the budget request. 
It also includes $68 million for both University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University for “research and capital projects,” $60 million for regional and four-year universities for workforce investments and $20 million for two-year colleges for the same purpose. 
The final $21.5 million for “legislative initiatives” includes funding for programs passed or required by the Legislature like expanding concurrent enrollment opportunities for high school students and funding financial assistance programs. 
Legislative priorities
The Regents on Thursday approved a series of their priorities for the upcoming legislative session.
One goal includes increasing the annual family income limit to qualify for the Oklahoma’s Promise scholarship program, said Jarrett Jobe, vice chancellor for governmental relations. The scholarship program offers qualified Oklahoma students, based on income and academic standards, an opportunity to earn a scholarship for college tuition.
Jobe said the agency also wants to clear up definitions in the law passed last session expanding Oklahoma’s Promise to the children of educators. 
Oklahoma higher education leaders previously said lawmakers may not have allocated enough funding to meet the demand for this expansion. 
The scholarship program is expected to cost the state $88.2 million for the upcoming fiscal year, officials said. This is an increase from previous years, largely due to a longer application window, more students meeting the requirements to qualify and the Legislature expanding the program to the children of Oklahoma educators.
Stabilizing property insurance rates is another major priority, Jobe said, because insurance is increasingly contributing to more expensive operational costs for all public higher education institutions. 
“As you know, we’ve received in our budgets and relief for our system over the last few years to the $5 million to stabilize these rising costs,” he said. “(We) have met with the insurance commissioner last year and we’re trying to figure out some statewide policies to help not only higher education, but the state, to keep those down and mitigate rising costs.”
Other priorities include supporting campus research, supporting adult learners and enhancing campus security by addressing physical and cybersecurity threats.

(Getty Images)Gov. Kelly Ayotte announced Thursday that regional agencies that support the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children will be closed starting Nov. 1 if the government shutdown continues. 
The region-based WIC agencies that support all 10 New Hampshire counties — Community Action Program of Belknap-Merrimack Counties, Goodwin Community Health, Community Action Partnership Hillsborough and Rockingham Counties, and Southwestern Community Services — will close at the beginning of next month due to lack of federal funding. 
WIC is a federal program that aims to “provide free healthy foods, breastfeeding support, nutrition education, and referrals to others services” for women and their children from pregnancy to age 5. 
Despite the possibility of agencies closing their doors in November, WIC services will continue for now. On Tuesday, Ayotte announced that the state had received additional funding for WIC from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to sustain services amid the shutdown. 
“We know how important these resources are to New Hampshire families and will continue to work with our partners to ensure WIC families have access to food benefits for as long as possible until the shutdown is resolved,” the governor said in a statement. 
According to the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, at least 13,000 Granite Staters will be able to sustain food benefits because of the additional funding. WIC participants can continue to receive benefits and food balances on the WIC shopper app or by calling the agency.

In early September, Gov. Ron DeSantis and Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo announced a push to eliminate all vaccine mandates in Florida. Ladapo attacked government mandates, saying, “Your body is a gift from God. What you put into your body is because of your relationship with your body and your God.”
Last month, appearing on the “On Call” podcast with Houston physician Dr. Mary Talley Bowden, Ladapo said, “The goal with the mRNA is for that not to be available to anyone, because no one should be using that one.”
Meanwhile, researchers at UF, where Ladapo is also a professor of medicine, are optimistic that mRNA vaccines will change the way cancer is treated.
“The notion that we may be able to use a simple vaccine to awaken a patient’s immune response to better fight their disease may totally change the way we think about treating cancer for the foreseeable future,” Mitchell said. 
Researchers highlight mRNA vaccines (for messenger RNA) for the way they can boost the body’s immune response, “a significant step toward a long-awaited universal cancer vaccine to boost the tumor-fighting effects of immunotherapy,” UF said in its news release. 
“The implications are extraordinary — this could revolutionize the entire field of oncologic care,” said co-senior author Dr. Elias Sayour, a UF Health pediatric oncologist. “We could design an even better nonspecific vaccine to mobilize and reset the immune response, in a way that could essentially be a universal, off-the-shelf cancer vaccine for all cancer patients.”

Study results
The observation is based on more than 1,000 patients at the Texas facility. Although preliminary, the results could have a widespread reach if validated in a clinical trial, UF said. 
The university said the next step is a clinical trial through the OneFlorida+ Clinical Research Network. 
The research focused on patients with stage 3 and 4 non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic melanoma between 2019 and 2023. 
Patients who received the COVID mRNA vaccine within 100 days of starting cancer treatment drugs were “associated with living longer by a significant amount.” Lung cancer patients with the vaccine had a median survival increase from 20.6 months to 37.3 months. Metastatic melanoma patients increased survival length from an average of 26.7 months to 30-40 months.
Non-mRNA vaccines provided no change in longevity, the research found.
“Although not yet proven to be causal, this is the type of treatment benefit that we strive for and hope to see with therapeutic interventions — but rarely do,” Mitchell said. 
The National Cancer Institute and “multiple foundations” funded the research. 
The study’s first author, Dr. Adam Grippin, trained at UF and now works at the Texas facility.
Last month, First Lady Casey DeSantis, a cancer survivor and co-chair of the Florida Make America Healthy Again Commission, announced $60 million in grants to support, in part, “research into the benefits of repurposing generics, like ivermectin, to fight cancer.”
Ivermectin, an anti-parasitic drug, is subject of a bill in the Florida House that would allow for it to be sold over the counter. According to the National Institutes of Health, the drug is effective for treating parasites in animals, and for humans to treat parasites such as head lice and scabies. The FDA has not approved the use of ivermectin to treat COVID-19 or cancer.
“Generic medicines are often overlooked because they’re off-patent and don’t necessarily promise big profits. Florida is investing in researching them to learn more and hopefully uncover new ways to beat cancer,” she wrote on social media.
As for a statewide ban on vaccine mandates, Ladapo said that during the coming legislative session, legislators will “have to choose a side. And I am telling you right now that you know the moral side is, it’s so simple.”
In order to remove all vaccine mandates, lawmakers would have to change statute, although agency officials can eliminate other mandates through rulemaking

,DC,2025-10-23 18:41:20+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,US Senate fails to move ahead on bills extending pay to federal workers during shutdown,"Ariana Figueroa, Ashley Murray",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-fails-move-ahead-bills-extending-pay-federal-workers-during-shutdown,,"WASHINGTON — The Senate Thursday failed to advance a Republican measure and rejected unanimous agreements on two related bills from Democrats that would have paid federal employees and contractors who have continued to work amid the government shutdown, which entered day 23. The stalemate constituted the latest example of how dug in to their arguments both parties are as the shutdown that began Oct. 1 drags out, as well as the heightened political tensions in the upper chamber when it comes to striking a deal to resume government funding.  Most federal employees will miss their first full paycheck on Friday or early next week. More than 42 million Americans, some 40% under the age of 17, are also at risk of delayed food assistance if Congress doesn’t address a funding shortfall expected by Nov. 1 in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Senate Democrats Wednesday sent a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins over concerns that the agency has warned states to hold off on processing SNAP benefits. They contended the agency has the resources to keep payments flowing.“We were deeply disturbed to hear that the USDA has instructed states to stop processing SNAP benefits for November and were surprised by your recent comments that the program will ‘run out of money in two weeks,’” according to the letter. “In fact, the USDA has several tools available which would enable SNAP benefits to be paid through or close to the end of November.”Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., introduced a bill Wednesday to continue SNAP funding through the shutdown. During Thursday’s briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration would “absolutely support” the legislation.Deadlock on federal worker payIn the Senate, a measure from Wisconsin GOP Sen. Ron Johnson on a 54-45 vote did not reach the 60-vote threshold needed to advance in the chamber. Its failure means that federal employees who have continued to work will not be paid until the shutdown ends.Democratic senators who agreed to the measure included Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman and Georgia's Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota changed his vote in order to reconsider the measure. “I don’t think it makes sense to hold these federal workers hostage,” Warnock told States Newsroom in an interview on his vote Thursday. “If I could have a path to give some of these folks relief while fighting for health care, that’s what I decided to do.”A separate measure from Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen also failed to move forward after Johnson objected. Van Hollen requested unanimous consent to approve his bill that would have also protected federal workers from mass Reductions in Force, or RIFs, that President Donald Trump has attempted during the shutdown. A second Democratic bill, from Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich., was narrower, only including pay for federal workers. But when he requested unanimous approval for his measure, it was also blocked by Johnson.Senators then left Capitol Hill for the weekend. On Wednesday, the Senate took a failed 12th vote to provide the federal government and its services with flat funding through Nov. 21.Senate Republicans have pressed Senate Democrats to approve the GOP-written stopgap measure. But Democrats have maintained that they will not support the House measure because it does not extend tax credits that will expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace.Layoffs cited by Van HollenVan Hollen argued his bill would protect workers from the president’s targeting of certain federal agencies and programs.""We certainly shouldn't set up a system where the president of the United States gets to decide what agencies to shut down, what they can open, who to pay and who not to pay, who to punish and who not to punish,"" Van Hollen said on the Senate floor before asking for unanimous consent to move the bill forward.Johnson objected to including Van Hollen's provision to ban federal worker layoffs during a shutdown. President Donald Trump’s efforts to lay off thousands of federal workers during the shutdown have been on hold since last week, after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order that was later expanded.  However, Johnson said he was willing to add into his own bill the provision from Van Hollen to pay furloughed workers.""I'm more than happy to sit down with you. Maybe we should do that later today,"" Van Hollen told Johnson during their debate on the floor.Shortly after, Peters introduced a near-mirror version of Van Hollen's bill, except that his measure would not prohibit layoffs — essentially what Johnson told Van Hollen he would agree to.""We all say we agree on this, so let's just pass this bill now,"" the Michigan Democrat said before asking for unanimous consent to advance the legislation.Johnson also objected to that proposal.“It only solves a problem temporarily. We're going to be right back in the same position,” Johnson said in an interview with States Newsroom about why he rejected Peters’ proposal.  Johnson said he talked with Peters and Van Hollen after the vote and “we’ll be talking beyond this.”‘Waste of time’ for House to meetEven if the Senate passed the bill sponsored by Johnson or Van Hollen, it’s unlikely the House, which has been in recess since last month, would return to vote on either measure.At a Thursday morning press conference, House Speaker Mike Johnson argued that Republicans already passed a stopgap measure to pay federal workers and that Senate Democrats should support that legislation. Johnson said bringing back the House would be a “waste of time,” noting that Democrats would not vote on the Republican proposal. “If I brought everybody back right now and we voted on a measure to do this, to pay essential workers, it would be spiked in the Senate,” said the Louisiana Republican. ""So it would be a waste of our time.”Duffy warns of flight delays due to shutdownTransportation Secretary Sean Duffy joined Johnson and House Republicans during their press conference. He said that flight delays have increased due to staffing shortages.More than 50,000 TSA agents and more than 13,000 air traffic controllers have continued to work without pay during the government shutdown. “They’re angry,” Duffy said of air traffic controllers. “I've gone to a number of different towers over the course of the last week to 10 days. They're frustrated.”Next Tuesday, air traffic controllers will not receive their full paycheck for their work in October, Duffy said.He added that the agency is already short-staffed — by up to 3,000 air traffic controllers.“When we have lower staffing, what happens is, you'll see delays or cancellations,” Duffy said. The FlightAware tracker said there were 2,132 delays within, into or out of the United States of unspecified length reported by Thursday afternoon, compared to 4,175 on Wednesday, 3,846 on Tuesday and 6,792 on Monday.A shortage of air traffic controllers helped play a role in ending the 2019 government shutdown, which lasted 35 days, after thousands of commercial flights were ground to a halt.",,,,2025-10-23 14:57:26.372385

This story was originally reported by Barbara Rodriguez of The 19th. 
President Donald Trump and his administration are increasingly criticizing the use of vaccines on children, even though vaccines have kept millions of children healthy while also improving global public health.
The focus on vaccines comes as the government monitors the biggest measles outbreak in the United States in more than 30 years and increasing cases of whooping cough and flu deaths in children.

Some of the president’s claims in recent weeks — that vaccines cause autism, or that some combination shots given to prevent multiple diseases should be separated — are not rooted in fact or science. During a Sept. 22 news conference, Trump openly speculated about why children receive so many shots.
“They pump so much stuff into those beautiful little babies. It’s a disgrace. I don’t see it. I don’t, I think it has, I think it’s very bad,” the president said during remarks where he also warned pregnant people to avoid pain-relief medication like Tylenol, claiming that it causes autism despite no proven direct connection. “They’re pumping, it looks like they’re pumping into a horse. You have a little child, little fragile child, and you get a vat of 80 different vaccines, I guess. Eighty different blends, and they pump it in.”
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist who is playing a central role in vaccine policy gave a different estimate during a Senate hearing on Sept. 4.
“When I was a kid, I got three vaccines, I was fully compliant,” Kennedy said. “Today’s children have to get between 69 and 92 vaccines in order to be fully compliant, between maternity and 18 years.”
These figures are conflated and need context, medical experts say. Here’s what to know about the childhood vaccine schedule.
What is the childhood vaccine schedule, and why do we need one?
The childhood vaccine schedule, as it’s known in the United States, is a series of recommended vaccine shots for children that have been approved by medical professionals and the federal government. The vaccines, administered throughout childhood but primarily in the first years of life, protect children from diseases that used to be more common — like polio and diphtheria. The schedule is also used by insurance companies to determine which vaccines they will pay for.
Following the schedule is especially important for young children because their immune systems are still developing and they’re more susceptible to infection.
Before the widespread introduction of vaccines, children were infected with more diseases that caused illness, long-term chronic ailments and sometimes death. Children who follow the vaccine schedule are less likely to become seriously infected by certain diseases, and they also create herd immunity for others who are unable to be vaccinated because of compromised immune systems.
Has the schedule changed?
Yes. The medical community has recommended adding more vaccines to the schedule over time. But the science behind some vaccines — their ingredients, effectiveness and the shots necessary to complete a series — has improved.
The American Academy of Pediatrics, the trusted medical organization of pediatricians that was founded nearly 100 years ago, began making vaccine requirements in the late 1930s through a pamphlet with a red cover known as its “Red Book.” At the time, vaccines were available for only a handful of diseases: smallpox, diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough).
Over time, more vaccines were developed: The polio vaccine was introduced in the 1950s. Separate vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella were made available during the 1960s before a combination shot was introduced in the early 1970s.
During this time, doctors and researchers discussed the need for more formal vaccine guidelines. In 1964, a government-backed panel of experts, known as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, was formed. It is housed under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
For decades, AAP and ACIP issued separate but similar vaccine schedules for children. The groups, along with the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) approved a single vaccine schedule that became effective in 1995.
New shots have been added periodically to the unified schedule: The varicella (chickenpox) vaccine was added in the mid-1990s; the rotavirus vaccine was added and revised between 1998 and 2008; the hepatitis A vaccine was added in 2000; and the pneumococcal vaccine was added in 2001.
Kennedy politicized ACIP this summer by replacing all its members, and some of the new members do not have relevant experience in vaccine safety or policy. AAP, which had still been issuing standalone vaccine recommendations, is highlighting its work and not ACIP’s.
When Kennedy says he was vaccine compliant after just a handful of shots, he’s leaving out the fact that children back then got sick more often, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
This was a time before a vaccine to prevent measles, which at the time caused roughly 50,000 hospitalizations in children. Vaccination also didn’t exist for rubella, which at the time caused about 20,000 cases of congenital birth defects. Even chickenpox caused more than 10,000 hospitalizations before a vaccine was introduced.
“We live longer, better, safer lives because of those vaccines that weren’t available for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and I when we were little boys in the 1950s,” Offit said.
Why are there so many vaccines on the schedule? And are there that many shots?
The vaccines listed on the current schedule help protect against more than 15 potentially serious diseases. The CDC lists each disease here.
Since some vaccines require multiple shots, that can add up. The polio vaccine requires four doses between infancy and 6 years old. The pneumococcal vaccine also has four shots in its series before age 2. The combination diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine is five shots over several years.
By one estimate, children receive a little over 30 vaccine doses by the time they turn 18. That does not include annual immunization for the flu or COVID-19. People may choose to get those shots throughout adulthood.
That is more vaccines than in the past, but that is only because new vaccines have been developed to help prevent more diseases.
Dr. David Hill, a pediatrician in North Carolina and an official representative for AAP, noted the medical breakthrough of the pneumococcal vaccine that was added to the childhood vaccine schedule during his first years of practicing medicine. That vaccine helps block a serious bacteria that can cause multiple infections in the body
“It used to be that kids were in all the time with severe ear infections, sinus infections — we had to worry about those infections turning into meningitis if they got bad or were uncontrolled,” he said. “And I watched the number of ear infections that I would treat plummet, and the severity go down dramatically.”
Hill also noted the antibody shot for the respiratory syncytial virus, also known as RSV, that is given to pregnant people or newborns and has been available for only a few years. Emerging research shows they are safe and effective.
“I can tell you that RSV was just the bane of our existence all winter long in pediatric hospital medicine,” he said. “Our floors were inundated with babies who were having difficulty breathing, and just last year these protective efforts were fully rolled out, and it’s been a dramatic difference.”
Is there a cumulative impact for a child getting so many vaccines?
No. Vaccines are thoroughly tested for safety, including alongside one another to ensure they can be administered together.
This topic is at the crux of Trump’s framing about the safety of childhood vaccines, since children sometimes receive multiple vaccine shots during early wellness check-ups. That may worry some parents about whether so many shots can overwhelm a child’s immune system. But research shows no cumulative impact on children.
Hill said parents should think about this through the lens of antigens, the part of viruses and bacteria that induce immune responses in the body. They are often the key ingredient in vaccines aimed at preparing the body for potential infection.
The number of antigens in vaccines has decreased since the 1960s. So even though children may be getting more shots than before, they’re getting less of an antigen load compared with a few decades ago.
“Say your child gets a cold, they’re getting thousands of antigens when they get that cold. If your child drops a chocolate-covered raisin on the floor and picks it up and eats it, thousands of antigens. The dog licks their face, tons of antigens. They go to day care, countless antigens,” Hill said. “The entire vaccine series today carries fewer than 300 antigens. So in terms of what the immune system is capable of responding to, it is a drop in the bucket. It is just negligible when you compare it to the number of antigens that the immune system responds to over the daily course of life.”
Offit put it another way: “It’s not the number of shots that matters. It’s the number of immunological components in those shots that matters.”
How does the United States compare to other countries when it comes to the number of vaccines that kids take?
Vaccine mandates and recommendations for children vary broadly around the world, and many are linked to school entry. While there is no global schedule standard for childhood vaccines, the World Health Organization tracks how countries aim to address the same vaccine-preventable diseases.
Some countries recommend fewer vaccine shots. The reasons vary: Access, finances, universal health care policies and vaccine manufacturers’ capacity all play a role in how governments set their policies.
Offit said one of the reasons the United States may have more vaccinations on its schedule — not just for young children, but older ones — is because it has been willing to invest in public health like supporting vaccine use.
The British government just recently began recommending the chickpox vaccine, decades after the United States and other countries.
Separately, while other countries do not recommend the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, the United States added it to its vaccine schedule for older children and teens. Rates of cervical cancer in the United States have dropped.
“Other countries choose not to do that,” Offit said. “The better question is, ‘Why don’t they do it?’ Not, ‘Why do we do it?’”
What vaccines are needed for school?
Participation in public settings like day cares and schools often include vaccine requirements (unless there is an allowable exemption) because infectious diseases can spread easily in group settings. Certain jobs also require immunization records. States have different laws and rules for vaccine mandates.
What’s the risk of delaying or skipping certain vaccines?
More than 1 in 6 children in the United States begin but do not complete all vaccines that require multiple doses. Often that is because of access to health care, but some parents also choose to ignore the recommendations or delay certain vaccines.
Doctors do not recommend that parents skip or delay shots, since vaccines on the schedule have been timed to when a child’s immune system is most susceptible to certain diseases but also when that immune system is mature enough to respond to a vaccine.
For example, ​​children are encouraged to complete the rotavirus vaccine series by six months of age because rotavirus is a common disease between six and 24 months of age.
“Children are vaccinated at certain ages because you want to make sure they’re immune and protected at a time when they would likely develop those diseases,” Offit said.
Many babies are born with maternal antibodies in their bloodstream, but that protection wanes as a child ages — which is why eliciting an infant’s own immune response is important.
“A delayed vaccine schedule only increases the period of time during which you’re susceptible to these preventable illnesses, with no benefit,” Offit added.
Do vaccines cause autism?
No, they do not. It’s a longtime debunked rumor that picked up steam in the late 1990s when a now-retracted research paper concluded that children who received the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) shot later developed autism — despite no robust scientific proof. Several studies since then have shown no association between vaccines and autism. The MMR vaccine is also safe and effective.
How do we know that vaccines are safe?
Vaccines are tested during multiple phases of what’s known as clinical trials. In the United States, a vaccine product must pass safety standards before it can be approved for use and made available to the public. A vaccine that’s been added to the childhood vaccine schedule continues to be monitored afterward in case its use needs to be revised.
While vaccines can cause side effects — primarily some soreness and a mild fever — doctors are more concerned with the impact of a person becoming infected with a vaccine-preventable disease. Serious side effects are extremely rare, but if someone believes they or a child were harmed by a vaccine, there is also a legal mechanism to file a claim.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2202122299-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-10-23 14:57:26.372385

(Getty Images)The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services announced a contingency plan Thursday that would partner the state with the New Hampshire Food Bank’s mobile food pantry program to help in-need families should the government shutdown prevent those families from receiving food assistance benefits.
The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is operated jointly by the federal and state governments to help low-income families pay for food. When Congress failed to pass a federal budget in September, the federal government ceased all nonessential operations, including SNAP. If Congress doesn’t act by Oct. 31, the federal government won’t distribute funding for SNAP benefits to states. Over 75,000 people in New Hampshire are enrolled in SNAP.
The plan, which is subject to approval by the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee and the Governor and Executive Council, will allow the food bank to open up to 20 locations twice a week for the next five weeks, just for SNAP recipients. DHHS’s announcement didn’t say whether state funding would be used but the need for Fiscal Committee and Executive Council approval suggests it will. The department has not yet responded to the Bulletin’s request for clarification.
“I want to thank our partners at the New Hampshire Food Bank for joining us in this effort to ensure vulnerable Granite Staters get the food they need in the event this shutdown continues,” Gov. Kelly Ayotte, a Republican, said in a statement announcing the plan. “Now, politicians in Washington must get their act together and reopen the federal government so critical programs like SNAP and WIC can continue without disruption.”
The government shutdown began after Senate Democrats refused to vote for any spending plan that didn’t include an extension of tax credits Americans use to purchase health coverage on HealthCare.gov. U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen told the Bulletin last week that “there are not any official negotiations going on” between Democrats and Republicans in Congress, only backdoor communications.
Republicans say they won’t discuss extending the tax credits until the government reopens. Democrats say they won’t vote to reopen the government until Republicans vote with them to extend the tax credits. If the tax credits aren’t extended, many Americans using HealthCare.gov will see large increases in their health care premiums.
SNAP recipients aren’t the only ones feeling the effects of the shutdown. Hundreds of thousands of federal employees have been furloughed while many essential workers are working without pay. Also, national parks are closed, and federally funded research projects are facing potential delays.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SNAPcontingency-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 14:57:26.372385

(Keila Szpaller/Daily Montanan)The U.S. Senate on Wednesday voted to confirm Montana state Rep. Bill Mercer as a U.S. Judge for the District of Montana.
President Donald Trump nominated the Billings Republican to the federal bench in July, and the Senate held a hearing on his nomination later that month.
Montana’s U.S. Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy released a joint statement following the 52-45 vote praising Mercer’s appointment.
“We congratulate William Mercer on his long-awaited confirmation to serve as U.S. District Judge for Montana,” the senators said. “Bill will have a lasting impact on both our state and the nation, and his experience at the U.S. Department of Justice, as U.S. Attorney for Montana, and as a state legislator have uniquely prepared him for this role. We are confident Bill will continue to zealously defend the rule of law and the original interpretation of the Constitution as he serves the people of Montana and the nation.”
The Senate vote broke along party lines, with three senators — Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) — not voting.
Mercer, 61, was born in Billings. He earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Montana, a master’s in public administration from Harvard University, and his law degree from George Mason University. Mercer has worked at Holland & Hart law firm since 2010.
Mercer was the Montana U.S. Attorney from 2001-09, during the President George W. Bush administration, and since 2019 has served in the Montana House.
He will replace current federal judge Dana Christensen, who in 2022 announced his intent to retire to senior status.

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Hours after Denver Mayor Mike Johnston announced that his office had again unilaterally extended the city’s contract with Flock Safety, his staff and Denver Police Department officials faced questions from residents who say they’re angry and fearful about how the company’s network of AI-powered surveillance cameras may be used.
A standing room only crowd of hundreds packed a large conference hall and spilled into an overflow room at Geotech Environmental Equipment’s Denver facility during a town hall organized Wednesday by Denver neighborhood organizations and progressive groups including the ACLU of Colorado, which says the Flock cameras “pose a serious threat to the democratic rights of every person in our city.”
Frustrations boiled over repeatedly during the two-hour meeting, especially in relation to Johnston’s decision earlier Wednesday to extend the existing Flock contract until March 2026. That contract extension comes with new terms that are responsive to community concerns about how the citywide network of 111 license plate readers are used, said Tim Hoffman, Johnston’s director of policy, who represented the mayor’s office at the event.

“I would respectfully disagree with the idea that the mayor did not engage in any public process,” said Hoffman, a former prosecutor who ran for an at-large seat on Denver City Council in 2023, drawing howls of derision from the crowd.
Amid nationwide concerns about the use of Flock’s surveillance network to aid President Donald Trump’s mass-deportation campaign, Johnston’s defense of the cameras as a key crime-fighting tool for police has emerged as a defining issue of his first term in office. Weeks after City Council members unanimously rejected a two-year, $666,000 contract extension with Flock in May, Johnston’s office agreed to a shorter-term extension priced at $498,500 — just below the $500,000 threshold at which city contracts require council approval.
At-Large Council member Sarah Parady said in a statement that she was “stunned” by the latest contract extension, which she called an “undemocratic dealing with a known bad actor.” She answered questions at Wednesday’s town hall alongside two fellow council members, Serena Gonzalez-Gutierrez and Shontel Lewis, who also expressed concerns about Flock and the way Johnston has handled the issue.
“Just following a weekend when millions of people poured out into the streets for No Kings day protests, one man made a decision — behind a closed door, with the CEO of a private company — about a technology that threatens all of our constitutional rights,” Katie Leonard, an organizer with the Denver Party for Socialism and Liberation, told the crowd.
In a statement Wednesday, Johnston touted the extension as a “Denver-specific package that will lead the way in using this technology for the public good.” Flock will implement safeguards, the city said in a press release, to prevent the network from being accessed by federal agents or law enforcement officers from other jurisdictions, and the company has verbally agreed to pay $100,000 for each instance of data being improperly released to external parties.

Those provisions aren’t nearly enough to satisfy Flock’s critics, who say the company and the mayor’s office have repeatedly misled the public about how the system can be used. Officials had previously denied that the cameras could be used for immigration enforcement, before audit logs revealed that Denver cameras had been accessed more than 1,400 times for that express purpose. Those searches were enabled because Denver had been included in Flock’s “national lookup” function, which Denver police officials said they hadn’t been aware of and disabled after learning of it in April.
“The track record that you have does not build trust,” said Kathy Sandoval of the Villa Park neighborhood organization.
Critics also argue that data collected by Flock in Denver can’t be fully insulated from federal search warrants or other pressure from the Trump administration — or from federal agents accessing the system using the login credentials of local officers, as a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent did using a Loveland Police Department account earlier this year.
Colorado law bars local law enforcement and state agencies from collaborating with ICE or sharing personal identifying information with federal immigration authorities. But a pattern of both “front door” and “back door” access to local Flock networks by federal agents was recently revealed in Washington state, which Parady noted has immigrant protection laws similar to Colorado’s.
Between 700 and 800 Denver police officers have access to the Flock system, Commander Jake Herrera of the department’s Operational Innovation Bureau told town hall attendees.
Mass surveillance fears
Since Flock cameras were first installed in Denver in May 2024, over 250 stolen vehicles have been recovered “at least in part” due to the system, Hoffman said, and it has provided evidence leading to the arrests of nine homicide suspects.
The use of automated license plate readers like those operated by Flock has been challenged in court by civil rights advocates who argue it violates the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures. Hoffman called it an “unsettled area of law.”

After presentations from advocates and neighborhood organizations, members of the public voiced their opposition to Flock in a Q&A session. One speaker expressed fear that the technology would be used to target transgender Denverites and other people the Trump administration may label “terrorists,” while another called himself a “normie Democrat” who felt let down by Johnston’s actions.
“I obviously hear the frustration in this room,” Hoffman said. “There are going to be disagreements on the margins here, (but) there is no one in the mayor’s administration, the mayor especially, who wants ICE rounding up our most vulnerable citizens or residents … (or) a woman who comes here from Texas for reproductive health care to then have that action be prosecuted back in the state of Texas.”
404 Media reported earlier this year that a sheriff’s deputy in Johnson County, Texas, had used Flock’s nationwide search function to surveil a woman who had an abortion. Both Flock and the Johnson County Sheriff’s Department claimed the search was performed as part of a “missing person” investigation for the woman’s safety, but court records subsequently contradicted that claim, showing the woman was under scrutiny as part of a “death investigation” of a “non-viable fetus.”
Flock’s mass surveillance technology, Parady told the crowd, is “serving the smaller and smaller circle of people who are absolutely convinced that they never have to fear their government — not because of a mistake, not because of their politics, not because they’ve gotten reproductive health care, not because they’re trans, not because they’re immigrants, not because they stood up for immigrants, not because they’re a democratic socialist elected official, not because they tried to prosecute Donald Trump.”
“If you are in that circle, perhaps this technology is serving you,” Parady added. “That circle is shrinking every day.”

Gov. Newsom was prepared to sue over a potential National Guard deployment.,"In summary
President Trump name-dropped Bay Area tech executives when he called off an immigration enforcement surge in San Francisco. Gov. Newsom was prepared to sue over a potential National Guard deployment.


After a tense night in the Bay Area, President Trump called off a planned “surge” of federal immigration agents in San Francisco after friends persuaded him to back down.
“Great people like (Nvidia president) Jensen Huang, (Salesforce chief executive) Marc Benioff and others have called saying that the future of San Francisco is great,” the president wrote on social media. “They want to give it a ‘shot.’ Therefore we will not surge San Francisco on Saturday.”
The announcement followed a nerve-wracking night for Bay Area immigrants and others. Wednesday afternoon, Trump deployed about 100 federal agents to a military base in the East Bay in preparation for a high-profile and long-threatened immigration crackdown.
Agents were expected to raid local Home Depot stores, where undocumented workers often congregate, over the next few days, local news outlets reported. 
“We’re going to go to San Francisco,” Trump told a Fox News reporter on Sunday. “The difference is, I think they want us in San Francisco. San Francisco was truly one of the great cities of the world, and then 15 years ago, it went wrong. It went woke.”
Protesters throughout the Bay Area began amassing on Thursday, starting with a pre-dawn gathering blocking the entrance to Coast Guard Island in Alameda, where the federal agents were expected to arrive. Agents deployed an apparent flash-bang grenade to disperse the crowd, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
Elsewhere, protesters planned to gather at San Jose City Hall, San Francisco’s Justin Herman Plaza and other locations.
San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said on social media that Trump called him Wednesday night.
“I told him the same thing I told our residents: San Francisco is on the rise,” Lurie wrote. “We have work to do, and we would welcome continued partnerships with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and U.S. Attorney to get drugs and drug dealers off our streets, but having the military and militarized immigration enforcement in our city will hinder our recovery. 
“In that conversation, the president told me clearly that he was calling off any plans for a federal deployment in San Francisco,” Lurie continued. “Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem reaffirmed that direction in our conversation this morning.”
State and local authorities had been anticipating the raids and had stern words for the Trump administration and vowed to take action to protect residents.
“We’re a nation of laws and accountability — not a nation that turns a blind eye to abuse of power,” Newsom said in a statement. “We don’t bow to kings, and we’re standing up to this wannabe tyrant. The notion that the federal government can deploy troops into our cities with no justification grounded in reality, no oversight, no accountability, no respect for state sovereignty — it’s a direct assault on the rule of law.”
Newsom characterized the deployment as an attempt at voter suppression, as Californians vote on Proposition 50 to redraw congressional maps in favor of Democrats. Newsom put the measure on the ballot to counter Republican gerrymandering in Texas that was meant to help Trump keep a GOP majority in the House of Representatives. Less than two weeks before Election Day, the race remains close.
Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta promised to sue the federal government to stop National Guard troops from deploying to San Francisco.  So far, the administration’s heightened presence in the Bay Area appeared limited to immigration enforcement.
“There is no basis to send National Guard troops to San Francisco. No emergency. No rebellion. No invasion. Not even unrest,” Bonta said in a statement. “Trump has made no secret of his intentions: To use our National Guard as his own Royal Army and our cities as a training ground for the military. This is outrageous, indefensible, and most importantly illegal.” 
San Francisco, Oakland and several other cities in the Bay Area are so-called sanctuary cities, which limits how  local law enforcement officers interact with federal immigration agents. San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins said she would prosecute federal agents who used excessive force or otherwise violated local laws.
Trump has used crime data as a justification for potentially sending troops to San Francisco and other left-leaning cities. But San Francisco’s crime rate is down significantly in most categories. Oakland, which historically has had some of the country’s highest violent crime rates, has also seen a steep drop in most types of crime this year.
One of the most diverse regions in the country, the Bay Area has a robust immigrant population – roughly 30%, according to the Bay Area Equity Atlas. The majority come from Latin America and Asia, but thousands also come from Iran, Russia and Canada. At least 457,000 lack legal status, according to the Migration Policy Institute.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/102325-CBP-ICE-SF-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-23 14:18:15.747241

Fewer headline grabbing jackpots last year led to a drop in revenue for online lottery offerings. (Screenshot from RILottery website)Rhode Island’s gaming revenue has rebounded from last year’s decline, even as most aspects of the industry have taken some financial hits. And it’s all thanks to mobile gambling, according to the latest report by the Rhode Island Office of the Auditor General.
The annual report released Wednesday showed the Rhode Island Lottery transferred $433.6 million to the state’s general fund in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 — a $7.2 million increase over fiscal 2024 revenue of $426.4 million.
In fiscal 2023, the state reported $434 million in gaming revenues.
Like prior years, the bulk of last year’s gaming revenue came from video lottery terminals within the state’s two Bally’s-run casinos in Lincoln and Tiverton, which accounted for $313.6 million, or 70.8% of total gross profit. But even that stable source of gaming income saw a decrease of 0.6% from fiscal 2024, according to the auditor’s report.
The main reason gaming revenues stayed afloat, the report notes, was iGaming. Formally launched by Bally’s Corp. in March 2024, the state’s mobile casino provided a net profit of $20.8 million to Rhode Island’s general fund at the end of the fiscal year.
But the auditor’s report notes the iGaming money may not be reliable much longer.
“Massachusetts is expected to implement iLottery in the spring of 2026, as well as legislative consideration of some additional iGaming bills,” the report states.
Most other forms of gaming were on the decline in the most recent fiscal year.
The auditor general’s report notes the state’s share of table games revenue fell 2.9%, along with a 16.1% decrease in online lottery offerings. The latter was attributed to “significantly fewer large jackpot drawings” — those advertised in an excess of $1 billion — for PowerBall and Mega Millions drawings.
Revenue generated by sports wagers declined by 3.2%, with only $18.6 million transferred to the state’s general fund. In fiscal year 2024, the state received $19.2 million from sports betting.
The auditor’s report blames the decline “primarily due to increased competition from neighboring states.”
Rhode Island was the first state in New England to legalize sports wagers in 2018, but Connecticut and Massachusetts were close behind.
Connecticut, which legalized sports betting in 2021, saw nearly $28 million in revenue from bets in the most recent fiscal year, according to data from the state’s Department of Consumer Protection.
Massachusetts, which launched sports betting in 2023, saw over $150 million in gaming revenue, according to data from the commonwealth’s Gaming Commission.
Lawmakers have tried to make sports betting more appealing in Rhode Island in recent years as a way to recapture bets that have since gone to neighboring states. In 2023, the state legalized bets on collegiate teams when they are participating in tournaments consisting of four or more teams.
Some also tried to expand the number of online sports betting vendors beyond the single app managed by International Game Technology, which has the state’s exclusive contract to run Rhode Island’s digital sportsbook through November 2026.
Legislation introduced this year sought to expand the number of sports betting vendors to between three and five  by July 2026. A bill sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone cleared the Senate during the final weeks of the 2025 legislative session, but never reached the House floor. 
Rhode Island gambling regulators are in the midst of laying the groundwork to possibly expand online sports betting options — though there is some skepticism about how much money an expanded market would bring.

Mike Bohacek, of Michiana Shores, was stopped by Michigan City Police on Jan. 24 and later found to have had a blood alcohol content of 0.28% — more than three times Indiana’s legal limit of 0.08%. (Michigan City Police)New body camera footage released by Michigan City police shows what unfolded the night Republican Indiana Sen. Mike Bohacek was stopped and ultimately driven home — rather than booked into jail — after a January traffic stop that later led to his drunk driving arrest.
The roughly two-hour video, obtained by the Indiana Capital Chronicle through a public records request, provides a full account of the stop. A request for dash cam video is still pending. 
Bohacek, of Michiana Shores, was stopped by police on Jan. 24 after a citizen reported him “drinking an open container and stumble out of his vehicle” at a Panda Express in Michigan City, according to charging documents. The senator was later pulled over near Swan Lake Cemetery on U.S. 20, where he refused a breathalyzer test. 


Police then took him to a hospital, where a blood test showed a blood alcohol content of 0.28% — more than three times Indiana’s legal limit of 0.08%.
But Bohacek wasn’t arrested at the time. Under Indiana law, members of the General Assembly are shielded from arrest in most cases during the legislative session — a protection known as legislative immunity.
That meant Bohacek’s case was kept sealed and the senator remained uncharged for months.
New details from body camera footage
The recording begins as Officer Daniel Revoir pulls over Bohacek’s Black 2023 Dodge Charger, bearing his Indiana legislative license plate.
“You were going a little above the speed limit,” Revoir tells Bohacek as he approaches the car. Officers later said Bohacek was clocked at 70 miles per hour in a 45 zone.
Revoir told another officer that Bohacek was “was maintaining his lane” while driving, but said the senator’s eyes appeared red and glassy.
When Bohacek refused to perform field sobriety tests or blow into a portable breath test, Revoir began consulting superiors about how to proceed.

“So, I just pulled over a state senator,” he says at one point, expressing uncertainty about whether he had probable cause to arrest Bohacek. Revoir additionally told a supervisor that Bohacek was “in his car, drinking water and eating food” during the traffic stop.
The officer read Indiana’s implied consent law, which warns that refusal to take a chemical test can result in a one-year license suspension. Still, Bohacek declined again.
Revoir then told dispatchers he would obtain a warrant for a blood draw. Bohacek was handcuffed, patted down and placed in the squad car, but not arrested. His wife was called to retrieve his vehicle from the roadside.
At Franciscan Health Michigan City, Bohacek consented to the blood test. 
When asked if he had been drinking or using drugs, Bohacek replied that he takes tramadol, a prescription medication, for back pain.
He then said quietly that he “had a glass of wine” at home earlier in the day.
“I didn’t eat lunch,” Bohacek said. “I don’t drink a lot, so.”
At one point, the senator admitted that he “probably should’ve used Uber Eats, or something.”
Revoir agreed: “Yeah, that definitely would’ve been a cheaper option.”
The officer later told Bohacek that test results confirmed a blood alcohol concentration of 0.28%.
“The numbers are the numbers,” Bohacek responded. Moments later, after realizing his BAC was more than three times Indiana’s legal limit, he added: “How much? … Holy — oh, wow. … That’s crazy. I didn’t expect that.”
Revoir replied: “If all you had was one glass of wine, that was a strong glass of wine.”
Allowed to go home 
The body camera footage showed Revoir repeatedly checking with superiors about what to do after learning Bohacek’s blood-alcohol level. Supervisors and a local prosecutor advised that because the General Assembly was still in session, officers could not jail him that night.
Revoir explained the decision to Bohacek at the hospital.
“I guess legally, I cannot arrest you and take you to jail because your congress is still in session. So, what I’m going to do is I’m doing a full police report, and I’m going to file an arrest warrant for you for operating while intoxicated,” he said. “Once (the legislature) is out of session, you’ll be surrendered by the Statehouse and remanded into custody.”
Bohacek said he had “no idea how this works.”
“Apparently, I can still get parking tickets,” he told Revoir. “But … I don’t speed. I don’t know how the whole immunity thing works. I’ve never been around it.”
Indiana Sen. Mike Bohacek accepts plea deal in DUI case

Even so, Bohacek apologized multiple times. 
“I’m sorry,” he told Revoir as the officer drove him home. 
“You don’t seem like a bad guy,” Revoir responded. “But obviously, you know, good people make bad choices from time to time.”
Bohacek, who represents Senate District 8, was later charged in May with two misdemeanor counts: operating a vehicle while intoxicated with endangerment and operating with a BAC of 0.15% or higher. The charges came months after the Jan. 18 incident, once the legislative session had ended.
A specific section in the Indiana Constitution states that lawmakers are immune from arrest during session in all cases except treason, felony, or breach of the peace during the legislative session, as well as while traveling to and from the Indiana Statehouse. 
The most recent session started on Jan. 8 and adjourned on April 25.
Court records show Bohacek accepted a plea agreement in August, pleading guilty to one count of operating while intoxicated. He received a 60-day suspended sentence and one year of probation. The court allowed him to drive using an ignition interlock device in lieu of a full license suspension.
Bohacek did not respond to a request for comment about the newly released footage.

(Courtesy of the Office of the Governor) A well-known face from public television this week stepped into a new role leading the New Mexico Office of African American Affairs.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced Gene Grant’s appointment as the office’s executive director on Wednesday. He previously spent nearly two decades as host of “New Mexico in Focus” on the local PBS affiliate. After leaving the show in 2023, he then served as the chief program and policy officer at nonprofit Animal Protection New Mexico for just over two years. Grant, a Santa Fe resident, also serves on the boards of the ACLU of New Mexico, the Vortex Theatre and Duke City Shootout.
“For almost 20 years, Gene Grant has been one of New Mexico’s most trusted voices — asking tough questions, bringing people together and making sure every New Mexican has a seat at the table,” Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “He understands the power of representation, and he’s spent his career making sure African American voices and stories are front and center in our state.”
Grant’s hiring marks the third appointment since William Scott Carreathers resigned as the office’s head in June 2020. Lujan Grisham then appointed New Mexico Black Leadership Council Board President Amy Whitfield to the role. After Whitfield became the governor’s   housing and homelessness advisor, Charles Reado, a former social worker for the state’s child welfare department, stepped in as the office’s acting executive director. Reado will now serve as the department’s deputy director, Grant confirmed.
The state’s Sunshine Portal reports the executive director position has an annual salary of more than $98,0000 per year.
In an interview with Source, Grant said his first priorities will be expanding the office’s footprint; offering more information virtually; and providing listening sessions. His first day was officially Oct. 22, he said.
“I’m thankful for the governor’s confidence, and there’s a lot of work to do, and I’m ready to do it,” Grant said. “There’s issues informing the African American community that are happening out of national politics, as well as local politics that need attention in all corners of our state.”
Grant named three top issues he plans to address: physical health; mental health awareness; and education, but promised to incorporate feedback from across the state to drill down into further priorities. He said his time in public media fostered his “eye for the statewide view.”
“I’m not just an Albuquerque-specific or Santa Fe-specific person,” he said. We’re going to be getting on the road: to Hobbs, Roswell, Las Cruces, all the different counties where there are African American populations. I’ll be talking with legislators that serve in those areas.”
Grant said he also hopes to transform Albuquerque’s African American Performing Arts Center into a resource for the surrounding neighborhood in the city’s International District.
“We hope to use it for different things beyond just exhibition, beyond just stage performances,” Grant said.
He said the pressure the federal government is exerting on agencies and universities to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion inspires him to work to prove the state agency’s value to all New Mexicans.
“It’s a state agency, all taxpayers pay for it and, while we have a single focus, certainly, it is good for the rest of the state,” he said. “If we have things moving forward in the African American community, everybody wins.”
The national environment is creating a sense of urgency to protect the state office’s mission.
“It’s tough times right now, there’s no question about it,” he continued. “But it’s time to be brave, it’s a time to be forward-leaning, it’s time to look towards the future, and make sure that African Americans here have equally a shot to as many of the great things that are going on in New Mexico as everybody else.”

The Mississippi Charter School Authorizer Board approved Ambition Preparatory Charter School’s request to expand into grades nine through 12 at its July meeting. The school currently serves kindergarten through eighth-grade students. However, leaders of the local public school district voiced their disapproval at their board meeting Tuesday night.

“The establishment of this high school will have significant long-term implications, including decreased enrollment in existing high schools, particularly smaller ones, resulting in an impact on district fiscal operations,” JPS Superintendent Errick Greene said. He also noted that a new high school would likely affect teacher recruitment at the public school district. 
Greene made clear in an impassioned speech that the district views Ambition’s foray into higher grades as the establishment of a new school, not an expansion.
It’s an important distinction.
According to state law, charter schools can only be established in areas where the local school district is rated A, B or C if the local school district’s board approves. There’s no appeal process, so if the school board denies the request, the process ends. New charter schools can only be established without local school board approval in areas rated D or F. 
But expanding an existing charter school to serve more grades is relatively new territory. The Mississippi Charter School Authorizer Board, which is tasked with approving new or expanded charter schools, established a new policy in 2023 that addresses charter schools that want to expand.
Lisa Karmacharya, executive director of the authorizer board, says that, in this instance, Ambition Prep is not starting a new school, so it doesn’t have to follow the state law for establishing new charter schools. 
The JPS vote came as a shock to Karmacharya when reached by Mississippi Today. 
“I am absolutely speechless,” she said. “My mouth dropped open.”
Karmacharya said that DeArchie Scott, Ambition’s executive director, completed a “healthy and robust application for the expansion” under the new policy and should continue with the process. 
That’s exactly what Scott plans to do, he said. 
“It’s not a new application, so it goes based on what the (local public school) district was rated at the time of approval, which was an ‘F,’” he said. “It’s already been approved by our authorizer board, so we don’t need approval from JPS.”
Ambition Prep, which opened in 2019, got a C in the latest Mississippi school report card, as did Jackson Public Schools. 
Clarksdale Collegiate Public Charter School in the Delta was previously approved as the state’s first charter high school, but that was through a merger. Ambition is the first school in the state to take advantage of the charter board’s new expansion policy to start serving higher grades. If the charter’s buildout is completed in fall 2027, it would make Ambition Prep the second charter high school in the state and the only charter high school in Jackson.
It’s not clear how the dispute will be resolved, or if it will escalate to litigation.
A spokesperson for Jackson Public Schools said the district’s board of trustees would “pursue all available options at its disposal to support its position regarding Ambition Prep’s request.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/06211733/IMG_4139.jpg,,,2025-10-23 14:02:48.411957

In an attempt to clear the air, Rogers said she’d reached out to each one of them.

Upon hearing her email, Jennifer Baughn, an architecture historian who lives down the street from Taste, in the otherwise sleepy north Fondren neighborhood off Meadowbrook Road, spoke up.
“That’s me,” she said so members of the Jackson Planning Board could hear her. “I’ve never received an email.” 
“But I have it here,” Rogers insisted as other residents began to say that they, too, had not heard from her. “I literally have it here.”
Residents in close proximity to Taste have complained for months that the establishment, which many of them refer to as a nightclub despite Rogers’ insistence it is a bar and restaurant, has disturbed their quality of life with loud music and traffic.
At issue Wednesday was Taste’s proposal to build nine residential units — which it hoped to use as Airbnbs — on top of its existing restaurant in a section of Fondren historically home to offices, convenience stores and fast-food chains. The units are part of Rogers’ plan to invest in north Jackson that began when she opened a beauty supply store in 2022 after owning a beauty business in the area for more than a decade. 
“We’re not going to invest in the neighborhood just to destroy it,” she told Mississippi Today.

To open Airbnbs, the city’s zoning administrator, Ester Ainsworth, had recommended Taste pursue rezoning its white brick restaurant, one of the few newly redone commercial buildings in this part of Fondren, from commercial to mixed-use development. 
The proposal rankled residents of the otherwise low-key neighborhood. Six people, including Baughn, spoke in opposition to what she called a “de facto entertainment district” with music that is too loud and patrons who park illegally and drive recklessly. 
“This has been the most stressful year of my life as every weekend has been taken away from us,” she said. “We cannot enjoy the peace of our household and that has happened without any due process from our neighbors.” 
After about an hour of discussion, the planning board overwhelmingly voted to recommend denying the rezoning. The issue will eventually go before the city council, which has the final say on whether or not to grant Taste’s request. 
“Thank you for your investment in the city,” said Michael Booker, the planning chairman who represents Ward 2 and voted against the measure, as Rogers and her attorneys walked out of the room. 
As they exited, they vowed aloud to build hotel rooms instead.

Terris Harris, an attorney who spoke on behalf of Rogers, told the planning board that he thought an above hotel would be permitted under the restaurant’s existing zoning classification, so Taste could pursue its goal of building the units even if the board nixed its Airbnb-apartment idea. 
“That would be well within the requirements of their zoning, so it’s tomato, tomato, chocolate, chocolate, however you want to say this, it’s the exact same thing,” he said.  
Harris added that he believed residents’ opposition to Taste’s proposal had “absolutely nothing” to do with a second floor of residential units but rather a mistaken belief that Taste operates as a nightclub when it is in fact a bar and restaurant. 
“These aren’t fly-by-night business folks,” he said. “These are business folks with multimillion dollar enterprises who have spent over a million in that place. … This is not a nightclub. That’s not what this is. This is a fine dining restaurant, and the cigar lounge they have in there is super small, so it’s not a lot of people in there.”

Rogers insisted she had done everything she could to ameliorate the concerns, such as buying parcels of land around the restaurant to create additional parking and even turning over security footage that police wanted when they investigated a shooting near a nightclub across the street from Taste called Parlour Room. The bullets injured eight people and police reportedly found at least 30 casings outside.  
“We have hired extra security guards. We have got a noise ordinance reader. We got with the police to make sure we have the exact same ordinance reader as they do,” Rogers said. “We started closing earlier. We don’t even have a DJ where we started off having a DJ.” 
Baughn and others conceded Taste is not the only bar on the street causing problems for residents. 
“It’s a different crowd,” she said of the Parlour Room. “It’s a little more criminal of a crowd than Taste, but it’s not as popular as Taste, and it has adequate parking, which Taste does not.” 
Liz Brister, the president of Downtown Jackson Partners who lives in the neighborhood and has renovated homes there, said a nonprofit organization working on Fondren’s economic development plan is looking at the need to rezone the area to encourage residential density. 
Doug Boone, the executive director of the Fondren Renaissance Foundation, claimed Taste has made no attempt to hear from residents and had, in fact, misled them about the nature of its business from the start. 
Brenda Davis, a resident who moved to North Fondren in 1989 and decided to stay there after she retired in the late 2000s, said she hears “booming bass” and “cars screeching” every weekend. 
“‘No communication’ might not be the word,” she said of the relations between the bar and residents, “but no communication between the two that would cause a compromise.” 
Ainsworth, the zoning administrator, said she had witnessed the bar’s patrons parking up and down the street, flouting No Parking signs. Emily Pote, a planning board member representing Ward 7, asked who is supposed to hold the bar responsible for that, to which Ainsworth replied, “the city.” 
“But sometimes people pay us no attention, and they do whatever they feel is necessary for their survival,” Ainsworth said. 
After the meeting, Baughn said that her street has had problems over the years with loud establishments, including a spate of rave clubs about 20 years ago that were shut down after residents got the city council and the fire marshal involved. 
Compared to the raves, Taste has the potential to be an improvement, Baughn said. 
“I love that building, and actually, what they’ve done with it isn’t bad,” she said of Rogers’ redesign. 
Baughn said she doesn’t know why bars or nightclubs have flocked to this area of town over the years, except for its excess vacant rental space. She believes the solution now is to sever the commercial and residential sides of North Fondren by closing off the street. 
“I do think there could be a compromise, she has just not been interested in it,” Baughn said of Rogers. “She could’ve talked to us today, but she didn’t.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/23122519/Jackson-Planning-Board-meeting-5.jpg,,,2025-10-23 14:02:48.411957

That review of the election, which did not turn up any proof of wrongdoing, has resulted in 10 counts of misconduct being filed against the former judge. Late last month, he agreed to have his law license suspended for three years because of the charges. 
Last week the OLR filed a statement arguing that the case against Gableman should follow Supreme Court precedent, which would mean the costs incurred by the OLR investigator and independent referee overseeing the case should be paid by the lawyer under investigation. The referee issued a recommendation stating that there was no reason the case shouldn’t follow the existing precedent.
Both the responsibility for paying the bill and the ultimate punishment will be decided by the state Supreme Court. 
Also last week, Gableman filed a motion in his case last week seeking the recusal of liberal justices Susan Crawford and Rebecca Dallet.
Gableman’s filing notes that Crawford called him a “disgraced election conspiracy theorist” and accused him of leading a “sham” investigation of the 2020 election during her campaign earlier this year. 
His filing notes comments Dallet made in 2017 after she had announced her campaign for the Court but before Gableman had decided not to run for another term. Dallet accused Gableman of not recusing himself from cases in which he had a conflict of interest, called his 2008 campaign “one of the most unethical” in state history and said he was a “rubber stamp for his political allies.”
Gableman argues that these comments create the appearance of bias and that the justices shouldn’t weigh in on his punishment. If they were to recuse, the Court’s conservatives would hold a 3-2 majority — though Justice Brian Hagedorn sided with the Court’s liberals in the 2020 election cases it decided.

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor) Ranchers are pushing against a Trump administration proposal to import beef from Argentina, a move they say is causing chaos in the market. 
Beef production had been a bright spot in a struggling U.S. farm economy. But futures prices have taken a hit since President Donald Trump said Sunday that the U.S. should buy beef to help support Argentina and lower prices for consumers. 
Julie Ellingson, executive vice president of the North Dakota Stockmen’s Association, said Trump’s stance had an immediate and dramatic impact on the livestock industry. 
Ellingson called it “real time, real life consequences for livestock producers.”
Ellingson and the Stockmen’s Association say supply and demand should determine the market. 
“Our organization has stood steadfast against market-altering policies,” the group said in a statement. “Otherwise, market signals get confused and chaos can result, just like we have seen the last few days since the announcement.”
USDA announces plan to ‘strengthen’ beef industry

For ranchers, fall is a critical time of year, when cattle that have been grazed during the summer are often sold. 
Frank Tomac is the president of Independent Beef Association of North Dakota and ranches in Sioux County on the South Dakota state line. 
“If our president continues to push this, then it’s going to continue to drop our prices,” Tomac said. 
The group is calling on its members and on consumers to resist Argentine beef imports and to call for labeling rules that would indicate if beef is imported, known as a country of origin labeling. 
“The consumer could then decide which product they want, whether they want the product of the U.S., or whether they want the product of foreign countries,” Tomac said. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Wednesday announced a plan to strengthen the cattle industry and lower beef prices for consumers.
The same day, Trump, in a social media post, took credit for the strength of the beef market. 
“The only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States,” Trump wrote, adding that beef producers need to bring down their prices. 
Matt Perdue, the former government relations director for the North Dakota Farmers Union who now is a candidate to become president of the organization, said he was “deeply disappointed” in the comment. 
Perdue said he supports Trump administration moves to open up more public lands to grazing and encourage young producers to get into ranching, but he said importing beef undercuts U.S. producers. 
Perdue said ranchers have endured a long stretch of low prices. “There’s finally a period of some financial success, and we have to ruin that?” Perdue asked.
U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., on Tuesday signed a letter to Trump along with other House members asking for clarity on the policy. 
“We respectfully request additional information on this matter and urge your administration to ensure that any future decisions are made with full transparency, sound science, and a firm commitment to the U.S. cattle industry,” the letter said. 
Ellingson said this has been a good year for beef producers. The U.S. cattle herd has shrunk in recent years, in part because of drought conditions in prime cattle-producing regions. 
That has been a driver of higher prices for ranchers and at the grocery store, but Ellingson said demand for beef has remained strong in the U.S. and in export markets. 
“This has been a real positive time in the beef business, in many cases, hitting record prices for live cattle,” Ellingson said. “Consumer demand is as strong as it’s ever been.”

Instead, Rep. Jessica Baker wants to replace every mention of “child pornography” in statute with “child sexual abuse material,” because she believes it’s wrong to apply “pornography” to pictures and videos of raped or sexually battered children.
“While adult pornography is legal, there is no legitimate category known as ‘child pornography,'” Baker, a Jacksonville Republican, said in a statement to the Phoenix. “The term itself is misleading, as it implies a lawful form of pornography when, in fact, any sexualized depiction or exploitation of minors is a crime. Such material is not pornography — it is Child Sexual Abuse Material.
“We must call it what it truly is: the documentation of the sexual abuse of children,” she added.

HB 245 is a 56-page measure that crosses out every reference to “child pornography” in Florida law and replaces it with “child sexual abuse material,” amending 19 state statutes.
If passed, Baker’s bill would align Florida with Pennsylvania and Louisiana, which have already adopted similar language. Delaware and Texas will take up these measures during their 2026 legislative sessions, while Alaska’s measure failed in the Senate.
These small changes to legal terminology come amid a broad, national push to ensure precise language is used when it comes to victims of sensitive, heinous crimes like child sexual abuse, human trafficking, and sexual exploitation. The Department of Justice in 2023 published a memo noting that although the term “child pornography” still appears in federal law, officials prefer to use “child sexual abuse material” because it’s a better reflection of the crime.
The memo points out that in 2016 an international group working to combat child exploitation formally recognized “child sexual abuse material” as the preferred term.
This isn’t Florida’ first foray into passing legislation dealing with child sexual abuse — albeit in generally more extreme terms. In 2023, the Florida Legislature became the first in decades to pass a law expanding the death penalty to child rapists. In 2024, it defined and created punishments for “grooming,” which involves enticing children into sex. During the 2025 session, it added human trafficking of a minor as another crime eligible for execution.
The 2026 session begins Jan. 13.

Oh, and a trip to Canada. 
Tepper shared in an interview with CommonWealth Beacon that she took a previously-unreported trip up to Nova Scotia last month to meet with officials to discuss how Massachusetts can potentially tap into Canadian offshore wind, much in the way the state will soon have access to 1,200 megawatts of hydropower from Quebec.  
What’s more: Healey will be in Canada in a few weeks, too, with other New England governors for a not-yet-public forum to discuss energy, in addition to other issues, said Tepper, who spoke on the sidelines of the ClimateBeacon conference in Boston. 
And despite the federal rollbacks on clean energy funding and wind permitting that jeopardize Massachusetts’s climate targets, Tepper said that delaying those goals is “not our focus right now.” She also defended the Mass Save energy efficiency program, which was cut earlier this year and has been attacked as an unnecessary driver of high utility bills.  
This transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. 
The governor last week asked DPU to review all charges on bills. One of the most concrete things the state can do right now to avoid higher energy costs is for the DPU to reject the rate hike requests pending from the utilities. Would you personally like to see the DPU reject those requests? 
The governor asked the DPU to look at all the rates and charges. They’re there, in front of them now, and they have to do their process. It’s an adjudicatory process, and they’ll make a decision. But overall, last year, when the weather was very cold, we made some changes. Those changes are going to be reflected on the bills this winter.  
With the current federal environment, additional offshore wind seemingly stalled and even solar declining last year, do you think Massachusetts should be delaying the climate goals it has adopted?  
Clean energy is the way that we’re going to be powering the future. So regardless of any of that, we need to be bringing more clean energy into the state. We’re really focused on making sure that we can work with our regional colleagues and procure – we’re trying to unlock some energy up in Maine. What makes it so unique is that all the states have agreed ahead of time how we’re going to pay for it. With transmission, it’s always about how you’re going to pay for it. So that’s going to unlock this wind that we all have been dying to get from Maine. And we’ve got procurements going on with Connecticut. We’re really all working together to make sure that we have more supply coming in.  
The governor has talked about an “all of the above” approach, and that means we’re all working together to look at new nuclear, to look at where we are with gas, to look at where we’re going with geothermal. So it’s all about bringing all the energy in, primarily to reduce costs. 
So you don’t see a need to adjust or push back any of the climate targets. 
It’s not our focus right now. The biggest driver of [utility] bills is about transmission and distribution. It’s about infrastructure. So our energy affordability bill is really focused on that part of [consumers’ energy] bills. That’s what’s going up the fastest.  
On solar, why does the administration propose cutting net-metering rates in your energy affordability legislation? Does that send mixed messages on how much and how fast the state wants to increase solar deployment? 
One of the goals is to get some charges off the bill. We’re trying to lower costs, and we have one of the highest net-metering costs in the country. This is a forward-looking thing, and it would be specifically for large facilities. So you and your house, you’re still net-metering. I’m still net-metering. And it’s not getting rid of it, it’s lowering it to make it more consistent with what it is in the rest of the country. 
Do you think that the Mass Save program should be cut any further than it already has been? 
Last year, the DPU did reduce some of the cost of Mass Save, and those costs will be reflected in this year’s bills. Mass Save is an extremely valuable and important program and has saved customers millions and millions of dollars. I think what people sometimes forget about energy efficiency is it’s not just beneficial for the people who are doing it. It’s beneficial for all of us. When you go and look at ISO New England’s charts showing the amount of electricity that we did not use and how much money we saved because we didn’t have to build more transmission, we didn’t have to build more generation, that’s all coming from people using less electricity. It’s worth a lot of money for us to encourage people to use things efficiently. It’s a really successful program.  
On clean energy, do you have anything more to say about the state’s thinking around importing Canadian wind or building more wind itself, either onshore or in state waters?  
The governor is actually going to Canada with all the regional governors in a couple weeks. We have a good relationship with Canada. I went to Nova Scotia last month to talk to them about what they’re doing with wind. There could be some partnerships there. We’re about ready to put on this New England Clean Energy Connect project [that imports Canadian hydropower], which started with conversations many years ago, that turned into a real project. And so that’s where we’re exploring.  
The New England governors and Canadian premiers have a conference every year. And this time it’s in Newfoundland and Labrador. Some of the issues that are on the table is how can we share energy and how can we share energy costs? 
I do need to ask you, after the Cabinet went through a resignation last week, if you are comfortable in your role? Do you have any plans to leave or change your role? 
I have had the privilege of working with Gov. Healey for many years, and I’m excited to continue to work with Gov. Healey. It’s a real privilege.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A $4 billion budget request for Oklahoma public education flew through the state’s top school on Thursday and continues to the state Legislature for consideration.
If lawmakers approve the request for the 2027 fiscal year, it would represent a mostly flat budget compared to current funding levels, with only a $23.7 million spending increase caused by the rising cost of public educators’ insurance premiums. The only cut is an expiring $50,000 expense to purchase a curriculum on the Civil Rights Movement.
This is the first budget request from new state Superintendent Lindel Fields. His administration’s proposal included fewer cuts than what Fields’ predecessor, Ryan Walters, suggested last month shortly before resigning Sept. 30. Gov. Kevin Stitt appointed Fields to finish Walters’ term through January 2027.
The Oklahoma State Board of Education tabled Walters’ budget request, which would have cut $2.5 million to offset some of the insurance costs, and unanimously approved Fields’ proposal. 
The Oklahoma State Department of Education’s current $3.9 billion appropriation is the largest of any state agency.

Some of Walters’ priorities still will carry over to the new administration. Fields’ head of finance, Kristen Stephens, said the Oklahoma State Department of Education is prepared to spend $11.9 million on literacy instruction, particularly on high-dosage reading tutoring, which Walters also supported.
Stephens said the agency also plans to spend $42.3 million on teacher recruitment and retention, with much of it supporting the Oklahoma Teacher Empowerment Program. The program uses lottery funds to give bonuses to classroom teachers who take on mentorship roles and extra responsibilities in their schools.
Although the literacy and teacher empowerment initiatives aren’t new to the Education Department, Fields said he wanted to “highlight those resources that are available.”
Oklahoma lawmakers, five of whom attended the board’s meeting Thursday, will consider the budget request when they convene the 2026 legislative session in February.

After approving the budget proposal, the board declined to issue an accreditation warning to 14 school districts with multi-year deficiencies. Board members said they have concerns that Walters’ administration tainted the accreditation process.
Each public school and district in Oklahoma must be accredited by the state Board of Education, and their specific accreditation status ties to whether the Education Department identified any deficiencies in their finances, operations, governance or academic performance.
A former employee of Walters’ administration, Kourtney Heard, wrote in her resignation letter that the agency committed “manipulation of school accreditation.” The Education Department then suppressed the release of Heard’s and other senior employees’ resignation letters until Fields took over the agency.
Board member Becky Carson said she “can’t in good conscience vote for an approval for these warnings because of information that these items might have been altered at some point.”

The board unanimously voted in favor of Carson’s suggestion that all 14 districts remain at the same accreditation status they had the previous year, giving them another year to address their deficiencies.
“I’d like for us to get a better understanding of this because if a school has deficiencies, that’s serious,” board member Chris Van Denhende said during the meeting. “If they’re released from that (deficiency) and they haven’t fixed it, that’s serious, as well. So I think we need to return some credibility to this process and make sure that we look at it very carefully.”

Phil Murphy announced a deal that would allow the owners of a Cranbury farm to prevent the town from seizing it to build affordable housing.,"Cranbury township officials had sought to claim a portion of a 21-acre beef cattle farm through eminent domain to site affordable housing. (Nikita Biryukov | New Jersey Monitor)Cranbury officials have asked a Superior Court judge to delay proceedings over their bid to seize a local farm for affordable housing using eminent domain, saying pending regulatory changes could give the township other means to meet its affordable housing obligations.
The township’s bid to claim the farm, which is family-owned and tenant-operated, drew controversy and attention from Republican officials. Former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican nominee for governor, has campaigned in Cranbury, and the township’s move to seize the land drew opposition from U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins.
But Gov. Phil Murphy on Thursday announced a potential end to the controversy, saying his administration and the involved parties have reached an agreement to ensure the farm remains under its current ownership while Cranbury leaders look elsewhere to build affordable housing.
“For 175 years, the Henry Family Farm has stood on South River Road in Cranbury as a proud symbol of that agricultural tradition,” Murphy said in a statement. “New Jersey will always protect its farmers and farmland. And we will always live up to our reputation as the Garden State.”
What happens to ‘pioneering’ public safety program under next governor?

The beef cattle farm sits on a 21-acre plot less than 600 feet from the New Jersey Turnpike, separated from the major roadway by chain-link fencing and a trio of warehouses minutes from Exit 8A. It has about 40 head of cattle, including a vocal steer named Lucky.
Local officials had sought to claim some of the property to meet the township’s affordable housing obligations, which require it to stand up 265 low- and moderate-income units over the next decade.
The township’s affordable housing plan would have involved the seizure of about 11.6 acres — not including a 19th-century farmhouse and other buildings — for the creation of 130 housing units, all of which would be subject to affordability controls.
Township officials said little land in the township of about 2,300 was developable under state affordable housing standards, and the few other sites that were could be ineligible for federal tax credits that subsidize housing production.
In a letter to the court signed by other parties in the case, Kevin Van Hise, an attorney for the township, said amendments stemming from comments submitted by the township and others on a pending rules proposal on low-income housing tax credit allocation could forestall the need for seizure through eminent domain.
“The parties believe this is the best path forward and will likely result in a final settlement agreement that will resolve the vast majority of claims in the submitted challenges,” Van Hise said in the letter.
The township’s comments on the rulemaking proposal have not yet been publicly released.
The Fair Share Housing Center, a nonprofit that litigates to ensure municipalities meet their affordable housing obligations and opposed the selection of the site for different reasons, was also pausing its challenge to the farm’s selection.
The center had opposed siting affordable housing at the farm because of its isolated location and the warehouses surrounding the site.

“It has come to our attention that certain reading materials on the Epic Reading platform may not align with the diverse belief systems of all our school district families,” North Little Rock School District administrators wrote in the memo.

Action Memo-Epic Reading Content 
Epic is a digital reading platform that hosts more than 40,000 books, audiobooks and educational videos. The two-page memo provides NLRSD staff with a step-by-step process for how to hide the listed 50 books from students.
“This measure is a proactive step to ensure all content used in our classrooms is appropriate for our students and respectful of family beliefs,” the memo states. “We affirm the worth and dignity of every student and family in our district and remain committed to providing learning environments where all children feel safe, accepted, and supported. We appreciate your cooperation in this matter.”
The memo is from Superintendent Gregory Pilewski, Assistant Superintendents of School Performance Thomas Rogers and Jacob Smith, Assistant Superintendent of Network Support Services LeAnn Stoll, and Coordinator of English Language Arts (ELA), Literacy and Reading Carmen Langston.
Over the past few years, some Arkansas elected officials and community coalitions have sought to keep LGBTQ+ content out of children’s reach in libraries, calling it “indoctrination” and “age-inappropriate.” Opponents of such efforts have said this content reflects the community and restricting access to it is censorship.
Most of these efforts have pertained to public libraries, but some school districts have restricted access to certain books, such as Conway and Farmington.
Some of the titles North Little Rock administrators seek to keep away from students include:

“Love Wins,” an account of the legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States;
“Bathe the Cat,” a children’s book about household chores that includes a rainbow flag in an illustration of a family’s refrigerator;
“The Mother of a Movement,” a biography of Jeanne Manford, the founder of PFLAG (Parents, Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays);
Biographies of LGBTQ+ public figures Megan Rapinoe and Jazz Jennings.

As of Thursday morning, NLRSD spokesperson Dustin Barnes had not responded to an email asking what prompted the memo.
Laws on book challenges, ‘indoctrination’ create culture of fear in Arkansas school libraries

All Arkansas schools are required to have content challenge policies in place, and Act 372 of 2023 put the final say on the availability of challenged books in the hands of school boards. Librarians told the Advocate in 2023 that the new law created a culture of fear and self-censorship in Arkansas school libraries.
The same law would have given city and county officials authority over challenged books, but U.S. District Judge Timothy Brooks of Fayetteville blocked this portion of the law temporarily in 2023 and permanently in 2024. The state appealed Brooks’ ruling this year.
Act 372 also would have created criminal liability for school and public librarians who distribute content that some consider “obscene” or “harmful to minors,” two terms that the law does not define. Brooks’ injunction also blocked this provision.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Kid-in-library-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-23 13:17:30.708338

(John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)In a defeat for Gov. Bill Lee’s administration, a three-judge panel ruled against the state’s effort to end a longstanding lawsuit challenging the vagueness and inadequacy of exceptions to Tennessee’s near-total abortion ban.
Attorneys for the state asked for a ruling in their favor, without a trial, in a lawsuit brought in 2023 by a group of Tennessee OB-GYNs and women who had suffered serious medical problems during their pregnancies. The American Medical Association subsequently joined the lawsuit.
State attorneys had argued that a 2025 amendment adding “medical necessity exceptions” to Tennessee’s 2022 abortion ban made the lawsuit moot.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
But the Chancery Court panel disagreed, signaling skepticism that exceptions to the state’s abortion ban were adequate to protect the lives and health of pregnant women in Tennessee.
The plaintiffs, the judges wrote, “have sufficiently alleged that the defects in the Medical Necessity Exception place their lives at risk in violation of their constitutional right to life.”
“The changes made by the 2025 Amendment do not significantly alter the status of this case,” the panel wrote, concluding the lawsuit contained sufficiently serious and credible allegations to move forward.
Tennessee abortion ban
Tennessee’s strict abortion ban, which went into effect after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, was amended twice to provide limited exceptions for medical conditions. The law, in its original form and as amended, does not contain exceptions for victims of rape or incest, or for pregnancies with fetal abnormalities.
In 2023, Gov. Bill Lee signed into law an amendment that said a doctor may perform one “using reasonable medical judgement, based upon the facts known to the physician at the time” if the abortion is necessary to prevent a pregnant woman’s death or to “prevent serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.”  The legislation also added molar and ectopic pregnancies as exceptions to the state’s abortion ban.

It was this 2023 legislation the lawsuit initially challenged as overly vague.
In 2024, the three-judge panel temporarily blocked the state’s medical board from disciplining doctors for providing emergency abortions but declined to block criminal prosecution of physicians, saying it lacked the authority to do so.
Their ruling also outlined four specific pregnancy-related conditions that qualify as “medical necessity” exceptions to the state’s abortion ban, noting the then “confusion and lack of consensus within the Tennessee medical community on the circumstances requiring necessary health- and life-saving abortion care.”
The four conditions include: “previable preterm premature rupture of the membranes; inevitable abortion, defined as dilation of the cervix prior to viability of the pregnancy, either by preterm labor or cervical insufficiency;” :fatal fetal diagnoses that lead to maternal health conditions, such as severe preeclampsia and mirror syndrome associated with fetal hydrops;” and “fatal fetal diagnoses leading to an infection that will result in uterine rupture or potential loss of fertility.”
This year, lawmakers further amended the state’s abortion ban to include the four conditions outlined by the chancery court ruling. The amendment says doctors “may” provide an abortion for these conditions.
The 2025 legislation also explicitly excludes mental health diagnoses as a medical exception to the state’s abortion ban. The panel’s decision, issued last week, allows the plaintiffs to challenge the lack of a mental health- related exception to the abortion ban.

State must turn over documents

The panel in a separate decision last week allowed the plaintiffs to obtain internal documents from the Tennessee General Assembly, the governor and legislative committees that reveal the” state’s interest in enforcing the amended abortion ban and medical exceptions.”
The panel likewise allowed for subpoenas to Tennessee Department of Health for data on abortions, maternal mortality and any unofficial guidance the department has issued to health providers since 2022.

On Monday, attorneys for the state filed an emergency motion seeking permission to appeal the ruling requiring state officials to comply with the subpoenas.
State attorneys said the decision to force state officials to turn over internal documents “presents a momentous separation-of-powers  question – pitting the state judiciary against the other two branches – that should be decided by the appellate courts.”
The group filing suit is represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, a New York-based law firm.
Tennessee requires three-judge panels to consider challenges to state law. Chancellor Patricia Head Moskal, Judge Sandra Donaghy and Chancellor Kasey Culbreath issued the opinion in this case.

Toulouse Oliver has served as secretary of state since 2016—when she served a two-year term—and is in her second four-year term. She previously spent close to a decade as Bernalillo county clerk.
As recently as late August, Toulouse Oliver said she was not planning a run for office, telling Source New Mexico that she was instead focusing on her finishing her election-related dissertation at the University of New Mexico. She said she changed her mind after “a lot of folks” worried about the state of the country approached her in recent months urging her to stay in elected office.
“I have always felt called to service, so I felt that I was being called again, and that’s why I changed my mind,” she said.
Toulouse Oliver’s announcement follows State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard’s withdrawal from the race last week due to her husband’s health issues. New Mexico State Sen. Harold Pope of Albuquerque and Loving Village Councilor Jackie Lee Onsurez remain in the Democratic primary race. Republican Manny Lardzibal thus far faces no opposition in that contest.
In a 40-second video embedded in her new campaign website, Toulouse Oliver pointed to her time battling “MAGA extremists” over their false claims of election fraud in New Mexico and across the country after the 2020 election. She testified before Congress in July 2022 that threats against her office spiked, including several her office reported to police, after the issue came to a head in Otero County during the 2022 primary election.
In the video, Toulouse Oliver said New Mexico is “facing a moment unlike any in our history. Donald Trump is attacking our democracy and pushing an extreme agenda. New Mexico needs a fighter who will stand up to him. That’s why I’m running for Lt. Governor.”
As for her dissertation, Toulouse said she’s still working on it, but “it’s probably going to take a little more time now,” she said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_8317-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-10-23 13:01:08.506819

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Six weeks after Hasbro Inc. showed its cards by announcing plans to relocate its headquarters from Pawtucket to Boston by the end of 2026, few additional details have been revealed.
Indeed, there was almost no mention of the pending move — including its effects on jobs and costs — in the company’s third-quarter earnings report, published Thursday morning, nor during the accompanying 60-minute call with investors.
The only acknowledgment of the news that rocked Rhode Island was a footnote tucked into the legal disclaimer of the 19-page financial filing: 
“Our business could be adversely affected by challenges and disruptions arising from the loss of skills, knowledge or expertise, and from uncertainty regarding the continued employment of key personnel, particularly as a result of recent workforce reductions and the planned relocation of our Rhode Island operations to Boston, Massachusetts.”
Andrea Snyder, a spokesperson for Hasbro, did not immediately respond to questions on the costs and timing of the move Thursday morning. 
Hasbro has already confirmed it will leave no trace of its century-old Rhode Island roots after relocating the majority of its local workforce to Boston by the end of 2026. The company announced in September it has inked a deal to lease seven floors of a 16-story laboratory building in the Boston Seaport, but the rent it will pay for a prime piece of city real estate remains unknown. Rhode Island leaders had attempted to entice the company to stay within state lines, even if not at its existing Newport Avenue headquarters, by offering up a piece of undeveloped land in the I-195 Redevelopment District for $1.
But tax incentives were never discussed during the Rhode Island General Assembly’s 2025 session, while Massachusetts leaders spent more than a year negotiating with Hasbro executives over potential tax breaks, according to publicly released emails first reported by the Boston Business Journal. Hasbro ultimately secured $14 million in state tax credits, approved by the Massachusetts Economic Development Council on Sept. 17, for the 700 jobs it has promised to bring to its new headquarters.
Hasbro employs more than 1,000 people in Rhode Island now, suggesting some might be laid off as part of the move. But the company has not given any notice of mass layoffs to the state Department of Labor and training as of Thursday. Private employers with more than 100 workers are required to give state and local officials 60 days notice before making cuts under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. Earlier this year, the company warned that tariffs could force staffing cuts.
Digital gaming drives growth
While trade wars with China continue to sap potential profits — with an estimated $20 million in losses due to tariffs nationwide in the third quarter — Hasbro has bounced back quickly.
The company reported a $233.2 million profit for the three-month period that ended Sept. 30, up 17.4% from the same period in 2023. Earnings per diluted share rose 5 basis points year over year, from $1.59 per share to $1.64 per share.
The strong financial showing, which beat analysts’ expectations, was largely driven by its digital gaming business, including MAGIC: The Gathering, which continues to see record revenue, up 55% year over year — reaching $459.4 million as of Sept. 30 — amid interest from new players and collaborations with beloved brands like Marvel’s Spider-Man. 
The company’s digital licensing business, which includes Monopoly GO!, also boosted the bottom line by 21% to $364.6 million, according to the earnings report.
The gains were partially offset by declines in toy sales with delayed orders from retailers amid inflationary cost hikes and the fallout from international trade wars. 
Yet CEO Chris Cocks remained optimistic on a call with investors Wednesday, touting the start to a long-term growth period for the toy segment in the final three months of this year. 
The company has already begun to shift its supply chain away from China —- where it had sourced 50% of its toys and games — with the goal of sourcing no more than 30% of its products from any single country outside the United States by the end of next year.
“Hasbro delivered another quarter of growth, highlighting the strength of our brands and Playing to Win strategy,” Cocks said in a statement. “We’re poised to enter 2026 with momentum.”
The company also revised its year-end projections upward, expecting total revenue growth in the “high single digits” with an adjusted operating margin of 22% to 23%. In late April, a month after President Donald Trump just as President Donald Trump unveiled 145% tariffs on Chinese imports, Hasbro predicted a $60 million to $180 million operating loss for the year.
Scaling back of tariffs — now at 30% for Chinese imports, has soothed Hasbro’s fears, along with strategies for “opportunistic debt reduction” and “cost discipline,” company executives said.
Still, $60 million in losses from tariffs are expected through the end of the year, with a larger figure in 2026 assuming a full-year impact from the trade wars, Gina Goetter, Hasbro’s chief financial and chief operating officer, said on the earnings call Thursday.
“We’re still working through the net impact,” Goetter said, noting that the financial losses from tariffs didn’t manifest on the company’s balance sheet until the third quarter of 2025.
Shares rose 2.1% in the first two hours following Hasbro’s earnings release Thursday morning. 
The Boston Seaport office will house Hasbro’s corporate services, as well as its toy, board game and licensing arms. Its digital gaming business, which includes MAGIC: The Gathering, will remain at its present hub in Renton, Washington, which features 111,000 square feet and 500 employees.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-23 16:31:33+00:00,Mississippi Today,Federal judge in Mississippi admits staff used AI to draft inaccurate order,Devna Bose and Taylor Vance,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/23/federal-judge-in-mississippi-admits-staff-used-ai-to-draft-inaccurate-order/,Judge Wingate conceded that the opinion drafted with AI did not undergo proper review and said he’s taking steps to make sure it doesn’t happen again.,"A federal judge in Mississippi has admitted that his staff used artificial intelligence to draft a flawed court order, after months of speculation and an inquiry from a U.S. senator. 
U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate sent a letter on Tuesday to the director of the Administrative Office of the Courts in response to an inquiry from Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley. Wingate acknowledged that his law clerk used an AI program to compose an order that paused the enforcement of a state law that bans diversity, equity and inclusion programs in Mississippi public schools. 
The order, issued July 20, was factually inaccurate — naming defendants and plaintiffs that weren’t parties to the case, misquoting state law and referencing a case that doesn’t exist — which led the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office to raise concerns. 
Wingate then replaced the order with a corrected version, wiped the flawed order from the docket, and denied a request from the Attorney General’s Office to restore the original order with errors to the public docket. He refused to explain the errors, calling them “clerical” mistakes.
Months later, Grassley sent a letter to Wingate, asking him to address the errors and the speculated use of AI.
Wingate finally acknowledged that one of his law clerks used an AI program called Perplexity to analyze publicly available information from the docket to craft the order. But Wingate emphasized no privileged or sealed information was used. Wingate says he still does not plan to restore the original order to the docket, in an effort to avoid confusion. 
The judge conceded that the order was a draft opinion, and it did not undergo proper review before being added to the docket. Wingate said he’s taking steps to make sure this doesn’t happen again. 
The corrective measures include requiring all draft opinions, orders and memos to undergo a second, independent review. He will also require all cited cases be printed and attached to the final draft. 
“I manage a very busy docket and strive to maintain the public’s trust by administering justice in a fair and transparent manner,” Wingate wrote. “Given that I hold myself and my staff to the highest standards of conduct, I do not expect that a mistake like this one will occur in the future.”
Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, commended Wingate, a Reagan-appointed judge, for acknowledging the mistake.
“Each federal judge, and the judiciary as an institution, has an obligation to ensure the use of generative AI does not violate litigants’ rights or prevent fair treatment under the law,” Grassley said in a statement. “The judicial branch needs to develop more decisive, meaningful and permanent AI policies and guidelines.” 
Still, AI usage in the federal judiciary is a serious issue, and it’s largely uncharted territory, especially among federal judges.  
The legal profession has seen a rise in AI use in recent years, with people relying on software or processes that attempt to replicate aspects of human work. These use vast amounts of data to accomplish tasks such as researching court cases and citing them in legal briefs. 
But these systems are not perfect and can “hallucinate,” or provide false information. 
Judges in Mississippi have punished attorneys in both federal and state courts for using AI because attorneys have an ethical and professional responsibility to tell the truth in court. 
But there’s little accountability when the roles are reversed. 
Robert Conrad Jr., the director of the federal Administrative Office of the Courts, also sent Grassley a letter noting that he recently established an AI task force composed of judges and technology experts to recommend new policies on AI usage in the federal court system. 
Conrad said the task force, during the summer, published interim guidance on AI, suggesting that attorneys should review and independently verify all AI-generated content and should consider disclosing when they’ve used AI to help craft documents.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/07041116/judge-Henry-Wingate-e1514409305395.jpg,,,2025-10-23 13:01:08.506819
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-23 16:26:36+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,ICE sweeps viewed as ‘real awakening’ by immigration bill backers,Sam Drysdale | State House News Service,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/politics/ice-sweeps-viewed-as-real-awakening-by-immigration-bill-backers/,Supporters of the so-called Safe Communities Act say the stepped-up raids have stoked fear in immigrant communities and underscore the need to shield local law enforcement from entanglement with federal immigration authorities.,"WITH ENFORCEMENT of immigration laws surging in Massachusetts, a coalition of advocates rallied Wednesday and attached new urgency to the call for lawmakers to revive a long-stalled proposal that top legislative leaders have repeatedly dismissed.
The rally comes a week after federal officials announced the results of “Operation Patriot 2.0,” in which U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested 1,406 people statewide due to their immigration status between Sept. 4 and 30. ICE said just over 600, less than half, of those detained had been convicted of or charged with serious crimes. Nearly 300 had previously been ordered removed by immigration judges.
Supporters of the so-called Safe Communities Act (S 1681 / H 2580) say the stepped-up raids have stoked fear in immigrant communities and underscore the need to shield local law enforcement from entanglement with federal immigration authorities. The bill, filed every term since at least 2017, would bar police and court officers from inquiring about immigration status and prohibit local cooperation with ICE unless required by law.
“I think there’s been a real awakening… all the sharing on social media of the outrages that have been committed by ICE have made abundantly clear there is a definite need to do what we can do to protect all our communities, and that local police shouldn’t be swept up into the enforcement of federal immigration laws,” said Frank Soults, spokesperson for 32BJ SEIU, a union representing largely immigrant workers.
Top Democrats on Beacon Hill have shown little appetite to advance the measure, which was filed at the start of the year but hasn’t been scheduled for a hearing by the Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee.
Asked last month whether the increased ICE activity warranted movement for on the bill, House Speaker Ron Mariano said, “I don’t know if it’s a year for that.” 
He added that immigration enforcement is a federal matter, not one for state government to address. “There has to be a way for us to coexist without having to get into defining and limiting each other’s specific charges,” Mariano said.
Senate President Karen Spilka similarly downplayed the need for the legislation, arguing that much of what the bill proposes is already standard practice in Massachusetts. 
“Massachusetts has been clear that we will help federal ICE if and when there are criminal issues, criminals being arrested,” she said, noting concerns come when people are detained without clear justification or warrants.
The legislation was last sent to a study order in 2023, effectively killing its progress for the session.
Advocates argue the political winds have shifted, pointing to passage of a 2023 law enabling undocumented immigrants to apply for driver’s licenses, and $5 million the Legislature earmarked this year for undocumented immigrants to access legal services if arrested by ICE. 
“I think there has been a turning point. It’s taken a long time… but we’re hopeful,” said Soults. “We feel like the coalition is stronger now than ever.”
Supporters say recent ICE operations have hardened community support for the bill. Sen. Sal DiDomenico, whose district includes Everett and Chelsea, which have large immigrant populations, condemned ICE actions. 
“We have a rogue agency coming into our communities every single day of the week, breaking the law, causing terror,” he said. “Words don’t make a difference. Only action is what gets us to a place where we can bring dignity back to this country.”
Rep. Manny Cruz of Salem, the son of immigrants, said the State House “must” pass the bill this session and needs to take a stronger stance. 
“This house here,” he said, gesturing to the State House, “We have work to do. We need to ensure that we’re living up to our values and our commitment to be a place of equity and justice for all.”
When asked specifically if Gov. Maura Healey, Mariano and Spilka were doing enough to protect immigrants, Cruz said legislative leaders have met with the Black and Latino Legislative Caucus to discuss immigration enforcement. 
“I think that those meetings were well received,” he said. “What I’ll name is that we have more work to do as a coalition to ensure that we’re building support outside of the building,” calling for broader backing from law enforcement and local officials.
Federal officials, meanwhile, have defended their operations. ICE officials said Operation Patriot 2.0 focused on individuals who had violated immigration law, including 277 who had previously been ordered deported. 
Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said the operation “exposed the grave consequences of sanctuary policies.”
Healey has repeatedly said Massachusetts is not a sanctuary state, but the Trump administration has targeted Boston as one of 35 “sanctuary jurisdictions” that they say impede the enforcement of federal immigration laws.
“Every illegal alien we arrested during the operation was breaking U.S. immigration law, and hundreds were violent criminals who should never have been allowed to roam freely in our communities,” Lyons said. “Local politicians are responsible for protecting their constituents, so they need to step up and end irresponsible sanctuary policies.”
ICE Boston’s acting Field Office Director David Wesling said those arrested include “murderers, rapists, drug traffickers, child sex predators and members of violent transnational criminal gangs.”
Still, the bill’s backers say raids are sweeping up too many people who pose no threat, while fostering distrust between immigrant communities and local law enforcement — something they believe the bill would fix.
“As a state, as local municipalities, we have to stand up and be willing to say that we will not lend a hand to ICE to tear apart our communities,” Cruz said. “Instead, we will send a message of true public safety, that regardless of your documentation status, that you can come to our local police department and report a crime without the fear of being deported.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/68f9242c83aec.image_-1.webp?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-23 13:01:08.506819

As North Carolina hospitals bear the impact of lost Medicaid funding at the state and federal levels, a report from the North Carolina Healthcare Association shows they provided $7.4 billion in benefits to their communities in 2024.
Released by the state hospital advocacy group on Wednesday, the report shows that North Carolina hospitals provided $417 million for medical education and training, $145 million for subsidized health services such as neonatal care, addiction recovery, and trauma services, and $106 million for health research, among other benefits last year.
The report, aimed at showcasing community benefits and work that serves the public good, provides a counterpoint to criticism frequently leveled at hospitals by some elected leaders in North Carolina. Former Republican state Treasurer Dale Folwell, an outspoken critic who called the hospital system a “cartel,” frequently accused them of failing to meet their obligations for charity care and cost transparency.

It also highlights investments in the state’s healthcare pipeline. Education initiatives detailed in the report, for example, are intended to counter a projected shortage of around 9,000 registered nurses in the state by 2030, with hospitals partnering with Appalachian State University and Coastal Carolina Community College among others to offer tuition assistance and scholarships and launch new nursing programs and fellowships.
However, NCHA President Josh Dobson warned, those investments are at risk.
Dobson wrote in an open letter that even as hospitals are “underfunded for the care they provide,” they are duty-bound to provide care for uninsured and underinsured patients. That leaves them vulnerable to  greater financial hardship if more North Carolinians lose access to Medicaid benefits.
“These challenges are too great for any hospital to face alone,” Dobson wrote. “Hospitals depend on strong partnerships, innovation, and sustainable resources to create programs that make a real difference — and to remain financially strong so they can continue this work for years to come.”
The General Assembly has been deadlocked for months over fully funding the state’s Medicaid program, resulting in cuts to reimbursement rates for all services this month. And cuts to the program enacted in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act could cost state health providers billions, particularly if it triggers the end of North Carolina’s Medicaid expansion, which has extended coverage to roughly 680,000 residents.

The report indicated that North Carolina hospitals are at risk of losing $32 billion in Medicaid funding over the next decade under program changes passed in the bill. That drop in funding imperils the rural hospitals that serve 80 of the state’s 100 counties.
“This will make it challenging to do this important work to keep people healthy and out of the hospital, which is critical to lowering healthcare costs for everyone,” the report says. “There is still time for Congress to act to prevent some of these cuts from happening and protect both hospitals and the people they serve.”
Many of these facilities were already on the brink. In 2023, Martin General Hospital of Williamston closed, leaving its county without a local hospital. According to the report, providers like East Carolina University Health have tried to fill the gaps, offering free health screenings in Martin County and proposing in June to reopen the hospital for emergency care.
The report also details how hospitals stepped in during Hurricane Helene to provide aid, with Mission Hospital in Asheville seeing 3,500 patients and treating another 5,500 in clinics. In the months after, its staff helped distribute food and water to those in need.
“It was an incredible sight, the way that these team members were all working together from different departments that have never even met before,” said Taylor McCaulley, a nurse manager at Mission Hospital in a video accompanying the report. “You’re seeing all of these staff members that are coming in just to truly save the day for them.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Medicaid-cuts-nurse-Getty-2025.jpg,,,2025-10-23 13:01:08.506819

State unemployment records indicate Joyce D. Richardson, the City of Jefferson’s utility billing clerk, was fired in July for alleged theft, dishonesty, failing to follow policies and procedures, and failing to complete city records as required.
According to the records, Richardson was responsible for receiving the $150 deposits that new utility customers paid when opening their accounts with the city. The deposits could be made electronically or through cash or check.

At a recent hearing on Richardson’s unemployment-benefits claim, city officials testified that on March 25, 2025, the city’s finance officer, Sarah Morlan, and City Clerk Roxanne Gorsuch reported that a cash deposit collected from a new utility customer appeared to be missing.
According to the testimony, an audit into the city’s utility account deposits was conducted, after which it was determined that three cash deposits — made in December 2024, January 2025 and March 2025 — were missing and that all three were handled by Richardson.
In April, city officials asked Richardson to search for the missing deposits, but she allegedly indicated she did not have time due to her “billing preparation” work. She was then placed on unpaid administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation into the matter, and the Greene County Sheriff’s Office was contacted.
According to the state unemployment records, a sheriff’s office investigator prepared a report, with findings, that in late June was forwarded to the Greene County Attorney’s Office for consideration of criminal charges, and to the city and the Office of Auditor of State.
On July 3, 2025, the city fired Richardson. She subsequently filed for unemployment benefits, which led to the recent hearing before Administrative Law Judge Elizabeth Johnson.
State records indicate that at the hearing, Richardson testified she believed the city fired her in retaliation for taking time off to speak with someone about applying for a different job but also testified that none of her coworkers liked her and that they had conspired to force her out of her job.
Johnson recently ruled the evidence suggested Richardson committed workplace misconduct and was ineligible for unemployment benefits.
“The employer has presented credible testimony that claimant took three $150 cash utility account deposits,” Johnson ruled.  “This money should have been deposited into the employer’s account, not taken by claimant for her own personal purposes. Every employer across all industries has the right to expect that employees do not steal. Theft of company assets, whether money or equipment or time, is disqualifying misconduct even without prior warning.”
Court records indicate no criminal charges were filed in the case. Richardson had worked for the city since August 2020, according to state records.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was not able to reach Richardson for comment.

(Official White House Photo by Daniel Torok)Environmental groups’ request that a federal court shutter the “Alligator Alcatraz” detention center was paused Wednesday because of the government shutdown.
Led by the non-profit Friends of the Everglades, a coalition of activists had asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit to reconsider its September decision to keep open the migrant detention center, located in the heart of the Everglades, despite environmental concerns.
But the court on Wednesday agreed with the Department of Homeland Security that the case should be paused until government attorneys can work again.
“The motion to stay the appeal is granted. The movant is directed to file a notice with the court when the purpose for the stay is obviated,” the two-sentence order reads.
Although this comes just weeks after the court expedited the appeal and scheduled oral arguments for January, the federal government’s shutdown on Sept. 30 set off a cascade of missed pay, furloughed workers, and in-limbo cases.
So, on Oct. 10, government attorneys, noting that many Justice Department lawyers are banned from working until the government comes online again, asked for a pause on the case until “DOJ attorneys are permitted to resume their usual civil litigation functions.”
How did we get here?
The state created the sprawling, 3,000-bed facility atop the seldom-used Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in Big Cypress National Park, drawing scrutiny from Democrats, immigration groups, and environmental organizations since its July 1 opening.
Friends of the Everglades, the Center for Biodiversity, and the Miccosukee Tribe filed suit over the summer alleging the detention center violates federal environmental laws. A district judge agreed, ordering Florida to shut down the center by September’s end. But a federal three-judge panel on Sept. 4 reversed, noting that because the site had not received federal dollars, and was entirely state-run, federal environmental regulations don’t apply.
A week later, DHS and Florida Emergency Management Director Kevin Guthrie revealed that Florida had applied for federal reimbursement — though Friends of the Everglades believes the request was made earlier. On Sept. 30, the state received more than $608 million to pay for the construction, transportation, and equipment costs of the facility
The plaintiffs soon after appealed, asking the Eleventh Circuit to reconsider. When DHS pointed out that some government staff couldn’t work during the shutdown, Friends of the Everglades called the situation “regrettable” but argued it didn’t outweigh the environment “harms” caused by dragging out the case.
“An indefinite stay in this case … would cause Plaintiffs ongoing and irreversible harm where the federal action being challenged — the construction and operation of an immigration detention center in the Everglades that imperils sensitive wetlands, endangered Species, and communities in the area — would continue during the indefinite stay period,” the attorneys wrote.
When the Eleventh Circuit released its order against them, Eve Samples, executive director of the Friends of the Everglades, put out a statement calling the move a ruse to avoid accountability.
“There’s a growing mountain of evidence that Alligator Alcatraz was built in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act,” Samples said. “Meanwhile, the government is dragging its feet in court to dodge accountability — using the federal shutdown as an excuse to delay the appeal.
“We’re more resolved than ever to keep fighting to restore the lower court’s injunction to protect the Everglades.”

U.S. tariff measures, combined with China’s halted soybean purchases, are hitting Missouri farmers where it hurts, threatening billions of dollars in export revenue and shaking Missouri’s agricultural backbone.


Since April 2, the day President Donald Trump dubbed “Liberation Day” and imposed sweeping tariffs on America’s trade partners, businesses have been scrambling to adapt. Missouri is no different, with its agriculture sector being heavily strained.

Soybeans are Missouri’s most valuable agricultural product. The state produced nearly $2.9 billion worth of the crop last year, which ranked sixth nationally.

But amidst tariffs and a trade dispute with China, which previously was the biggest importer of U.S. soybeans, American farmers are seeing a steep drop in exports.

Bryant Kagay owns Kagay Farms in Maysville, where he primarily grows corn, soybeans and wheat. Kagay said he has experienced a “significant” drop in soybean prices.


“Over the past several months, there’s been a pretty good decline through the growing season for the expected cash price of soybeans,” Kagay said.


At the center of this struggle is the tense trade relationship between the U.S. and China. In 2024, U.S. farmers sold more than $12.6 billion worth of soybeans to China, making up more than half of all American soybean exports, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.


China was one of the first major targets of tariffs after Trump began his second term. Following a series of trade escalations earlier in the year, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods reached as high as 125% in April. However, a temporary agreement reached in May significantly rolled back many of those increases.


Currently, the baseline import tax on Chinese products stands at 10%, though certain products still face additional duties above that level.


In response, Beijing not only has utilized reciprocal tariffs, but also has stopped purchasing U.S soybeans, which has been detrimental to American farmers.


“Trade wars are harmful to everyone, and these latest developments are deeply disappointing at a moment when soybean farmers are facing an ever-growing financial crisis.” Caleb Ragland, president of the American Soybean Association, said in a statement issued Oct. 10.


While global demand for U.S soybeans shrinks and prices decline, many producers are struggling to cover their costs. Currently, soybean prices are hovering around $10 per bushel, well below their $13 per bushel level in December 2023, according to the USDA.


“The fact that China is not buying soybeans now has been a very big negative for the market, causing prices to be lower and their producer returns to be far less than they would have been otherwise,” said Pat Westhoff, director of the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute at the University of Missouri.

In addition to torpedoing demand for U.S. soybeans, the Trump administration’s trade measures have posed challenges for farmers and business owners because of their unpredictable nature.


Tariff policies have changed rapidly, and court cases against some tariffs are still pending, leaving many Missouri farmers left without a clear roadmap.


“Farmers are trying to decide which crop to plant next spring, which investments to make. It’s really hard to know for sure what to do,” Westhoff said. “Producers have to make choices about what they’re going to do in 2026 and beyond. … That’s hard to do when the environment is as uncertain as it is today.”


Many Missouri farmers may face difficult choices about how to stay profitable amid the shifting trade landscape. With global demand becoming less predictable and more scarce, farmers and policymakers are being forced to start considering ways to strengthen the domestic soybean market.


One promising area of growth lies in the expanding biofuel industry, which experts say has the potential to create more stable domestic demand for agricultural commodities.


“If there were more demand for biofuels, that would result in increased demand for corn to make ethanol, and increased demand for soybean oil to make biodiesel,” Westhoff said. “So if we were to have policy changes that encourage the use of those biofuels, that could be a positive to demand for agricultural products and support prices in the face of lost markets overseas.”

Despite the potential to develop a bigger domestic market in the future, farmers are struggling right now. To ease the burden, the federal government has discussed deploying trade relief packages, including payments under programs like the Market Facilitation Program, which was used when Trump imposed tariffs on China in his first term.


“There’s talk these days of a possible aid package that might provide some benefits to producers of soybeans and other crops and other livestock products,” Westhoff said. “If there’s not any additional assistance provided and we continue to have the sorts of disruptions we’ve had, I’d expect fewer people to plant soybeans in 2026.”


Still, while federal aid packages may offer a temporary lifeline, many farmers say they aren’t a long-term fix.


“I think they just ultimately cause inflation,” Kagay said. “What’s going to happen ultimately, the seed, chemical, fertilizer equipment dealers are going to get that money, and it just kind of kicks the can down the road.”

Flannery carried the bill in the legislature earlier this year, but it didn’t move out of a House committee. Rep. John Blanton, R-Salyersville, filed a similar bill during the 2024 legislative session, while the late Louisville Democratic Rep. Charles Miller first introduced the legislation in 2022. 
“Really, what I want to do is make sure we can get something across the finish line that makes these products in America again, so we can use these and get people back to work,” Flannery told the committee Thursday. 
The 2025 version of the bill would have mandated contracts for construction or maintenance of public buildings or public works projects, like roads, sewers and streets, include provisions that any of the iron, steel, aluminum or any of the other manufactured goods used as a primary component be manufactured in the U.S. 
This year’s version also allowed governments to waive the Buy American requirement if it would increase the project’s cost by 10% or more. A local impact statement prepared by the Legislative Research Commission predicted the legislation would have a moderate to significant financial impact on local governments by driving up construction costs in possible several ways. No fiscal note is attached to the bill on the legislature’s site.
At the federal level, former President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump have supported buying American policies. 
Chad Conley, a rapid response coordinator for United Steelworkers District 8, told the committee that the bill is “an opportunity to revitalize American manufacturing” by ensuring that public works projects in Kentucky utilize metals made in the U.S. At present, state agencies typically award contracts to the lowest bidder, “allowing foreign producers to undercut U.S. prices and win awards,” he said. 
“State preference laws like this one can change that practice to require governments to accept a bid that might be marginally higher than the lowest bid with the knowledge that money spent will be circulated back into the American economy,” Conley added. 
Mike Buckentin, CEO of Bowling Green-based nonprofit Metals Innovation Initiative, told the committee that recent investments have been made in the metals industry, particularly in Kentucky. In 2023, Nucor Steel opened a steel mill in Brandenburg, adding jobs to the Meade County community. 
“Kentucky is doing great, not just in manufacturing overall, but specifically in metals,” Buckentin said. “We continue to grow, we continue to invest and we’re one of the leaders in the nation right now in metals and in manufacturing.”
Some members of the committee expressed support for the proposal. Rep. Al Gentry, D-Louisville, said that lawmakers must “be careful how we construct this.” 
“I’ve always said that one of the most important things in the jobs we do as legislators is we have to create an environment where businesses want to invest in the state and can operate and at the same time create good quality jobs, because putting people to work with good quality jobs is really one of the most important things we can do,” Gentry said. 
At the end of the discussion, co-chair of the committee, Sen. Phillip Wheeler, R-Pikeville, called the proposal “a great concept.” 
“For at least the last 30 or 40 years, some of the uniparty people in Washington have really caused some damage to our national security and the United States by shipping a lot of these industries overseas,” Wheeler said. “We need to work on getting them back here in the United States.” 
Flannery told his colleagues that he is open to making changes to the legislation before the 2026 legislative session.

However, the state has not yet received any disaster aid for the June storms. North Dakota officials continue working on reimbursement requests to submit to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)OLATHE — The Kansas abortion trial with wide-reaching implications for state lawmakers and health care providers wrapped Friday with arguments over the two sides’ differing definitions of pain, humanity and consciousness.
“These are not easy issues,” Judge Christopher Jayaram said at the close of the day’s proceedings.
“I take this responsibility with understanding the gravity to which I am charged,” he said.
His comments were preceded by seven days of testimony from ethicists, doctors, researchers, people who have received abortions, an animal biologist and a neonatologist as each side of the case denounced or defended state abortion restrictions.
The rules date to 1997, when Kansas legislators passed the Women’s Right to Know Act with the stated motivation of fully informing women of the risks of abortion by mandating providers comply with a list of requirements, including a 24-hour waiting period to complete consent forms, specific typefaces and page colors for paperwork, large display signs in private offices with state-approved language, informing patients a fetus at 20 weeks can feel pain, which is disputed, and a 30-minute wait between first meeting with a physician and undergoing an abortion.
Providers and advocates argue that the law stigmatizes abortions and interferes with their ability to provide them. The case also includes more recent laws, House Bill 2749 from 2024 and House Bill 2264 from 2023, that never went into effect because a judge blocked them as part of the pending lawsuit. Sometimes called the reasons mandate, the 2024 law required providers to give patients the opportunity to select from a list of reasons for obtaining their abortion and report that data to the state. The 2023 law required doctors to tell patients their abortions were reversible, which has not been conclusively proven by science.
The defendants and plaintiffs represented the most prominent sides of a long-running national dispute, a confrontation brought into focus by the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion. Abortion in Kansas is allowed up to 22 weeks of gestation, and Kansas has some of the most permissive abortion policies among red states, in large part, due to the August 2022 statewide vote that affirmed abortion as a state constitutional right.
Farr Curlin, a professor at Duke University and a medical ethicist, testified on Oct. 16 for the state.
“Physicians are, like the public, divided about abortion,” Curlin said.
What has made abortion so controversial is the “arbitrary hostility toward one class of human beings,” he said, referring to fetuses. He argued the state’s laws advance an ethical interest in preserving the rights and life of a fetus while increasing oversight of abortion providers. He does not support abortion in most instances.
Farr said that the scientific community doesn’t agree on when human life begins
The state presented witnesses who supported its language classifying fetuses as “living, separate, whole and unique human beings” based on their clinical practices, research or other studies. Abortion providers and experts for the plaintiffs rebutted that language.
Experts and doctors also disputed claims regarding fetal pain and abortion pill reversal.
Steven Ralston, an OB-GYN and the director for maternal fetal medicine at George Washington University, testified that a difference exists between pain and reflex.
“Pain is an emotional response to some kind of unpleasant sensation,” he said.
He and other witnesses fielded questions about nociception, the body’s physiological response to stimuli that could cause tissue damage. Pain is the resulting subjective experience. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says science conclusively establishes that fetuses cannot experience pain until after 24-25 weeks. Nociception develops earlier, beginning at around 7 weeks. The state’s attorneys and witnesses used nociception as proof of fetal pain before 25 weeks. But the scientific community is not in agreement.
“It’s not an emotional response to what’s happening,” Ralston said. “It’s a reflexive response to what’s happening.”
Research into “abortion pill reversal,” which involves ingesting progesterone after taking mifepristone in an attempt to continue the pregnancy, is underdeveloped. In small studies, taking mifepristone alone, without the follow-up of misoprostol, the second step in a medication abortion, can prove dangerous.
Selina Sandoval, an OB-GYN for Planned Parenthood in Kansas, said in an Oct. 16 interview following brief testimony that the state mandating abortion providers to inform patients about abortion pill reversal requires doctors “to give misinformation” to patients. It’s not something she said she feels comfortable telling patients is an option, she said.
Being a part of the case was important to Sandoval. She said she has noticed how care has improved since the state’s restrictions were enjoined.
“I’ve personally seen the harms that the Women’s Right to Know Act has caused my patients,” she said.
A patient once told her she took buses for 19 hours to get to a Kansas clinic from Texas, she said. Affordability, work, child care and travel considerations all factor into the decision to get an abortion, Sandoval said. She called the state’s restrictions discriminatory.
“No other area of health care is under this amount of scrutiny,” Sandoval said.
 
An enormous case
Brittany Jones, the president of conservative Christian group Kansas Family Voice, sat in on much of the trial. She said in an interview it was one of the most unusual trials she has seen.
Jones took issue with the way the judge defined facets of evidence or objections in the case. The witness proceedings involved numerous objections from both sides that evoked differing reactions from the judge.
“From that standpoint, I mean, the judge appeared — I’m not going to assume anything — but he appeared very biased,” she said. “And appeared to be making rulings that were very biased and not based on the law. They were based on his opinions about abortion as a whole.”
The case at hand is a big one, Jones said.
“It started out as a big case when it included our entire informed consent law going back to 1997, that’s never been challenged, that has helped so many women in Kansas,” she said.
As the judge added more laws to the case, it grew in size and magnitude.
“We really don’t have a great idea of what strict scrutiny looks like in Kansas, how it’s applied in these cases, and so it has huge implications for how the Legislature can go about protecting women and life in the state,” Jones said.
She said Kansas has always been a leader, often at the center of the national conversation on abortion. It is one of the first states to try to figure out how to operate in the post-Dobbs era, she said.
Lynette Ranney ran the front desk from 2018 to 2023 at the private Overland Park clinic that is a plaintiff in the suit. That was before and after Dobbs, but before Kansas’ restrictions were blocked. She was in charge of ensuring patients had filled out the correct paperwork and that they met all the state requirements. She described in court the anger, frustration and eye rolls from patients toward the state’s long list of requirements.
If patients brought in the required forms in the wrong color or the wrong forms altogether, the 24-hour waiting period would begin again.
“We would have to turn the patient away,” Ranney said. “We would print off new ones, give them their 24-hour timeframe, and try to reschedule them.”
One patient broke a door at the clinic after being turned away for blurry paperwork, Ranney testified
These issues arose at least 10 times a week, she estimated. She said she spent at least seven hours each workday on paperwork. In Ranney’s current role at a skin cancer center, she said, she spends about five minutes on similar tasks.
Once the paperwork and the 24-hour wait were completed, patients then waited an additional 30 minutes from the time they first saw their provider before they could proceed with an abortion. The clinic would set kitchen timers, Ranney said.
Ranney described to the court a patient who traveled to Kansas from Texas. She was seeking an abortion after being subject to sexual assault. When she showed up for the appointment, she brought the wrong consent forms, Ranney said. By the time the clinic could reschedule her appointment, she was too far along in her pregnancy to be seen, she said.
“It was devastating,” Ranney said. “It was so hard to be the person that says, ‘Hey, I know you’ve got a lot going on, but, sorry, we can’t help you.’”
 
National interest
A handful of national groups are involved in the case. On the plaintiff’s side, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Center for Reproductive Rights argued on behalf of Traci Lynn Nauser, a Kansas OB-GYN, her clinic, and Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains. On the state’s side, the conservative Christian advocacy firm Alliance Defending Freedom and Colorado-based firm First and Fourteenth.
Allison Pope, an attorney for the alliance and a native Kansan, said in a September press release that the state’s restrictions help women be fully informed about their pregnancies before choosing to get an abortion.
“Informed consent laws make this possible and reflect the longstanding will of the people of Kansas, but Planned Parenthood has made it clear that its goal is to withhold critical information from women,” she said.
Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach, who is a defendant in the case, said in the alliance’s press release that the state restrictions provide the “best possible care” for Kansas women and children.
“Planned Parenthood has always cared more about its bottom line than women’s health and is actively working to hide important health information from women that could be a matter of life or death,” he said. “We are urging the court to uphold this commonsense protection that prioritizes the lives of women and their children in Kansas.”
Planned Parenthood and other medical organizations across the country have long recognized abortion as reproductive health care.

In a town hall on LGBTQ+ issues hosted by the “Capital Caucus,” a group of state legislators who represent the area around Lansing, legislators seemed focused on their future legislative priorities — priorities that many acknowledged might only be passed if Democrats regain a trifecta. The town hall was hosted Wednesday night at the Central United Methodist Church in downtown Lansing. 
“We try to do what we can and show up where we can. And that may not mean passing a lot of legislation right now, but we sure as hell will be building the case for it,” Rep. Emily Dievendorf (D-Lansing) said. “So as soon as we have the gavel back, we can just start to touch that domino and knock things over, because we need to hold on to the progress that we’ve made.”
Rep. Julie Brixie (D-Okemos) acknowledged the power of still having a Democratic governor, attorney general and state Senate, especially in responding to federal attacks on access to gender-affirming care. 
However, in terms of passing legislation, she expressed similar sentiments to Dievendorf, saying, “I like to view it as a brief holding period for this two year period that we’re in until we can again march forward and move forward in the next cycle when we get our Democratic majority back.”

Others did highlight more recent legislative victories, including the removal of anti-LGBTQ+ language from the Fiscal Year 2026 budget, as Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing) emphasized. 
“Some bills are attacking the LGBT community, the trans community, and a lot of the bills, again, they are unenforceable, but they still are an attack on this community, and we can’t let that stand,” Rep. Penelope Tsernoglou (D-East Lansing) continued. 
But while many questions — submitted in advance by attendees and presented by Michigan State doctoral student Sterling Bentley — centered on responding to the Trump administration’s policies rolling back access to gender-affirming care and misinformation about the LGBTQ+ community, many panelists emphasized the need for community engagement and care in response to that. 
“One of the ways that we can combat misinformation that is out there about those of us who identify as queer and trans people is that we have to do the work around supporting our young people,” Jarred Daniels, an implementation specialist at the Michigan Organization on Adolescent Sexual Health, said.
“I think by raising awareness around these issues, and making sure that our young people have access to sexual health education is going to do so much in the impact of combating misinformation,” Daniels continued. 
And Lilianna Angel Reyes, the Health Equity and Outreach Director at the Ruth Ellis Center in the Detroit area, emphasized that folks with access to education — both formal and informal education — should work to support those without it.

“Cohesion and access to other people and resources increase education access,” she said. 
Later going on to recount her own story as a transgender woman who began transitioning in the early 2000s, Reyes added, “We came from a place that was very, very, very dark, and so I don’t think that we should even fathom that we could go back.”
“I think we will do better when we have more voices that reflect our community, and we’ve definitely had that since Rep. Dievendorf came to the legislature,” added Rep. Kara Hope (D-Holt).
But Amber Moe-Olds, director of movement building at Equality Michigan, shared a somber reminder of what is at stake, calling transgender people the “canary in the coal mine right now for civil rights.”
“The administration is testing how far they can go and what they can get away with using the transgender community right now. And so if we sit silent and we let this happen, we are complicit in losing every other right along the way,” she said.
A point of disagreement came between Dievendorf and Brixie near the end of the panel, in response to labor organizer Bridget McConaughy’s question on how to respond, or not respond, to GOP attacks on trans people. 
Brixie told those in the room not to “take the bait” of having to respond to each attack, attacks that have no legislative potential to pass. 
“It’s easier to take a strategic move of saying we as a caucus are not going to give oxygen to the Republicans’ twentieth hate filled resolution that they pass,” she said. “If we recognize that what they’re doing is just pushing our buttons, and if we don’t react, then it’s not going to be on the news.”
Groups, including the Salus Center, Rooted Counseling and DeWitt Pride all presented information to attendees at the Capitol Caucus LGBTQ+ Town Hall. Oct. 22. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance.
Dievendorf, however, pushed back strongly against this. As the only non-binary member of the legislature, they said, “even when the attacks on us are not in the news, they don’t go away for us.”
“As long as that bill is being introduced, we may not be talking about it, but other folks are,” they continued, referencing the threats that their own office has faced. “That is our opportunity to get in front of the misinformation, correct the lies, and also build community among ourselves, because the attacks were disregarded.”
As the panel came to an end, Daniels added in response to fears about conversion therapy bans being overturned, “Community will be the thing that saves us, no matter when the law is too slow, when justice cannot be found, we will have us. We will save us.”

(Photo via Getty Images)The University of Northern Iowa will use a multimillion-dollar grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to lead efforts to strengthen math, science and technology education in rural elementary schools throughout the Midwest.
NSF has awarded UNI a five-year, $4.9 million grant for a new initiative titled “National STEM Teacher Corps Pilot Program: Midwest Alliance for Rural Elementary Science,” according to a news release.
UNI associate professor Dana Atwood-Blaine will lead researchers from Iowa State University, University of Kansas and University of Minnesota as principal investigator in identifying and providing aid to “outstanding STEM educators working in high-need classrooms.”
“Through this program, we have the opportunity to celebrate and strengthen the work of rural STEM teachers who are making a lasting impact on their students and communities,” Atwood-Blaine said in the release.

The Midwest Alliance universities will select 18 educators “committed to advancing STEM learning” for the initiative, the release stated, who will receive an annual $12,000 stipend for four years as well as opportunities for mentorship and professional development.
Created by NSF after the passage of the CHIPS Act of 2022, the National STEM Teacher Corps Pilot Program aims to promote STEM education, lift up and support educators in this area and develop career pathways current and future STEM educators will find rewarding.
According to the release, goals of the program beyond supporting individual teachers include creating a “lasting network” of educators and researchers “to strengthen rural elementary science teaching,” using hands-on activities and real-world cases to improve student learning and researching “what works best in training teachers and teaching science in rural schools.”
“The Midwest STEM Alliance will help ensure these teachers receive the recognition, resources and growth opportunities they deserve,” Atwood-Blaine said in the release. “By elevating science instruction that integrates both literacy and math, we’ll help students thrive across subjects and build a lasting foundation for rural science education across the Midwest.”

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)If I was in charge of the state budget and had just watched $825 million unexpectedly disappear, I suppose I’d try to bluff my way out of this mess, too.
Which is what the Reynolds administration looked like it was doing last week, when the state’s Revenue Estimating Conference said the 2025 fiscal year ended with $300 million less than they’d expected a year ago.
For the current fiscal year, 2026, they’re now anticipating a whopping $525 million less than predicted last October.
I touched on this trend in last week’s post about Iowa’s long-suffering economy, but after I published, the news from the REC got so much worse.
No wonder the ruling party was putting on a brave face and trying to convince Iowans this was all part of the plan. But they’re not very good poker players. Their tells were all over the place.
Take Kraig Paulsen, chairman of the REC who runs the Reynolds administration’s department of management. Federal tax changes will reduce state revenues and, Paulsen conceded, the economy isn’t going as well as they’d like. “Obviously, we are not in a period of (the) state’s most robust growth, but we do continue to see growth,” he said.
Call that a concession, albeit with a big dollop of spin.
In the first quarter of 2025, our GDP didn’t grow. It shrunk. We rebounded somewhat in the second quarter, but the longer-term trend is awful. Last year, the size of Iowa’s economy, when compared with the rest of the states, fell to its lowest ranking in 27 years.
Robust? That word doesn’t belong in the same sentence as the words “Iowa economy.”
Maybe not even in the same paragraph.
Gov. Kim Reynolds claimed revenues were down “just as we projected.” But the steep level of decline the REC now predicts is not what her administration projected, according to documents a Senate Democrat obtained via an open records request earlier this year.
Rep. Gary Mohr, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, tried to shift attention to Joe Biden.
This is a standard play for the GOP when all else fails. But it wasn’t Biden who told Iowa’s ruling party to pass a flat income tax that gave $67,000 to the average millionaire and $600 to the average Iowa family. It wasn’t Biden who told congressional Republicans to pass a budget and tax plan this year that will give the average millionaire $80,000 and then tried to cover it by slashing $1 trillion from Medicaid. And it wasn’t Biden who told them to support a tax on foreign imports that is driving up consumer prices.
That’s on the GOP.

To be clear, watching this much money disappear from the state budget is not what Iowa’s ruling party was expecting when, in the spring of 2024, they accelerated the state’s flat tax to take full effect this year.
Anne Discher, executive director of Common Good Iowa, probably had the most salient reaction to the REC’s new estimates when she said, “If all were proceeding according to plan, one would think they would be meeting their projections, not falling short again and again.”
Exactly.
This is not part of the plan. Instead of facing a $900 million deficit for 2026, which lawmakers expected at the end of the last legislative session, the state now faces a projected $1.3 billion deficit.
That’s 16% of projected general fund revenues. That’s huge.
To put that into perspective, Illinois — whose state budget is roughly six times larger than Iowa’s—has a projected shortfall this year that’s only a fraction of ours, $267 million.
Meanwhile, Illinois’ economy is growing faster than Iowa’s.
It’s true that Iowa has more than $6 billion in reserves, which is a good backup to have. Federal COVID funds, a nationwide economic boost coming out of the pandemic and withholding state spending on healthcare and public education have built up this surplus. Still, Republicans clearly are having to lean on those reserves a lot more than they expected.
Thus, the attempt to bluff you into believing this is all part of the plan.
It’s not. Nowhere in the news stories in 2024 about the Republicans’ mad dash to a flat tax did I read about a projected $1.3 billion deficit.
There’s a reason I didn’t read about it: They weren’t expecting it.
The GOP’s alternate play is to say this is money Iowans no longer have to pay in taxes. And that part is true. But the rich have gobbled up a lot more of that money than you have. That $6 billion budget surplus they’re draining is going to pay for a flat tax that’s stuffing more than $110 into the average millionaire’s pocket for every $1 that you’re getting.
Meanwhile, the GOP has been quietly raising more money each year from sales and excise taxes, which take a bigger percentage out of your income than they do a millionaire’s.
That, my friends, has definitely been part of the plan.
(Source: Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy)
The numbers crunchers at the REC now say general fund revenues should rise in 2027 over this year’s projection. But as Discher said, this estimate should be taken with “great caution.” (And even if it turns out to be accurate, it will still be several hundred million dollars less than what the Reynolds administration had anticipated.)
The truth is Iowa’s ruling party is treating the state’s budget like a casino. They bet the farm a top-heavy income tax cut would awaken Iowa’s sleepy economy, and they’re losing. But instead of walking away from the table, they’re letting it ride, betting they’ll hit the jackpot the next hand. Or maybe the one after that. If they don’t? Well, they’ll just keep trying to bluff their way through this mess.
That’s not good for Iowa’s future. It’s time we called their bluff.

That’s according to the state’s Department of Health and Human Services in a news release Thursday.
Federal officials also indicated that the shutdown meant a limited availability in funds for the nearly 42 million people across the nation who rely on SNAP. The pause in Michigan SNAP benefits through the month of November was to be in place until further notice, the USDA told the state agency.
The move could place some Michiganders at risk of food insecurity and poverty, the state said.
Nearly 13% of Michigan households, nearly 1.4 million people, receive SNAP benefits, 43% are families with children and 36% are families with members who are older adults or disabled. The state health and human services agency also noted that more than 490,000 children benefit from SNAP resources.
“The impact of households losing SNAP benefits will be felt around the state,” said MDHHS Director Elizabeth Hertel in a statement. “SNAP is more than a food assistance program; it’s a lifeline for many Michigan families. It helps families put nutritious food on the table, supports local farmers and grocers, and strengthens our communities and economy. We are strongly disappointed by the USDA’s decision to delay this assistance, and in Michigan we will do what we can to help blunt this impact.”
SNAP participants were directed to reach out to their local state health department branch with questions regarding benefits or to check the MI Bridges platform for updates.

(Photo by Kate Brindley/New Hampshire Bulletin)The New Hampshire Senate upheld Gov. Kelly Ayotte’s veto of a bill that would have expanded the prohibition on electioneering by public employees Thursday.
In vetoing Senate Bill 213, Ayotte said she would be interested in working on strengthening the anti-electioneering law, but pointed to an unrelated section in the bill focused on absentee voting that clashes with a different bill signed into law this year. The Senate unanimously voted to sustain the veto.
SB 213 would have built upon the current ban on electioneering by laying out specific activities that public employees cannot do, as well as those that they can. Current law defines electioneering as a public employee acting “in any way specifically designed to influence the vote of a voter on any question or office” while in the performance of their official duties, but it does not specify those activities. 
The bill states that the prohibition on electioneering includes a public employee distributing or displaying campaign materials, making public statements for or against a candidate, organizing surveys, forums, or events that are political, and using their authority to influence or interfere with a voter’s decision.
But it states that public employees’ participation in parades, fairs, festivals, and other events would not count as electioneering as long as it didn’t favor a candidate. It also clarifies that conducting neutral voter registration drives and election awareness efforts, providing factual information about who is running for office, and informing the public about official functions are activities that do not count as electioneering.
Currently, the anti-electioneering statute applies to anyone employed by a public employer, except those elected by a popular vote, those with duties that “imply a confidential relationship to the public employer,” and those in a probationary or temporary status. Violation of the public electioneering statute could result in a misdemeanor. SB 213 would not have changed that definition or penalty. 
Meanwhile, a separate portion of the bill would have required residents to provide proof of identity, citizenship, age, and domicile when applying for an absentee ballot. Those requirements were already included in Senate Bill 218, which Ayotte signed in August. 
“I am vetoing this legislation as it conflicts with other bills I have recently signed into law regarding absentee ballots,” Ayotte wrote in her veto message Aug. 1. “Additionally, I intend to work with the bill sponsors on the issue of electioneering to ensure that public employees can engage in public discourse without misusing their official positions for political purposes.”
Speaking on the Senate floor Thursday, some Senate Democrats said they opposed the anti-electioneering components in SB 213 as well. Portsmouth Sen. Rebecca Perkins Kwoka, the Senate minority leader, argued the clarifications were unnecessary, and she argued the listed examples of what is and isn’t allowed could create vagueness issues that could violate employees’ 14th Amendment rights.
“In my opinion, this bill was a solution looking for a problem,” she said. “In effect, what our existing law does is sufficient and effective. Our public employees act always with integrity and the highest ethics.”
SB 213 is the only Senate bill vetoed by Ayotte this year; she also vetoed 11 House bills, which the House will take up in its veto session on Dec. 17. 
Under the state constitution, all vetoed bills return first to the legislative chamber in which they originated, and if that chamber votes by a two-thirds majority to overturn the veto, the other chamber also takes it up for a vote.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/primaryday2024.png,,,2025-10-23 11:22:05.950589

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star) After a week on the defensive explaining controversies unearthed from his past, Graham Platner, the oyster farmer challenging Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins for her seat in 2026, still drew a crowd to his town hall in Ogunquit Wednesday night.
The first public polling on the race also backs up the apparent continued support for the political novice. 
Platner has more than twice the support of Gov. Janet Mills, the Democratic establishment’s pick, among Democratic primary voters, according to the poll released Thursday by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, which surveyed respondents between Oct. 16 and 21, amid the week of revelations about his past.  
Mills announced her candidacy on Oct. 14, after months of speculation that she would. Days later, the first reports of Platner’s controversial past comments broke, revealing a potential vulnerability as he goes up against seasoned campaigners with national backing. 
Unearthed Reddit comments present first stumble in Platner’s rise

Some of those comments included asking why Black people “don’t tip,” suggesting people wouldn’t get raped if they weren’t inebriated around people they didn’t feel comfortable with, calling rural Americans “racist” and “stupid,” and saying that violence may be necessary to counter facism. Platner apologized in a video posted online, saying he didn’t agree with the comments he made during a time in his life when he was struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression after serving in the military.
Of the 510 likely Democratic primary voters captured in the survey, 58% said they would vote for Platner, 24% for Mills, less than 2% for any other candidate and 14% were undecided. 
Overall, the survey captured 1,100 Maine residents and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3%. Majorities of self-described socialists, progressives and moderates backed Platner, while a plurality of liberals supported Mills. Platner also showed a wide lead among those ages 18-49, and for those 65 years old and older, Platner and Mills were effectively tied, according to the poll. 
However after that survey period ended, more controversial online statements and reports of his now-covered Nazi-linked tattoo surfaced this week. Platner said he got a tattoo of what he thought was a skull and crossbones while drunk overseas in 2007 with other young Marines. In a social media post on Wednesday, he said he got the tattoo covered on Tuesday, saying he was unaware that it was recognized as a Nazi symbol.
Speaking to the crowd of about 500 in Ogunquit Wednesday night, Platner again acknowledged the tattoo and said, “I do not want something on my body that represents, in any way, the antithesis of my politics.”
Platner also said the revelations about his tattoo and other reports about his past show that “the establishment is spooked.” 
“They’re not trying to get out there and talk about issues,” he said. “They’re trying to figure out if I said something stupid on the internet 13 years ago. If they thought this was going to scare me off … they clearly have not spent a lot of time around Marines.”

McCarron joins a Republican field that includes Secretary of State Wes Allen; Patrick Bishop, a deputy with the Cullman County Sheriff’s Department; Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries Rick Pate; former gubernatorial candidate Dean Odle and businesswoman Nicole Wadsworth. Current Lt. Gov. Will Ainsworth is term-limited.
As of Thursday, Allen had over $612,000 on hand for the campaign; Pate had nearly $491,000 and Wadsworth had almost $175,000.
The lieutenant governor presides over the Alabama Senate. The office used to have power comparable to the Speaker of the Alabama House, with the lieutenant governor assigning senators to committees and controlling the flow of legislation. But after a weeks-long standoff in 1999 between then-Lt. Gov. Steve Windom, a Republican, and the Democratic-controlled Senate, the powers of the lieutenant governor were transferred to the Senate President Pro Tem.
The lieutenant governor retains some appointment powers and is second-in-line to the governor’s office.
McCarron played for the University of Alabama from 2009 to 2013. He won two national championships during his time with the Crimson Tide. In the 2013 Iron Bowl, he threw a 99-yard pass to receiver Amari Cooper. Auburn won the game on Chris Davis’ “Kick Six” return.

Dray Bourgeois is a multiply disabled, first-generation college graduate from southern Vermont. Raised in a low-income household, he was awarded a Curtis Fund scholarship—support that allowed him to pursue college when the odds were stacked against him, at a time when higher education is increasingly out of reach. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Breaking[...]","Dray Bourgeois is a multiply disabled, first-generation college graduate who clawed his way past everything stacked against him—poverty, disability, doubt, and institutions that were never built for someone like him to succeed. He didn’t just graduate. He broke a cycle.
Across the country, college is costing more every year, while financial aid is getting harder to secure, and federal support increasingly politicized. These shifts hit first-generation, low-income students the hardest.
Before college, Dray’s family of five lived in Bennington and was barely getting by. Then his mother became blind and had to stop working. “We were low-income before,” he says, “but after my mom had to retire, we were really struggling. Two kids going to college at the same time? It just wouldn’t have happened without financial support.”
Dray and his brother are both recipients of a Curtis Fund scholarship. And in a household with no college tradition and limited income, that support helped them reach college and reshaped what their family believed was possible.
“There were so many sacrifices we made just to get by,” he says. He pushed for every bit of merit aid, juggled work and school, and refused to give up on himself, even when the odds were set against him.
“So many of my peers had never known true financial struggle. I felt like I didn’t belong. Like they thought less of me.”  It reminded him just how deeply people underestimate students from backgrounds like his—and how much he had to overcome to prove they were wrong.  
Yet he made it through. Dray earned his degree from Hampshire College and graduated without taking on debt thanks to his scholarship. Now, he’s building a life that once felt out of reach—he’s not living paycheck to paycheck anymore. He’s not putting his physical health at risk just to make rent. “I actually have savings now. I’m planning a wedding and putting money aside for a house, which never even felt possible before. That kind of future used to feel so out of reach.”
And now he’s using that momentum to help others do the same. At VSAC (Vermont Student Assistance Corporation), where he landed his first full-time job right out of college, he guides students through college applications and shows them what’s possible. He’s teaching them that people like them deserve to be in the rooms where futures are decided, because they’ve lived what’s at stake.
Dray was nominated for The Curtis Fund scholarship by his own VSAC counselor, who saw his potential before anyone else did. “She told me I was going to college. She wasn’t going to let me not go,” he remembers. When she called to tell him he’d received the award from The Curtis Fund, it was the first time it felt real. “It was a relief, but also this wave of possibility. Like maybe I could actually do this.”
Now Dray’s planning to pursue a master’s degree, potentially in special education, a field that overlaps with his current outreach work. And the ripple effect is clear: his parents, who never had the chance to attend college themselves, have been empowered by what Dray and his brother learned. “It’s even helped them make better financial decisions,” he says.
The Curtis Fund connects Vermonters with the access, support, and belief they need to pursue education, change what’s possible, and build a stronger future—for themselves, their families, and our state.
Community-based solutions are more vital now than ever. With federal aid being gutted, student debt climbing, and political attacks on public education accelerating, Dray is clear: “This is bigger than me. Some people will always have a way in. But for students like me, this kind of support is the only way forward.”
“It’s community-driven support like this that actually makes a difference,” he says. “Not with noise or performative policy, but by meeting people where they are and helping them move forward — for real.”

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)A new coalition of food security advocates and organizations sent a letter to U.S. Sen. Susan Collins Wednesday evening asking her to fully fund the nation’s largest food benefit program in November. 
The letter, which was signed by six different organizations, comes after an announcement earlier in the week that those who rely on Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP,  won’t receive their benefits in November due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. 
“As Maine’s Senior Senator and Chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, we call on you to support the immediate release of SNAP’s contingency funds to pay for partial SNAP benefits amid the ongoing government shutdown,” the letter says. 
More than one in 10 Mainers throughout the state rely on these benefits, but the need is markedly higher in Androscoggin, Aroostook, Piscataquis, Somerset and Washington counties. In total, just shy of 170,000 Mainers receive SNAP benefits. They are among the more than 42 million Americans across the country who rely on the program. 
If the funds aren’t released, SNAP recipients won’t receive vital food assistance, the letter argued, and farmers and grocers will be without revenue. On average, a family of four in Maine who receives SNAP benefits gets $572 per month.
“During a season when many people celebrate with food, Maine’s poorest households will be wondering where their next meal is coming from and looking to local food pantries and non-profits who cannot fill the enormous gaps left by federal funding,” the letter reads.
The letter is signed by Preble Street, Maine Children’s Alliance, Full Plates Full Potential, Maine Federation of Farmers’ Markets, Maine Equal Justice and the Maine Center for Economic Policy. 
Collins’ office did not respond to a request for comment by publication.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which operates SNAP, has about $6 billion in a multi-year contingency fund. That’s short of the roughly $9 billion needed to cover a full month of the program.
Nearly 170,000 Mainers won’t receive SNAP benefits in November due to government shutdown

Even if a shutdown deal were reached immediately, the time needed to process the payments and make them available for recipients means benefits would likely be delayed.
The shortfall is caused by the shutdown, which hit its 22nd day Wednesday. The fund is supposed to maintain a balance of about $9 billion, but $3 billion of the funds expired at the end of the fiscal year Sept. 30. Because Congress has not approved the next year’s funding, the fund only has $6 billion.
USDA would have to come up with the remaining $3 billion. The department could try something similar to its shuffle of more than $300 million in tariff revenue into its Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC, through the rest of the month. 
It’s unclear if USDA plans to use the SNAP contingency fund or any other maneuvers to extend benefits.
Nearly 40% of the 42 million SNAP recipients nationwide are children 17 and younger, according to the USDA. About 20% are seniors aged 60 and older and the remaining 40% are adults aged 18 to 59.
USDA did not respond to multiple requests for comment from States Newsroom.
Parties in Congress remained nowhere near a deal to end the shutdown as of Wednesday.

Laura Kelly takes part in a news conference Oct. 22, 2025, to announce funding of nine transportation infrastructure projects requiring investment of $442 million through 2030. (Submitted)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly added nine highway expansion and modernization projects valued at $442 million to Kansas’ transportation pipeline.
The announcement in Lindsborg on Wednesday represented the fourth round of projects in the state’s 10-year Eisenhower Legacy Transportation Program adopted by the Kansas Legislature and signed into law by Kelly. The location was chosen because the roster of projects included reconstruction of Kansas 4 and Bethany Drive to create a more functional entrance to the city from I-135.
The $11 million project, with a contract scheduled to be awarded in 2029, would remove an aging bridge to eliminate the need for maintenance at the location.
Kelly said the IKE program had proven to be a powerful engine for economic growth and represented a commitment to build a stronger, safer Kansas.
“Since the program’s inception, we have worked diligently to advance important infrastructure modernization and expansion projects to the construction stage, ensuring a safe, prosperous future for Kansans in rural, suburban and urban communities across the state,” she said.
The most expensive project in this round would be replacement in 2028 of Centennial Bridge with a $157 million, four-lane structure in Leavenworth County. In 2029, the state also plans to proceed with $120 million in interchange improvements on Kansas 96 at Rock Road and Woodlawn Road in Sedgwick County.
The Kansas Department of Transportation committed to a $43 million project in 2030 for construction of an interchange at Kansas 10 and Lone Elm Road in Johnson County.
In 2029, KDOT said it would allocate $35 million to create passing lanes on U.S. 169 in Anderson and Allen counties. The agency said southwest Kansas would benefit from $33 million in passing lanes on U.S. 83 in Finney and Scott counties.
Other projects included $17 million to rebuild U.S. 281 in Russell and Osborne counties in 2028. In addition, $15 million would be invested in reconstructing Kansas 33 in Douglas County and $11 million to upgrade K-33 in Franklin County during 2030.
KDOT Secretary Calvin Reed said improvements in transportation infrastructure depended on development of local project partnerships.
“Communities across the state recognize the benefits that a well-planned and funded transportation system brings,” Reed said. “When we listen to and collaborate with Kansans directly, we can have confidence that these investments will deliver meaningful and long-lasting benefits for all.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Laura-Kelly-on-KDOT-funding-1024x681.png,,,2025-10-23 10:24:01.580390

(Jeremy Stevens for Louisiana Illuminator)A Louisiana tribal casino is under the scrutiny of at least two federal agencies, according to documents the Illuminator has obtained and a former casino purchasing manager who says authorities have interviewed her twice about the matter.
The probe involves Jonathan Cernek, former chairman of the Coushatta Tribe, who federal regulators allege used a casino business credit card to build and furnish his personal home. A former tribal official said the controversy has raised questions about fairness and accountability over how leaders spend casino proceeds intended to benefit all its members.  
The National Indian Gaming Commission ordered the Coushatta Tribal Gaming Commission last month to suspend the license of Todd Stewart, the casino’s former general manager and chief financial officer, because of an alleged failure to report suspected misuse of gaming revenues during Cernek’s tenure. The federal commission has ordered the tribe to hold a revocation hearing for Stewart. 
Claims of Cernek’s credit card misuse are outlined in an eight-page statement Stewart provided to the Coushatta Tribal Council last year. The Illuminator has obtained a copy of the letter. Although he initially did not respond to questions from a reporter, Stewart confirmed via email Tuesday that he wrote the statement.
Dated Aug. 14, 2024, Stewart’s statement details events dating back to November 2023. They include Stewart’s discovery of invoices for deliveries to the home of Cernek and his wife, Mandy, citing “bathroom fixtures” as an example. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Stewart wrote that he reported the purchases to other members of the tribe’s leadership council and eventually confronted Cernek about the credit card spending. In response, Stewart alleged in his statement that the former chairman threatened his job.
Stewart also wrote that he spoke with former casino purchasing manager Paula Corliss about Cernek’s credit card use. She explained the account was for community goodwill purchases, such as air conditioning units for tribal elders and gift baskets for graduating tribal members, according to Stewart.
In his statement, Stewart said Corliss confirmed “there were at least a few instances where Mandy Cernek placed orders [using the credit card] with product delivered to the Cernek residence.”
In a recent interview with the Illuminator, Corliss confirmed these details, adding that she believed “nothing was hidden” about the Cerneks’ use of the casino credit card.
“It was there for him [Stewart] to see, for the council to see, everybody in finance,” Corliss said. “It was there. You could see it. No one addressed it with the chairman. No one, and Todd said he would handle it.”
Jonathan and Mandy Cernek did not respond to phone or text messages requesting an interview, nor did the Cerneks respond to a list of questions the Illuminator hand-delivered to their home in Calcasieu Parish.
Stewart initially did not respond to phone or email messages. After a reporter hand-delivered a letter with a list of specific questions to Stewart’s residence in Henderson, Nevada, on Sept. 27, he sent a brief email statement.
“Throughout my tenure with the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana, I have discharged the duties of my position with professional integrity and have worked with the stakeholders for the betterment of the Coushatta Casino Resort. That has defined my tenure,” Stewart wrote.
Corliss told the Illuminator the FBI questioned her in person in late May 2024 about Coushatta Casino’s finances. She also said she spoke with someone from the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs over the phone in late October 2024.
The tribe’s current chairman, David Sickey, and tribal council members Crystal Williams and Kristian Poncho did not respond to phone and text message requests for interviews for this report. The tribe’s public relations representative, Mary Patricia Wray, did not respond to an emailed list of questions.
In response to a list of questions about the Coushatta Tribe, the FBI said it is limiting its responses to the news media during the federal government shutdown. Typically, as a matter of policy, the FBI neither confirms nor denies the status of its investigations.
The Bureau of Indian Affairs did not respond to questions about its involvement with the Coushatta Tribe. Its website indicates the agency’s services are impacted in the ongoing shutdown.
The National Indian Gaming Commission has previously said it does “not comment on ongoing investigations, or potential investigations.”
Tribe awaits explanation
Jonas John, the Coushatta Tribe’s former heritage and cultural department director, said he clashed with the former chairman over financial matters before Cernek forced him from his role. It happened two years ago after John said he spoke out about a dormant tribal museum project. He said he was given a termination notice and told he could either resign or be fired. 
“This was direct from [former] Chairman Cernek and his administrator, Chris Langley,” John told the Illuminator.
John said he asked for a reason for his termination, and human resources told him they wanted a change and no longer needed his services.
“I was shocked due to the fact I have given so much to our tribe in revitalization of tribal culture, which people still benefit [from] today …” John said. “Sometimes, if you start questioning our department’s grant money and tribal issues, this is what happens.”.  
“We built the casino to help our people and the local community grow, but that takes honesty and good leadership,” John said.
Coushatta Tribe’s next generation warns against risk from carbon sequestration

John said tribal community meetings with its leadership are infrequent, and there has been no public explanation from the tribal council about the alleged credit card misuse or other financial issues.  
“Our museum has never been developed,” John said. “There’s a $13 million building back there that there is nothing accountable for, and I wanted accountability. I asked, ‘Where did these funds go? Why is our museum like a skeleton?’ You know, it’s just there.”
John said many members want to replace the bylaws that govern the Coushatta Tribe. 
“We need a constitution that will prevent people from stealing and misusing funds,” he said. “Without that, nothing changes.”
The Coushatta Tribe is a federally recognized sovereign nation with more than 900 enrolled members. Its casino is under federal and state oversight, with its operations defined in a tribal-state compact. That agreement establishes the tribe’s reporting, financial oversight and regulatory obligations the tribe must follow to maintain its gaming license. 
The National Indian Gaming Commission regulates and monitors all tribal casinos through the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. It issued the order to suspend Stewart’s license after investigating a complaint from an unspecified source about Cernek’s misusing casino revenues, according to a notice the federal agency sent to Pam Bass, chairwoman of the Coushatta Tribal Gaming Commission.
Like Louisiana’s other tribal casinos, the Coushatta have their own gaming commission that serves as the establishment’s primary state regulator. But its members must report investigations, disciplinary actions and compliance data to the Louisiana State Police.
State Police can enforce state and federal laws and investigate violations that occur in connection with the Coushatta Casino Resort, according to a compact between the state and the tribe. State Police are required to share their investigation reports with the tribe, according to the compact that applies only to the tribe’s gaming operations, not its governmental affairs.
There was no response from State Police to questions for this report before publication.
Tribes must keep six years of independent audits and must provide audit and accounting records to State Police for review or copying upon request. It was these audits that first brought to light issues with the tribe’s credit card spending. 
Last month, the Louisiana Legislative Auditor published a report from one of the independent audits that indicated the Coushatta tribe’s leadership did not keep track of credit card use, with no receipts to show for purchases totaling more than $100,000 over a two-month spending period in 2024 that was reviewed. 
Shawna Castellano, a regional director with the National Indian Gaming Commission, wrote in the Sept. 8 order calling for Stewart’s license to be pulled that the audit confirmed claims made in the complaint filed with the commission.
A comparable Coushatta Casino Resort audit from 2023 was recently published on the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s website. It found 338 transactions totaling $111,697 with no receipts over the two-month review period. 
Statement reveals discrepancies
Stewart’s written statement to the Coushatta Tribal Council provides his version of events surrounding Jonathan Cernek’s credit card use. 
In late January and early February 2024 meetings, Stewart said Corliss told him that, on one occasion, one of the casino’s purchasing credit cards was flagged by the bank for suspicious activity, and she ordered a replacement. Not long after receiving the new credit card, it was missing from her desk, Stewart wrote, adding that Corliss suspected Cernek had entered her office after hours to take it.
Corliss told Stewart the former chairman had a master key, according to Stewart’s statement. 
“Soon after I instructed Paula to cancel the purchasing credit card, she called me to advise that there was no need to cancel the credit card as The [former] Chairman had physically returned it,” Stewart wrote.
Corliss confirmed this claim with the Illuminator, stating that Cernek took the card in more than one instance, and sometimes sent her a text message afterward to say he had the card before returning it.
In his email Tuesday to the Illuminator, Stewart said an earlier report mischaracterized the situation.  
“Contrary to your previous reporting, my statement opens with a clear knowledge of those in possession of credit cards,” he wrote.
Audit shows Coushatta Tribe didn’t track credit card use

According to Stewart’s statement to the Coushatta Tribal Council, he met with Kristian Poncho, the Coushatta Tribe’s secretary-treasurer, in mid-February 2024 to discuss Cernek’s credit card spending. Stewart told Poncho “any potential ‘bleeding’ had been stopped and we were therefore dealing with historical activity that had already occurred.”
At the time, Stewart wrote, he was focused on reaching a credit agreement with Wells Fargo for a $150 million casino renovation and hotel expansion project. He was also finalizing a related contract with Yates Construction and his work on the 2023 audit, which would later raise concerns about missing receipts. 
By Feb. 21, 2024, Stewart and his team briefed the Coushatta Tribal Council on the casino’s finances. The Wells Fargo deal closed March 11, and the Yates contract followed on March 27. Expansion work began at the resort that month. 
The 2023 audit, Stewart wrote, was finalized and issued on April 25, 2024, with “no significant or material deficiencies reported.”
According to Castellano’s notice to the Coushatta Tribe last month, the National Indian Gaming Commission interviewed Stewart this past June and learned he did not “disclose suspected fraud to the external auditors during the [fiscal year] 2023 annual audit of the financial statements.” 
Stewart also didn’t discuss the matter with “the potential lender of a $150 million construction loan the Coushatta Casino was in the process of obtaining” until the loan was actually secured, Castellano wrote.
“The audited financial statements for the period ending December 31, 2023, and 2024
were issued by the external auditors with an unqualified (clean) opinion,” Stewart told the Illuminator this week.

‘A tensity in the air’
Stewart also said in his written statement to the Coushatta Tribal Council that Jonathan Cernek asked him to join him for dinner alone on April 30, 2024, at Simon’s Bar & Grill, on an out-of-the-way stretch of Highway 397 southeast of Lake Charles. 
“We met at an isolated venue …” Stewart wrote. “There was a tensity in the air when we begin to interact, and I struggled to carry the conversation for over an hour.”
Stewart wrote that their conversation remained strained until Cernek suddenly asked why Stewart had been “asking people how a chairman can be impeached.” 
Stewart explained that a tribal elder had accused the Cerneks of stealing from the tribe and that he was only trying to figure out his own job security, according to the statement.
The chairman told Stewart that he “had had his back” many times and wanted to know that he was loyal, according to Stewart’s statement.
Feds order Coushatta casino to suspend former GM for not disclosing fraud concerns

Cernek resigned without explanation as tribal chairman Aug. 9, 2024, less than a week before Stewart prepared his statement for the Coushatta Tribal Council.
“It appears that there is an attempt to hold me, the non-tribal member, accountable for the inappropriate actions of the Chairman, a Tribal member,” Stewart wrote to the Illuminator this week.
When the Illuminator reported last month on the audit findings, Wray said the tribal council had eliminated its purchasing credit cards and adopted a formal expense reporting and reimbursement policy.
The Coushatta Tribal Gaming Commission was given 45 days to hold a hearing on Stewart’s license revocation and report back to the National Indian Gaming Commission on its decision. As of mid-October, there’s been no date set for Stewart’s hearing.
On his LinkedIn page, Stewart listed this past Sept. 7 as his last day as general manager at Coushatta Casino Resort.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Coushatta-sign-cropped-1024x646.jpg,,,2025-10-23 10:24:01.580390

University of Alaska President Pat Pitney appointed Siemers as interim chancellor in May of this year. Pitney announced that after reviewing four candidates for chancellor through a hiring search, as well as community and stakeholder feedback, she decided that extending Siemers’ appointment would “provide institutional stability.”

“I appreciate the hard work of all four finalist candidates to engage with and get to know our university community, and I’m incredibly grateful to everyone who participated in the search process and shared their perspectives,” President Pitney said in a statement with the announcement. 
“Cheryl is uniquely positioned to continue advancing UAA’s priorities without pause, and I am pleased to share that she has agreed to extend her appointment. This decision ensures continuity and sustained progress as UAA continues to build on its strengths and pursue its strategic goals,” she said.
The four frontrunner candidates visited the campus in September and participated in candidate forums and engagement events. They were Diane Hirshberg, director of UAA Institute of Social and Economic Research; Aaron Dotson, UAA vice chancellor for research; Jennifer Capps, California Polytechnic University Humboldt provost and vice president of Academic Affairs; John Ballard, president of National Intelligence University.
Jonathon Taylor, UA director of communications, said by email Wednesday that all four candidates were qualified and generally received positive feedback from their campus visits. “However, the overwhelming consensus from the community and stakeholder feedback was that Interim Chancellor Siemers has been an excellent leader for UAA and that the stability maintained by keeping her in that role would be beneficial to the institution,” he said. “Given that and the lack of unified consensus in the stakeholder and community feedback behind any one of the four finalists, President Pitney opted to extend Interim Chancellor Siemers’ appointment, which she accepted.”
Siemers stepped into the interim chancellor role after former chancellor and former governor Sean Parnell announced his retirement after four years in January. She previously served as the director of UAA’s Kenai Peninsula College. She joined the college in 2002, and taught as an adjunct then full-time faculty member in the Department of English, then as assistant director before becoming director of the college. She holds a master’s in English from UAA and a Ph.D. in rhetoric and linguistics from Indiana University of Pennsylvania. 
Siemers will continue as interim chancellor of UAA, overseeing the Anchorage campus, Kenai Peninsula College, Kodiak College, Matanuska-Susitna College, and Prince William Sound College, and a budget of roughly $333 million. 
Taylor said the search for a chancellor has concluded for now, adding that “President Pitney will evaluate how she would like to proceed with the UAA Chancellor role on a longer-term basis in 2026 once the ongoing search for a permanent UAF Chancellor concludes.”

For low-income and minority communities that face barriers to voter registration, health care facilities can offer a solution: making civic engagement easier by reaching people where they are.
Registries of motor vehicles, or RMVs, are currently a main location for voter registration. The National Voter Registration Act, nicknamed the “Motor Voter Act,” requires RMVs to offer automatic voter registration, making the process seamless for new Massachusetts residents getting driver’s licenses or registering their cars. But low-income and immigrant individuals are less likely to drive and own a car, and therefore many may never visit the RMV. These communities have disproportionately low voter registration rates.
But where does nearly everyone visit? Hospitals, clinics, and community health centers. In 2023, 96 percent of Massachusetts residents reported visiting at least one health care provider in the past year. And the halls of our hospitals are filled with millions of visitors. These spaces are under-tapped resources that should offer voter registration to the vast, diverse people that they serve.
It’s also the law. Just as the National Voter Registration Act requires voter registration assistance at RMVs, it also requires it at state-run hospitals (and other offices) that offer public assistance. The reason? To ensure that those who may not visit the RMV—but may seek resources like health care through MassHealth and SNAP’s food benefits—are also afforded their right to access the ballot box. 
But Massachusetts’s public hospitals, whose social work offices offer public assistance, are currently not complying with this federal law. And because public hospitals primarily serve minority and low-income individuals who are already less likely to be registered voters, this failure makes their disproportionate disenfranchisement even worse. Boston-based legal organization Lawyers for Civil Rights is putting pressure on the Commonwealth to come into compliance. With other election reforms like same-day voter registration gaining momentum, Massachusetts should satisfy its existing legal obligations under the National Voter Registration Act as well.
Private health care facilities can also give voting support in addition to medical support. Just as quality improvement measures have been successfully integrated across health care systems, voter registration services can be seamlessly incorporated into routine patient care. And bringing voter registration into health care facilities isn’t just a smart use of existing resources, but it also has snowballing benefits. 
Health care systems have long recognized that addressing social determinants of health, including civic engagement, can dramatically improve patient outcomes. When patients have accessible pathways to register to vote while receiving care, we’re not just treating their immediate health needs, but empowering them to advocate for policies that affect their long-term well-being. This represents the kind of systematic, evidence-based approach to health care improvement that can benefit both individual patients and entire communities.
The registration deadline for this November’s election is fast approaching — on October 25. Massachusetts can register many more voters by that time — and that would especially be the case if public hospitals were to offer the required voter registration assistance and private health care facilities stepped up to join this effort. 
Let’s meet people where they already are—doctors’ offices and emergency rooms—to improve patients’ health and the health of our democracy.
