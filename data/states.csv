Docking State Office Building in Topeka. (Submitted)TOPEKA — State and local leaders gathered Thursday at the new Robert B. Docking State Office Building to celebrate completion of the three-year, $120 million project.
It took more than a decade for the state to determine what to do with the Docking building, as historical preservationists fought to keep the original 14-story facility, built in 1954. In the end, the state Legislature approved demolition and construction of a new three-story building.
“The opening of the new Docking State Office Building represents what we can accomplish when we work together to reimagine something from the past to meet the needs of today and the future,” said Gov. Laura Kelly in a news release. 
The new building reuses significant materials from the original Docking building, according to a state website that tracks construction progress. More than 50,000 square feet of limestone was reclaimed and reused, as were granite, greenstone and multiple historical features. 
“One of the goals for the new Docking Building was to create one of the most efficient, modern, and beautiful buildings in the country, and for this facility to be a ‘front door’ to the state government for visitors to the capitol,” said Kansas Department of Administration Secretary Adam Proffitt in the  release. 
Last week, Kansas Department of Administration Deputy Secretary Frank Burnam received the Innovation in State Government Award from the National Association of State Chief Administrators for his work on the project, the news release said.
“With 98% of the materials of the old building incorporated into the body of the new building, Kansas has integrated continuity and environmental efficiency into the Docking State Office Building,” said Brian Docking, grandson of Gov. Robert Docking. “Today I represent my great grandparents, my grandparents, and my father and uncle and the future of our family to say we are humbled by this honor.”
The total cost of the project was just under $140 million, with $60 million appropriated from the state general fund and the remaining balance paid through American Rescue Plan Act dollars, said Steven Wu, senior fiscal analyst at the Kansas Legislative Research Department.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Docking2-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-30 17:16:40.605569

This story by Virginia Ray was first published in The Commons on Oct. 28, 2025.
BRATTLEBORO — She started her own restaurant at the age of 20. Today, Linda Alvarez teaches young people how to become entrepreneurs and community leaders themselves. Now, she has been named 2026 Vermont Teacher of the Year, the first career and technical education educator in the state to receive this award from the Agency of Education.
“Being recognized as Vermont’s Teacher of the Year is such an honor,” said the business and entrepreneurship teacher at the Windham Regional Career Center. “It means so much to see career and technical education celebrated on a statewide level.”
This year, Alvarez said she will “travel around Vermont visiting schools, speaking about CTE and sharing the incredible work my students do at the Windham Regional Career Center.” Alvarez, who has been at WRCC for four years, is now also part of the National Teacher of the Year Program.
“I hope to inspire more students to see career education as a path to both purpose and success,” she said. “Our young people are full of ideas and energy. They just need chances to show what they can do. When we give them those opportunities, they surprise us every time.”
Beyond book learning
In Alvarez’s classroom, students experience not just the book learning of business, but the reality.
Through projects such as the year-long Food Truck Business Plan, students design, brand and launch ventures, build 3D models of trucks, create marketing campaigns and present business plans to community leaders and local bankers.
Alvarez’s classroom is intentionally inclusive.
First-generation college students, multilingual learners and neurodiverse students thrive under her guidance. Students leave her programs empowered; many go on to earn college scholarships or enter directly into high-demand careers.
“In every way, Linda is the kind of teacher our students deserve,” said Windham Regional Career Center Director Nancy Wiese. “She is a visionary who equips them not only with skills but also with confidence and purpose to shape the future.”
“Linda is an exceptional teacher who routinely inspires her students and colleagues at the WRCC,” said Windham Southeast Supervisory Union Superintendent Mark Speno. “Vermont Teacher of the Year is an acknowledgment that is well deserved.”
Alvarez said what she likes best about her work is “watching students grow into leaders.”
“When they realize they can run a business, present to community members, or earn college credits while still in high school, their whole mindset changes,” she said. “Seeing that pride and excitement never gets old.”
The most challenging part of her job, she said, is balancing the different needs of her diverse students. “Some are new Americans learning a new language, others are the first in their family to think about college, and many are figuring out who they want to be,” said Alvarez. “Finding ways to reach every student where they are takes patience, creativity and heart.”
Asked what she’s most proud of, Alvarez said, “the opportunities my students have created for themselves.”
“Many have gone on to start small businesses, study business or marketing in college, or use their skills to help their communities,” she says. “Their success is what makes this work so meaningful to me.”
Alvarez said she decided to become a business and career teacher because she “loves helping students see the real-world side of learning.”
“I want them to understand that education can be hands-on, creative, and connected to their own dreams. I’ve always believed that when students can picture themselves in a career, they become more confident and motivated to reach their goals.”
Roots and wings
Originally from Dearborn, Michigan, and Gainesville, Florida, Alvarez now lives in Brattleboro with her husband, Orlando, and their son, Sebastian. She is also stepmother to Genie, Jamie and Joseph, and grandmother to Lucas. Outside school, she has owned and operated two successful restaurants, including the Restless Rooster, which operated on Elliot Street. She also loves cooking, camping and watching Detroit sports.
The Teacher of the Year holds an MBA from Fitchburg State University in management, marketing and communications, a B.A. in history with a minor in education from the University of Florida, and is currently completing a Certificate in School Management and Leadership from Harvard Graduate School of Education at Harvard University.
When applying to Fitchburg, Alvarez had to write a speech in which she — presciently, perhaps — was to presume she had won the very award that she has, indeed, won. She titled it: “CTE Teaching Toward Belonging, Purpose, and a Future They Choose.”
In her speech, Alvarez noted that her students come from diverse towns, cultures, learning styles and life experiences. “But here’s what they all have in common: they chose to be in my classroom,” she said. “They chose CTE. And because of that choice, they show up with passion. With curiosity. With grit. And because they chose, they thrive.
“This is one of the most important things CTE can teach us: When students feel they have agency, when they see relevance and know their work matters, they rise. So the question becomes: How do we build a system that doesn’t wait until 11th grade to engage students, but instead calls to them early, welcomes them, and shows them the way forward?”
Her answer is to do what’s being done at WRCC: “work to build that system, one intentional step at a time.” Alvarez goes on to say that “learning shouldn’t end with a grade.”
“That’s why in southern Vermont we partner with the Brattleboro Development Credit Corporation to connect students with job shadows, internships, and career pathways,” she said.  “And yet I keep returning to this: We must start sooner. CTE is not a last resort. It is not a back-up plan. It is not a side door. It is a pathway that empowers students to lead with their strengths, engage with real-world learning, and build futures rooted in relevance and purpose.”
A year of speaking and accolades
As the 2026 Vermont Teacher of the Year, Alvarez will serve as an advocate for students, educators and the transformative power of Career and Technical Education.
She will also be recognized at the University of Vermont’s Outstanding Teacher Day in November, and she will represent Vermont in the spring for the National Teacher of the Year program, which includes events in Washington, D.C.
“I am thrilled to recognize Linda as Vermont’s Teacher of the Year,” says Secretary of Education Zoie Saunders. “Linda’s commitment to equity, innovation, and excellence prepares students not only for careers and college, but for meaningful lives beyond the classroom. We are honored to recognize her contributions to teaching in Vermont.”
The Agency of Education has recognized outstanding Vermont teachers through the Vermont Teacher of the Year award since 1964. Generally, about 25 applications in the state are considered every year.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota State Board of Higher Education is debating allowing state colleges and universities to implement reduced credit bachelor’s degrees with a final decision expected by the end of the year.
The new degree proposal would allow colleges to offer bachelor’s degrees with a minimum of 90 semester hours, which is 30 hours fewer than a typical four-year degree. Schools would need the board’s approval before offering a reduced credit degree..
During a board meeting Thursday, Deputy Commissioner Lisa Johnson, chief academic and student affairs officer for the North Dakota University System, said, as the proposal is currently written, it could apply to any bachelor’s degree program offered at state colleges and universities.
She added the Higher Learning Commission, which accredits colleges and universities across the U.S., said schools implementing reduced credit bachelor’s degrees need to be mindful of potential transfers, graduate programs and license requirements associated with the new degrees that could jeopardize state-to-state licensure compacts.

Johnson said only one public school, Yavapai College in Prescott, Arizona, was offering the reduced bachelor’s degrees and rest of the reduced credit offerings were at for-profit schools.
Levi Bachmeier, the new superintendent of the Department of Public Instruction in-waiting, embraced the idea and said state colleges and universities could do more to innovate new pathways for students.
“This would not require institutions to offer these reduced credit bachelor’s degrees,” Bachmeier said. “We are just allowing them to put an additional arrow in the quiver that I view it as an opportunity to retain and recruit more North Dakotans to get a quality education.”

Bachmeier was also supportive of a “warning label” being attached to potential degrees.
A draft label was included in the board’s meeting documents that read: “Students enrolling in a reduced credit bachelor’s degree program must be advised of the potential financial aid, academic, and career implications of obtaining a reduced credit bachelor’s degree.”
The North Dakota Student Association unanimously opposed the reduced bachelor’s degree proposal during a recent meeting, said Maxwell Eriksrud, a University of North Dakota student and student representative on the State Board of Higher Education.

“By reducing these requirements, I think you’re going to be reducing the actual benefit of college for these students,” Eriksrud said. “I think there is also a slight disconnect between admin and student concerns in this policy.”
Of the reduced credit bachelor’s degrees approved by the Higher Learning Commission, Johnson said the titles of the degrees are no different than a regular bachelor’s degree, but many of the reduced degrees appeared to be bachelor’s of applied science.
“As a board, you could designate that. You could require us to have something like that in the title,” Johnson said.
Valley City State University, Mayville State University and Bismarck State College all have programs outlined that would allow graduation with fewer than the traditional 120 credit hours. 
Valley City State’s program to reduce the credit requirement to 106 credits – one less semester – for an education degree had already been approved by a committee, pending the board’s approval of the policy change. 
Larry Brooks, vice president for academic affairs Valley City State, told a committee on Sept. 4 that the last semester would often be used for obtaining an extra endorsement, such as kindergarten or special education. 
He said students could always come back to school to get that endorsement. He said having some professional experience would help students be more confident that seeking such an endorsement fits with their career goals. 
Kevin Black, chair of the State Board of Higher Education, said the board is duty-bound to protect the best interests of students and, while his entrepreneurial spirit wants to try the reduced credit degree program at schools in the state, he thinks more guardrails are required before the policy can move forward.
“I would not want to send my son or daughter to an institution for a reduced degree and then totally blow their chances to get a job,” Black said. 
The board voted to send the proposal to the Academic and Student Affairs Committee to provide more regulations surrounding the reduced credit degrees before the board takes up a revised policy in December.

(Photo: Lynn Bonner/NC Newsline)The state of North Carolina and a coalition of businesses and groups are donating almost $18 million to the state’s food banks, Gov. Josh Stein’s office said Thursday, as they prepare for a surge of need due to a pause in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP.
The state will grant $10 million to food banks. Insurance provider AmeriHealth Caritas is donating $5 million, and the David & Nicole Tepper Foundation is fast-tracking $2.5 million as part of a previous longer-term $10 million donation.
Other businesses, including Duke Energy and Bank of America, are also contributing.
“Shoring up our state’s food banks will serve as a critical, but fleeting, lifeline for families in need, and I hope other North Carolina organizations will also step up in this time of need,” Stein said in a statement. “Whether it’s paying our military, ensuring no child goes hungry, or lowering health care costs, leaders in Washington need to come together immediately to find a bipartisan solution that provides long-term stability for millions of Americans.”
Stein’s office did not immediately respond to an inquiry about the source of the $10 million.
Amy Beros, president and CEO of Food Bank of Central & Eastern NC, said in a statement that food banks were “working tirelessly to meet the increased need.”
But she stressed that they could not replicate the scale of SNAP, which provides nine meals for every one that food banks do. The nearly $18 million pales in comparison to SNAP’s estimated monthly total benefits in the state — $230 to $250 million.
“We need swift action to ensure this critical support continues uninterrupted for those who need it most,” Beros said. “Every day of delay means more empty plates and tougher choices for our neighbors.”
Around 1.4 million North Carolinians receive SNAP benefits. Ten of the state’s 99 counties have more than a quarter of their residents participating.
Those benefits will be put on hold Saturday as the U.S. Department of Agriculture halts payment amid the federal government shutdown. A coalition of Democratic states and officials, including Attorney General Jeff Jackson, have sued to force USDA to dip into its reserve fund to continue paying benefits.

As the nation grapples with a growing mental health crisis, a residential therapeutic community in Vermont’s Green Mountains is asking its residents to slow down and do the work.

Anyone who struggles with mental health and substance abuse—or loves someone who does—knows the path to healing is often long, filled with ups and downs. Yet, the solution-focused, brief interventions favored by insurance companies can imply that successful recovery is time-limited.
Amid a national mental health crisis, one residential therapeutic community in the Green Mountains of Vermont is asking its residents to slow down and do the work. 
Spring Lake Ranch has operated since 1932, and in that time, the core program has remained much the same. Adults experiencing mental health and substance-use challenges live and work alongside staff to run a functioning farm. 
The Ranch’s model is a Therapeutic Work Program, which combines several evidence-based practices with psychiatric care to prepare residents for life after treatment. The model requires time to reap the full benefits, with a recommended stay of at least six months. Some residents stay for multiple years.  
Work therapy is at the program’s heart. Broadly popularized in the eighteenth century, its philosophical roots can be found as far back as Plato’s techne and the Buddhist practice of Zen cultivation. It is a powerful intervention for residents who feel stuck in a cycle of hopelessness or failure. By engaging in meaningful work, they find purpose and connect to something larger than themselves. When they do something they never thought they could—helping to birth a calf, for instance, or chopping down a 50-foot-tall tree—their self-worth and self-efficacy surge. This cultivates hope, which is the key to long-term recovery.
The other theory at the core of the Ranch’s approach is milieu therapy, a flexible and holistic method of care. Milieu therapy is essentially living an engaged life within a supportive, structured community. It incorporates daily living activities with relationship-building and routines that provide consistency and clear expectations. Within the milieu, residents and caregivers work together to explore and model healthy functioning. Early research centered on patients living with schizophrenia, demonstrated marked reductions in violent and inappropriate behaviors. Loneliness is a major risk factor in mental health, so this type of community can also benefit people struggling with mood disorders, addiction, depression, anxiety, or failure to launch.  
Work and the milieu are foundational for the Ranch’s approach, but the therapeutic philosophies don’t stop there. Situated in an undeveloped mountain-top forest, with a pristine, spring-fed lake and Vermont’s distinct seasonality, the Ranch is a great place to experience the positive effects of nature therapy. Some of the researched benefits of nature therapy include decreased cortisol levels (the stress hormone) and increased absorption of Vitamin D, both of which reduce risk factors for physical health problems. Regular time in nature is also shown to improve creativity and problem-solving skills, mindfulness, and overall mood. Outdoor activities help residents exercise, build trust in their abilities, and nurture social relationships through shared experience. With similar benefits as nature therapy, animal-assisted therapy is also part of daily life at the Ranch. Caring for livestock is an important function of the farm, with frequent opportunities for residents to engage with other animals as well, including dogs, cats, donkeys, and horses.

Residents also receive one-on-one clinical therapy, group therapy, nutritional counseling, recovery programming, psychiatric care, and medication management. The model is not about replacing one standard of care with another but rather marrying traditional and alternative methods into a single approach. It allows residents to take their time not only to reach a baseline level of functioning, but to encounter and resolve new challenges and push through the plateau that often leads to relapse. 
The Ranch currently has two step-down programs that provide residents even more time to prepare themselves for life after treatment. An ongoing Capital Campaign seeks to expand this programming by building a mini-neighborhood on the property, with specialized assistance for residents who are ready for more independence. The new transitional program will allow residents to stay at the Ranch for longer periods of time at a lower-price point. They will learn independent living skills and receive assistance with finding employment.
For nearly a century, Spring Lake Ranch has observed success stories. These successes, defined by each resident’s individual needs and goals, have been difficult to quantify. A few years ago, the Ranch began measuring outcomes using the Daily Living Activities (DLA-20) assessment. Collecting results from 2019 – 2021, they learned just how impactful the Therapeutic Work Program can be. The DLA-20 identifies levels of functioning across twenty domains, including personal relationships, drug and alcohol use, grooming, and time and money management. On the 7-point scale, 1 represents extremely severe impairment, and 7 represents no impairment. 
Taken together, the Ranch’s respondents showed clinically significant improvements in global functioning across all twenty domains, with an average improvement of 1.21 points. Individually, 76% of residents improved in a domain by as much as 4.3 points. The benchmark for clinically significant results is that 35% of respondents improve by at least half a point, so the Ranch far exceeded the benchmark for success.
The Ranch hopes this data will be the first step toward increasing support from insurance companies and health agencies for models like their Therapeutic Work Program. They also hope the new transitional program, funded by their Capital Campaign, will serve as a blueprint for treatment centers across the country.

Mental health is a lifelong journey; individuals who experience mental illness and addiction will continue to manage symptoms long after treatment. Spring Lake Ranch has found that residents will have stronger success when they’re provided individualized, holistic care at their own pace. This provides long-term benefit not just for individual residents but for the communities they return to as well. Investment in different approaches to mental health care is an investment in a functioning society.

,Source New Mexico,2025-10-30 21:07:31+00:00,Source New Mexico,Planned Interior layoffs could cripple limited New Mexico wildfire research,"Bryce Dix, KUNM News",,,,,https://sourcenm.com/2025/10/30/planned-interior-layoffs-could-cripple-limited-new-mexico-wildfire-research/,Planned layoffs at the United States Department of Interior could cripple limited New Mexico wildfire research,"An undated photo of snow falling at Redondito Peak at the Valles Caldera National Preserve. (Courtesy U.S. National Park Service)Earlier this month, the Department of the Interior submitted court documents outlining its plans to lay off just over 2,000 employees nation-wide amid the ongoing government shutdown.
While these firings have been put on hold, for now, they could strip New Mexico of already scarce wildfire research resources.
According to the court filings, the proposed layoffs will impact many different sectors under the Interior – including a sizable 57% reduction of staff at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Fort Collins Science Center, which does scientific research for a slew of natural resource agencies.
That would leave the center with just 30 people overall.
While most of its staff are based in Colorado, the center has a small but mighty research presence in New Mexico.
“The New Mexico Landscapes Field Station was this institution of incredible forest ecology research in New Mexico, doing some of the most groundbreaking, fascinating forest research,” Andreas Wion told KUNM.
Up until two months ago, Wion was a research ecologist at the station but felt “forced out” as the Trump administration actively and aggressively downsizes the federal government.
Reflecting on his tenure at the field station, Wion pointed to the research he did on tree growth rings as an important contribution to documenting fire on the landscape.
“Oftentimes that involves collecting either small cores or sections of trees, cross dating the rings, making sure they all line up in the right way, and then looking for evidence of past fires within the tree rings,” Wion said.
By collecting over 2500 different unique fire scar sites from tree rings across the country, the New Mexico field station spearheaded a North American “fire scar atlas,” giving historical fire insights over the entire continent.
Currently, in addition to analyzing tree rings, the New Mexico field station has three employees listed on its website who research fire, forest ecology and wildlife. Some of this research has spanned decades in the Jemez Mountains and the Valles Caldera.
But, Wion said there are very few forest ecologists who study the impacts of wildfire in New Mexico, highlighting the dangers that the proposed job cuts can have for understanding wildfire in the Southwest.
“You can have missing years in your data, but losing the infrastructure, the people, the knowledge, the intellectual capacity to continue these long term data sets is something that can’t just be rehired and re-taught,” Wion said.
While the center is indeed small – and always has been – it attracts lots of grants and research money, said Craig D. Allen, a retired research ecologist and former leader of the New Mexico USGS field station. Allen founded the center over three decades ago, first headquartered at Bandelier National Monument.
“I mean, it’s productive,” Allen said. “For every dollar USGS puts into it [the New Mexico Landscape Field Office] has, over the last 20 years, brought in $3 of non-base funding to support the work that’s been done.”
Allen said that the USGS field station was revolutionary for its time, but was eventually followed by newer institutions dedicated to research forest ecosystems, such as the New Mexico Highland’s New Mexico Forest and Watershed Restoration Institute and the University of New Mexico’s Earth Systems Ecology Lab.
Still, he is insistent the USGS field station stands out from the rest, thanks to the broad swath of fire ecological work it does.
“The field station in its current, modest form, still has the potential to continue to be productive if it manages to persist through current governmental reorganization,” Allen added.
For now, a federal judge has temporarily halted the ongoing and pending shutdown firings as a lawsuit from two federal employee unions snakes through the courts – creating confusion within the Department of the Interior on what positions are possibly subject to layoffs.
If these planned job reductions come to fruition, it’s unclear if the New Mexico field station will be left intact.
Messages to the Department of the Interior and Fort Collins Science Center seeking comment and interviews were met with automatic messages about the ongoing government shutdown, which prohibits most federal employees from working until Congress passes an appropriations bill.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/7357efbf-f0f2-464b-b546-38956ff04659HiResProxy-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-30 17:16:40.605569

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Private fundraising will help South Dakota Public Broadcasting save just under half of the employees originally selected for layoffs earlier this year, the organization said Thursday. 
SDPB announced potential cuts in August after Congress and President Donald Trump canceled $1.1 billion in previously approved nationwide funding for public media. That decision cost SDPB $2.2 million, or about 20% of its budget. At the time, state funds accounted for a little more than half of SDPB’s budget, while grants, private donations and other sources made up the rest.
The softened layoffs, down to seven from the 15 announced earlier, were made possible by a mixture of restructuring, donations and grants. 
“This is a remarkable demonstration of what South Dakota can do when we pull together,” Executive Director Julie Overgaard said in a news release.
Four journalists, two engineers and one marketing specialist were laid off, Overgaard confirmed with South Dakota Searchlight. Additionally, five open positions will remain unfilled. The open positions and layoffs will reduce the organization’s staff from 63.5 full-time equivalent positions to 51.5.

“South Dakota Focus,” an in-depth public affairs television program, will be eliminated and magazine-style TV program “Dakota Life” will reduce its output. Public affairs radio program “In The Moment” will be incorporated into breaks during the national “Morning Edition” show, with host Lori Walsh producing the segments. “In The Moment,” which is currently an hour-long standalone show, will be shortened to about 15 total minutes on air, with extra content shared in the program’s podcast.
Friends of SDPB, the organization’s nonprofit fundraising arm, did not share how much money was raised in its months-long donation drive. The organization’s Bison Campaign, launched after the funding rescission, has a $2 million goal. A message on the Friends of SDPB website as of Thursday said “we’re already more than halfway there.”
Overgaard said SDPB received “very generous” foundation grants to continue providing education resources for the next year. SDPB will have to determine a “strategic redirection” for its educational programming before the grant expires.
SDPB will retain live legislative audio and video feeds, high school fine arts and sports event broadcasts, and emergency communications.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Some Oklahoma leaders are asking the governor to call a special session to provide emergency state funding for food assistance programs during the federal government shutdown. 
Over 680,000 Oklahomans could be cut off from the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, on Saturday if the shutdown continues. Gov. Kevin Stitt on Wednesday called on Oklahomans, nonprofits, food banks and religious groups to step up to help fill the gap, but he said the state will not use its savings to replace the program’s funding yet. 
Tribal leaders, members of the legislative Black caucus and House and Senate Democrats, meanwhile, are calling for Republicans to take greater action, including holding a special session to tap into the state’s savings to fund the program and feed Oklahomans.

A special session can be called by the governor or by the Legislature, if two-thirds of both the House and Senate sign on. 
“We have an obligation to protect children,” said Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, in a statement. “The solutions offered by the governor (Wednesday) are inadequate. He needs to call the Legislature into a special session to work on real and immediate solutions.”
Gov. Kevin Stitt, House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, and President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, did not comment Thursday on the calls for a special session to tap into the state’s savings.  
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 because Congress has failed to find a bipartisan path forward on a stopgap spending bill by the start of the federal fiscal year. A Republican proposal seeks to temporarily keep the government open through Nov. 21. Democrats back a separate plan to permanently restore health subsidies for those who buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.
Rep. Mark Lawson, R-Sapulpa, said in a statement Thursday that lawmakers know Oklahomans are being impacted “through no fault of their own,” but Congress needs to “do their job and vote to reopen the federal government.” 
“We cannot sustain funding SNAP benefits – which cost over $100 million a month in Oklahoma – for long with only state dollars, leaving Oklahomans in no better position than they are facing with the Nov. 1 deadline,” Lawson said. “Not to mention funding for our troops, air traffic controllers and other safety programs. Many of our own state employees are facing furloughs. Their salaries depend on federal dollars.”
Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskins Jr. called on Stitt to use the state’s surplus funding in the rainy day fund to replace the SNAP benefits that could be cut off come Nov 1.

The “rainy day fund,” otherwise known as the constitutional reserve fund, was created to collect surplus revenue to spend in select circumstances. The fund is capped at 15% of the current estimate for the state’s general revenue fund, according to the Oklahoma Policy Institute, an independent, nonpartisan Tulsa-based think tank.
The fund’s current balance sits at more than $1.32 billion, according to the House budget portal. 
Hoskins said now is the time to use the fund to help Oklahomans to “stem misery that (Stitt) did not cause.” 
“This crisis, a product of failures in Washington, D.C., can be fixed at least in the short term, if we all pitch in,” Hoskins said in a statement. “The state of Oklahoma should join us by immediately committing $142 million to save SNAP for Oklahomans through the end of November.”
The Cherokee Nation has committed some of its surplus funding to help provide relief to “thousands of Cherokees in Oklahoma” who could lose SNAP benefits, Hoskins said in a statement. The tribal nation is also providing $1.25 million to food banks and nonprofits to “help all of our friends and neighbors,” according to a statement. 
State law, though, limits how much of the rainy day funds can be spent. 
No more than three-eighths of the fund can be used in the case of a revenue shortfall in the current budget year or to use in the next budget year when there’s a predicted shortfall, according to the Oklahoma Policy Institute. Three-eighths of the current fund equates to around $495 million.

A quarter of the fund, which would be about $330 million, can be spent using the appropriations process in the case of an emergency and $10 million can be spent on “tax incentives for at-risk manufacturers.” 
An emergency must be declared by the governor with two-thirds of the House and Senate agreeing to appropriate the funding, or by a “joint declaration of emergency conditions” by the House Speaker and President Pro Tem of the Senate with approval from three-quarters of each legislative chamber. 
Five members of the Oklahoma Legislative Black Caucus, all Democrats, on Wednesday signed a letter to Stitt, Paxton and Hilbert asking for a special session to address SNAP benefits and the “devastating impact” a lapse in benefits could have. The members said ensuring food access is nonpartisan and a “moral responsibility” and urged swift action, according to a news release. 
“The welfare of Oklahoma’s citizens must remain the top priority of elected leaders at every level of government,” according to the letter. “If Governor Stitt fails to act, we call on legislative leadership to gather the signatures necessary to convene a special session to provide temporary state funding for SNAP recipients until the federal shutdown is resolved.”

“Washington has failed to do its job,” Gov. Spencer Cox said in a statement. “Utah is stepping up so families, especially those in rural communities, can keep food on the table. Because Utah Food Bank serves Utahns in all 29 counties, additional state resources will reach small towns and city neighborhoods alike, including our federal employee neighbors who’ve gone too long without a paycheck.” 
‘Hopeless’: Utahns say shutdown’s pause on food stamp funding carries a steep cost

Last week, Adams said the state isn’t equipped to fund federal programs for weeks or months, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which is not being funded in November in the midst of the shutdown. 
Republican legislative leaders urged Congress to end the shutdown, many faulting Democrats for it. 
“The responsibility to end this shutdown lies with our federal partners in Washington. Congress must stop the political games and reopen the government. Every day this shutdown drags on, hardworking Americans are hurt. It’s time for Congress to do its job and put the American people first,” Adams said in a statement Thursday. 
Congressional Democrats argue that the shutdown came after Republicans refused to negotiate over extending subsidies for health insurance policies offered under the Affordable Care Act. Those subsidies are set to expire at the end of the year.
The Utah leaders urged faith-based organizations, nonprofits and the community to join the initiative and support local food banks and pantries.
“We’re providing targeted, temporary, and accountable support to ensure every dollar makes a real difference and that the most vulnerable Utahns get the help they need,” Schultz said in the release. “We’re calling on all Utahns — nonprofits, faith groups, businesses, and families — to step up, lend a hand, and make a difference. It’s in moments like this that we see what truly makes Utah special.”

(Courtesy photo by Roxana Martinez-Gracias)A group of unionized janitors held up a banner reading “Keep T.F. Green safe & clean” and handed out leaflets to passengers traveling in and out Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport Thursday morning.
Seven janitors organized under SEIU 32BJ urged passengers to email airport CEO Iftikhar Ahmad and pressure officials to stop a new cleaning service vendor from cutting workers’ hours. 
The Rhode Island Airport Corporation’s (RIAC) board of directors in August awarded SJ Services of Danvers, Massachusetts, a three-year contract to manage cleaning services at the Warwick airport. SJ Servivces was among five bidders for the contract, which begins Friday.
Airport board votes to pursue new janitorial services vendor over union worker objections

“It definitely got some attention from folks,” Roxana Martinez-Gracias, a communications specialist for the union, said in an interview. “It was a nice introduction to talk about the problem at hand.”
The union fears that its 27-member cleaning crew will likely be cut in half under the new contract.
That staffing cut was based on a cost proposal sheet included with bid procurement documents that had janitors working a collective 2,700 hours per month over a potential five-year contract term. Under prior contracts, janitors worked between 4,300 and 5,000 hours per month, according to union officials.
 “It’s a bit up in the air how things are going to progress,” Martinez-Gracias said. “We’re still in communication with T.F. Green about trying to hear the workers’ testimony to sit down with us, but that just hasn’t happened yet.”
Airport spokesperson Bill Fischer said the airport corporation has no role in determining the number of janitorial workers.
“RIAC is not in a position, nor is it legally permitted, to create additional positions at a cost of $93,000 per position for janitorial roles that fall outside the scope of a competitively awarded contract, simply to satisfy a union demand based on a previously underperforming vendor,” Fischer said in an email to Rhode Island Current. 
Fischer said the max cap of 2,700 hours determined by airport officials for the bidding process “were necessary to maintain a clean and safe terminal.”
Janitorial services at the airport were handled for the past 15 years by Denmark-based ISS Facilities. Fischer said the company chose not to seek to renew its contract. Fischer said the airport had “received multiple complaints” about cleanliness under ISS.
Fischer shared with Rhode Island Current copies of violation notices sent to ISS in July 2024 and July 2025, noting “persistent grime” in the terminal, along with “inadequate restroom maintenance.”
“It is clear that ISS management is failing to properly manage staff to meet the required performance levels,” the July 31, 2025, notice states.
Despite the concerns of airport officials, the cleanliness of T.F. Green helped the Warwick airport reach the distinction of being the best in the world, according to Travel + Leisure magazine.
“RIAC has a legally binding contract with a vendor — backed by a performance bond — that guarantees our high standards for janitorial services,” Fisher said. “In contrast, a union is demanding an arbitrary increase in staffing, using a poorly performing previous vendor as the yardstick.”
A representative from SJ Services did not immediately respond to request for comment.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Florida judges legally can’t bar state attorneys and their staff from carrying firearms into courtrooms, according to Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier.
In an Oct. 20 letter posted to the attorney general’s website, Uthmeier told Sarasota’s Republican State Attorney, Ed Brodsky, that he and his staff should be allowed to bring their guns into courtrooms — even though the Chief Judge of the Twelfth Judicial Circuit decreed otherwise in a September order.
“The Chief Judge’s Administrative Order clearly conflicts with and attempts to amend Florida law,” Uthmeier wrote in his advisory opinion, insisting that the circuit has “contravened” the law. These opinions are not binding, and while courts have to consider them in litigation, they don’t need to abide by them.
“The Order cannot lawfully prohibit the State Attorney, assistant state attorneys, and their investigators from carrying firearms in the Twelfth Circuit’s courtrooms.”
He argued that although Florida statute empowers judges to limit “any person” from bringing weapons into their courtrooms, state attorneys and their staff don’t count as “any person.”
They count as law enforcement.
“Law enforcement officers—including state attorneys, assistant state attorneys, and investigators—do not fall within the definition of ‘any person,'” he said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Uthmeier’s opinion tracks with his dogged pro-gun rights approach since Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed him to the chief legal position in February. He declined to defend a decades-old ban on open carry last month when the First District Court of Appeal struck it down as unconstitutional. He has since asked the legislature to clean up state statute to reflect the decision.
Similarly, he’s preemptively refused to defend a Parkland-era law that lowered the gun-buying age if it makes it to the Florida Supreme Court — unlike his predecessors. This  approach comes as House Republicans are set to consider (for the fourth year in a row) whether to return the gun-purchasing age to 21. DeSantis, meanwhile, has advocated for a repeal of Florida’s red flag laws, but the state Senate has largely avoided touching gun laws since the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018.
Why did Uthmeier write this opinion?
The dispute arose after Judge Diana Moreland in September finalized new restrictions on where state attorneys can carry firearms: state attorneys and their staff could carry firearms into court facilities where their offices are, but not in courthouses without their offices or in any courtroom. Moreland oversees cases in Sarasota, Manatee, and DeSoto counties.
Brodsky disagreed, and wrote to Uthmeier to ask his legal opinion. Because this isn’t a court case, the attorney general as Florida’s chief legal officer can offer advisory opinions that often carry great weight in future litigation and serve as a guideline for state attorneys.
Uthmeier referenced a 1988 opinion by Florida Attorney General Robert Butterworth in a letter to then-State Attorney Janet Reno, a Democrat serving Miami-Dade who went on to serve as U.S. Attorney General. Butterworth believed that assistant state attorneys are law enforcement, and therefore could carry weapons into court in their official capacity.
“The Florida legislature has recognized the importance of the safety of prosecutors by giving them the right to arm themselves in the course of their official duties,” Uthmeier wrote.
“While [statute] contemplates a Chief Judge’s ability to regulate the carrying of firearms in courthouses and courtrooms, the State Attorney, assistant state attorneys, and investigators plainly fall outside that statute’s permissible regulatory sweep.”

Maine Gov. Janet Mills knows the $1.2 million she has allocated to help plug the hole that will be left by lapsed federal food assistance will not be enough but said the state has limited options without federal support.
With 170,000 Mainers set to lose Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits due to the ongoing government shutdown, anti-hunger advocates are pushing for the Maine Legislature to step in and provide additional funding to make up for the roughly $29 million that goes to low-income households each month.
USDA won’t shuffle funds to extend SNAP during shutdown, in about-face from earlier plan

Mills announced Wednesday she would be allocating $1.2 million to Good Shepherd Food Bank and Maine’s network of Area Agencies on Aging. One day later, appearing at Good Shepherd’s Auburn location, the governor said that the money will last “as long as we can spread it out.”
But, she said, the ultimate responsibility lies with the federal government, particularly the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which Mills said is falsely saying that a contingency fund can’t be used to bolster SNAP during the shutdown, reversing its previous plan to do so.
“They can stop this,” she said. “They can authorize the expenditure of the $5 billion contingency fund, and they can stop the shutdown.”
Of the state’s current allocation, Anna Korsen, deputy director of anti-hunger advocacy group Full Plates, Full Potential, told Maine Morning Star, “the gap is enormous — and this investment will not close it.”
“Maine is in a hunger crisis, and no food pantry can replace SNAP. For every one meal provided by a pantry, SNAP provides nine,” she added. Korsen also pointed out that access to those pantries, “which are often open only for limited hours during the week, can also be difficult for working caregivers and parents trying to feed their kids.”
Food pantries are already stretched thin. Preble Street in Portland is increasing its capacity to serve more than 2,400 meals a day, seven days a week to meet the need, according to Director Mark Swann.
“But, I want to stress, this is not a solution,” he said. “It is a temporary remedy to fill the tremendous gap left by this loss of SNAP benefits to vulnerable communities.”

Calls for special legislative session
If Maine does want to appropriate more funds to plug the hole left by federal SNAP funding, it would have to be approved by the Legislature. 
Several lawmakers and anti-poverty groups have publicly called on the governor and legislative leaders to convene a special session to address what many are describing as a funding crisis. A special session can be called by the governor, or by presiding officers with the consent of a majority of lawmakers.
“This is an all-hands-on-deck moment for our state government,” said Robyn Merrill, executive director of Maine Equal Justice, which along with Full Plates, Full Potential and the Maine Center for Economic Policy called on policymakers to make an urgent plan for additional funding.
Citing the right to food enshrined in the Maine Constitution in 2021, Maine Sen. Craig Hickman (D-Kennebec) sent a letter to Mills and Democratic leaders asking them to use their authority to convene a special session to cover the estimated $29 million gap in SNAP payments each month.
Mills said they are looking at all options. “But the answer,” she said, “is in the hands of the administration in Washington right now,”
Asked whether they would work with their colleagues to convene a special session, GOP leaders said congressional Democrats should support the Republican stopgap spending plan and end the government shutdown.
Pointing to Mills’ bid for U.S. Senate, which has been supported by Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Sen. Trey Stewart (R-Aroostook), said, “wouldn’t it make more sense for her to just ask him to end this nonsense and re-open the federal government by extending Biden’s budget, rather than spending state resources through a special session?”
Democratic leaders, alternately, put the onus on President Donald Trump’s administration for withholding SNAP contingency funds. 
“While we as a state need to stay creative and collaborative to weather this—we must not forget who is to blame,” said Maine Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Cumberland). “ The USDA has the funds needed for this vital program. This is a deliberate punishment and attack on states.”
Maine House of Representatives Speaker Ryan Fecteau (D-Biddeford) said he’d support a special session if Maine’s Republican leaders commit that their caucus will support a bill to cover food assistance for kids, families, and seniors. 
“I can tell you Democrats will absolutely support funding the Trump-imposed shortfall,” Fecteau said.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)Existing challenges for Arkansas’ farmers could be exacerbated by a prolonged federal government shutdown, Congressman Steve Womack told industry leaders Thursday, though he said he’s hopeful there will be movement toward reopening the government next week.
The shutdown, which has affected air traffic controller staffing, resulted in Womack’s flight from Washington D.C. being delayed last night as the Republican congressman traveled to Northwest Arkansas to host a roundtable discussion with members of the local agriculture industry Thursday morning.
The roundtable was not open to reporters, but Womack, who represents Arkansas’ 3rd Congressional District, told members of the media afterward that a labor supply shortage and the high costs of feed, seed, fertilizer, land and equipment are driving farmers out of business.
‘A dire strait’: 1 in 3 farms could close without aid, Arkansas agriculture leaders tell lawmakers

Bill Haak, husband of former Republican state Rep. Delia Haak, raises dairy and beef cattle in Benton County. The eighth-generation dairy farmer said one of the challenges he’s facing is “pretty rough” milk prices that have thankfully been offset by beef prices. 
“The milk is lower due to the federal milk market order,” he said, referring to a federal system that maintains a stable marketing relationship between processors and producers. “It’s just like everything else, supply and demand, and right now there’s just a saturation of milk in the country and the federal milk market order reflects that.”
Farmers often rely on subsidies from the federal government and the ongoing shutdown could impact their ability to access programs, like those that offset the loss of livestock, according to the Benton County Cooperative Extension Service’s Johnny Gunsaulis. 
“Like I said in the meeting, the livestock people in this part of the world really take pride that we’re one of the areas of the state that receive a lower amount of government payments, and most people are pretty proud of that, but when they do need those for help, this government shutdown will affect those producers,” Gunsaulis said. 
The shutdown is also affecting research at the University of Arkansas’ Division of Agriculture where a number of county extension agents and research are partially federally funded, the division’s vice president Deacue Fields said. No employees have been furloughed, according to Fields, who said the division is using carryover funds to keep staff paid. 
But it’s a short-term solution that’s preventing the division from being proactive with research because it isn’t able to invest resources like it typically would, he said. Avian influenza, for example, is one research area the division is “heavily involved in” and this is the season where there’s generally an uptick in the disease, Fields said. Avian influenza was identified in a backyard flock in Mississippi County, according to an Oct. 10 update from the division. Roughly 60 birds were destroyed as a result. 
“The overall investment in agriculture research really matters for us to be able to continue to stay ahead of the curve and be able to feed a growing population with the same amount of land, same amount of production assets that we had before,” Fields said. “It takes research and innovation.”
Womack said the early stages of a federal government shutdown often don’t affect people too much, but the overall economy will be affected as the closure continues.
For example, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits are expected to lapse Saturday, which Womack said would affect more than 200,000 people in Arkansas, a state with the highest food insecurity rate in the nation, according to a September 2024 USDA report. 
“To the people who would suggest that the government shutdown doesn’t necessarily affect them, let me assure them it completely affects them. It just may not show up because they’re still getting a paycheck and they’re still going about their daily routines,” Womack said.

Democrats and Republicans in Washington have been deadlocked for weeks, making no visible progress in negotiations to reopen the government. The shutdown began Oct. 1 after Congress failed to approve a funding bill before the start of the new fiscal year. 
A sticking point for Democrats has been tax credits used by people who buy their own health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace; the credits are set to expire at the end of this year. Republicans have said negotiations about the credits can begin once the government is funded.
Womack said Thursday he’s “hearing whispers” about conversations behind the scenes that could lead to action soon. With the pain inflicted by the loss of SNAP benefits, Womack said he’s hopeful there will be a plan drafted next week that would allow lawmakers to approve three pending appropriations bills, one of which is related to agriculture. SNAP benefits are administered by the Department of Agriculture.
“Then, once you get government reopened, the two sides, bicameral, bipartisan, can sit down at the table and then start discussing other emerging issues, and certainly health care is going to be one of those, what to do with enhanced tax credits that expire at the end of this year for the Affordable Care Act,” he said. “Those are the kinds of discussions that we need to be having right now, but you can’t have them if you’ve got two sides that are sitting in their corners right now unwilling to work with each other.”
In addition to agriculture, Womack said the shutdown is delaying the approval of a transportation and housing appropriation bill that includes around $100 million for projects in his district, including highway construction and water system improvements.

“Scouting gives kids real chances to lead, serve, and try new things in a safe, supportive setting,” said John Walker, Scout Master of Troop 67. “Parents see their children gaining confidence and character week by week,” Walker said.
Local Scout units are adding members and inviting interested parents and youth to a series of Join Scouting nights in November.
“We’re seeing strong interest across Delaware because families want exciting programs with hands-on experiences that promote life skills—from Cub Scouts through high-adventure crews—and plenty of chances for parents to get involved,” said Ray Teat, Scouting executive for the Del-Mar-Va Council.
Scouting in Delaware offers age-appropriate options for boys and girls—including Cub Scout packs, Scouts BSA troops, Venturing crews, Sea Scout ships, and Exploring posts—giving youth multiple paths based on age and interest. (Scouts BSA typically organizes youth into single-gender troops, while Venturing, Sea Scouts, and Exploring operate coed.)
The program starts with Cub Scouts and family-friendly weekly activities that build basic skills, with monthly outings and annual trips to keep engagement high. “Our proximity to trails, waterways, and historic sites makes it a natural fit for hiking, camping, and conservation projects,” Teat said.
Outdoor programming is a cornerstone. Scouts regularly camp at nearby parks and Scout reservations. Day trips and weekend campouts introduce skills such as tent and camp-kitchen setup, trail safety, map and compass, and Leave No Trace principles. Older youth advance to backpacking treks, canoe and kayak outings on area rivers, cold-weather camping, climbing, and orienteering events. Sea Scouts focus on boating safety, seamanship, navigation and stewardship of local waterways. Many activities pair outdoor skills with service, including trail work, habitat restoration, and community cleanups.
Scouting experiences translate directly into leadership and life skills. Scouts plan trips and menus, manage budgets, and lead teams—building project-management and problem-solving abilities along the way. Merit badges expose youth to careers and practical knowledge in first aid, personal fitness, robotics, citizenship, and personal finance. The advancement framework provides clear goals, often culminating in Eagle Scout service projects that require proposal writing, fundraising, logistics, and volunteer coordination. Youth also log service hours, practice public speaking as patrol leaders, and mentor younger members.
Programs are open to all, with coed options in several tracks. Venturing emphasizes high adventure and leadership for teens; Exploring connects youth with career fields; Sea Scouts centers on maritime skills. Leaders say the inclusive lineup helps Scouting meet families where they are and adapt to community needs. Age-appropriate challenges—from backyard campfires to multi-day treks—are delivered with trained adult leadership and safety protocols to build resilience and sound judgment.

We linked to them here.,"One of the “pre-development draft concepts” for the New Mexico State Fair grounds that Stantec presented to the new State Fair District Board on Oct. 30, 2025, in Albuquerque. Stantec officials stressed that the concept is subject to change. (Courtesy Stantec)Members of a new board overseeing up to $500 million in investment to re-envision the State Fair grounds in Albuquerque authorized about $67 million for infrastructure—including millions aimed at two dangerous intersections. 
The State Fair District Board, which the Legislature created earlier this year, is tasked with overseeing the design and authorizing spending for the 236-acre site in the heart of Albuquerque that abuts the International District neighborhood. The state-owned site has emerged as a target for investment that board members and neighbors say they hope will benefit the neighborhood, long beset with crime, drug use and poverty. 
The board unanimously gave initial approval for spending for the project’s early phases, including about $16 million for demolition and land preparation, $27 million for internal roadways and utilities, $19 million for a 10-acre park and $6 million for”off-site” pedestrian safety improvements. 
Members also received their first glimpse at  “pre-development draft concepts” for the fairgrounds.
Officials at Stantec, the firm developing a master plan for the redevelopment, also provided the concepts to Source New Mexico, though they stressed the designs are preliminary and subject to change, including based on the public’s input at upcoming meetings.

Even with the project in its nascent stage, the impact on the International District and its residents has been the subject of much conversation among board members, including Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller and New Mexico Senate President Pro Tempore Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque). The development may also mean the annual State Fair will need to find a new home. 
The intersections on both sides of the fairgrounds, where Central Avenue crosses San Pedro Drive and Louisiana Boulevard, are the two most dangerous intersections in New Mexico for pedestrians, according to state Transportation Department data. Forty-two crashes involving pedestrians occurred at those two intersections in 2024.
The design concepts Stantec shared aim to open up the site with green space, parks and amenities, including an arena or other large community venue, along with an unspecified number of mixed-income housing units. The design also includes “traffic-calming” measures, including more crosswalks, pedestrian-activated streetlights and at least one more stoplight, said Stantec Designer Nancy Locke.
“We’d love to slow that traffic down a little bit,” Locke said.

The $67 million the board authorized includes $6 million in “off-site” improvements detailed in the pre-development concepts, money that could go to the pedestrian safety measures. It includes about $2 million for intersection improvements, $2.6 million for sidewalk and landscape improvements and $140,000 to improve the existing bus stops there. 
While the board authorized the $67 million in bonding capacity for infrastructure, spending that money is still a good way off, Lujan Grisham said. The Legislature will also have to sign off when it meets in January, and then the state Finance Board will issue the bonds at a later date. 
And the funding for up to the $433 million in remaining bonding capacity the Legislature gave the Fair Board would come in subsequent phases. The governor and state Rep. Janelle Anyanonu (D-Albuquerque) said they might seek even more funding for the project at the January legislative session. 
Still, the governor said during Thursday’s meeting she’d like to see the project break ground before she leaves office at the end of next year, and she asked Locke if that was possible. 
“We’ll have to move fast,” Locke said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-30-at-2.27.16-PM-1024x571.png,,,2025-10-30 17:01:34.283367
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-30 20:31:11+00:00,CT Mirror,More CT high school students are taking college-level classes,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/30/dual-enrollment-courses-ct-schools/,A surge in COVID emergency funding has allowed district leaders add more dual credit classes and practical training for today's job market,"Connecticut has seen a significant jump in the number of high school students taking college-level courses, according to data from the state Department of Education released on Thursday. 
In 2024-25, more than 24,700 high school juniors and seniors in Connecticut enrolled in college-level courses, an increase from 17,500 students three years prior. The 24,700 amounted to about 30% of high school juniors and seniors across the state. 
The trend follows a surge of state funding that was directed to the programs two years ago.
In the fall of 2023, the state announced it would use $3.8 million in federal pandemic emergency funds to help high schools add more college-level courses. Districts have since used that money to expand their offerings and pay teachers to write curriculum and become certified to teach a variety of disciplines. Connecticut’s education department also invested an additional $5 million of COVID funds in colleges and universities for the expansion of dual credit classes. 
Superintendents say they’ve shifted their focus when developing courses with an eye to the current job market. And some have begun to question the widely-accepted philosophy that every high school graduate should pursue a 4-year degree. 
“We see students always have to go to a four-year college,” said Joseph Macary, superintendent of Vernon Public Schools, at a roundtable discussion in Hartford on Thursday. “And that’s not what we want them to do. We want to try — and we are — diversifying to other courses that they don’t need a 4-year degree to do.” 
Subjects with the highest enrollment across Connecticut public high schools are social sciences, followed by physical and life sciences, mathematics and English language and literature.
Courses in some subjects have exploded. The number of business and marketing courses in particular have increased by 73% from last year — an increase that may be partly driven by a new financial literacy requirement for high schoolers in Connecticut. 
The number of students taking manufacturing courses has increased by 47%, and the number of students taking classes in healthcare and mathematics have increased by about a third. Enrollment in English and social sciences has grown also, though not as dramatically. 
Responding to business needs
John Maduko, chancellor of Connecticut State Colleges and Universities, said Connecticut’s workforce is facing an “existential threat” as the state’s population ages and Baby Boomers retire.
Specialty high school courses — and the apparent rising enrollment in those courses — could help address shortages of workers with needed skills.

Macary noted that military submarine manufacturer General Dynamics Electric Boat needs thousands of welders and other technicians in order to fulfill recent contracts with the United States Navy.
“I believe that we need to create systems and structures in our high schools that are responsive, that they can be agile enough to be responsive to the workforce,” said Macary. 
Anna Cutaia, superintendent of Milford Public Schools, said her district offers five career pathways — business management, allied health, computer science, education and government. She said district leaders are hoping to expand those offerings to include performing arts, cybersecurity and eSports. 
Cutaia said the school meets with industry representatives to hear what skills are needed for the current labor market. She said they have recently added industry certifications, which allow students to go directly into the workforce — or into an apprenticeship, technical school or a 2- or 4-year college degree program.
According to Cutaia, 80% of Milford’s seniors last year went on to a 4-year college, and 20% “are taking advantage” of the industry certificate they earned. 
Dual enrollment courses are also critical for colleges and universities as they work to attract new students and shore up their own student population.
Maduko said dual enrollment students make up 11% of CSCU’s total enrollment. He said this has helped offset some of the enrollment declines the system experienced during COVID. 
The University of Connecticut offers the most dual enrollment courses — serving about 30,000 students in partnership with nearly 200 high schools. 
CSCU offered classes to about 12,500 dual enrollment students last year, and private colleges offered about 3,700.
Jennifer Widness, president of the Connecticut Conference of Independent Colleges, said  some of the private universities in Connecticut have developed partnerships with certain high schools. 
Goodwin University, for example, has partnered with Wallingford Public Schools and other districts to offer advanced manufacturing courses. Mitchell College is developing healthcare and business tracks in partnership with New London Public Schools, while also working to launch a healthcare academy with Lawrence + Memorial Hospital. Quinnipiac University is offering  an apprenticeship program for teaching in partnership with East Haven and West Haven public schools. 
Improving access
Past reporting by the Connecticut Mirror found that access to dual enrollment classes varied significantly depending on resources available within each school district. Suburban districts tend to have greater college course offerings than rural or urban districts, driven in part by the availability of teachers who are certified to teach those classes and the stability of leadership. 
Ajit Gopalakrishnan, chief performance officer for the state Department of Education, told CT Mirror that the state was working with higher education institutions to make it easier for teachers to become accredited to teach dual enrollment courses. That includes moving away from the traditional assumption that teaching a college level course required a master’s degree in the subject of the course, he said, which many K-12 teachers don’t have.
Gopalakrishnan said the coronavirus funds have been put toward teacher stipends, to help cover the cost of any additional classes they need to become certified. 
Tom Yelich, chief of staff for CT State Community College, said in a statement that the college and the state provide funds for tuition and professional development for teachers taking graduate classes to be able to teach dual enrollment classes.
Maduko stressed the importance of making dual enrollment classes available for students who might not have otherwise considered college. He said that CSCU wanted to provide college-level courses to high schoolers who fall into what he calls the “academic middle.” 
“God bless the AP students, they are phenomenal. But we want to make sure that those students — and really their families that maybe at first never thought of college and the university being a reality — we can provide this opportunity to them while in high school,” he said. 
Data shows the state has made progress with increasing access to dual credit courses for students of color. Last year, the number of white high school students taking college courses increased by about 24% compared to the prior year. But the number of Black and Hispanic students taking college courses in high school rose 34% and 35.5%, respectively. 
Tadarrayl Starke, UConn’s vice provost for undergraduate student success, said that 44% of the students in UConn’s Early College Experience classes are first-generation, and that the fees were waived for about two in five students in those classes.
A stepping stone to higher ed
Students and superintendents at Thursday’s roundtable said dual enrollment classes had many benefits.
Kayla Markowitz, a student at Jonathan Law High School in Milford, said that taking a series of Advanced Placement courses helped her narrow down her interests. She now plans to attend a 4-year college and major in public policy. 
Markowitz and higher education leaders also said that taking college-level courses in high school gives students confidence in their ability to complete that level of education. And several higher education presidents and school superintendents pointed out the significant savings students can achieve when they complete college courses in high school.
Macary said students at Rockville High School in Vernon saved $1.5 million in college tuition through dual enrollment courses last year. 
A UConn Early College Experience course costs $50 per credit and is free for low-income students, compared to about $700 per credit for a traditional college class at UConn.
Dual and concurrent enrollment students at CT State Community College can take classes for free. In comparison, one credit at CT State Community College for an adult before financial aid costs about $300. 
According to state data, the percentage of students exhibiting “post-secondary readiness” has increased from about 44% to about 47% from the 2023-24 school year to 2024-25. This means they’ve either earned above a certain score on an Advanced Placement exam or earned three or more college credits through dual enrollment classes.
State Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker said that while it’s important to celebrate the progress being made, there’s also a lot of work that still needed to be done.  
This spring, lawmakers voted to include $6 million in the state budget in 2026-27 to offset the cost of dual credit courses. Officials at the State Department of Education say this is intended to be an annual appropriation.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023_1110_SR_CTColleges_018-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-30 17:01:34.283367

Wednesday’s state Senate Agriculture Committee Hearing focused almost exclusively on soybeans and cattle, two of the state’s top agricultural products. 
Soybeans are the state’s number-one crop, benefitting from easy access to the Mississippi river and New Orleans port. China is the world’s largest soybean importer and historically buys about half of all U.S. soybeans. However, since 2016 and the Trump administration’s first trade war, China has strategically shifted to buying more Brazilian soybeans. 
“It’s a real dilemma for us  in Mississippi and the Delta trying to decide where we go from here with our soybean crop,” said Duane Dunlap, president of DNS Commodities, to the committee. 
China did not buy any soybeans from the U.S. this year until Wednesday. On Thursday, after meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, President Donald Trump posted on social media that China would begin buying “massive amounts” of U.S. soybeans.

But Dunlap thinks there’s also a market opportunity within Mississippi for soybeans.
Mississippi’s chickens, hogs and catfish all eat soybean meal but there are currently no soybean processing facilities in the state. So soybean meal is imported from other states. Dunlap pointed out that Mississippi is the largest soybean-producing state without a processor. He suggested that there’s an opportunity here to build a plant that could supply Mississippi farmers.
Beef prices are at record highs, driven by high demand and historically small herds. Trump has said that the U.S. could buy more beef from Argentina to bring prices down. This has led to push back and concern from U.S. cattle farmers. 
 ”Producers are just now starting to feel like they’re in recovery,” said Ethan Lane, senior vice president of government affairs for the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association.

In Fiscal Year 2023, federal defense spending made up 6% of Mississippi’s GDP. In 2021, the state established the Governor’s Office of Military Affairs to coordinate groups across the state.

(Photo by Julia Rendleman for New Jersey Monitor)It’s almost Halloween, which means it’s time to revisit one of my favorite New Jersey stories — that time Orson Welles pretended Martians had landed in the Garden State and were incinerating everyone in their path.
It’s also almost Election Day, which means it’s the perfect chance to explain what an 87-year-old radio play can teach voters about separating fact from fiction amid an onslaught of campaign trickery.

For the uninitiated, Welles’ radio adaptation of H.G. Wells’ “The War of the Worlds” aired on Halloween Eve 1938. Writer Howard Koch moved the setting of the novel from 19th-century England to 20th-century New Jersey, and made the start of the show sound like an orchestral concert interrupted every few minutes by increasingly dramatic news accounts reporting strange explosions on Mars, a strange cylindrical object falling onto a farm in the Grovers Mill section of West Windsor, and finally a monster exiting the UFO and waging war on the Garden State and beyond.
If you happened to miss the first few minutes of the broadcast, which made very clear that it was a fictional radio play, you may have thought you were listening to legitimate news of an alien invasion. And, sure enough, newspapers the next day were plastered with accounts of nationwide panic, some more believable than others.
The Herald News reported that the switchboard at Passaic Police Headquarters was “flooded with calls.”
The Courier-Post quoted someone from Grovers Mills named Old Bill Dock who said the radio show had him brandishing his double-barreled shotgun. “Thirty years since I fired her last,” he said, “but danged if I wouldn’t let her go last night if I could get a bead on ‘em.”
The Daily Home News said frightened people ran into the paper’s office and New Brunswick police headquarters to get info on the alleged war. “I couldn’t convince them that it was only a radio show,” said Lt. John Lyons.
Most other press accounts appear … less based in reality.
The New York Times wrote, “In San Francisco the general impression of listeners seemed to be that an overwhelming force had invaded the United States from the air, was in the process of destroying New York and threatening to move westward. ‘My God,’ roared one inquirer into a telephone, ‘where can I volunteer my services? We’ve got to stop this awful thing.’”
What inquirer? Who were they talking to? How did the Times know about this conversation? There’s a lot of chatter today about how untrustworthy the media is, but it seems like editorial standards were pretty loosey-goosey in 1938, even in the pages of the Gray Lady.
The front page of the Bergen Evening Record on Oct. 31, 1938, when newspapers made Americans believe there was a nationwide panic over a radio show.
For decades, the story of Welles’ “War of the Worlds” was a story about a gullible nation taken in by obviously fake news. But in recent years, Welles scholars and others have noted that, no, newspapers were the first to whip everyone into a frenzy by touting a nationwide panic that likely didn’t happen.
Michael J. Socolow, a University of Maine professor who teaches in the school’s journalism and communications department, said contemporaneous reports show hardly anyone listened to Welles’ show that night because it aired at the same time as the year’s most popular show, hosted by ventriloquist Edgar Bergen (yes, a ventriloquist on the radio). What really happened in the broadcast’s aftermath was the result of good-old-fashioned jealousy by newspaper owners who saw an opportunity to take down radio by painting Welles and radio broadcasters as irresponsible for scaring the daylights out of Americans, Socolow told me.
“Radio news was growing bigger and more important because we’re headed into World War II, with the Munich crisis happening one month before,” he said. “The American people are really starting to pay attention to radio news at an entirely new level. And that’s what had newspapers upset.”
Marguerite Rippy, an associate dean for graduate affairs at George Mason University who has studied Welles, called the broadcast and newspapers’ reaction to it “classic folklore.”
“The field of folklore studies how scary stories spread,” Rippy said. “We like to pass on stories. I think it’s the basis of who we are. And those storytelling moves happen both in Welles’ broadcast and in the media storytelling that came after. They’re both counter-folklore performance narratives that are operating with each other to create this other fantastic story that is very true about people, which is that we’re easily manipulated.”
And that brings me to the election. In four days, New Jersey voters will decide who becomes our next governor, Jack Ciattarelli (R) or Mikie Sherrill (D).
I know it’s naive to think candidates seeking office in 2025 would be honest with voters. But party leaders on both sides are engaging in the same kind of trickery that Welles used to make it sound like Martians had invaded Earth and that newspapers in 1938 employed to create the narrative that Welles’ radio play fooled people all over the United States.
Republicans have blanketed our airwaves with an ad claiming Sherrill bragged that clean energy initiatives she backed would “cost you an arm and a leg but if you’re a good person you’ll do it.” Sherrill did indeed use those words during a radio interview, but these GOP ads eliminate what she said right before. She said Democratic Party messaging about clean energy failed because it told voters it would “cost you an arm and a leg but if you’re a good person you’ll do it.” She was criticizing her party for lecturing people about clean energy, not lecturing voters herself.
Democrats have also been generous with the edit button. The party used a clip of Ciattarelli saying during a radio interview that “once you get outside our major urban centers, our most rural communities are just magnificent” to paint Ciattarelli as racist. Democrats even organized a press conference so the mayors of Plainfield, Orange, East Orange, Paterson, and Rahway could bash Ciattarelli for that comment — which he made on a podcast in response to a question about the best time to visit New Jersey if you don’t want to visit the Shore. Ciattarelli’s full comment was: “Fall is a magnificent season in New Jersey. The foliage is off the charts. And once you get outside our major urban centers, our most rural communities are just magnificent and there’s all kind of fall fests going on and pumpkin patches and farmland and hayrides. It’s magnificent.”
Like those listeners who may have tuned in late to Welles’ broadcast, voters who see both these edited clips are missing the context that makes them less scary. And like the newspaper editors in 1938 who took advantage of the fears of a nation dreading a march to war in Europe to target radio broadcasters vying for competition, Republicans and Democrats in New Jersey are using voters’ modern-day agita to make them believe their political leaders say all sorts of foolish things they never said.
I don’t fault voters who fall for the campaigns’ deceptiveness. Political operatives are taking advantage of voters who are anxious about racism or rising unaffordability and manipulating them by presenting them with ads that confirm their priors about the candidates and attempt to scare them into action. That is precisely what made it easy for newspaper editors in 1938 to convince people there had been a nationwide panic, Rippy told me.
“A smart manipulation presses on a panic point you already have,” she said.
Luckily, a little bit of media literacy helps cut through the B.S. Just like the portions of the “War of the Worlds” that sounded real had hints that it was all a lark, and just like newspapers’ accounts of the ensuing panic contained clues that a lot of the claims were bunk, today’s campaign of misinformation signals to viewers who pay attention that it is not legit. The very obvious edits of Sherrill’s and Ciattarelli’s statements in the examples cited above are a tell-tale sign that you are being manipulated. Ask yourself why a campaign would want you to hear just a seconds-long segment of their political opponent’s longer statement. The answer is they want to fool you. Don’t let them.

Gov. Tate Reeves said the new group will help build “a bigger, stronger Mississippi in the years to come.”
The state’s top politicians, all Republicans, on Thursday spoke about wide range of topics during the casual gathering at the Mississippi Coliseum in Jackson.
Reeves said the state now has “the strongest economy” in its history.
“No state, and I mean no state, is hotter than Mississippi,” he said.
But others leaders offered warnings of major challenges or problems.

Agriculture Commissioner Andy Gipson said Mississippi is in the midst of an “agriculture crisis,” from high input costs for farmers and global trade wars that have sapped overseas sales of commodities.
But he said solutions are in the works, including a soybean trade deal with China announced by President Donald Trump this week. He also said Mississippi’s geography, with plenty of fertile land and water, promises a brighter future.
Gipson said lack of water in other parts of the U.S. will within 20 years turn the Southeast into “the food production center for the country.” 
Insurance Commissioner Mike Chaney said Mississippi being the only state without a robust mitigation program to strengthen housing stock against hurricanes and other natural disasters could spell doom for the state’s insurance market, and economy at-large.
“Some gaslighting members of the state Legislature decided (earlier this year) they would kill the program to mitigate houses,” Chaney said. “Now, we’re the only state without a mitigation program.”
Chaney also warned of major, continuing problems with access to health care and of the potential for hundreds of thousands of Mississippians to lose health coverage amid the ongoing battle in Washington over the federal Affordable Care Act.
House Speaker Jason White told the business leaders they should support his push in the coming legislative session for expanding “school choice,” or “education freedom.” This push, coming from the Trump administration, would include using public tax dollars for private schools and allowing families more choices in their children’s education. White said it would help with workforce development, better training Mississippi students for jobs.
White also said the House plans to tackle another major issue for businesses by pushing to raise the corporate tax credit for spending on child care for employees to 100%, or “dollar-for-dollar” of what companies spend.
Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann told the audience Thursday that state economic growth hinges on three things: “Good schools, a trained workforce and a solid housing market.”
“This year, the Senate will be addressing all of these,” Hosemann said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/30123917/Mississippi-Economic-Council-annual-Hobnob16B.jpg,,,2025-10-30 16:21:22.122332

The state has declared a limited State of Emergency, SNAP benefits to continue despite a federal shutdown.
WILMINGTON — Delaware families who receive SNAP (food stamps) face a Monday recertification deadline that could interrupt November benefits for households whose certification periods end in October. At the same time, the state has declared a limited State of Emergency, so benefits can continue despite a federal shutdown that would otherwise halt payments.
Gov. Matt Meyer, on Wednesday, declared an emergency order, authorizing Delaware to load SNAP benefits week-to-week in November with state funds and to boost support for food banks and pantries if needed. The order cites more than 120,000 Delawareans relying on SNAP each month. The administration emphasized the measure is temporary and intended to prevent an abrupt lapse while federal payments are suspended.
Republican legislative leaders publicly backed keeping benefits flowing but urged Meyer to use uncommitted state dollars first and, if necessary, call the General Assembly into session. In letters this week, GOP caucuses suggested redirecting money earmarked for the Legislative Hall parking garage project and portions of the state’s ERP cloud migration budget, with backfilling once federal operations resume.
The emergency order follows a USDA memo stating it would not deploy federal contingency funds for November SNAP during the shutdown and would not reimburse states that self-fund benefits—leaving states to decide whether to cover the gap. Several states, including Delaware, have now acted, according to reports in Reuters.
Meanwhile, the Delaware Division of Social Services (DSS) says many SNAP households still must complete routine recertification by Monday to avoid a separate interruption unrelated to the shutdown. Renewals can be submitted through the Delaware ASSIST portal or at State Service Centers. DSS reminds clients to provide income, housing and household documentation; missing items can delay approval.
Local nonprofits, including the Food Bank of Delaware, are preparing for increased demand if families miss the cutoff or experience processing delays, even with the state’s emergency funding in place. Advocates have stepped up outreach through social media, churches and community partners to prevent gaps.
What families should do now?


Check if you’re due to renew: This applies to households whose certification period ends in October. Delaware Health and Social Services


Recertify by Monday: Submit online via Delaware ASSIST or return your mailed packet to DSS; include income, rent/mortgage, utilities and household size documentation.

The big picture


State action: Delaware will fund weekly SNAP loads in November while federal payments are suspended, under a State of Emergency signed Oct. 29.


GOP stance: Support for continuity of benefits, coupled with calls to reprioritize specific state funds and, if needed, reconvene lawmakers. See House Republicans’ open letter.


Why it’s urgent: A federal memo says USDA will not use contingency funds for November and won’t reimburse states that pay on their own.

(Photo courtesy of Iowa National Guard)Gov. Kim Reynolds announced Thursday she will deploy Iowa National Guard members to assist with Iowa food banks and pantries and direct the state to match donations beginning Nov. 1 if the federal government does not reopen.
Benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, will not be distributed beginning in November if the federal government shutdown, which on Thursday reached 30 days, continues. As there does not seem to be a resolution in sight, charitable organizations are preparing to see a surge in demand in Iowa and across the country from families seeking food assistance.

While Iowa has not moved to provide state backing for SNAP benefits as some other states have considered, Reynolds announced the state will provide “interim support” for Iowa food banks and pantries if SNAP benefits end as expected.
These supports include plans to deploy Iowa National Guard members for active duty, conducting food distribution missions throughout the state, as well as planned meetings with the Iowa Department of Health and Human Services and Volunteer Iowa to recruit and deploy volunteers “to support food assistance operations in communities across the state where help is needed.”
Additionally, Reynolds directed Iowa HHS to use existing state funds to match cash donations to the state’s six regional food banks up to $1 million, beginning Nov. 3, if the shutdown continues.
“Government plays an important role in supporting its citizens, but we each have a personal responsibility to care for the people in our communities, especially those in need,” Reynolds said in a statement. “That’s why the state will match up to $1 million in contributions made by Iowans for regional food banks across our state. Together, we can make an even bigger difference for our neighbors who need help during this time.”
A spokesperson for the Des Moines Area Religious Council said their organization was “grateful for the office of the governor’s work to create an emergency response for Iowans in need.”
“This increased collaboration and communication with Iowa HHS and agencies like DMARC is an important step to remove barriers for our neighbors as they navigate an incredibly difficult time,” Blake Willadsen, communications manager for DMARC said. “SNAP is our nation’s most effective tool for fighting hunger, and the loss of it this November will be felt especially hard by families, children, and seniors across our state.”
Food banks, pantries and other organizations said last week they expect to see “unprecedented” need across the state if SNAP benefits end, as the food assistance program serves roughly 270,000 Iowans each month. In addition to the state’s response, there have also been several private organizations pledging support for these entities in the coming week.
Local businesses including Big Grove Brewery and The Big Grove for Good Foundation have announced plans to donate a total of $12,000 to three Iowa food banks, Hy-Vee will donate $100,000 to food banks in its regions and Fareway and the Iowa Pork Producers Association are collaborating to donate $20,000 worth of pork to food banks across the state.
The three Medicaid managed care organizations in Iowa, Iowa Total Care, Molina Healthcare of Iowa, and Wellpoint Iowa, have also committed to donate $100,000 to support Iowa food banks, according to the governor’s news release.
Food insecurity impairs learning, teachers’ union says
Advocates say the lapse of SNAP benefits will have major implications for Iowans in all aspects of life — including education. Iowa State Education Association President Joshua Brown said students who experience chronic food insecurity face greater challenges in learning and retaining information, and called on members of Congress to pass a “bipartisan funding bill that prioritizes the welfare of our citizens, especially our most vulnerable.”
“We are frustrated and disappointed, and we are here to demand change,” Brown said. “The Iowa congressional delegation and other elected leaders in Washington — this is your moral test, and you are currently failing. You are fighting over budget lines and political talking points while children are going to bed, worried about whether where their next meal is going to come from. You are treating the future of our children as a bargaining chip in a game of partisan politics.”
U.S. Sens. Klobuchar, Baldwin join Iowans to call for extended ACA tax credits

Members of Iowa’s all Republican federal delegation have supported measures to provide funding for SNAP if the shutdown continues. U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks introduced a bill Friday to let the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture access emergency funds to maintain SNAP operations during the shutdown.
On Monday, U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn toured the Food Bank of Iowa and called for Democrats to support the continuing resolution passed in the House — a short-term funding bill that does not include Democrats’ language on extending Affordable Care Act tax credits — in order to prevent SNAP benefits from being halted.
“This shutdown is threatening food on the table for hundreds of thousands of Iowa families—many of them kids, new moms, and seniors,” Nunn said in a statement. “We cannot expect Iowa food banks and families to pay for Washington’s dysfunction. I’m calling on Senate Democrats to set partisanship aside and pass our clean continuing resolution before we reach the funding cliff.”
But Democrats have criticized House Republicans for refusing to negotiate on the ACA enhanced tax credits and other issues. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart criticized Iowa’s GOP House delegation for not working to reconvene and negotiate a deal with Democrats to reopen the government.
“The USDA has the money to feed hungry Iowans in November, but the Trump administration is refusing to release these funds,” Hart said in a statement. “Instead of working to ensure veterans, mothers, and children can access the food they need, Republicans are using people’s lives as leverage to continue playing political games. Iowa families should not have to worry about putting food on the table because of Washington gridlock. It’s time for Republicans to do their job and put people before politics.”

Andy Beshear, a Democrat, has long supported implementing universal pre-K statewide.(Alabama Reflector photo by Stew Milne)A committee established by Gov. Andy Beshear, tasked with researching universal preschool, says Kentucky should expand access to pre-K. 
In June, Beshear signed an executive order establishing the Pre-K for All Advisory Committee to explore support for universal pre-kindergarten programs in Kentucky. 
Sam Flynn, the executive director for the Team Kentucky Pre-K for All Program, said Thursday that the group found, over the course of four months of meetings and town halls, that Kentucky’s children are not ready for kindergarten and about 27% of children in the state have access to pre-K. 
Early learning sets kids on life trajectory, Kentuckians hear, as Beshear keeps pushing for pre-K

The committee presented Beshear with a report on their findings. They also shared details from the report during Beshear’s weekly press conference Thursday. 
According to the report:  

Kentucky’s early care system is fragmented, offering early care and education through a patchwork approach of programs with inconsistent eligibility rules, funding sources, affordability and access. 
Kentucky’s existing system is inadequate. Childcare is often unaffordable and inaccessible, leaving parents forced out of the workforce and children not ready for school. 
Several states have successfully expanded access to preschool for all four year olds. 
Successful pre-k programs focus on quality,  offer flexible, mixed delivery of services and use strong data systems. 

“We believe that these findings can provide us not only a clear view of the challenges we face, but a direction and a path forward,” said Felicia Cumings Smith, board chair of the Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence and a committee member. “Based on these findings, this committee has issued recommendations charting a path forward for the governor, the General Assembly and all Kentuckians.” 
Based on the findings, the committee made these reccomendations:

Kentucky should expand its existing voluntary state funded public preschool program responsibly, in phases, over several years.
Expansion should ensure local flexibility on when and how expansion will occur, with decisions being made at the local level with support from the Kentucky Department of Education. 
Kentucky should provide services through mixed, integrated school district -led partnerships with Head Start, private regulated child care and community based providers. 
Expansion should prioritize quality. 
The General Assembly should authorize the Kentucky Department of Education to establish administrative regulations with the focus on district local flexibilities for things like facilities, transportation and educator requirements. 
Kentucky should track success through a unified data collection system. 

“I know how education positively impacts the lives of our people,” said Carrie Ballinger, superintendent of Rockcastle County Schools. “I see it every single day. Getting kids a stronger start is crucial to their development and to their long term academic success.” 
Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman said pre-K “isn’t political” but “the right thing to do.” 
“It is clear that Kentucky needs pre-K for all,” Coleman said. “It will expand access to childcare and learning. It will give parents and caregivers options and help them to save money. It’ll create jobs and boost our workforce, and we’re getting right to work to get this done for Kentucky, for our families, our businesses and for our future.” 
Beshear, a Democrat, has long supported implementing universal pre-K statewide. He called on Republicans in the state legislature’s supermajority to fund such initiatives in his State of the Commonwealth Address earlier this year. However, top Republicans said then that their caucuses did not have a consensus on the matter.

(Getty Images)Starting Jan. 1, individuals carrying health insurance through Highmark BlueCross BlueShield will no longer be covered for any services rendered through the Kanawha County Emergency Ambulance Authority, according to a news release from the authority.
Per the release, the Kanawha ambulance authority is canceling its contract with Highmark after the ambulatory service and insurance agency failed to agree on a new contract that would have seen Highmark “adequately reimburse” KCEAA for its services.
No one will be turned away for service, the release read, but some people who were previously covered will soon be considered uninsured and will be on the hook to pay the full, out of pocket costs of the services rendered.
Highmark BlueCross BlueShield serves about 250,000 people in West Virginia and holds the largest share of the commercial insurance market in the state. 
Cathy McAlister, the director of corporate communications at Highmark BlueCross BlueShield West Virginia said Thursday that the insurance provider follows standards set by the federal Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services and pays those same rates.
“We provided Kanawha County Emergency Ambulance Authority data that showed that our reimbursement was aligned with the industry and agreed to some select increases,” McAlister said in an emailed statement. “It was Kanawha County Emergency Ambulance Authority that terminated their agreement with us, per their contact rights. We regret their decision and recognize the challenges faced by EMS providers but believe the issue cannot be resolved by commercially insured individuals alone.”
Tom Susman, a spokesman for Kanawha County Emergency Ambulance Authority, said the ambulance authority isn’t asking Highmark to solve all of those challenges, however.“We’re just asking them to pay their fair share and not have the other folks in Kanawha County pick up their tab,” Susman said. “That’s all this is.”
According to the release from the ambulance authority, Highmark agreed in negotiations to increase payments by “a small amount.” That amount, however, was “not enough” for the ambulance authority to sustain its services.
Susman said most of the people who will be impacted by the contract termination are ones who receive Highmark BlueCross BlueShield coverage individually or commercially through their employers.
If those individuals are treated or transported by KCEAA starting on Jan. 1, they will be charged the full cost of providing EMS services without any insurance coverage or discount.
People who are covered by Medicare or Medicare Advantage plans through Highmark should still receive the insured discount for emergency transportations due to federal regulations that require a certain amount of coverage — and reimbursement — for Medicare beneficiaries, Susman said. Non-emergency services, however, may not be covered at the same level.
Susman said that the ambulance service is “just trying to be paid fairly.” 
“Something has got to give. We’re not asking for a horrible amount of money here; we’re asking for enough to keep us afloat and for what is fair for the services we’re providing,” Susman said. “We as a service provider don’t have the luxury of saying no [to patients], and of course we wouldn’t turn anyone down because of their insurance — but these services do cost money and we want what we’re owed.”
Susman said about 75% of revenue for Kanawha’s ambulance authority comes from reimbursements after treating patients covered by the Public Employees Insurance Agency, Medicare and Medicaid. 
Highmark, he continued, paid less in reimbursement rates than PEIA. 
“We are sorry that Highmark BlueCross BlueShield doesn’t see the need to support KCEAA’s services adequately,” said Monica Mason, executive director of KCEAA, in the news release. “This is not something we want to do. Unfortunately, KCEAA is fighting a deficit and must require all insurers to pay their fair share for its services.”
KCEAA said in its release that it “remains hopeful” that a better contract can be negotiated with Highmark over the next 60 days. The current contract requires a 30-day notice for cancellation. By giving the 60 days, Susman said older people looking at Medicare Advantage plans and companies deciding health insurance for their employees will have enough time to consider other options since KCEAA will no longer be an in-network provider.
Chris Hall, the executive director of the West Virginia EMS Coalition, said the pressure building at KCEAA is similar to that for ambulance providers throughout the state, and “inadequate” reimbursement rates are a large part of the issue.
If EMS agencies receive low reimbursement rates, the remaining cost for services — up to almost $500 per an ambulance call, Hall said — are passed on to taxpayers. 
“EMS relies solely on patient care revenue and taxpayer support to fund its operations. Insurance reimbursements typically fall drastically short of covering the actual costs. And like a hospital emergency room, EMS is obligated to provide care regardless of a patient’s insurance status,” Hall said in an emailed statement. “If EMS agencies are underpaid, taxpayers bear the cost or emergency services become less available, which strains local budgets and jeopardizes care quality and access.”
Mason, in the news release, said that an increase in reimbursements is necessary to keep ambulance services operating in Kanawha County.
“In the past five years, more than 30 EMS providers across West Virginia have disbanded partly because some insurers have not paid them sufficiently to support their services,” Mason said. “We cannot let that happen to KCEAA.”

Shots were fired Saturday at the front of the regional prison in Mayersville. At least one shot hit a window as visitors, inmates and staff were inside, according to a Wednesday statement from the Issaquena County Sheriff’s Department. 
Prison Warden Don Brown issued a memo Sunday to all held at the facility: Due to the recent shooting, visitation would be suspended until further notice “for the safety of the visitors, the inmates and staff.”
Sheriff Waye Windham was not immediately available for comment Thursday to offer details about the shooting. Information about identification of those involved in the shooting and whether any charges have been filed was not immediately known. 
A correctional facility staff member reached Thursday declined to say whether visitation is still suspended or if the facility is in a lockdown. 
The sheriff’s office contacted the Mississippi Department of Corrections, the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and the Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics to assist with the investigation. 
Spokespeople from MDOC and the Department of Public Safety referred questions to the sheriff’s office.

Vermont, the first state in the country to legalize civil unions, has a storied history supporting LGBTQ rights. Last week, a crowd gathered to hear speakers illuminate historical figures who championed the cause, and hear about a gathering place that served as a safe haven for the LGBTQ+ community.
The Andrews Inn, run as a restaurant, inn, gay bar and disco club from the 1973 to 1984 at the heart of downtown Bellows Falls, was a magnet for people from all corners of the East Coast and southern Canada. But the inn, which served as a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community in Bellows Falls for a decade, is largely unknown in the collective imagination of Vermont today, said Andrew Ingall.
Ingall is a scholar and performer who organized a series of talks this fall, sponsored by the Vermont Humanities 2025 Fall Festival “Resilient Patterns,” on his family history, Andrews Inn and legacy of LGBTQ+ caregiving in the state.
Around 45 people poured into the Rockingham Free Public Library in Bellows Falls on Oct. 25 to learn about and remember the stories of older LGBTQ+ adults and ancestors in Vermont’s history.
Thom Herman, one of the former innkeepers and owners, said the gathering was a cathartic experience, remembering the many joyful and meaningful experiences at the inn such as the Yellow Rose Ball, which was held in honor of a local high school girl who died. 
“When I left April Fool’s Day, 1984 and closed the inn, I left with a lot of trauma,” Herman said. “I never would have imagined that 40 years later, people would be celebrating and giving me a chance to heal and appreciate some of the wonderful things, friendships that still are happening to this day.”
As much as Andrews Inn was a LGBTQ+ community hub, it also drew detractors and homophobic attacks from the local community. The tension heightened after a male prostitution sting operation played out at the inn in 1983, said Gail Golec, a historian and member of the Bellows Falls Pride group.

The news tarnished the Andrews Inn’s reputation and economic viability, even though the inn’s owners did not know about the activities, the subjects of the raid had never visited the inn prior, and all charges were eventually dropped, Golec said. The building shuttered a year later. 
Golec has produced a podcast series and is working on an upcoming documentary on the Andrews Inn. She said she was intrigued by the Andrews Inn’s setting in a rural, economically disadvantaged Vermont community amid the AIDS crisis and growing LGBTQ+ rights movement. 
“I think it’s a fascinating history of the inn, but it’s also the wider story is about how people take care of each other,” Golec said. “It’s about how everybody looked after each other and how people found family and found community.”
Jeremy Youst, Herman’s partner and the other former inn owner, said opening the inn in Bellows Falls was “nourishing.” He told the crowd creating spaces for community connection helps remind people “we’re a part of something bigger than ourselves.”

Tracing his own family tree, Ingall found that his father’s cousin, Léon Ingall, settled not far from Bellows Falls in Townshend in 1980 with lifelong partner Warren Kronemeyer. The couple opened an European antique shop called Warlé, which is the namesake of his research, the “Warlé” project.
Ingall said Léon was a fashion designer who escaped Nazi Germany, and enlisted in the U.S. Army. During his service in World War II, Ingall said Léon met Warren, who worked as a journalist in France. The couple opened an interior decor shop in New York City before moving to Vermont, Ingall said.
Later in life, Ingall said Warren and Léon’s property has been transformed into an affordable senior living community called Valley Village. The center is LGBTQ+ affirming and inclusive, Ingall said, and a “beautiful legacy” of his ancestor and partner.
Ingall also discussed research into a couple named Charity and Sylvia, who were considered a married couple in Weybridge under the term “help-meet” in the 19th century, long before civil unions or gay marriages were legal in the state. In the Shaker tradition, Charity and Sylvia used an adult-sized “granny cradle” to rock their partners during illness, a profound symbol of LGBTQ+ caregiving, Ingall said.

An upcoming event on Nov. 8 in Middlebury will highlight the research on Charity and Sylvia, along with bringing the story of Warren, Léon and the Andrews Inn to life. The event will bring together speakers from the Henry Sheldon Museum of Vermont and performer Maestro Clemmons, best known for his role in the PBS television show “Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood.” Ingall said he hopes to again weave together these stories to help foster social connection and appreciation of older LGBTQ+ adults and ancestors. 
Community hubs and spaces like the Andrews Inn serving the LGBTQ+ community in rural Vermont are even more needed today after the loneliness epidemic was declared a public health crisis by the U.S. surgeon general in 2023, Ingall said.
Ingall noted there are higher rates of economic insecurity, food insecurity, anxiety, depression and social isolation for older LGBTQ+ adults, and he hopes the discussion will spark ideas of what community care could look like in the future. 
“I also see the theme of care and caregiving as a common thread between Warren and Léon, Thom and Jeremy and Charity and Sylvia,” Ingall said. “These LGBTQ+ folks made their mark in Vermont history, but there are so many others upon whose shoulders we stand, those who aren’t as well known or haven’t yet been discovered.”

(Photo by Ryan Berry/Washington State Standard)Prosecutors allege a Washington state man repeatedly posted “veiled death threats” to Gov. Bob Ferguson on social media, including pictures of the front door of the governor’s home. 
Casey Cutter Patterson, 34, is also accused of posting a picture of an AR-15 in August and referring to Ferguson’s security detail. A search warrant revealed he’d requested public records about the “personal security detail” of Ferguson’s predecessor, former Gov. Jay Inslee. 
Patterson is charged with making “threats against governor or family” as well as intimidating a public servant. Both are felony charges. He remained in county jail Thursday.
At his arraignment Tuesday, he pleaded not guilty. 
Pierce County Superior Court Commissioner Barbara McInvaille set bail for Patterson at $200,000. McInvaille also issued a no-contact order barring Patterson from trying to communicate with Ferguson for 10 years.
The charges come amid increasing concerns over the safety of elected officials and political figures, after the killings this year of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk and Minnesota state House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband. 
On Oct. 5, a man reportedly dealing with mental health issues broke into the state Capitol and committed vandalism inside, according to charges. No one was injured.
Washington State Patrol Chief John Batiste said this month that a staffer at the Washington State Fusion Center had been tasked with focusing on potential threats to Washington state lawmakers.
Patterson, of Lakewood, started replying to Ferguson’s social media posts when Ferguson was state attorney general, according to criminal charges filed this month in Pierce County Superior Court.
In one response, Patterson reportedly told the Democrat, who was running for governor at the time, that he was “coming for your lunch money” and “I’m going to make you cry.” 
At first, the defendant’s posts appeared to be protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, according to charging papers. They were more like those of an upset constituent.
But his rhetoric escalated, prosecutors allege.
In March 2024, Patterson told Ferguson on social media, “You’re a criminal, and we’re going to treat you like one,” with a picture of the front door to the now-governor’s home, according to the charges. 
At first, Washington State Patrol investigators couldn’t tell if Patterson took the photo or obtained it by other means. However, they later determined the suspect had taken the photo himself.
A state patrol lieutenant called Patterson to tell him the posts with Ferguson’s front door were concerning to authorities and the then-attorney general. 
“Mr. Ferguson does not want to be contacted, follow, tracked, or monitored in his personal life,” the lieutenant reportedly told Patterson. 
Patterson was agreeable, telling the lieutenant he didn’t threaten Ferguson, according to court papers. 
After that call, Patterson stopped replying to Ferguson’s posts for months. Though he resumed in late November 2024, after Ferguson had been elected governor, the charges say.
In response to an X post about the governor-elect, Patterson wrote, “I know he’s worried about his address, which is public information. He had WSP contact me for tweeting a picture of his front door. I’m going to keep tweeting it,” according to the charges.
“Bob Ferguson might have me blocked from both of his accounts on here, but I hope he sees this,” Patterson reportedly posted two days later, with pictures of Ferguson’s door and his address taken from public records filed with the state Public Disclosure Commission.
Over the next couple months, Patterson posted the pictures multiple times, prosecutors allege. 
Once Ferguson took office in January, he got a new official X account, where Patterson wasn’t blocked. So the suspect began replying to Ferguson’s posts again, according to court documents. 
“I’m going to throw out a hypothetical,” Patterson reportedly responded in one example. “If the people of Washington came to collect for the crimes you’ve committed, how confident are you with your Personal Security Detail?”
For months, he posted veiled threats to Ferguson, the charges say. In August, for example, the defendant wrote to the governor on X that he was “going to bully the [expletive] out of you, and I know where you live.”
The posts started mentioning guns in October, according to the charges. In one case, he wrote, “we have more guns than you, and we know where you live. [Expletive] around and find out.” 
In another he says “we have more guns than you and your [Washington State Patrol security detail], and we know where you live.”

“Patterson’s posts have escalated over time and show that he has made substantial steps toward threatening behavior,” a Washington State Patrol detective wrote in a police report. “Based on the totality of the evidence, Patterson’s repeated posts, imagery, and statements directed at Governor Ferguson appear to constitute a credible threat intended to cause fear and potential harm.”
On Monday, authorities arrested Patterson via warrant because they feared he would turn to violence if issued a court summons to appear in his criminal case.
A LinkedIn profile that matches Patterson’s name and photo on X indicates he is a former hospital corpsman with the U.S. Navy and has worked in security since 2019.

(Photo by Patrick Coolican/Minnesota Reformer)Halloween has become a tale of two traditions: The classic, house-to-house trick-or-treating, and the modern, centralized trunk-or-treat event, where families gather in parking lots to collect candy from decorated cars. 
While both are enjoyable, just one truly serves a vital civic purpose: building the social connections our communities increasingly lack.
Trunk-or-treat events offer undeniable benefits, especially in rural Minnesota communities where homes are far apart. These events provide a safe, efficient and inclusive venue for every child to participate. Furthermore, they are excellent outreach opportunities for businesses, churches and civic groups to engage with families and promote their organizations.
When trunk-or-treating supplants traditional neighborhood trick-or-treating, however, we sacrifice something invaluable.
The power of the porch light and the calendar
Traditional trick-or-treating is not just about candy — it is a community ritual disguised as a holiday. For one evening a year, it forces us out of our isolated homes and onto the sidewalk, creating a casual, low-pressure setting for residents to meet.
Trick-or-treating builds trust. Walking up to a neighbor’s door and being greeted warmly, even briefly, breaks down the invisible barriers we often erect. It humanizes the people living next door and chips away at the pervasive, unproven myth that our neighbors are a threat.
Trick-or-treating also fosters social cohesion: These small interactions are the building blocks of a resilient community. They establish the “eyes on the street” that increase a neighborhood’s collective sense of safety long after the jack-o’-lanterns are put away.
Crucially, trunk-or-treats often occur on a weekend afternoon or a different day altogether, a schedule designed for convenience. 
But the magic of building community in cities and towns is tied to October 31st. When community organizations or cities attempt to shift the focus away from the actual holiday — or when neighboring municipalities establish differing “official” times — it fragments the very ritual that’s meant to unify. 
The tradition thrives when we collectively agree that Halloween night belongs to the neighborhoods in large cities and the overall community of smaller cities and towns, typically during the informal but widely accepted hours at dusk and after.
A community-focused compromise
We can address modern safety concerns without abandoning the neighborhood. Instead of viewing these two traditions as an “either/or” choice, we should explore a “both/and” approach.
For neighborhoods grappling with concerns about darkness or porch access, consider a sidewalk table model. Neighbors can set up decorated tables or stations right on their lawn or sidewalk. This provides high visibility for candy distribution but, more importantly, it positions neighboring adults side-by-side on the curb. This creates a rare, welcome opportunity for people to socialize, chat and bond while the children are busy, further strengthening the immediate community.
The best Halloween celebrations are not necessarily the ones that are the fastest or the safest, but the ones that are the most authentic and connecting. 
Trunk-or-treats are a great option for organizations and families in the countryside, but they should be a supplement, not a replacement, for neighborhood life within the city limits on October 31st.
Ultimately, Halloween is one of the few traditions left that encourages us to open our doors and our hearts to the people who share our street.
 We must reassert that the true magic of the night happens on the sidewalk — where children build memories and neighbors build a community.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/halloween-pic.--1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-30 15:57:09.536853

Two groups who sued over congressional and legislative districts two years ago asked the federal judges to allow them to amend their complaints to include the new 1st District, whose boundaries legislative Republicans approved last week.
One group of plaintiffs includes Common Cause, the North Carolina NAACP, and individual voters. The other lawsuit was filed on behalf of nearly two dozen Black and Latino voters. 
Republicans redrew the district at the behest of President Donald Trump, who is seeking to maximize Republican U.S. House wins in the midterm election.
The previous version of the 1st District, drawn for the 2024 election, was already the subject of the consolidated lawsuits filed in 2023. Plaintiffs claimed that Republicans in the General Assembly approved legislative and congressional districts that diluted the power of Black voters. 
The three-judge panel heard arguments in the case last summer but has not issued an opinion. 
The latest 1st District boundaries, established last week, dismantle the Black Belt, counties in northeastern and eastern North Carolina with a bloc of Black voters. Those voters have helped elect Black members to Congress since 1992. 
The 1st District was the only competitive congressional district in the state last year. Incumbent Democratic Rep. Don Davis narrowly won a second term. 
The group of plaintiffs including Common Cause, the NC NAACP, and individual voters, says legislators made the district even worse in retaliation for opponents filing the lawsuit. 
The updated complaint filed by individual Black and Latino voters said Republicans in the legislature violated the Constitution and federal law in targeting Black voters.
Lawyers for Republican legislators said in a court filing this week that they did not oppose the plaintiffs amending their complaint.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_4636-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-30 15:57:09.536853

DemasMembers of the Michigan Senate on Thursday voted to advance a supplemental funding bill providing $71 million in state funds to support food assistance with federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, or SNAP, set to come to a halt on Saturday. 
Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service instructed state officials to pause SNAP benefits in November, citing a lapse in funding due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. 
Senate Bill 182, passed the chamber 27-4, with Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township), Sens. Jim Runestad (R-White Lake) Dan Lauwers (R-Brockway Township) and Joseph Bellino (R-Monroe) making up the “nay” votes. The bill would allocate $50 million to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services for emergency food assistance, alongside an addition $10 million for food bank grants and another $10 million for the Agricultural Surplus System Program, which the Food Bank Council of Michigan uses to purchase excess produce, protein and dairy from Michigan farmers. 
The bill also allocates $1 million to the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for the Double Up Food Bucks program, which matches EBT/Bridge Card or food stamp dollars spent on fruits and vegetables at participating stores, allowing recipients to access twice the amount of fresh fruits and vegetables. 
Michigan House Democrats put forth their own proposal to backfill SNAP Benefits earlier this week, proposing $600 million intended to cover two months of lost benefits. 
State steps up food bank stopgap funding 
While neither the Senate plan passed Thursday, nor the House Democrats’ plan outlined Wednesday, have much chance of being taken up in the GOP-led House, there was some funding put forward to plug the expected hole in the food assistance safety net.
Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s office announced that the state will provide $4.5 million to the Food Bank Council of Michigan to support food banks and pantries throughout the state. 
“Today, in light of the USDA’s decision to freeze SNAP, the State of Michigan is taking action to support the Food Bank Council of Michigan so they can continue feeding families in all 83 counties and deliver food to those who are unable to drive,” Whitmer said in a press release. “We take care of each other in Michigan, and we will continue bringing together public and private philanthropic resources to feed people as we hit day 30 of the federal government shutdown and approach the November 1 pause of SNAP.”
About 1.4 million Michigan residents use SNAP, according to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, and in Fiscal Year 2024, benefits averaged to $173 per recipient each month — meaning that total benefits would total over $240 million per month. 
“Because we did the right thing and kept state government on the job, we are now able to step up with this critical support for our local food banks, ensuring they have the resources they need to protect our communities and keep Michigan families strong,” Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) said in the press release. 
“But this will never be a long-term solution and state government can only make up so much of the federal government’s spending. Congress must follow our lead and keep more Michigan families from being hurt by this shutdown,” Hall added.
Whitmer also led a letter, sent early Thursday and signed by 21 other Democratic governors, calling on President Trump to release SNAP contingency funds.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)More than 100 congressional Democrats are pushing Attorney General Pamela Bondi to restore withheld funding and rescind new grant restrictions that have left providers of domestic violence services in New Jersey and beyond scrambling for support.
In a letter sent Thursday to Bondi and obtained by the New Jersey Monitor, the lawmakers said the Department of Justice’s actions have effectively halted access to Violence Against Women Act grants that nonprofits have relied on since 1994 to provide victims with counseling, legal advocacy, emergency and transitional housing, and more.
New Jersey providers have gotten no VAWA funding this year to support victims of domestic abuse, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking, despite getting $11.2 million last year and an average of $9.1 million in grants a year since 2020, according to federal data. The feds have distributed just $9 million of this funding to 29 grantees across the country so far this year, compared to $684 million to 880 grantees last year, federal data shows.
At the same time, domestic violence has risen in New Jersey in recent years, with police reporting nearly 71,000 incidents, including 57 fatalities, in 2023, according to the state police’s most recent domestic violence report.
“The lives, safety, and well-being of survivors across the country depend on swift and decisive action,” the House lawmakers wrote in Thursday’s letter.
Four members of New Jersey’s congressional delegation — Reps. Josh Gottheimer, LaMonica McIver, Nellie Pou, and Bonnie Watson Coleman, all Democrats — signed the letter.
The lawmakers’ letter comes a month after a coalition of states, including New Jersey, sued Bondi and the Justice Department over new restrictions that condition VAWA and other funding that support victims’ services on the ideological goals of President Donald Trump’s administration.
The restrictions are rooted primarily in two memos Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche issued in February and May ordering federal officials to eliminate diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility considerations from federal programs, policies, and funding, or face investigation and penalties under the federal False Claims Act.
Those memos and the “vague and burdensome” requirements they impose on nonprofits seeking grants undermine “both the letter and spirit of VAWA,” the lawmakers wrote. The Violence Against Women Act requires grant recipients to comply with antidiscrimination requirements.
“The threat of federal investigation or civil enforcement — especially for small, under-resourced nonprofits — poses an unacceptable barrier to accessing funds that Congress has explicitly appropriated to serve survivors of gender-based violence,” the lawmakers wrote.
The Congress members also are objecting to a Justice Department plan to reduce the Office on Violence Against Women’s budget by nearly 30% and merge it into the Office of Justice Programs, calling those moves “directly at odds with congressional intent.” In 2022, Congress reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act and strengthened the office’s statutory protections to prevent such consolidation, they wrote.
“The Department has a responsibility to uphold the commitments made by Congress under VAWA and to avoid placing critical support for survivors and their service providers at risk,” they wrote.
The letter comes six months after a bipartisan coalition of Congress members sent a similar plea when funding threats first emerged.

The Senate version of Trump’s budget reconciliation bill failed to garner enough votes to pass, resulting in a nearly month-long shutdown that began on October 1. At the crux of the bill’s failure – and the reason why the government hasn’t reopened – is whether to fund Biden-era health insurance subsidies included in the Inflation Reduction Act that are set to expire at the end of this year.
 


 
The subsidies lower monthly premiums for consumers who obtain coverage through private health insurance marketplaces that were created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2014. These subsidies were meant to help people who don’t qualify for Medicaid, are too young to receive Medicare, and whose employer doesn’t offer a private health insurance plan.
If the GOP slashes funding for these subsidies, enrollees will be forced to either pay for the entire premium out of pocket, if they can afford it, or abandon health insurance altogether. In rural Tyler County, West Virginia, for example, the average monthly premium will increase by $1,339 in 2026. In rural Pope County, Illinois, the average monthly premium will increase by $1,258.
More than 2.2 million rural Americans – and 13.8 million urban and suburban Americans – will see their health insurance premiums increase if the GOP wins negotiations during the government shutdown.
This data comes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS), which aggregates data at the state, county, and ZIP code levels. This dataset only includes the 31 states that use the federal Healthcare.gov health insurance marketplace to enroll consumers. The figures in this analysis are from the 2025 Open Enrollment Period (OEP), which ran from November 1, 2024, to January 15, 2025.
Originally, the health insurance subsidies were available to consumers with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL), roughly $32,000 to $128,000 for a family of four. But the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 expanded those subsidies to Americans living above 400% of the FPL, and the Inflation Reduction Act extended those subsidies until the end of 2025. Under the ACA, monthly premiums are capped based on income, with the federal government covering the remaining cost.
Compared to their urban counterparts, rural Americans are more likely to live in counties that will see the highest monthly health insurance premium spikes.
 


 
Nearly a quarter of rural Americans live in a county where the average premium increase will be between $659 and $1,339 per month. Only 2% of urban and suburban residents live in counties that will see this level of increase, meanwhile. On the other hand, 41% of metropolitan residents live in counties that will see the lowest increase in premiums – less than $509 per month. Only 18% of rural Americans live in counties in that category, however.
Rural West Virginia will see some of the highest premium spikes in the nation. All 35 of West Virginia’s nonmetropolitan, or rural, counties are in the fourth quartile of the highest premium spikes. In 33 of those 35 rural counties, the average premium increase will be more than $1,000 per month.
According to the Center on Budget and Policy, 15,000 West Virginians who have health insurance through the marketplace will lose health insurance altogether in 2026, if the current health insurance subsidies are not renewed.
Any increase in health insurance premiums is likely to result in loss of coverage for many Americans. One study found that, for every $40 increase in monthly premiums, there was a corresponding drop of one-fourth of the low-income enrollee population. Surveys find that cost is the main reason people don’t sign up for health insurance. According to the Congressional Budget Office, expiring subsidies will lead to 4.2 million enrollees losing health insurance by 2034. The end of these subsidies will hurt Americans across the board, regardless of whether they live in a rural or urban area.
Despite the partisan divide in Washington, funding for these subsidies has broad popular approval. A KFF Health News poll found that 78% of Americans believe that Congress should extend marketplace subsidies. In Florida, for example, conservatives have initiated a letter-writing campaign urging their legislators to extend health care subsidies.

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota is using $1.5 million in Department of Health and Human Services general fund money to address food insecurity across the state exacerbated by the federal government shutdown.
The agency has granted $915,000 to the Great Plains Food Bank, which Gov. Kelly Armstrong said has gone to purchase more than 450,000 pounds of food that will start being distributed to an estimated 24,000 households.
The assistance comes as the government shutdown is expected to interrupt November benefits to those enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP. About 57,000 North Dakotans received almost $10 million from SNAP in September.
Armstrong said the grant cannot make up for this funding, but is as much as the state can offer right now.
“It gets food to communities quickly to meet increased demand on food pantries until the federal government reopens and SNAP is restored,” Armstrong said at a Thursday press conference at the North Dakota Capitol in Bismarck.
North Dakota officials said last week the state is unable to fund SNAP directly because it cannot load money onto people’s electronic payment cards.
Armstrong said the Department of Health and Human Services gave $915,000 because it was the amount the nonprofit asked for.
The Great Plains Food Bank distributes food to almost 200 partner food pantries across the state.
“With distribution centers in Fargo and here in Bismarck, and a fleet of trucks that are on the road every day, we’re able to move food efficiently to our network operating in large cities, rural communities and our tribal nations,” said Great Plains Food Bank Interim CEO Kate Molbert.
The nonprofit sent out a plea for donations earlier this week due to the pause in federal services.
Armstrong on Thursday announced that the Department of Health and Human Services is also setting aside $600,000 to support the federal Women, Infants and Children Program, which helps feed low-income new mothers and young children.
The program was originally expected to run out of money Nov. 10. The additional money will keep it fully funded through November, said Interim Health and Human Services Commissioner Pat Traynor.
Local leaders rush to help, but can’t fill massive SNAP void

Families with young children who qualify for federal programs like SNAP, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Medicaid automatically qualify for the Women, Infants and Children Program, Traynor said.
There’s also a senior nutrition program for those age 60 or older, he added. There are no income requirements for that program.
For more information about food assistance, visit hhs.nd.gov or greatplainsfoodbank.org.
People can also call the Health and Human Services Department at 701-328-1000.
Armstrong said the state doesn’t know at this time whether the federal government will reimburse it for any of the money. 
He also said he’s not sure how the state will respond if the federal government is still shut down after November.
“We’re going to continue to hear where the needs are and see if there’s ways we can resource this,” he said. “But the answer is, we do not have unlimited funds in the state. We don’t have the infrastructure to replicate this stuff at the state level.”

(File photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)The builder of a 71-mile pipeline that will supply natural gas to a proposed power plant in South Carolina’s Lowcountry so far has 63 of the permission slips it needs from landowners to survey their property for the line’s potential route.
State-owned utility company Santee Cooper and Virginia-headquartered Dominion Energy contracted Kinder Morgan to build, own and operate the $431 million pipeline that will stretch from Screven County in Georgia, across Hampton and northern Colleton County in South Carolina, to the site of a former coal plant along the Edisto River near Canadys.
On that site the two power companies plan to build a 220-megawatt power plant, now estimated to cost $5 billion — up from $2.5 billion when the two began considering the project three years ago. It’s unclear why the estimate has doubled. As of Thursday afternoon, Santee Cooper had not yet responded to the SC Daily Gazette’s questions about cost, initially asked Wednesday.
At the beginning of the month, Kinder Morgan sent out letters to 185 potentially impacted property owners across 220 tracts that lie along the proposed route in South Carolina, seeking permission to enter and survey their land. Since then, the company also has held group meetings with the landowners in each of the two counties.
In addition to the owners of 63 tracts who have already said yes, 10 have said no, said Allen Fore, Kinder Morgan, vice president of public affairs.
The company plans to spend the next six to eight months contacting and asking permission of the rest, he told the SC Daily Gazette.
I’ve received a letter. Now what?
It’s up to landowners whether or not to allow Kinder Morgan to come on to their property.
The company wants to survey a path 300 feet wide but ultimately will only need a 50-foot-wide path. They will pay the landowner for the right to bury the pipeline on the decided route. That means signed contracts might not be needed for all of the surveyed tracts.

A large portion of the pipeline’s route also will run near existing power lines owned by Santee Cooper so as not to disturb more land and forest than necessary.
At this point in the process, it’s just about getting a look at the land. Surveyors won’t cut down any trees. They won’t dig up any ground. It’s not invasive, and the property owner can accompany the surveyors as they do their work, Fore said.
“We’re trying to find out if there’s anything out there that would be problematic for pipeline construction,” he said. “As you can imagine, we have 80,000 miles of pipe in 43 states and we have come across a lot of stuff, from dinosaur bones to pet cemeteries.”
Surveyors are looking for any environmental, ecological, archaeological, buildings or other existing structures, that may prove challenging to navigate or preclude the pipeline from coming through. They’re also there to hear what the landowner can tell them about the property.
On a project in Indiana, for example, Fore said a woman worried the pipeline would disturb the graves of her two beloved dogs. After learning this, Kinder Morgan moved the route by about 40 feet to the edge of her property.
What if I say no?
Kinder Morgan will follow its initial letter with phone calls and offers to meet in person with the pipeline executives.
Fore said he’s already made two of these visits in South Carolina to owners of two large tracts who had initially said “no” to the company.
After assuring one man he and his team weren’t bringing any survey equipment and had the authority to answer his questions, the group spent about 45 minutes walking around the property with the landowner.
The man, it turned out, was not opposed to the pipeline itself. But between the position of the man’s home, trees and ponds on the property, it became clear the land’s layout isn’t appropriate for pipeline construction.
“But it was important to get on the property and talk to the landowner, and it’s very likely we’re not going (to build) on that property at all,” Fore said.
As for the second landowner, when the team arrived, the man told them he thought he had a different way than what the company had originally planned.
“We got in his truck and drove around the property, and what we couldn’t see from our aerial review was a series of roads on the property that he had built,” Fore said. “He suggested we move off of neighboring properties onto his because it would be a better route for us.”
As a result, Kinder Morgan may now remove those other landowners from the potential route.
“That’s the level of detail,” Fore said.
Kinder Morgan doesn’t just send a letter and then immediately turn to the courts to get access or control over people’s property, he said: “Far from it. We don’t do that.”
Under South Carolina state law, Kinder Morgan does have the ability to get a court order to gain access for a survey, but Fore said the company considers that “counterproductive.”
What approvals are needed?
After completing the surveys, Kinder Morgan plans to pre-file its application, complete with detailed drawings of the final route. with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission between April and June of next year.
At that time, the company will begin conducting engineering and environmental reviews and holding the public hearings that it needs as it prepares to make full-blown filings with state and federal regulators.
In addition to permission from the commission, they’ll need various approvals from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, state Department of Archives and History, and the state Department of Environmental Services.
The federal regulatory process governs much of this project because the pipeline crosses state lines. But a massive piece of energy legislation, which Gov. Henry McMaster signed into law in May, did put time limits on any state-level permits.

Under the law, a state agency presented with an application for an “energy infrastructure project,” which includes natural gas pipelines, has six months to review it and make a decision. If the agency doesn’t meet this timeline, the application is considered approved.
“People just need to be more vigilant and understand the timeframe for public comment is shorter than it was before,” said Jeff Tibbals, a Charleston real estate lawyer who specializes in utility-related land cases.
The environmental permitting process is how people fully understand the project’s impact on land and water resources, said Emily Wyche, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center.
The nonprofit is worried about the pipeline’s proximity to the 350,000-acre undeveloped estuary known as the ACE Basin.
Wyche contends the “more rushed process” for state permits will result in “less informed, thoughtful decision making on these permits that are ultimately going to impact people’s land and water.”
However, the entire route will also need federal approval, and the speed of state permits plays no role in the federal review and permitting process.
How much money will I receive?
When it begins to look as though state and federal regulators are ready to approve the route, that’s when Kinder Morgan will begin scheduling appraisals with impacted landowners about how much money the company is willing to offer, Fore said.
That process likely won’t start until late 2026.
SC utility, environmental groups reach deal on powerline upgrades through ancient cypress forest

Easements will give Kinder Morgan permanent access.
But landowners will still own and can use the land, with limitations. They can plant crops or bushes, but not large trees with deep roots, and they can’t build any kind of structure on it in case the company has to come back and dig up the pipe for maintenance.
Whatever the company pays for right of way will be a one-time payment that won’t transfer if the landowner sells. And having the easement there can impact the value of the property in a sale.
How much the company will offer is unknown. Amounts will depend on the land’s value and negotiations.
Tibbals, who has helped negotiate several high-profile deals for clients, said the appraisal must take into account the value of the land included in the easement as well as how the presence of the pipeline impacts the value of landowners’ remaining property.
He said it’s that second category he most often sees neglected in the initial offers from utility companies.
The pipeline’s proposed route goes through a dozen private properties protected by conservation easements — which keep out multi-home and commercial builders — according to a map provided by the Southern Environmental Law Center. That nonprofit, as well as the Conservation Voters of South Carolina, worry about the pipeline crossing what’s supposed to be forever protected.
Tibbals said such easements don’t stop pipeline construction, but the nonprofits that manage them must be part of the negotiating process. Because those easements protect the land from being subdivided and developed, it also means the land might be worth less and result in a lower offer from the pipeline company.
While land values have increased as South Carolina’s population has grown, appraisers also consider agricultural land lower in worth than property zoned for possible residential, commercial or industrial development, Tibbals said.
Once a company completes the appraisal and submits an offer to a landowner, that can start the clock on what Tibbals called a 30-day negotiating period.

Can I be forced to sign a deal?
Yes, South Carolina state law allows the builders of natural gas pipelines, as well as private water companies and corporate electric companies, to use what is known as condemnation to force a landowner to sign over access rights.
If a deal isn’t reached during the negotiating period, Tibbals said, a pipeline company can file a lawsuit. Once a company files that condemnation suit, landowners have 30 days to decide whether to challenge the company in court.
But, Tibbals said, if a project has government approvals, landowners usually don’t have a good claim for stopping it crossing their land.  If the property owner doesn’t challenge the project within those 30 days, the company can start construction.
“The only issue then is how much they get paid,” Tibbals said.
There is no time limit for filing a legal challenge to the amount the company offers, Tibbals said, as long as the landowner has not accepted payment.
Still, all of this is why Fore said Kinder Morgan wants to have conversations with landowners now, in an effort to avoid tracts owned by people vehemently opposed.
“Anytime you build, you want a mutually agreeable resolution to whatever it is,” he said. “The folks who genuinely, adamantly — there’s no configuration, no compensation, no construction modification, no route adjustment that can accommodate those folks — that’s not a good way to start a relationship.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gas-pipeline.jpg,,,2025-10-30 15:57:09.536853

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Colorado lawmakers approved $10 million to head towards the state’s food banks as federal food assistance benefits pause due to the government shutdown.
Democratic Gov. Jared Polis announced his request for the money last week. The funding, set in $3.3 million increments over six weeks from the state’s General Fund, will go to the food bank network Feeding Colorado through the Community Food Assistance Grant Program.
The Joint Budget Committee unanimously approved the request on Thursday morning.
“I’m certain that this is a hope shared by this committee, that the federal government will resolve and become the partner to us that it should be, and fund the programs that it is legally required to fund,” said Rep. Shannon Bird, a Westminster Democrat.

The approximately 600,000 low-income Coloradans who typically receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program money from the federal government will not get those benefits in November as the government shutdown persists. People use SNAP benefits to supplement their grocery budgets, and advocates predict that a pause in funding will push hungry people towards food banks for help. The average Colorado household that uses SNAP receives $367 per month, adding up to about $120 million in the state each month.
“It is a sandbag in a flood,” Tom Dermody, a policy analyst with the JBC, told lawmakers. “We don’t have the mechanism to actually step in and provide that (full) funding. We’re also in a budgetary circumstance where we don’t have the scale to actually address the SNAP emergency in any sort of truly meaningful way.”
The money from the state is intended to help Feeding Colorado purchase enough food to meet some of the needs, focusing on communities with high shares of SNAP recipients. Food banks have already started preparing for an influx of visitors starting this weekend.
Attorney General Phil Weiser joined a lawsuit against the Trump administration over the SNAP issue, arguing that federal contingency funds can be used to pay the roughly $8 billion for November benefits across the country.
Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Weld County Republican, questioned why Polis hadn’t declared an emergency on the issue, enabling him to use the state’s emergency disaster fund.
“It’s about the poor planning that’s taking place in this state. This is an emergency disaster and I don’t know why we wouldn’t declare that,” she said. “They could have put a process in place two weeks ago to try to identify how to work through this and make sure that people weren’t going without food.”
Democrats on the committee pushed back on that idea, saying it is risky to use emergency funds when there is a chance of other disasters affecting the state, such as floods, wildfires and other impacts from the federal shutdown.

(Provided by the shelter and Facebook)The Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter has been remediated following a state plan to deal with a drug incineration gone awry, but shelter staff aren’t working out of the facility and the long-term location of the facility is in flux.
On Oct. 24, the City of Billings issued a press release saying remediation had been completed following a Department of Environmental Quality-approved plan. That work plan also collects information like certifications and property details and identifies site considerations such as floor plans, ventilation, attics and crawl spaces, the DEQ said in a statement. The agency’s authority is specific to the air quality permit and incineration equipment and DEQ’s Air Quality Bureau is still investigating the incident, an agency spokesperson wrote in an email.
They’re waiting on a final clearance plan as well, she added.
“The final clearance plan will include instructions for collecting samples that will document that clean-up has met the decontamination standard,” agency spokesperson Madison McGeffers wrote in an email.
The shelter has not operated out of the building at 1735 Monad Road in Billings since the incident, a Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter spokesperson told the Daily Montanan.
Instead, they’ve been operating out of a warehouse and their other location on Grand Avenue.
To date, Billings has reimbursed the shelter $51,191.25 for initial cleaning by Newman Restoration and initial testing performed by Northern Industrial Hygiene, a city press release said. Additionally, the city paid a certified methamphetamine cleanup company $6,621 to clean the Animal Control Incinerator Room.
The city, though, said some beans remain uncounted.
“YVAS directly contracted Newman Restoration for cleaning of YVAS’s personal property but has not provided the City with a total cost estimate or scope of work related to this cleaning despite multiple requests,” a city press release stated.
The shelter said timing was the biggest factor.
“We needed items cleaned quickly so that we could get our temporary location set up. An itemized contents estimate would have taken a good amount of time when we needed items cleaned quickly and returned,” shelter spokesperson Izzy Zalenski said.. “One of our biggest concerns was getting out veterinary equipment out as soon as possible, not only did we have a Spay/Neuter clinic coming up that weekend, but we also have medical cases come in almost daily, so we needed to be able to serve those animals.”
There is also a question about smoke damage in the HVAC system at the facility. Northern Industrial Hygiene’s cleanup recommended, “cleaning of the entire structure and HVAC system for potential smoke damage,” the city press release said, but that “NIH acknowledged to the City that this recommendation was based largely on statements made by YVAS personnel, and not on testing or direct observation.”
The release said Billings is obtaining independent estimates for more testing to see if there’s smoke damage and “whether any additional cleaning is necessary before committing further taxpayer resources.”
The DEQ said it’s hard to tell the level of contamination.
“It is difficult to quantify or compare the severity of exposure from individual-to-individual,” McGeffers wrote in an email. “Since methamphetamine is a powerful, highly addictive stimulant that affects the central nervous system and can be inhaled or absorbed through direct skin contact, all contaminated properties are a concern for human health and must be mitigated with care.”
She added, “Our test results are specific to surface residue. There were surface residue test results that were above the health-based standard.”
Yellowstone Valley Animal Shelter does not plan to return to the Monad Road location, the organization said in a statement last week. The Billings press release said that if the shelter does return to the location, they’d “commit to discontinuing the use of the incinerator for drug disposal.”
The city is also waiting to hear back from the state’s Attorney General’s Office on the agreement that allowed drugs to be burnt in the first place.
“The City is awaiting feedback from the Montana Attorney General’s Office regarding updates to the MOU previously used for drug disposal by law enforcement agencies statewide,” the city press release said.
It’s unclear how long drugs have been incinerated at the facility.
“I don’t have an actual date,” city administrator Chris Kukulski wrote in an email. “The facility was built in the early 2000s. We are aware that it was being used to incinerate drugs since at least 2007.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shelter-pup.jpg,,,2025-10-30 15:57:09.536853

(Photo: Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department)The executive director of a Las Vegas animal rescue organization that raised money to treat Reba, the bulldog who died after being abandoned in a plastic tote, has used proceeds from the nonprofit organization to pay herself an unapproved salary and for personal expenses, such as  streaming service subscriptions and vacation expenses, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday, 
The lawsuit comes as rescues in Southern Nevada pick up the slack for government shelters, which are overcrowded and historically underfunded.  Advocates fear the allegations in the lawsuit could raise concerns about the integrity of non-profit rescues as they seek public money to help cover their costs. 
The suit, filed by the board of directors of Vegas Pet Rescue Project, alleges Jamie Gregory, the organization’s founder, president, as well as executive director, altered the organization’s bylaws after she and board members received an anonymous email alleging misuse of funds by Gregory. 
“While the organization has no doubt played a role in supporting animals and serving the community, such positive contributions do not exempt it from legal obligations,” says the anonymous email, which was provided to the Current. 
Bylaws provided by Gregory to the Current and sent to board members for authentication, differed from those provided to the board by Gregory. In text messages included in the lawsuit, Gregory admits to board colleagues that she altered the bylaws to guard against losing her unapproved salary or being terminated by the board.  
“I did edit things concerning voting the director out of position,” Gregory wrote in the text, adding she felt “pushback” from the board “regarding my position and the fact that I have a salary and that it wasn’t voted on. … The idea of not being involved in the rescue I founded terrifies me.” 
On Wednesday, Gregory said that she will be “responding through legal counsel and vehemently deny the claims.” She declined to say more. 
Last month, Gregory told the Current she earns $74,000 a year in salary. Bylaws she provided indicate the executive director is to earn $20 an hour for 30 hours a week, which would total $31,200 annually. 
VPRP’s tax returns from 2018 through 2023, the last year on file, report no income for Gregory. 
The lawsuit alleges in 2024 Gregory paid herself $86,896 in compensation, and just under $69,000 through September of this year, and used rescue funds to pay $5,444 in personal expenses this year, and $5,337 last year. 
“These personal expenses included: personal cell phone, subscriptions to Amazon
Prime Video, Amazon Music, and Amazon Digital, Defendant’s Ring doorbell subscription, food for Defendant’s personal pets, personal trips (car rental and gas), as well as charges for food and gas while Defendant was on vacation at Disney World in Orlando, Florida,” the lawsuit says. 
The rescue operated at a loss of $61,418 in 2022 and $61,463 in 2023, according to tax returns. 
‘A difficult decision’
“It’s important to emphasize the reason why rescues are created: to help animals. They are not meant to become personal piggy banks,” Annoula Wylderich, founder and director of Animal Protection Affiliates, said via email,  “Those who view their rescue as a means for personal gain are not in it for the right reasons and shouldn’t be.”
The rescue’s “mission has been compromised by the Defendant, who is currently holding hostage the organization and exposing it to the loss of its tax exempt and nonprofit status,” the lawsuit says, adding the board of directors “were forced to make a very difficult decision and authorize this action to preserve and safeguard VPRP.”
In a statement Thursday, the board, all of whom are volunteers, said it “acted swiftly and responsibly to address the situation in order to protect the animals. Moving forward, we are dedicated to ensuring that 100% of all funds are directed toward the care of the animals, just as it was always intended.” 
“Rescues that do not operate with transparency and accountability are not only placing their own organization and officers at risk (legally and otherwise), they are betraying the animals and donors and hurting those charities that DO operate ethically,” said Wylderich, who credited the VPRP board for their efforts. “They set a great example of what a good, trustworthy nonprofit board looks like.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rebafrommetro-1024x567.png,,,2025-10-30 15:57:09.536853

Tea Republican Sen. Ernie Otten said the committee was “being slighted” by Johnson’s failure to appear, adding that lawmakers need to hear “the other side” of allegations against Johnson’s office.
Members of the South Dakota Canvassing Group, which advocates for removing tabulation machines from elections and replacing them with hand counting, allege that the Secretary of State’s Office allowed an election systems vendor to provide uncertified laptops to some counties for election use, and used some funds inappropriately to update the state’s voter registration and election night reporting system. The group is also concerned about a vendor connected to a multi-state voter registration system that has come under scrutiny for privacy and security concerns.
Some of those concerns were raised by members of South Dakota Canvassing at the committee’s May meeting, but lawmakers chose to have Johnson return at a later meeting to answer questions posed to her.

(Photo: Melissa Sue Gerrits / Carolina Public Press)In 2014, the North Carolina General Assembly commissioned a report that came to a stark conclusion: the state should discontinue the use of its economic distress tiers. The tiers fail to accurately capture economic distress, the report said. The system isn’t working for struggling communities.
A decade later, the system has only become more entrenched, influencing an unknown number of state programs, both economic and not.
North Carolina is the only state in the country with a three-tiered economic distress ranking — and certainly the only one where such ranking bears this amount of influence. Could there be a better way to distribute state funding and lift up the state’s most disadvantaged communities?
“There have been many attempts to tinker with the system,” N.C. Rural Center CEO Patrick Woodie told Carolina Public Press.
“It has remained basically intact, mainly because we haven’t found a viable alternative. There’s a lot of lawmakers that would like to see improvement, but can’t find a consensus or a path forward.”
In 2024, a bipartisan bill that would have directed the N.C. Collaboratory at UNC-Chapel Hill to study potential changes to the economic distress tier system on behalf of the legislature did not become law.
This year, the N.C. Department of Commerce conducted listening sessions in cities across the state to hear residents’ concerns and ideas about the state’s economic development strategy.

The conclusions drawn from those conversations will help inform the Comprehensive Strategic Economic Development Plan for 2026 through 2030. Whether that plan will attempt to address the shortcomings of the tier system remains to be seen.
This is the third article in Trapped By Tiers, a three-part Carolina Public Press investigative series examining North Carolina’s economic distress tiers, a system intended to promote economic mobility across the state. CPP analyzed state data and found that this system is ineffective, stagnant, and at times, counterproductive.
The first article examined the ways in which this system fails counties across the economic spectrum. The second focused on where North Carolina went wrong. This third and final installment explores ways to improve the system, as well as possible alternatives.
Speaking up about pockets of economic distress
Karen Howard of Chatham County has a plan.
As a commissioner, she has seen how the county’s persistent Tier 3 status has left less fortunate parts of her county in the dust — towns like Siler City and Goldston. Because they are located in Chatham County, those communities do not get the special treatment that struggling communities in Tier 1 and 2 counties do. The situation in economically distressed communities within counties are concealed within an overall countywide picture of economic success.

“There needs to be more vision in the planning for how these tiers affect communities,” Howard said. “Not just counties, but communities. We could come up with workable solutions that allow for some nuance and for the possibility of a wealthy town very close to a poor town.”
Even in her frustration, Howard sees a path forward.
“Counties that have this challenge have the opportunity to form some sort of coalition,” she said.
“We need to work on the solution and present it to our legislators as a nonpartisan or bipartisan endeavor to address the very real challenge. Counties across the state span these deep pockets of wealth and then deep pockets of poverty. We could come up with and collaboratively design a workable solution that could be presented to the state.
“We can’t just show up and say you need to do better. There really needs to be some sort of a broad collaborative effort to draft this solution and present it to our legislators as a cohort, and I think we have a much better chance of success.”
The legislature
For Rep. Dante Pittman, D-Wilson, Nash, protecting disadvantaged counties like those he represents is of the utmost priority. Wilson and Nash are both persistent Tier 1 of economic distress counties. Pittman appreciates the way that the system recognizes and singles out the struggles of his constituents. If the system were to change, he wouldn’t want that special spotlight to shift.
“My primary focus is making sure that any changes to this system protect rural counties that don’t have the same level of resources,” Rep. Pittman told CPP.
Past changes to the system have been colored by specific legislators’ motivations, rather than a genuine attempt to improve the system for all counties, said Rep. Brian Turner, D-Buncombe. Rep. Turner believes the economic distress tiers system is outdated, overly applied, and fails to serve its original purpose.
“The system is overly simplistic, and just really needs to be updated and more sophisticated,” he said. “It needs to be done independent of manipulation and influence of the legislature. We need a revised system, and we need a consultancy to help us create one. Because I don’t think that the expertise exists within the legislature to do this without people putting their thumbs on the scale.”

Meanwhile, some legislators don’t even know about the system.
Rep. Garland Pierce, a Democrat who serves Hoke and Scotland counties, is one of these legislators. Both of his counties are persistent Tier 1 counties, but he told CPP that he did not know there was any system in place to benefit them. 
What do other states do?
One place to start that work is looking at what other states do.
Georgia’s system of four economic tiers builds in flexibility and allows for sub-county targeting. If a county experiences sudden economic distress — say from a hurricane or a factory closure — state officials can choose to move that county into a different tier, opening it up to enhanced state assistance. In addition, special zones like Less Developed Census Tracts and Georgia Opportunity Zones allow for pockets of poverty in otherwise affluent regions to get recognition.
Plus, Georgia’s tiers are used for just one thing: a job creation tax credit program.
Rep. Turner thinks state programs other than economic development should have to apply to use the tier system in their decision making programs, rather than just implementing it with impunity.
In Tennessee, counties are ranked in a system of five tiers that measures economic performance against a national standard.
This is closer to what Carolyn Fryberger, co-author of the UNC School of Government study on distress tiers, thinks could work.
“Let’s find a real benchmark of well-being and then measure ourselves against that,” she said.
Getting rid of the pre-set numbers of counties in each economic distress category would be a major improvement to the system, said Josh Carpenter, director of economic development group Mountain West Partnership. There isn’t always going to be exactly 40 distressed counties, 40 medium counties and 20 non-distressed counties, he pointed out.

At the national level, Federal Opportunity Zones use census tracts rather than county lines. This allows for a more granular look at geographic disparities. Both Maryland and Virginia identify specific Enterprise Zones that target specific areas within and across counties borders.
Many in North Carolina think this kind of specificity would help the system.
“We have proposed that tier designations should be assigned based on zip code, which is more reflective of the specific area,” Iredell County manager Beth Milton told CPP.
“Unfortunately, we have received little support from our legislature to make this modification.”
North Carolina’s county-by-county economic distress system catches a lot of flack for being too broad. But in some cases, the county-level is actually too narrow. The regional clustering of persistent Tier 1 counties in Eastern North Carolina, for example, is not addressed by the system.
Colorado’s Enterprise Zones, in contrast, span multi-county regions, allowing for regional cooperation.
“Regions are so much stronger when they work together,” Fryberger said. “The tiers just further cement county-to-county competition and ranking.”
Finding solutions to economic distress
Some agree with the 2014 report from the legislature: the tier system should just be thrown out.
“I will say that being designated Tier 3 prohibits us from receiving many benefits, especially related to capital project funding for new and renovated buildings as well as lottery funds,” Henderson County Commissioner Rebecca McCall told CPP.
“It is my stance that the tier system should be eliminated and funding provided where most needed.”
One idea is that there should be special programming for the bottom 20 counties, or that more tiers should be introduced back into the system. There aren’t 40 counties suffering from the highest level of economic distress, according to Woodie of the N.C. Rural Center — it’s more like 20 or 25. Grouping those bottom 20 in with counties the top half of Tier 1 does them a disservice, he said.
In the eyes of Rep. Lindsey Prather, D-Buncombe, the problems with the system are simple and fixable.
“First, there’s no reason to have a required number of counties in a certain category,” she said. “Second, we should consider whether more factors should be measured beyond the current four. Third, we should consider whether counties are the best district to measure, or if a smaller area — like zip codes — would better reflect the communities.”

The stakes are high. Struggling counties are not improving under the current economic distress system. Wealthy counties can’t access state assistance for their own disadvantaged communities. Counties that improve economically get punished with reduced funding.
A decade ago, the legislature recommended killing the system. Instead, the distress tiers have found even broader applications.
Changing the state’s system of economic development is possible. The question is whether North Carolina’s legislators and policy makers have the political will to make it happen and can set aside their differences long enough to work toward an effective solution.

(Screenshot)U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced Thursday that a road-focused immigration sweep with Indiana State Police has resulted in the arrests of 223 people alleged to be living in the Chicago area and beyond without legal status.
“Operation Midway Blitz” was launched in September and dedicated to an Illinois woman killed in a vehicle crash with a Guatemalan man in January.
“If you are here, driving on our streets illegally, and our highways, you are endangering our citizens, and your days are numbered,” Noem declared at a news conference in Gary, Indiana.
U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, acting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Todd Lyons, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun and Hoosier Public Safety Secretary Anthony Scott were also present.
Noem said 223 immigrants were arrested “and taken off our roads” through a 287(g) agreement with Indiana State Police. The deal was inked over the summer.

Of those, 146 were drivers: 46 semi-truck drivers and another 82 who drove box trucks, buses and other vehicles. They held commercial driver’s licenses from more than a dozen states, according to Noem. 
She pointed to large pictures of non-citizens convicted of various crimes, noting that collaborations with state and local law enforcement agencies have yielded more than 3,000 arrests since the “Midway Blitz” began.
Noem said that number includes “rapists, murderers and gang members.”
“We don’t want any of these individuals … in our communities, and we especially don’t want them behind the wheel of an 18-wheeler when they can’t speak our language, they don’t understand our laws, they can’t follow our roadway signs, and they can’t interact with law enforcement or our citizens,” she continued.
Braun thanked the Trump administration for “looking to Indiana,” saying illegal driving impacts the interstate highway-heavy Hoosier State more than others.
Indiana State Police plan to expand their cooperation with ICE, according to Braun, by assigning more troopers to commercial vehicle enforcement across the state.

Scott, who is also the state police commissioner, emphasized the work is “not new,” adding that it’s “what we do every day.”
About 1.5 million commercial vehicles are weighed or inspected annually in Indiana, per Scott.
“For the Indiana State Police, this is not about immigration status alone,” he said. “It’s about public safety. An 80,000-pound truck in untrained hands is a dangerous thing.”
Indiana will be reimbursed for its work, according to ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan, who cited provisions in the recently approved One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
“I’d like to thank you for defending the homeland, for choosing put the American people first, and the state of Indiana first,” Sheahan told Braun and Scott.

Andy Beshear announced the state is starting a food drive as a response to the looming loss of federal food assistance this weekend amid the government shutdown. 
Beshear said in his weekly press conference that boxes will be stationed in the lobbies of major state office buildings in Frankfort and the L&N Building in Louisville between Oct. 30 and Nov. 21 to collect non-perishable food for those in need. The governor added that the donated items will go to established charities like Dare to Care, God’s Pantry and Christian Appalachian Project to distribute to Kentuckians. 
“We’re going to be really intentional about making sure that these donations reach needy families across the state,” Beshear said. “I’m really proud to work alongside so many incredible Team Kentucky members that care so much about our state and the families that make up our state — something Team Kentucky has always made a priority. I know every donation will make a difference, and I appreciate everyone who takes part in this or any other food drive.” 
Democrats and Republicans have been going back and forth this week at the federal level as 42 million Americans are at risk of losing their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits starting Saturday. Yet, no agreement had been reached as of Thursday. 
Beshear joined a lawsuit on Tuesday with more than two dozen Democratic state officials suing the Trump administration for halting SNAP assistance despite during the government shutdown. The governor said that a hearing was scheduled in the lawsuit Thursday. 
On Thursday, Beshear renewed his criticism of the president for not finding a solution to the looming stoppage in food assistance. Beshear said that his “faith teaches me that food is life-giving and it is meant to be shared,” and noted that food assistance has continued during previous government shutdowns. 
“Let me be clear. The Trump administration can fund SNAP. They can make that decision,” Beshear said. “It has been done in past shutdowns, and the money is there. Moreover, if this president thinks he can do a $40 billion bailout of Argentina during a government shutdown, certainly he can fund SNAP for a lot less.”
Trump has been seeking $40 million in financing to Argentina this month to bolster the nation’s collapsing currency. 
A USDA memo published by NPR earlier this week said that “there is no provision or allowance under current law for states to cover the cost of benefits and be reimbursed” and that “SNAP contingency funds are only available to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover, benefits.”
The expected stoppage in federal food assistance leaves states to find solutions in the meantime. Republican West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced the state would contribute “up to $13 million” to two West Virginia food banks as it matches donations from residents there. Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency last week to allow using state funds to “provide food benefits.” Virginia has since rolled out a substitute state program, Virginia Emergency Nutrition Assistance, to send money to SNAP beneficiaries. 
Beshear told reporters “a number of options are on the table” for Kentucky at the moment, but he was not sure a special session of the state legislature would be necessary to address food assistance. He also said that any state solution would not make up for the full loss of the federal funding. 
The monthly cost of SNAP in Kentucky is about $100 million, Beshear said, providing assistance to almost 600,000 Kentuckians. Kentucky has $3.7 billion in its budget reserve trust fund, also known as the “rainy day fund.”
“All Donald Trump has to do is say, ‘I don’t want people to go hungry,’ authorize the SNAP payments to go out and our people will be OK,” Beshear said. “Either he will make the choice for folks to get full benefits, or it will be his decision that causes significant hunger.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_1809-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-30 15:01:23.934852

This story was originally reported by Jennifer Gerson of The 19th.  Meet Jennifer and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
With 42 million Americans on the brink of losing their SNAP benefits on November 1, many nonprofits and online content creators are asking parents to rethink what they hand out to trick-or-treaters this Halloween.
Some groups and influencers are using their platforms to remind followers that funding for SNAP — short for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and often referred to as “food stamps” — is about to run out because of the government shutdown. Handing out nonperishable food alongside candy, they say, can go a long way to help neighbors in need.
In a viral Facebook post, the United Way Family Resource Center recommended adding things like ramen, microwave macaroni-and-cheese cups, shelf-stable pudding, bags of pretzels and protein bars to the sweet treats in every child’s Halloween basket. “Every little bit helps keep a child’s belly full — and shows that kindness can be just as sweet as candy,” the post says.
Many popular pediatrician influencers and other content creators who focus on child well-being are repeating a similar message. Among their suggestions is placing a supply of Cup Noodles and mini cereal boxes on the doorstep so families can take what they need without stigma.
Heather Black is the vice president of 211 System Strategy at the United Way. 211 is the three-digit dialing code designated at the federal level to connect people to health and human services in their community — and Black said there has been “very significant increases in calls related specifically to food” to 211 since the government shutdown began four weeks ago. 211 has call centers across the country, reaching virtually all of the United States. Callers are connected with a trained responder who, after completing a short intake, connects them with local resources.
Black told The 19th that housing, utility assistance and food have always encompassed the top needs of 211 callers. Now, she said, “we are starting to see food needs specifically increase from people who maybe have always been able to rely on SNAP benefits and with the increasing publicity that funding from those benefits will not be available for the month of November, there’s beginning to be a lot of anxiety among families around how they’re going to meet those costs.”
Another group of callers concerned about food insecurity right now, Black said, are federal workers who do not receive SNAP benefits, but who are approaching four weeks without a paycheck while also dealing with increasingly high grocery store prices.
“This is real life for people,” Black said. That’s where the spirit of the now-viral Halloween posts come into play — and speak of ways to extend that energy even further.
“I think that’s a really creative idea, the Halloween idea — but that’s just one brief moment in time,” she said. “We’re going to need to do a lot more.”
In addition to encouraging people to support local food pantries and other community groups that help provide groceries to those in need, Black said there are other ways people can help.
“We need to check on our neighbors,” she said, mentioning people with children and older adults in particular. “We need to check in and make sure that people that we might know who would in a situation where their income could either be impacted by the government shutdown where they are now not getting a paycheck or if they have relied in the past on some of these programs where funding has now been paused — we need to check in on those folks.”
Black reminded that giving can also go beyond just donating to local food pantries. She recommended that when checking on people whose access to food might have been impacted by the shutdown in some way, ask if they need any items from the grocery store.
“I really encourage people to think in that way because asking for help is not always easy,” she said.

Farm groups said the trade deal was “encouraging” but also noted the need to continue looking for export markets and developing domestic soybean markets. 
Trump and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins announced Thursday China would purchase at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans this year, followed by at least 25 million metric tons annually in 2026, 2027 and 2028.

The announcement followed Trump’s meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, where the leaders agreed to remove certain retaliatory tariffs and Xi agreed to continue exports of rare-earth materials and possibly purchase energy from the U.S. 
Aside from a small reported shipment of soybeans purchased just ahead of the leaders’ talk, China had not purchased any soybeans from the current U.S. crop, which left farmers wondering if they had lost their largest export market. 
Iowa Soybean Association called the announcement “encouraging news” in a news release Thursday. ISA said soybean associations were “encouraged” that the trade commitments were framed as minimums and looked forward to “continued growth in soybean purchases beyond these levels.” 
ISA President Tom Adam said the announcement addressed many of the concerns farmers had after “months of stalled purchases and uncertainty.” 
“This is great news for American agriculture and for soybean farmers who have been eager to reestablish a stable and long-term relationship that positions us for success moving forward,” Adam said in the release. “We are very grateful to President Trump for making soybeans a priority in negotiations with China.”
According to the association, China has historically purchased between 28 and 36 million metric tons of soybeans, annually over the last 10 years, excluding the past two years when the country bought fewer U.S. beans. 
The association also called for the administration to continue developing other foreign export relationships and to finalize renewable fuel standards to help grow the domestic soybean market.

What’s that in bushels?
According to Iowa Soybean Association the 12 million metric tons China is poised to buy this year equates to 441 million bushels. 
The 25 million metric tons it has agreed to purchase annually through 2028 equates to 918.5 million bushels. 

Rollins said in a social media post the deal was “HUGE” considering China has played “hard ball” with the U.S. over the past four years. 
“China’s additional commitment to purchase minimums for the next three years while President Trump is in the White House to actually hold them accountable is good for all of us!” Rollins wrote. 
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the deal with China will make a “meaningful impact” on farmers who are “feeling the pain of a tough farm economy.”
“It’s important that we continue to play offense on trade by opening and expanding new markets while also driving domestic use of Iowa products, especially homegrown biofuels,” Naig said in a statement. 
Gov. Kim Reynolds and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst also celebrated the news Thursday on their social media accounts. 
Iowa Farm Bureau Federation President Brent Johnson similarly said the deal was a positive development for farmers. 
“The announcement of China’s return to the marketplace is welcomed news and should provide some price support to struggling U.S. soybean markets,” Johnson said in a statement. “With farmers facing rising costs to grow a crop amid depressed markets, we applaud the administration’s efforts to secure trade deals and opportunities for agriculture.”

The federal government is shut down. Millions of Americans are at risk of losing their health care coverage or facing skyrocketing premium increases, and millions more won’t be receiving the food assistance they need to feed their families come November 1.
Americans are right to be spooked, and the fear is very likely to persist beyond Halloween.
Even when Congress finally ends the government shutdown and addresses the growing crisis in food security and health care, the horrors inflicted on Medicaid, Medicare and SNAP in this summer’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” will remain.  When coupled with drastic cuts to public health programs through the DOGE program, and more recent cuts in response to the shutdown, the future of our health, security and well-being looks grim.
At the age of 55, I know a few things about life-saving health care. I have survived cancer treatments, strokes, a brain aneurysm and end-stage kidney disease that requires dialysis. I also take several medications that are lifesaving.
Without access to affordable health coverage and prescriptions, I would have been long gone. Even with coverage, I had to fight to ensure payment for needed treatments, but I have been one of the lucky ones who had coverage and the ability to fight to guarantee it.
I’m also a mother whose two daughters have depended on Medicaid during periods where they couldn’t get health care through their employers. In that way, they are like the more than 3 million North Carolinians covered by Medicaid insurance–more than 1 in 4 persons.
The U.S. spends more on health care alone than the entire gross domestic product of every nation in the world other than China. In spite of spending nearly twice as much per person as any other nation, our health outcomes rank low among developed nations. People will disagree about what’s wrong with the system and how to fix it, but there is no denying that we spend a lot more than we get in return.
Those of us who believe that quality, affordable health care should be available to everyone have our own solutions in mind, but policy change is hard in today’s polarized political context and given the complexity of the system. Still, as more and more Americans and businesses contend with escalating health care costs and impossible choices, demand will grow for serious solutions that don’t just put a bandaid on cost, but leverage government power to stop escalating prices.
Make no mistake, it will be up to us regular Americans to force that change. It’s clear in this moment our elected officials in Washington can’t even agree on keeping health care costs in line, getting food to the hungry, and reopening the government that they all work for. Rather than legislating for the good of their constituents, they are stubbornly playing political games to stick it to the other party. This is not what the American people want, or what we voted for—no matter which candidate we chose.
I have stood with others in front of the offices of U.S. Representatives Hudson and Rouzer in Fayetteville, demanding action to protect our health care and SNAP. Despite many requests for meetings, they have ignored constituents—even though they have been in the district for over a month now and while they continue to collect a paycheck to act as our representatives.
I’m an educator and an organizer, not an expert in healthcare policy. But I do know that the voters and communities I work with want affordable health care that meets their needs, lower prescription drug prices, nutrition programs that prevent hunger and malnourishment, and a public health system that defends us against diseases and prevents health crises like Covid.
This may be a lot to ask of a government that can’t even stay open–but it shouldn’t be. If other nations can provide health care at lower cost and with better outcomes, why can’t we move forward in that direction rather than constantly backtracking on hard-won progress?
I’d love to ask Representatives Rouzer and Hudson that question directly, but they won’t meet with me or anyone who is impacted by the shutdown they voted for. I’d also like to remind them that as supporters of “work requirements” in Medicaid and SNAP, they too should get to work and start representing their constituents instead of prioritizing political games.

A state district court judge has rejected a plea deal that could have seen a former Colstrip High School teacher accused of multiple felonies for having repeated sexual contact with a 15-year-old student avoid prison time altogether.
Last month, Rosebud County District Court Judge Rennie Wittman told William Eugene Schuman-Kline that she was going to reject the plea agreement that would have sentenced him to 20 years in state prison, suspended 16 of them, and then had the option of serving no jail time.
Attorneys for the former high school teacher had argued that prison time wouldn’t benefit anyone, and mounted a letter-writing campaign from community members, teachers, university professors and even religious leaders who asked the court for leniency.
Meanwhile, advocates for Indigenous People urged the court to reject the plea agreement, saying that there’s been a longstanding and systemic practice of courts doling out light punishments, especially when the victims are youth and Native American.
Wittman explained to Schuman-Kline, the court would not agree with the plea deal and instead sentence him on two different counts of sexual assault, one that carried a 20-year sentence, with 10 suspended; and another that carries a 10-year sentence, with no time suspended. Both of the counts would have run concurrently, meaning that Schuman-Kline would have spent at least 10 years in custody of the Montana Department of Corrections before being released.
Wittman allowed Schuman-Kline to withdraw from the plea agreement, which he did, and opted instead to have the case head for a trial, scheduled for Jan. 5-9, 2026.
A letter from Colstrip High School Principal Robin Nansel, who first reported the crime after students from a sports team informed her about it, urged Wittman to use the moment to demonstrate to the community that it will not tolerate the behavior and will protect students.
“The damage does not end with (the victim). His betrayal did not only devastate this student personally; it sent shockwaves through her peers, her friends and the staff members who worked alongside the defendant,” Nansel wrote in a letter to the judge. “A strong and just sentence is necessary — not only to hold him accountable, but to affirm to all students and families that we will protect them and such a betrayal will never be tolerated.”
Advocates for victims of sexual assault and indigenous women strongly objected to the terms of the plea deal, despite nearly two dozen letters of support for Schuman-Kline, whose family, former professors and even religious counselors said deserved leniency for his actions after being charged. Warrior Women For Justice said it worried that the case would become just another in a long list of offenses against Native people which receive a lighter sentence.
“Historically, courts have struggled with holding accountability to non-Natives that commit heinous crimes within Indigenous communities, and within our own communities,” the letter from Nicci Wagy, the executive director of the group wrote to Wittman.
Lucy Simpson, the executive Director of the National Indigenous Women’s Resource Center, stated it more bluntly.
“The NIWRC support the court’s imposition of the maximum sentence under law, as well as permanently barring Mr. Schuman-Kline from teaching, coaching or working with children in any capacity,” it said.
Schuman-Kline declined comment or interview for this story as did his counsel, Mark Parker.
  The charges 

The Rosebud County Attorney’s Office charged Schuman-Kline in January with five counts, four of them felonies including sexual assault and sexual abuse of a child.
According to court documents, Schuman-Kline was a first-year teacher at Colstrip and around 27 years old at the time when he is alleged to have begun flirting with a 15-year-old student. The inappropriate and illegal behavior described in court documents spanned a period from October through December 2023.
Those documents state that Schuman-Kline used his power as a teacher to coerce her into sexual activity that she could not consent to as a minor, and also because he was in a position of authority as a teacher.
Students at the high school as well as athletic coaches noticed what they considered to be suspicious behavior. The victim and Schuman-Kline had communicated often during the two-month span with the app Snapchat. The court documents said that Schuman-Kline also gave alcohol to the victim both on school grounds and a recreation building.
The court documents also allege that he would help the student with her homework after class and without anyone else present. The victim later told investigators that Schuman-Kline gave her credit for work she did not complete. The court documents also describe times when Schuman-Kline would “make out” with the victim, and details several instances where they engaged in sexual contact.
Authorities also say that Schuman-Kline and the victim used the Snapchat application to send explicit photos to each other, which the application would quickly delete. Court documents said that through forensic recovery of the phone, investigators said that Schuman-Kline had sent nude photographs of himself, while the victim sent several photos of herself topless.
Schuman-Kline also encouraged the victim to use the Snapchat app because it was “sneakier” than other applications, and even though his wife had checked his phone, she had found nothing, court documents said.
Other students reported that they had witnessed Schuman-Kline putting his hands on the student’s butt.
Court documents said that Schuman-Kline became jealous if the student started focusing on other teachers’ homework, and the victim told investigators that “it was not his fault that she had ‘seduced the teacher.’”
A police investigator also interviewed friends of the victim who said that she had confided that Schuman-Kline and the student had sex, but had been interrupted by when the class bell rang.
Authorities confirmed that they were also able to recover the photographs the victim had sent to Schuman-Kline.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-200443854-001-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-30 15:01:23.934852

(Commissioner of Political Practices)Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen has rejected a ballot initiative seeking to limit the power of corporations to spend money on elections, saying it did not meet legal review standards. 
The proposed Ballot Measure No. 4 would amend Article XIII of the state constitution to redefine the powers of corporations (“artificial persons” under the constitution) to state that they have no power to spend money “or anything of value on elections or ballot issues.” The proposal is a response to the Citizens United U.S. Supreme Court decision, which said spending money in elections is equivalent to free speech. 
Jeff Mangan, a former Commissioner of Political Practices in Montana, is the founder of the Transparent Election Initiative behind the ballot initiative known as “The Montana Plan,” and he told the Daily Montanan that he expected the measure to receive pushback from the Attorney General’s Office. 
Knudsen’s office, by law, reviews all proposed ballot initiatives for legal sufficiency and clarity of the proposed language. 
In a memorandum from Knudsen’s office dated Oct. 24, written by deputy solicitor general Brent Mead, the ballot measure is considered legally insufficient and of “significant material harm” to business interests. 
According to the memo, the ballot initiative proposes to both add and revoke powers in the state constitution, which Knudsen’s office says violates a provision of law requiring ballot initiatives to have a single-subject focus and only contain a single amendment. 
“Ballot Measure No. 4 affects diverse government functions across disparate areas of law,” the memo states, listing potential changes across five different Title sections of Montana law. 
The memo also references a fiscal note from the Office of Budget and Program Planning that indicates the fiscal impact of the constitutional change would require the Commissioner of Political Practices hire at least a half-time employee or contract equivalent to “assist with reviewing, determining, and resolving formal complaints including agency-initiated enforcement.”
According to the fiscal analysis, the cost of the employee position would be roughly $96,000 annually. 
It also states that COPP assumes the constitutionality of the ballot issue would be challenged in court, and it would cost from $50,000 to $500,000, “based on past challenges to similar issues.”
But Mangan, who held a series of listening sessions across the state this week, said the Transparent Election Initiative will challenge the legal review in court. 
He told the Daily Montanan in an email that he disagrees with the attorney general’s legal memo for several reasons, including that a legal sufficiency review is supposed to be “a technical gatekeeping function. The memo strays into policy and predictive litigation arguments that go beyond the role.”
“The Montana Plan presents one question to voters — whether Montana should continue granting corporations the power to spend in its politics,” Mangan said. “The components (revoking prior grants, defining permitted powers, parity for foreign corporations, and an enforcement mechanism) implement that single change; they are not separate amendments a voter could logically pick and choose among.”
The AG’s legal memo also states that the Montana Plan would harm business interests in the state by restricting or eliminating “the ability of artificial persons to participate on legislative and regulatory matters affecting them,” and create a competitive disadvantage against non-Montana businesses. 
“Businesses, nonprofits, trade unions, and other associations regularly appear before state and local bodies on legislative and regulatory matters. In other words, they petition their government for redress. Ballot Measure No. 4 revokes this right. Ballot Measure No. 4 goes further and prohibits these associations from lobbying via participation in ballot issues.” 
Mangan says this is a mischaracterization of the ballot initiative, which “does not regulate lobbying.”
“It concerns election spending, including ballot-issue spendings—a different legal category from petitioning or testifying on legislation,” he said. “The measure applies equally to corporations operating in Montana whether chartered in-state or out-of-state, so it doesn’t saddle Montana businesses with a competitive disadvantage that others can evade.”
The Transparent Election Initiative will submit its appeal to the Montana Supreme Court within 10 days of the memo’s publication.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-14-at-4.58.34-PM-1024x628.png,,,2025-10-30 15:01:23.934852

Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) speaks on a press conference on rising health care premiums without ACA tax credits. Oct. 30. | Screenshot. Ahead of Saturday’s start of the open enrollment period for health care under the Affordable Care Act, Michigan’s Congressional Democrats are calling on their Republican colleagues to work to restore the Affordable Care Act tax credits set to expire. 
Those tax credits have become a centerpiece of the federal budget debate and the ongoing shutdown of the federal government, which is approaching the one-month mark. Without them, health care premiums will skyrocket, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Ann Arbor) said in a virtual press conference held Thursday. 
“At some point, you had to draw the line in the sand. I want to get this government opened again. That means Republicans have to go to work in Washington,” Dingell said. “I hope Speaker Johnson calls us all back. We all get back there. We reopen the government, they do something about health care, so that millions of Americans don’t lose it.”
Dingell and her colleagues have pointed to these health insurance tax credits as a defining budget issue for them since the shutdown began, and have repeatedly called on Republicans to extend them through the coming year. 
“Because Congress has prioritized tax cuts for billionaires over Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, working Americans ae now seeing their health care costs double,” said U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) in a press release from her office. “We can’t afford to wait any longer. Speaker Johnson needs to call the House back immediately so we can stop the health care crisis from landing on Michigan families.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Jodie Schanhals, a 62-year-old entrepreneur from Traverse City, joined Dingell and Hertel in the press conference. Her health insurance, she said, will increase by around $1,200 per year without the tax credits. 
“Right now, the Republicans in the House of Representatives are placing me in the middle of this battle. Either we’re not gonna pay the health care subsidies that go along with the ACA, so everybody can get health care, or we’re not gonna feed 40 million people,” she said, referencing the lapse in SNAP benefits set to start on Nov. 1. “I am outraged that this is the choice. It’s so cruel.”
Schanhals, who had hip surgery in 2007, said that she is due to find out if she will need a hip replacement, which she is expected to need. 
“I won’t die from this,” she added. “I just won’t be able to walk.”
“For weeks, they refused to negotiate,” Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel added during the press conference, referring to Republicans. “For weeks, they refused to extend the tax credits that would keep premiums affordable. And now, with open enrollment starting this weekend, they still refuse to fix the problem they created.”

Members of the committee heard testimony from supporters of Rep. Matt Maddock’s (R-Milford) House Bill 4915 during last week’s meeting, where Rep. Julie Brixie (D-Okemos) requested an additional meeting for testimony on the bills, saying she’d been unable to ask her questions about the policy. 
The committee did not take further testimony on the bill Thursday, despite an additional request from Brixie to hear testimony, with the committee’s chair, Rep. Mike Hoadley (R-Au Gres), saying there had been adequate time for follow up questions with the committee’s minority vice chair, Rep. Kristian Grant (D-Grand Rapids). SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Members of the committee voted along party lines to refer the bill to the House Rules Committee for further consideration, with Hoadley telling the Michigan Advance it’s typical for that committee to further scrutinize any legislation that has to do with rules put forth by government departments. 
Before voting to refer the bill to another committee, members shot down a proposed amendment from Rep. Joe Tate (D-Detroit) which would bar the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs from enforcing implicit bias training requirements unless the content of the training pertains to instruction on the Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act – which prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, height, weight, familial status, marital status or source of income – or the Persons With Disabilities Civil Rights Act, effectively invalidating Maddock’s bill.
Michigan House committee considers ban on bias training requirements for health professionals

After the meeting, Brixie spoke out on the decision to move forward without further testimony on the policy, telling the Advance “the lack of transparency and the fear of the public weighing in on these issues is very disappointing and disconcerting.”
Stephanie Nawyn, an associate professor of sociology at Michigan State University submitted a card in opposition to the bill, but was not permitted to testify at Thursday’s meeting. 
Nawyn previously served as the university’s director of the Center for Gender in Global Context and worked as the co-principal investigator on a grant from the National Science Foundation developing programs to mitigate bias, though she emphasized she was speaking on her own behalf and that her comments did not represent MSU. 
While speaking with the Advance after the meeting, Nawyn said she suspects the bill’s supporters misunderstand what implicit bias is and what the training involves. 
During last week’s meeting, representatives from Do No Harm – a national organization opposing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts in health care and gender-affirming care for minors – spoke out against these trainings, calling them divisive, and arguing that these trainings promote discrimination. 
The opposite is true, Nawyn said, questioning why someone would institute training encouraging medical professionals to be biased.
Psychological studies have shown that implicit bias – which the American Psychological Association defines as a “negative attitude, of which one is not consciously aware, against a specific social group” – is particularly hard to address because people do not know that they have it, Nawyn said. 
“To say someone has implicit bias is not to say they are a bad person,” Nawyn said. “It’s just to say that, you know, they have absorbed things unconsciously that might make [them] not as good at providing health care.”
Nawyn also noted that there is a wealth of studies detailing the impacts implicit bias has on health outcomes for patients. 
“There are a lot of health disparities, and some of them are related to biases that doctors may have or other health providers may have,” Nawyn said. “There are certain patients that medical providers may not spend as much time with, may not take their concerns seriously, their reports of pain seriously and those generally lead to detrimental health outcomes for patients.”
While members of Do No Harm argued the training requirements were burdensome for health professionals, and that their time would be better spent reviewing medical literature, Nawyn said the time commitment required for these trainings is not an argument against them. 
“I’ve got probably three or four different trainings sitting in my inbox waiting for me to do that are all about compliance with government rules,” Nawyn said. “So to decide that this particular training is too burdensome when the state Legislature has no problems with all sorts of training that might be required as part of compliance, I think it’s a strawperson argument.” 
While arguments of the bill tend to focus on implicit bias as it applies to race and ethnicity, Nawyn noted the concept addresses a broader range of biases.
“Some of them focus on weight. Some of them focus on disability. Some of them focus on substance use that patients are engaging in – a misuse – socioeconomic status,” Nawyn said. “There [are] so many different biases that people might have, I think it should be left up to medical licensing boards to decide what are important implicit biases that they want their members to address and their decision whether or not to require some training to mitigate those.”

U.S. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Tammy Baldwin of  Wisconsin held a virtual news conference Thursday to discuss the impact of ACA tax credits expiring in Iowa. Iowa is represented by an entirely Republican delegation in Washington, D.C., all of whom have largely placed the blame of the 30-day shutdown on Democrats. While the U.S. House passed a stopgap funding bill in September to keep the government funded through Nov. 21, Senate Democrats have been able to block such a short-term funding measure from passing unless Republicans agree to extend enhanced ACA tax credits set to expire at the end of 2025.

Without the extension of these enhanced tax credits, Democrats say health care premiums for people who receive health insurance through the ACA-established Health Insurance Marketplaces may see their premium costs double as open enrollment begins Nov. 1. According to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, nearly 137,000 Iowans are enrolled on Marketplace plans in 2025.
Klobuchar said Senate Democrats were calling for Congress to act immediately to extend these tax credits, saying lawmakers cannot wait until December or January to address the issue.
“We are here to talk about this cliff that we’re standing on right now,” Klobuchar said. “It’s nothing that we can wait on. … This marketplace opens up now on Nov. 1, and if Congress doesn’t come together to extend these health care tax credits that greatly help people afford their health insurance, the premiums of these Iowans are going to double next year.”
She said this will cause additional burdens for Iowans who are also facing rising costs and health care shortages, especially in rural areas, due to cuts to Medicaid through the budget reconciliation bill. Without the ACA enhanced tax credits, a 60-year-old Iowa couple earning about $83,000 a year could see their premium increase by more than $13,000 a year, and a family of four making $64,000 could see their premiums increase by more than $2,500 a year, she said, citing data from the organization Keep Americans Covered.
“This is a major factor in rural America and rural Iowa,” Klobuchar said. “… That is a gut punch that too many families simply can’t afford.”
Baldwin said “the expiration of these tax breaks are going to put salt in the wound, frankly, for Iowans and Wisconsinites alike,” as she called for Iowans to reach out to their representatives in Congress and ask for support in extending the tax credits.
“If Donald Trump and my Republican colleagues won’t listen to Democrats, I hope they’ll listen to their constituents who are anxious, and in some cases terrified, about how they’re going to be able to make ends meet with these tax breaks expiring,” Baldwin said. “And to my Republican colleagues — there was plenty of room in the budget to deliver tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations, but what about hard-working Americans so they can afford their health care? The path out of this is so clear.”
Two Iowans who receive health care through the ACA marketplace spoke about the importance of extending these cuts. Lori Hunt of Des Moines said after being laid off from her job earlier in the year, she was able to secure health care through the marketplace. But without the enhanced tax credits, she said, this coverage would be unaffordable.
Having accessible health care is especially important because she was diagnosed with breast cancer three years ago, Hunt said. She has went through radiation treatment and is on a prescription to keep the cancer “at bay” — but said she needs regular health care check-ins and care to ensure future issues do not arise.
“It’s just something I need to keep on top of, (to) keep up with my screenings and to make sure that everything’s okay,” Hunt said. “And when this enhanced Premium Tax Credit goes away, I won’t be able to afford it.”
Jenny Turner, a mother from West Des Moines, said after her husband died of cancer when her son was 7, she transitioned to working part-time from home. She and her son have health insurance through the ACA, she said.
“Without the enhanced tax credits, my premiums are going to more than double, and I was able to get on the website and look that up,” Turner said. “And as hard as it’s going to be for us, I know it’s going to be a lot harder for a lot of other single mothers.”
Iowa’s U.S. House delegation, led by Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, sent a letter earlier in October calling for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to end the shutdown by passing the continuing resolution approved in the House. But Klobuchar said the stalemate is continuing because House Republicans are refusing to negotiate with Democrats on ACA tax credits, and because they do not want to vote on measures related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
“It’s just getting to the point of ridiculousness, because they’ve been out for six weeks — a six week vacation, which I think most Americans could only dream of,” Klobuchar said. “So while that is going on, we are calling on them to come to the table. … The president has a lot of power here. He prides himself on the art of the deal. He can bring people, but they’re together to do this, and that’s what has to happen. So hopefully, when he comes back from his trip to Asia, this will happen, and they’ll call back the House, and we’ll able to work on an agreement.”

(Photo by Madelyn Murphy/Colorado Newsline)The perpetrators of federal immigration enforcement under the Trump administration are allergic to transparency.
The most widely recognized symptom of this condition is their habit of masking up. The face-covering gaiter has quickly become a shameful icon for Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who’ve terrorized countless communities across Colorado and the country.
But ICE and its partners in the lawless implementation of President Donald Trump’s mass deportation program mask up in other ways. As Newsline reporter Sara Wilson recently discovered, the numerous daily flights that crisscross the country to transport immigrants are difficult to track. 
That’s by design.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The flights are run by ICE, which transports people to immigration detention hubs and out of the country to deport them. The operation balloons the catastrophe of detention by putting whole states between family members and undercutting the ability of detainees to seek legal help. 
Think of how a normal criminal prosecution works. A person is arrested on suspicion of violating the law by uniformed, identifiable police officers. That person is booked at a local facility and possibly jailed, but in many cases they have the opportunity to secure pre-trial release, and in all cases they’re given access to legal representation.
Compare that to how faceless, unaccountable immigration officers grab residents off the street and whisk them to locations unknown to family and friends. Most people whom ICE arrests in Colorado have no criminal conviction or charge, and that tracks with the national trend. Despite constitutional rights that are supposed to protect them, they have little expectation of due process or access to legal representation.
ICE flights are a major component of this injustice.
Wilson reported that Colorado-based Key Lime Air, which many customers know as Denver Air Connection, in mid-September started running daily flights of detainees for ICE. Key Lime is the first known Colorado-based company to participate in ICE Air, the agency’s program of removal and domestic transfer flights on charter and commercial airlines. 
Key Lime aircraft shuttle detainees around the country, and they frequent ICE detention hubs, particularly El Paso and Harlingen in Texas, and Alexandria, Louisiana. As part of reporting the story, Newsline journalists observed dozens of detainees exit and enter Key Lime aircraft with their hands and feet shackled.
The reporting didn’t come easy. The Key Lime planes that perform ICE Air work are devoid of company logos. The company appears to have blocked the planes’ registration numbers from at least one popular flight tracking website. When they started ferrying detainees they stopped using the Key Lime flight communication call sign, “LYM.”
Federal authorities communicate very little about the flights. We don’t know the identity of the passengers. And Key Lime was no help. Wilson had a door shut in her face at Key Lime headquarters at Centennial Airport, and when she got CEO Cliff Honeycutt on the phone he quickly ended the conversation.
Much of what is known about ICE flights comes from independent trackers, like Washington-based La Resistencia, and immigration advocates. The New York Times relied on a flight database created by refugee advocate Tom Cartwright when it published an investigation into the Alexandria deportation hub. The Guardian‘s investigation into the hub, which features a detention center on the airport tarmac, found “a pattern of alleged due process violations … neglect and abuse, documented health emergencies and long stays.”
“There is almost no legal access to the center,” the Guardian reported.
ICE leaders want to mask the agency’s detention flights for the same reason its officers want to mask their faces: Their behavior is inhumane and indefensible. And the result is the same: Malign government agents defy transparency and accountability.
But the work of advocates and journalists like Wilson exposes much about the true face of ICE Air.

(Photo by Andrew Kitchenman/Alaskaa Beacon)On Wednesday, the Alaska Supreme Court heard arguments in a legal case that will determine whether or not the state of Alaska may restrict abortion care to licensed physicians.
Since 2019, attorneys representing Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest, Hawaii, Alaska, Indiana and Kentucky, have been challenging a state law setting out that restriction. They argue that advanced practice clinicians should be permitted to provide abortion care, even though they are not licensed physicians.
The law, enacted in 1970, has been partially suspended since 2021, which has allowed advanced practice clinicians to perform abortions. In 2024, Alaska Superior Court judge ruled in favor of Planned Parenthood, continuing the suspension. 
The state of Alaska, which opposes Planned Parenthood’s interpretation of the law, appealed to the Alaska Supreme Court in hopes of restoring the law’s effectiveness.
The deciding issue may be whether strict scrutiny applies in the case. Under strict scrutiny, the government bears the burden of proving that a law is constitutional.
In 2024, Alaska Superior Court Judge Josie Garton ruled that strict scrutiny does apply, which contributed to her determination that limiting abortion services to state-licensed physicians violates the Alaska Constitution.
In written briefs to the Supreme Court this year, attorneys representing the state have argued that Garton’s ruling was mistaken; attorneys representing Planned Parenthood have argued in favor of the strict scrutiny determination.
If Garton’s decision on strict scrutiny is overturned, the rest of her decision could follow, and advanced practice clinicians would no longer be legally able to provide abortion care in Alaska.
In Alaska, abortion rights have generally been protected since 1997 by the Alaska Supreme Court’s interpretation of the state’s constitutional right to privacy.
Since then, subsequent editions of the court have repeatedly held that abortion care is health care and thus protected by the right of Alaskans to keep medical decisions private.
Attorney Laura Wolff, representing the Alaska Department of Law, argued Wednesday that the physician-only abortion law doesn’t violate the constitutional right to privacy because few people have been affected.
“The privacy clause analysis requires a significant impairment,” she told the justices. “Not a modest, not a medium, a moderate, a significant impairment, in order to even trigger the privacy clause.”
Attorney Camila Vega, arguing for Planned Parenthood, said some of the group’s clients have been able to access care more often because they no longer have to wait for a doctor to be available.
She said that it would be a mistake for the Supreme Court to require that a minimum number of patients be affected in order to violate the constitution.
“This court has never before required evidence about a threshold number of individual patients to strike down a law, and we would urge the court not to do so here,” she said. “The evidence … shows that since the injunction in this case, patients have been better able to access medication and aspiration abortion. They’ve been doing so for the last four years, and so we respectfully request that the court affirm the order.”
National and local groups filed friend-of-the-court briefs in support of Planned Parenthood. Standing Together Against Rape, an Alaska group, argued that restricting access to abortion care would harm abuse victims and survivors of sexual assault. 
The national groups argued that advanced practice clinicians are able to provide safe and effective abortion care, and there’s no difference in outcomes between their care and care provided by doctors.
Planned Parenthood has also argued that even if the Alaska Constitution’s privacy amendment does not apply in this case, the abortion-doctor law would violate the constitution’s equal protection clause.
That clause states “that all persons are equal and entitled to equal rights.”
Restricting abortion patients to doctor treatment alone deters them from getting treatment, Vega said.
“For example, if the state offered marriage appointments twice a week, but it said that for same-sex couples, you could only get a marriage appointment once a month, that is a clear equal protection violation,” she said.

A partial government shutdown is almost a month old. 
Congressional Democrats have refused to sign on to a funding bill if Republicans don’t agree to extend subsidies to buy health insurance on marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act. 
In the absence of the subsidies — which are scheduled to expire Jan. 1 — health care costs will more than double for 24 million Americans, the health-analysis nonprofit KFF reports. 
Congressional Republicans this summer passed President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. 
It provides about $1 trillion in tax cuts to the richest 1% of Americans over 10 years, while it cuts nearly the same amount from Medicaid. 
It also cuts $186 billion from the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, the deepest cuts in the program’s history.
While the Trump bill extended 2017 tax cuts favoring the wealthy, congressional Republicans so far have refused to extend the ACA subsidies, which started in 2021.

As the shutdown resulting from the impasse has gone on, millions of federal employees haven’t been paid, with millions of military personnel potentially joining them on Dec. 1. 
The cuts to food assistance, or SNAP, under the Trump law were already slated to begin phasing in on Nov. 1. But with the shutdown, funding for the program threatens to stop altogether.
Last summer, when the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was passed, operators of Ohio’s food banks said they were already overstretched because high food costs increased the number of hungry people, while also making supplies more expensive. 
That was before they faced complete defunding of SNAP, however temporary — and before some of those unpaid federal workers began to depend on their services.
“While we stand ready to assist those affected, our resources are already stretched thin, with an average of 1.4 million Ohioans visiting our food pantries each month, and a prolonged shutdown will add strain on our network,” the Ohio Association of Food Banks said in a written statement. 
“We are counting on our donors, supporters and communities to step up in any way they can as our network continues its response. This situation underscores the vital role of public-private partnerships in supporting working families.”
Think tank Policy Matters Ohio said that Congress doesn’t need to pass a bill to extend food benefits; Trump has the power to do that unilaterally.
“Past practice and guidance from the Government Accountability Office are crystal clear that the SNAP contingency reserve is available to cover regular SNAP benefits,” Executive Director Hannah Halbert said earlier this week in a written statement. 
“This administration’s choice to deviate from shutdown funding norms suggests their willingness to allow hunger to take a back seat to partisan politics.”
She called on Ohio U.S. Sens. Bernie Moreno and Jon Husted, both Republicans, to urge Trump to extend the reserve funds to hungry Ohioans.
Husted’s office was asked whether he had asked the Trump administration to look for ways the government can keep SNAP funded. It didn’t respond.
A spokeswoman for Moreno pointed to a bill he had cosponsored. Introduced by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., it would give the secretary of agriculture the power to appropriate money for SNAP — a power that Policy Matters and other organizations contend the secretary and the president already have. 
The bill makes no mention of the expiring health care subsidies. 
Asked if Moreno believed that Senate Democrats should allow those to expire in order to save food assistance, the spokeswoman didn’t respond.
Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost on Tuesday led 18 Republican attorneys general in a letter calling on Democrats to end the crisis over SNAP. 
Addressed to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., it urged him to lead his caucus in agreeing to a “clean” funding bill. 
To do that, Democrats would have to abandon their demand for extended health subsidies.
“This does not need to happen,” Yost’s letter said of the loss of SNAP funding. “Congress can stop the threat right now by passing a clean continuing resolution that keeps essential services funded and protects those who rely on them. You have the power to prevent a crisis that is entirely avoidable.”
Yost’s office was asked why the Republican A.G.s didn’t also write to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., given that he has more power than Schumer. 
It was also asked whether Yost was, in effect, pushing for the expiration of the health subsidies. 
It didn’t respond.
As the loss of food assistance looms for a million-and-a-half Ohioans, groups that have been leading protests against Trump called on people to help. 
The No Kings Alliance, which led huge protests across the country Oct. 18, is urging people to give to food banks, support local shelters and organize give-back drives.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-30 17:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,How one CT clinic is addressing racial disparities in maternal care,Katy Golvala,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/30/maternal-care-husky-enrich-health-hamden/,Enrich Health’s approach—which aims to improve maternal and birth outcomes—is aligned with HUSKY’s new value-based payment model.,"Monique Rainford has built a decades-long career as an obstetrician. But, for the last ten years, she’s been grappling with how the traditional health system she’s been a part of has failed to adequately serve Black mothers and babies.
Now she is redesigning maternal care delivery with the lofty goal of eliminating racial disparities. In June, Rainford and her business partner, Andrea Lee, opened Enrich Health, located in Hamden, where the model of care uses clinical strategies that are proven to improve outcomes for expectant mothers who are most at risk. 
The United States has the highest rate of maternal deaths of any high-income nation, according to research published by the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that studies health policy. Black and Indigenous women bear the brunt of this underperformance. 
Last year, Black people in the U.S. were more than three times as likely as their white counterparts to die from pregnancy-related causes, according to nonprofit research organization KFF. Their babies were also more likely to be born prematurely or with low birthweight. The gaps persist even when controlling for factors like income and education, “pointing to the roles racism and discrimination play in driving disparities,” researchers wrote.
“The traditional system was not designed for hundreds of thousands of women in America,” Rainford said. “That is part of why disparities are not going away.”
A 2019 study of nearly 7,000 pregnancy-related deaths from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that a Black woman with a college degree was more likely to experience a fatal pregnancy than a white woman without a high school diploma. A working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that the wealthiest Black mothers die of pregnancy-related causes at more than twice the rate of the poorest white mothers.

A group-based approach
For Rainford, addressing the problem requires completely reimagining the current system from the ground up.
Her clinic’s model of care incorporates methods proven to drive improvement in the areas where Black women experience worse outcomes. The physicians will monitor specific metrics for their patients, including birth weight, NICU admissions and c-section rates, and then compare them to state averages.
Instead of typical prenatal appointments where patients and providers meet one-on-one for a few minutes, patients at Enrich attend group appointments, which Rainford refers to as “motherhood circles.” 
A 2022 study of 2,400 pregnant women published by the Yale School of Public Health found that group prenatal care dramatically decreased the risks of preterm birth, low birth weight and NICU admissions.
The motherhood circles last roughly an hour and a half, and Rainford meets with all the expectant mothers at once. Doulas and other clinicians also participate, and some appointments include visits from community partners or specialists who offer expertise on topics like fitness, nutrition and lactation. During the session, Rainford conducts quick private check-ins, where she performs a routine obstetric exam and listens to any individual concerns, but otherwise, the entire appointment occurs with the full group. 
“They’re able to sit with a clinician, doulas, and each other — to have time for extensive interaction, community support, engagement, and facilitation. You just can’t do that in 15 or 20 minutes,” Rainford said.
The clinic also accepts patients who want care under the traditional model of one-on-one appointments.
Each patient at Enrich also gets paired with a doula. Research shows that doulas improve outcomes for both the mother and child — reducing rates of C-sections, premature births, and long labors, as well as lowering anxiety and stress.

While Enrich Health is designed to address challenges faced by Black women, patients of any race who feel underserved by the current system are welcome, Rainford said.
“We’re here because traditional care has not worked, and we don’t believe it will ever work to correct the problem,” Rainford said. “The whole goal of this is to use the best evidence from the literature to achieve the outcomes we want.”
How state policy helped open the door
Like many states around the country, Connecticut has tried to address racial equity in maternal care through policy. 
This year, the state Department of Social Services launched a value-based payment model for Medicaid enrollees seeking maternity care. The initiative, known as the “maternity bundle,” contributed to Rainford’s decision to start Enrich Health in Connecticut. 
“We decided to develop this innovative way of paying providers for value to address those racial and ethnic disparities in maternal and birth outcomes,” Fatmata Williams, deputy Medicaid director at DSS and one of the program’s designers, said. It’s also designed to improve outcomes for other groups, as well, like people with substance use disorders, Williams added.
Instead of compensating physicians solely based on the number of services they provide, the maternity bundle compensates them at a flat rate per patient, but also offers them the opportunity to get rewarded for reporting and improving outcomes across ten quality measures. 
Providers get paid for reporting measures like doula utilization, breastfeeding and preterm births. They also receive compensation for performance on metrics including maternal adverse events and low birth weight. 
The model does not penalize providers who don’t meet the marks, Williams said. “This is all upside only,” she said. “If [providers] do well in the quality measures, they get some money for that.”
The state’s approach appealed to Rainford because her clinic’s model was designed to improve many of the outcomes tracked for the maternity bundle.
“That is directly aligned with our revenue model,” Rainford said. “What the state was doing is part of why we even started in Connecticut.”
Enrich Health is still in its early days, but Rainford and Lee, her co-founder, have ambitious plans for the clinic’s expansion and they believe the concept could reshape maternal care nationally. They imagine a future where Enrich Health offers motherhood circles around the country.
“That is our vision,” Rainford said. “To transform health care delivery, first by eliminating health disparities and then giving moms a new option of care.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1016_SR_MaternalHealth_033-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-30 14:05:09.464326

An Orange County judge Thursday morning agreed to drop Tina Allgeo’s second-degree murder charge after the 47-year-old took a plea deal, pleading no contest to aggravated battery. Allgeo was sentenced to 18 months in prison followed by 10 years of probation.
The local case took on a statewide angle when Uthmeier in September publicly bashed Orlando’s Democratic State Attorney, Monique Worrell,  for pursuing a murder charge against Allgeo, whom Uthmeier believed acted in self-defense under Florida’s Stand Your Ground law. Although Allgeo initially claimed a defense under Stand Your Ground, on Thursday she changed course.
Monique Worrell via her webpage
Still, Uthmeier celebrated the dropped murder charge on social media.
“We’re glad to see that Orlando State Attorney Worrell took our advice and dropped the unjust murder charge against Tina Allgeo this morning. Ms. Allgeo clearly acted in self-defense,” Uthmeier posted. “In Florida, we will protect the right to stand your ground against violent aggressors.”

The Allgeo case served as another chapter in the deepening feud between Uthmeier and Worrell, who first clashed through Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2023. When Uthmeier served as the governor’s chief of staff, Worrell was suspended for allegedly neglecting “her duty to faithfully prosecute crime in her jurisdiction.”
Despite this, Worrell won her seat back in November 2024, unseating the attorney DeSantis had appointed to replace her.
Most recently, Uthmeier last month accused Worrell of refusing to prosecute pedophiles. In April, he said she was slow-walking and ignoring a mounting backlog of cases.
Worrell has denied all wrongdoing, accusing Uthmeier in turn of incompetence.
What happened?
The Orange County Grand Jury indicted Allgeo in February for the second-degree murder with a firearm of 42-year-old Mihail Tsvetkov. Surveillance footage shows Allgeo outside of her car, taking photos of Tsvetkov’s plates. When Tsvetkov drove away, she pursued him and struck his car with hers, the Phoenix previously reported.
A red light camera video then follows Tsvetkov as he exits his car, yanks open Allgeo’s car door, and begins to beat her, seemingly attempting to pull her out of her vehicle. Allgeo then pulls the trigger on her firearm, shooting Tsvetkov “in the face” and killing him almost instantly.
Uthmeier said Allgeo acted under the state’s Stand Your Ground law, which was passed in 2005. The law allows Floridians to use deadly force in self-defense as long as they are not engaged in criminal activity.
Worrell disagreed. During her quarterly meeting, she said, “The Attorney General has political motivations to try to label me as an anti-Second Amendment person; that is not the case,” ClickOrlando reported.
She added that Stand Your Ground still has limitations.
“What those limitations include is one, if you’re the aggressor, you now have a duty to retreat, and two, if you are in the commission of a crime, you have the duty to retreat,” Worrell said.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)Republican and Democratic former governors and members of Congress, billionaires and democracy reform organizations are coming to the defense of Maine’s law in a case over the legality of campaign finance restrictions. 
This broad support was demonstrated in amici curiae, or friend of the court, briefs filed in the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston on Wednesday. These briefs add to the arguments made by the State of Maine and another from the non-profit Equal Citizens and the committee behind the successful referendum in their appeals filed last week. 
In 2024, Maine voters overwhelmingly passed a citizen’s initiative that placed limits on contributions to political action committees that independently spend money to try to support or defeat candidates, commonly referred to as super PACs. 
The state was sued shortly after by conservative PACs, but that had been part of supporters’ plan all along. Their ultimate goal is to get the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that PACs should be regulated.
Latest filings in campaign finance court battle argue Maine has legal right to regulate super PACs

The friend of the court briefs each come at the case in a different way based on each group’s experiences with super PACs. 
In one brief, former elected officials described the pressure candidates feel to court super PACs and then serve the interests of their donors.
Issue One, a nonprofit that seeks to reduce the role of money in politics, filed this brief, which was co-signed by 24 former governors and members of Congress — half of which served as Democrats and half Republicans, including former U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine. Others include former U.S. Senate Minority LeaderTom Daschle, a Democrat from South Dakota, former Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold of Wisconsin and former Republican Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson, who considers himself an independent. 
Another brief was filed by a group of billionaires. They argue unlimited super PAC contributions distort markets and reward insider influence. 
Among those behind that brief are Steve Jurvetson and Vin Ryan, who were some of the largest donors to the ballot question committee behind the 2024 initiative. The others are businessman and television personality Mark Cuban, who was previously a lead investor on Shark Tank, and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. 
Several democracy reform organizations filed briefs in which they argued that unchecked super PAC contributions breed corruption. This type of argument was made by the Brennan Center for Justice, the Campaign Legal Center, Demos and Common Cause, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and Mainers for Working Families.
They also argued that the current lack of regulations is not supported by legal precedent, which is the overarching defense the State of Maine and Equal Citizens made in their appeals. 
That argument is also fleshed out in an amicus brief filed by the constitutional scholars whose rationale serves as the basis for why  those behind Maine’s law believe the Supreme Court will ultimately rule to reinstate contribution limits. 
The State of Maine and Equal Citizens both made the case that the 2010 Supreme Court decision Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission actually allows for super PACs to be regulated. It’s a later lower court ruling, SpeechNow.org v. FEC, that they argue is incorrect. 
In Citizens United, the high court ruled that corporations and unions have the right to spend unlimited money in elections because they have free speech rights under the First Amendment — unless there is a risk of “quid pro quo” corruption, essentially a favor for a favor.
In SpeechNow, the D.C. Circuit Court upheld that contributions to PACs cannot be regulated, either, so long as the PAC is independent. 
In their brief, Harvard Law professor emeritus Larry Tribe, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution Norm Eisen and Chicago Law professor emeritus Al Alschuler (a Maine resident who was part of the group that submitted the original referendum petition) explain that large contributions to PACs inevitably create a risk of corruption because donors and candidates have the opportunity to collaborate even if a PAC is “independent.” 
Therefore, the scholars argue, contributions to PACs can be regulated by Congress.
“There are very few solutions in American politics that unite Republicans, billionaires, and Harvard Law professors,” Equal Citizens Executive Director Maia Cook said in a statement on Thursday. “The fact that our initiative to reinstate super PAC contribution limits has received vocal support from amici like Mark Cuban, Reid Hoffman, Olympia Snowe, and Laurence Tribe demonstrates the strength of our argument: Americans deserve a representative government, by the people and for the people.”

“In law enforcement, we’re supposed to set the bar of honesty. We’re supposed to set the bar on trust in our community. We can’t violate it,” Haywood added. “This is devastating news, and we just got to pick up the pieces and regain the public trust.”

The utility is exploring if a third-party could buy and operate the coal units. (Photo courtesy of Duke Energy)Indiana regulators on Wednesday approved Duke Energy Indiana’s $3.3 billion plan — plus financing costs — to replace two coal-powered units at the west-central Cayuga Generating Station with natural gas versions.
Included was a settlement with a group of the utility’s largest industrial customers — and an agreement with coal producers to study third-party operation of the retired coal units.
“For generations, our Cayuga power plant in Vermillion County has served the state, and today’s decision ensures it will continue to be a major source of our state’s power generation for decades to come,” a Duke Energy Indiana statement reads, in part.
After more than 55 years in operation, Cayuga is the oldest coal-fired facility left in Duke’s Hoosier portfolio.
Ratepayer protection agency recommends against Duke’s coal-to-gas push

After the replacement, the two combined-cycle natural gas units would add more than 470 megawatts to the aging facility’s current 1005-megawatt capacity.
The undertaking was approved as a “clean energy” project with financial incentives, including the authority to charge ratepayers for financing while the units are under construction.
Duke Energy Indiana estimated the approach would save customers $812 million over the project’s life — predicting a total of $5.3 billion instead of the $6.6 billion expected under a traditional general rate case scenario.
The rate impact will hit in six-month increments, helping “reduce any rate shock that could be otherwise associated with implementing a construction project in base rates through a single step,” the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission’s Wednesday order reads.
The state agency tasked with protecting utility customers previously asked regulators to reject the plan, calling it “ill-advised” in May. Office of Utility Consumer Counselor witnesses cited the sheer cost, rapidly changing regulations and technological advancements in their testimony.
Duke has estimated that the first tracker filed would add $1.87 to the typical residential customer’s monthly bill. But that amount would rise as construction continues — with the OUCC predicting a total impact of $19.37 monthly.
The agency didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on the approval.
Duke Energy Indiana’s regulatory win comes with a settlement with Reliable Energy, a trade association representing major Indiana coal producers, for a study that could result in third-party operation of the coal units at Cayuga. The group previously opposed the coal-to-gas plan.

Reliable Energy President Savannah Kerstiens said the agreement “represents a significant step toward Governor (Mike) Braun’s vision of ensuring reliable, affordable energy, preserving valuable in-state generation, and strengthening Indiana’s power supply.”
“As power demand continues to rise, a central goal of this vision is to position Indiana as an energy exporter rather than an importer — a milestone that can be achieved by keeping every megawatt of capacity online,” she continued. “Enabling third parties to help advance that effort demonstrates the innovative, entrepreneurial approach that defines Indiana’s energy strategy.”
The proceeds from any sale would flow to the utility’s ratepayers.
Duke Energy Indiana also invoked Braun’s name, saying the settlement “aligns” with recent executive orders “encouraging additions to the state’s power supplies and making sure there’s careful evaluation before retiring coal units.”
The utility will look at the technical feasibility of simultaneously operating the coal and natural gas units, including the potential for “full(y) decoupling” the units.
The study was set to begin as soon as regulators approved the coal-to-gas replacement and has to be done in eight months, at most, according to the settlement agreement.
The filing lays out a detailed list of what must be studied, plus a timeline for Duke Energy Indiana to follow on stakeholder engagement, a request for proposals and bidding process, a due diligence and a negotiations period.
The coal units are scheduled to retire in 2029 and 2030. The utility agreed not to shut them down before 2029 — and to pause demolition during the request for proposals process, until regulators say demolition can continue.

Some clinicians and hospitals are betting on an extension of Medicare coverage for virtual care while others think creatively to cover the costs of care.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Providers try to keep telehealth available in Vermont, four weeks into a lapse in most Medicare reimbursements.","Dr. Roslinde Collins-Gibbard consults on critically ill patients from Dartmouth Health’s Telehealth hub.  Photo courtesy of Dartmouth Health
For many of the patients served by the Montpelier community health clinic All Brains Belong, being able to access health care through virtual and telehealth care appointments during and after the Covid-19 pandemic was a game changer.
When telehealth care became more widespread, “many patients were able to access health care that worked for them for the first time,” said Mel Houser, the founding physician of All Brains Belong, which focuses on providing care for patients with long Covid, chronic conditions or neurodevelopmental differences.
Even for the region’s large, mainstream providers, the broader flexibility for telehealth has proven crucial to many of their rural patients.
Dartmouth Health, among New England’s largest health care providers, has seen its online consulting with network specialists grow exponentially under new reimbursement rules that quickly became the norm for public and private insurers during the public health emergency.
But those federal rules changed overnight on Oct. 1, as some of the pandemic-era flexibilities that allowed Medicare to cover virtual appointments lapsed with the new federal fiscal year. Health care providers’ advocates nationwide have lobbied for years to make them permanent, and had at least hoped to see Congress approve further extensions as part of the next federal funding bill.
Now, with that funding bill still stalled — and large portions of the federal government shut down — the telehealth practices of small Vermont clinics and large hospital networks alike remain in limbo, along with the Medicare patients they serve. Nearly a quarter of the state’s population is on Medicare — 158,3600 individuals in 2025.
Separately, the lapse in authorization also means video or telehealth appointments can no longer count as the face-to-face encounters that Medicare requires for patients to be eligible for home health or hospice care.
Vermont state law requires that in-state insurers cover telehealth services to the same extent as they would cover the equivalent in-person services. But as a federal program, Medicare — the country’s health insurance program for people age 65 and older and those with certain disabilities — is not subject to that law.
Now that authorizations have reverted to pre-pandemic rules, Medicare covers telehealth — both audio-only and video interactions — only for mental health or substance use disorders, acute stroke treatment, or end-stage renal disease dialysis. For these conditions, updated rules allowing reimbursement for virtual care have been approved already through previous federal legislation. 
But outside those specific kinds of treatments, telehealth visits are currently not eligible for Medicare coverage at all in metropolitan areas, which in Vermont means in and around Chittenden County. In the rural parts of the state, telehealth visits will be covered only if they occur in designated Medicare “originating sites” such as a local clinician’s office.
That rule negates many of the accessibility benefits telehealth opens up, Houser and other providers point out.
Many of her patients rely on the at-home format for a variety of reasons, she said. Some patients are thankful for the freedom from the risks of catching a virus in the clinic. Others appreciate avoiding sensory overload of visiting the office that can overwhelm some people with sensory issues. For another group, virtual visits remove the stress of needing to find or pay for transportation to the office.
Though commercial insurers may follow the standards Medicare sets, both insurers who sell plans on Vermont Health Connect, the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace — Blue Cross Blue Shield of Vermont and MVP — are continuing to cover most telehealth care, spokespeople for each insurer confirmed to VTDigger. Vermont Medicaid coverage for telemedicine is also not changing.
At All Brains Belong, nearly half of the 350 patients her small clinic serves are on Medicare or Medicaid, Houser said.
While Vermont Medicaid and private health insurers are continuing to reimburse for virtual and telehealth services, Houser said she is now unable to bill Medicare for the care. For now, those patients can self-pay for the service, tapping into the sliding scale costs the clinic is able to offer with a mutual-aid Community Health Access Fund, or cover the cost of services with the clinic’s unique bartering service-exchange program. 
“We are trying to catch people in the gaps,” Houser said. Still, for a small clinic, the loss of cashflow is substantial, she said.  
Banking on a solution
The two largest providers for the state, Dartmouth Health and UVM Health, are continuing to provide telehealth services to Medicare patients and hold onto the bills, rather than seek other payments from Medicare patients. They are banking on the possibility that Congress will eventually act to expand the rules and approve the treatment retroactively.
Dartmouth Health has a broad range of telehealth care for patients in and out of the hospital, said Kevin Curtis, the medical director of Dartmouth Health’s Connected Care program. The network sees about 500 visits per week from Medicare beneficiaries using telehealth to their home, Curtis estimated. Nearly 200 of those patients are Vermont residents, he said. 
At UVM Health, the Network has nearly 40,000 Medicare-related telehealth visits per year, said the network’s spokesperson Annie Mackin.
More than 6.7 million Medicare recipients used telehealth in 2024 — nearly 25% of the population eligible for it, according to claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Utilization in 2023 and 2022 was similar, while the pandemic years of 2020 and 2021 saw much higher use, with nearly half of those eligible taking advantage of Medicare coverage for telehealth.  
Primarily, Dartmouth Health’s Curtis sees the need for telehealth care continuity as an access and equity issue, much as Houser at All Brains Belong does. The patients Curtis sees most benefit from at-home telehealth care are those with obstacles to getting to an in-person appointment, whether it’s a physical mobility challenge or no access to a bus or car to reach a clinic. 
For some patients, in the remote reaches of New England that Dartmouth serves, specialty care could be a two-hour drive away, Curtis said. For others, the very nature of their medical condition — like an autoimmune condition — can make getting seen in person a higher-risk endeavor.

Also, Dartmouth Health has embraced telehealth as a great answer to many of the challenges that rural health care systems are facing, he said. It increases individuals’ access to specialists and helps make a hospital’s investment in those specialists more worthwhile.
Their providers have redesigned their physical office space around this hybrid model and now rely on telehealth and virtual appointments, making it difficult to shift their practices. 
“You can’t just say ‘alright, let’s bring 40 patients back in a day.’ There’s no place for them,” Curtis said.  
A barrier to home health care
For Vermont providers of home health care and end-of-life care, the loss of Covid-19 era flexibilities around virtual care has presented its own bevy of difficulties.
For Medicare to cover home health visits or hospice care at home, the federal insurance requires a face-to-face encounter with a provider — which previously could occur remotely, explained Eric Covey, the interim executive director of VNAs of Vermont, the trade association for visiting nurses and other home health care providers in the state.
He described a situation where, without telehealth, homebound Vermonters who may not have access to transportation may delay or forgo their visit with a provider that they need for the approval. “A chronic condition could worsen, and ultimately, they could end up in a situation where their condition worsens to a point that they need to be hospitalized,” he said. 
That outcome is not just detrimental to the individual whose health is at risk, Covey said. It’s less expensive and taxing on the overall health care system to intervene earlier compared to sending someone to the emergency room or more acute care. 
Many patients do receive referrals for home health or hospice care when they are being discharged from the hospital. However, for the small number of individuals who need these referrals through other means, the remote option can be crucial. 
“The issue isn’t the volume. It’s the kind of severity and importance of the need that is about access to care for Vermonters,” Covey said.
It’s this element — the specific need each individual has for this care, rather than the sweeping breadth of all who use and stand to lose it — that concerns Curtis, the Dartmouth Health doctor.  
“We talked about a lot of this in numbers and impact and 500 (visits) a week, but each one of these is a Medicare beneficiary. Each of these (statistics) is one person who is a Medicare beneficiary, who needs care in their rural setting,” he said. “There are still 500 people every week who we just need to get the care to, whatever it takes.”

(Photo courtesy of Maine Family Planning)Starting Friday, primary care services will no longer be available at Maine Family Planning clinics in Presque Isle, Houlton and Ellsworth after the Trump administration barred federal Medicaid funding from going to the reproductive care provider.
The organization, which operates 18 clinics across the state, typically receives about $1.9 million in Medicaid reimbursements each year. Half of Maine Family Planning’s patients, many of whom live in rural areas, rely on MaineCare, the state’s Medicaid program, to pay for health care services.
In a statement Thursday, the organization said they saw more than 600 primary care patients last year. Those patients will now need to find an alternative provider, which will likely be difficult as the state already has a shortage of primary care physicians. 
George Hill, president and CEO of Maine Family Planning, said some of the organization’s patients have been seeing their doctors and nurses for years. 
“Telling those patients we can’t see them anymore has been devastating, especially knowing that some of them will find it too difficult to get a new provider and may just forego care,” Hill said in a statement. 
According to the Rural Health Information Hub, 13 of the state’s 16 counties are considered health professional shortage areas.
Maine Family Planning will continue to provide family planning and reproductive health services, though the organization said those too could be disrupted. Medicaid funding is not used for abortion services but the Trump administration also revoked family planning funding under what’s known as Title X in April.
The shuttering of the primary care practices was initially announced earlier this month after a federal judge denied the organization’s request for a preliminary injunction to block a provision in congressional Republicans’ massive tax cut and spending law that bars Medicaid funding from going to nonprofits that provide abortion services. 
That lawsuit is ongoing and will eventually be heard in the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston. In a separate suit, Planned Parenthood, which was also impacted by the new law, was initially granted a preliminary injunction that was later reversed by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in September. 
“While we wait for answers from the court, one thing is clear – the loss of this funding has already caused irreparable damage to our clinics and our community,” said Hill. 
Despite that, both Maine Family Planning and Planned Parenthood of Northern New England have said they will continue to treat reproductive care patients on MaineCare free of charge as long as they are able.

The two programs, the Personal Responsibility Education Program (PREP) grant and the Title V Sexual Risk Avoidance Education (SRAE) grant, are designed to “provide sexual health education that is ‘evidence-based,’ ‘medically accurate and complete,’ ‘age-appropriate,’ and ‘culturally appropriate.’
Lawyers for the Department of Health and Human Services argued that removing gender identity from the curricula from these programs would meet the statutory requirement to make the information “medically accurate and complete.” The court pushed back against this statement, citing a broad consensus among the medical community that gender identity and biological sex are distinct. 
“The Court also does not agree that the concept of gender identity ‘fall[s] outside the core medical and biological content that is central to sexual-risk education’,” the order granting the injunction read. “A curricula that denies the existence of transgender and gender diverse people is not medically accurate and complete.”
The state of Michigan, one of the plaintiffs in the case, was facing a loss of nearly $3.4 million in grant funding for the Personal Responsibility Education Program after HHS threatened to pull the funding, according to a press release from Attorney General Dana Nessel’s office. The grant funds programming at 25 school buildings and 8 community-based organizations in Michigan. 
“This unlawful action by the Trump Administration would have put the health and safety of our kids at risk,” Nessel said in the release. “For trans youth, who already face higher rates of bullying, isolation, and health disparities, this attempt to erase their very existence from educational programs was not just cruel but dangerous. I will continue to fight against illegal measures that jeopardize the well-being of Michiganders.”
The states’ original court filing also included the argument that requiring the removal of any mention of gender identity would be in violation of Michigan’s Elliot-Larsen Civil Rights Act, which includes sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity or expression as protected characteristics under the law. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
District Judge Ann Aiken wrote in her order granting the injunction that, “In Michigan, the ‘loss of PREP funding would threaten Michigan’s historic reductions in teen pregnancy, as the program is central to the state’s prevention strategy’.”
The states also argued that, since the funding for this program is appropriated by Congress, the Trump administration and the executive branch imposing new requirements on the funding was an overreach of authority. Aiken agreed. 
“Absent congressional authorization, the Administration may not redistribute or withhold properly appropriated funds in order to effectuate its own policy goals,” she wrote in the opinion. “The Appropriations Clause does not provide the Executive branch a tool that it can use to thwart Congress’s will. Quite the opposite.”
The press release from Nessel’s office concurred with that finding.
“Congress created the grant program with clear statutory requirements that are at direct odds with the Trump Administration’s baseless insistence that gender is absolute, fixed, and binary, and that any reference to transgender status or gender identity must be erased altogether,” the release stated.
While a final decision in the suit still has yet to be issued, the injunction will ensure that funding for the programs continues until that decision comes. Aiken also stated in her order that she believes the plaintiffs states are “likely to succeed” on the merits of their claim.

Tyler Clancy, R-Provo speaks at a ceremonial bill signing at the Utah State Capitol on April 15, 2025 (Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch)Shortly after announcing Utah’s current top homelessness leader, former Senate president Wayne Niederhauser, will be retiring Dec. 5, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox has picked his successor. 
The governor has appointed another familiar face from the Utah Legislature — Rep. Tyler Clancy, R-Provo — as the state’s next homelessness coordinator, a position that leads the state’s Office of Homeless Services. 
Clancy, however, won’t start in his new role until March 9, after the 2026 legislative session ends. That means the state won’t have a homeless coordinator during a legislative session when unanswered questions remain over how the state will fund expensive plans for a new 1,300-bed homeless campus, with state leaders envisioning it to have hundreds of beds for civil commitment and court-ordered drug treatment. 
Utah homeless coordinator to retire before key legislative session for homelessness funding

But Clancy — who also works as a detective with the Provo Police Department, assigned to the Special Victims Unit and the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force — will continue to serve as a legislator representing House District 60 through the 2026 session. 
And he’s no stranger to homelessness policy. 
After he was first elected to the House in 2023 as the state’s youngest lawmaker at the age of 25, Clancy has worked on legislation to bring more “accountability” and “healing” into Utah’s homelessness system. Earlier this year, he successfully sponsored HB329, a wide-ranging bill that enacted a long list of tweaks to Utah’s homeless system, but most notably it added more safety requirements in homeless shelters, including bag checks. 
Clancy has also sponsored bills related to public safety, drug policy and rehabilitation, “earning recognition from national and local organizations for results-driven leadership,” the governor’s office said in a news release issued Thursday morning announcing his appointment. 
Before being elected to the Legislature, Clancy worked as executive director of the Pioneer Park Coalition, a group of Salt Lake City community and business leaders that advocated for action to address homelessness issues in the Rio Grande neighborhood. 
“Rep. Clancy knows the work on the ground and at the policy table, and that mix will sharpen coordination and results,” Cox said in a prepared statement. “Building on the foundation Wayne Niederhauser laid, we will strengthen Utah’s response and help more Utahns find stability.”
Clancy, in a statement, expressed gratitude for the “opportunity to serve.” 
“Utah does best when we work together with clear goals and real accountability,” Clancy said. “My focus is on coordination that helps people move forward with dignity.”

“There’s so much in this bill that has changed from what we passed here, a lot of it not for the better,” said state Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus.
The bill will now go to conference committee, a temporary group of Ohio House and Senate lawmakers that come together to work out differences between versions of the bill. 
State Sen. Steve Huffman, R-Tipp City, introduced Ohio S.B. 56 in January. 
“I think it’s abundantly clear we need a regulatory structure around hemp and intoxicating hemp products,” said Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon. “We have some issues to work out, but I’m confident we can work those issues out.”
The 2018 Farm Bill says hemp can be grown legally if it contains less than 0.3% THC.
As S.B. 56 is currently written, only a licensed hemp dispensary would be able to sell intoxicating hemp products to adults 21 and older. 
The dispensaries would be required to meet standards for testing, advertising, and packaging. A 10% tax would be added to intoxicating hemp sales. 
The bill would limit the number of active hemp dispensaries to 400. 
The bill would allow certain hemp dispensaries to be grandfathered in if they sold intoxicating hemp products on or before Aug. 30 and hemp products sales surpassed 80% of their total sales for 2024 or the 12 months before the bill takes effect. 
Ohio Sen. Shane Wilkin, R-Hillsboro, said the bill fails to close the loophole for synthetic THC. 
“The bill would also allow for an enormous amount of hemp dispensaries to be placed around the state with no restrictions on how close they could be to a marijuana dispensary,” he said. “… Additionally, there would be grandfathering of those currently selling these unregulated, untested products.” 
THC-infused beverages are also included in the bill. 
A bar or restaurant would be able to sell 5 milligram THC-infused beverages for patrons to drink on site, while a store would be able to sell 10 milligram THC-infused beverages for carry-out. 
“There are several changes to the marijuana law, as well as drinkable hemp beverages that I believe need more vetting,” Wilkin said. 
On the marijuana side, the bill would reduce the THC levels in adult-use marijuana extracts from a maximum of 90% down to a maximum of 70%, cap THC levels in adult-use flower to 35%, limit the number of active marijuana dispensaries and prohibit smoking in most public places. 
Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote, and sales started in August 2024. 
Ohio recreational marijuana sales topped $702.5 million in the first year. 
Ohio lawmakers can change the law since it passed as a citizen initiative not a constitutional amendment. 
The bill would give 36% of adult-use marijuana sale revenue to municipalities and townships that have recreational marijuana dispensaries and people would also be able to apply for expungement of low-level marijuana convictions. 
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced earlier this month a 90-day executive order that bans the sale of intoxicating hemp products that started on Oct.14, but a Franklin County Court of Common judge has placed a temporary restraining order on DeWine’s ban until Dec. 2.  
“The people of Ohio want us to do something about these products,” DeMora said. 
“The governor tried to do something, and was stuck because he didn’t do it the proper way. It is up to us to make sure now that we can do something to end these things to get out of the hands of kids.” 
Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood, said she welcomes conference committee. 
“We feel a sense of urgency as well,” she said. “The other thing we’re aware of is get this right while there’s this pause in the governor’s ban to get it done.”

On CNN Thursday morning, Lamont said Mamdani has run a great campaign.
If he wins?
“Now it’s time to transition,” Lamont said. “Is he a mayor who can govern? Part of that’s going to be reaching out to the business community and Wall Street and saying, ‘I’m here to fight for all the people.’”
Lamont specifically credits Mamdani with focusing on affordability on the campaign trail, a top issue for Americans nationwide.
However, he echoed popular sentiments that have followed Mamdani on the trail; that he’s a 34-year-old New York State assemblymember with only a few years of experience in elected office.
“I think Mamdani, better than any of the other Democrats, is really making affordability front and center. That’s why he’s a very strong frontrunner in this race,” Lamont said. “I am reminded, though, of what George Washington once told Alexander Hamilton: ‘Revolutions are easy, governing is hard.’ So we got to think about the next step.”
Mamdani, a self-described democratic-socialist, has turned heads with his proposals. He wants city-run grocery stores, a rent freeze for stabilized tenants, free city buses, and higher taxes on the city’s wealthiest 1%.
He is 10 points ahead of former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo in the polls. Lamont had endorsed Cuomo before the primary.
Election day is Tuesday, Nov. 4. More than 370,000 New Yorkers have already voted.

The Iowa Board of Nursing has issued an emergency order suspending the license of registered nurse Kenneth Wayne Clark of Ankeny. The order is based on a disciplinary charge that Clark has engaged in unethical behavior or practices that are harmful or detrimental to the public by acting in a manner that is contradictory to professional decorum.
Court records show that on Aug. 1, 2025, Wayne’s home and vehicle were searched by the Polk County Sheriff’s Office. The sheriff’s office alleges it found methamphetamine, psilocybin mushrooms, and marijuana, as well as multiple pieces of drug paraphernalia — including glass pipes, bongs and storage containers for marijuana and methamphetamine.
On Sept. 9, 2025, Ankeny police alleged that from March 1, 2025, to July 30, 2025, Clark knowingly and unlawfully downloaded or possessed on his cellphone videos that are “consistent with child sexual abuse material.”
Prosecutors have charged Clark with 10 counts of purchasing or possessing the depiction of a minor engaged in a sex act. Police records indicate there are more than “2,600 unclassified videos and 60,511 images” at issue in the case, including at least 50 videos “consistent with child sex abuse material” that were allegedly downloaded onto the phone.
Last month, the court entered a no-contact order against Clark barring any contact with minors.  The Board of Nursing alleges the no-contact order is particularly relevant to its emergency order in that Clark was “doing in-home care for disabled children” prior to his arrest.
The board alleges Clark declined to sign a voluntary agreement not to practice nursing while the court case is pending, resulting in the emergency order.

Read this story in English.
Al comienzo de un nuevo año escolar, aumenta el número de niños que reportan necesidades graves de salud mental. Muchos se enfrentan a la ansiedad y el estrés al regresar a la rutina escolar diaria.
Para las familias de Connecticut con niños que necesitan atención de salud mental, los Centros de Crisis Urgentes ofrecen tratamiento de emergencia. Los UCC (Centros de Crisis Urgentes) tienen como objetivo apoyar a los niños que experimentan crisis de salud mental brindándoles acceso a tratamiento y apoyo.
Esto es lo que necesita saber sobre estos centros y lo que pueden hacer por los niños.
¿Qué es un Centro de Crisis Urgente?
Los Centros de Crisis Urgentes son instalaciones financiadas por el Estado y operadas por entidades privadas que ofrecen tratamiento para niños con necesidades urgentes de salud mental. Funcionan como una alternativa a los departamentos de emergencias hospitalarias, lo que permite que los niños permanezcan en sus hogares durante el tratamiento en lugar de recibir atención hospitalaria.
Están equipados para manejar crisis como pensamientos suicidas o autolesiones, sentimientos de depresión o ansiedad, abuso de sustancias y más. Sin embargo, no son departamentos de emergencias equipados para brindar atención médica inmediata. Para emergencias médicas, los centros indican a las familias que llamen al 911 o visiten el hospital más cercano.
Para niños y adolescentes de 18 años o menos, el personal capacitado de los centros trabaja para reducir las crisis de salud mental, completar evaluaciones y conectar a los jóvenes con los servicios. La mayoría de los seguros son aceptados en todos los centros. Alrededor de la mitad de los niños tratados en los UCC de Connecticut tienen seguro de Medicaid.
Para atender a los residentes de las zonas más rurales de Connecticut, los Centros de Crisis Urgentes también trabajan con servicios móviles de intervención en crisis de emergencia, también conocidos por los proveedores como Centros Móviles de Crisis, que brindan servicios similares a los hogares de los niños, para garantizar que se aborden las necesidades inmediatas de salud mental.
¿Cómo acceder a ellos?
Hay cuatro ubicaciones en Connecticut: Hartford, New Haven, New London y Waterbury. Funcionan sin cita previa y brindan acceso inmediato a recursos de salud mental. Hay 72 plazas diarias en cada centro.
En Hartford, las familias pueden visitar “The Village for Families and Children”. De lunes a viernes, están abiertos de 7 a.m. a 11 p.m. Los sábados y domingos, están abiertos de 3 p.m. a 11 p.m.
En New Haven, las familias pueden visitar el Hospital Yale de New Haven. En todo el Sistema de Salud de Yale New Haven se ofrece atención médica de emergencia para niños en todo momento, en cada departamento de emergencias y centro de atención urgente.
En New London, las familias pueden visitar la Agencia para Niños y Familias del Sureste de Connecticut. Abren de lunes a viernes, de 8 a. m. a 10 p. m. y los sábados de 10 a. m. a 6 p. m.
En Waterbury, las familias pueden visitar “Wellmore Behavioral Health”, una organización sin fines de lucro que opera el centro de crisis. Para hacer una derivación u obtener ayuda, el centro recomienda a las familias llamar al 1-855-WELLMORE.
¿Qué tan exitosos han sido?
En 2022, la legislación estatal estableció los Centros de Atención de Crisis Urgentes (UCC, por sus siglas en inglés) en respuesta al aumento de la demanda de atención de salud mental, citando un repunte en los suicidios juveniles desde la pandemia. Comenzaron a operar al año siguiente. Desde su apertura, miles de niños han visitado estos centros, y más del 95% de los visitantes han podido regresar a casa después de su visita sin necesidad de ir a la sala de emergencias.
“Esa es una tasa de éxito fenomenal. Es una tasa de éxito que no vemos en la mayoría de los otros servicios que brindamos”, dijo Hector Glynn, director ejecutivo de The Village for Families & Children.
Los padres cuyos hijos han recibido tratamiento en los centros han dicho que están satisfechos con el apoyo que ofrecen los UCC. “Cuidarán de su hijo. Se ha convertido en nuestro refugio seguro”, dijo Lisa Paradis, una madre cuya hija ha recibido tratamiento en los centros de crisis, el mes pasado.
¿Cómo se sostienen?
A pesar de los resultados favorables, el futuro de los UCC y los centros móviles de crisis se ve amenazado por la falta de financiación.
La financiación de los UCC depende principalmente de las asignaciones del presupuesto estatal a través de Medicaid. Pero aproximadamente la mitad de los pacientes que atienden los centros no están cubiertos por Medicaid, lo que significa que los centros no pueden acceder a gran parte de ese dinero. Además, el seguro privado generalmente tiene tasas de reembolso más bajas que Medicaid. Muchos pacientes con seguro privado también tienen planes de atención médica con deducibles altos y no pueden pagar las tarifas. Cuando no pueden pagar, las organizaciones sin fines de lucro condonan la deuda.
El programa de atención móvil en situaciones de crisis recibió aproximadamente 8,6 millones de dólares en el año fiscal 2027, pero nada en el año fiscal 2026, que comenzó el 1 de julio. Este verano, los funcionarios estatales estaban considerando la posibilidad de utilizar fondos no gastados de la ayuda para la COVID-19 para mantener los centros operativos hasta finales de año e integrar cualquier otra financiación adicional que pudiera ser necesaria para sostener sus operaciones hasta 2027.

A nurse practitioner who has specialized in allergy and asthma care for more than two decades, she was forced to close three of her rural allergy clinics in central Missouri and consolidate her practice at her clinic in Columbia.
Why? Missouri is one of 11 states that require advanced practice nurses such as Markes to have oversight from a physician.
The rules on how nurse practitioners can see patients in Missouri are meticulous. Nurse practitioners must be within 75 miles of the physician who oversees them on a daily basis, and physicians must sign off on the nurse’s patient records.
When Markes’ overseeing physician got reassigned during COVID and was moved out of the 75-mile radius from her clinics, she had no choice but to close them.
“There was no way I could be at those clinics and be within the mileage of where he was,” Markes said. “So I closed three rural clinics just for specialty care.”
Some of her patients followed her to Columbia, but others lost care.
“You have to take a day off work, or you have the gas money to get here,” Markes said. “It just adds to health care dollars. And it’s not direct … you have to get there first.”
While the rules were designed to keep patients safe, nurses say they don’t do much to improve the care those patients get. In fact, they argue it is a roadblock to Missourians’ access to primary care or mental health providers.
And while advanced practice nurses like nurse practitioners and midwives have been pushing for decades to get the law changed in Missouri, there’s been almost no momentum in the state legislature.
So Markes is suing Missouri. 
Using an often overlooked part of the state constitution that guarantees the right to earn a living, Markes is hoping that challenging the state’s requirement could lead to better health care for Missourians.
In states where nurse practitioners can practice individually, overall health ranks were 17 spots higher than in states with reduced practices, like Missouri.
And patient access in states where nurse practitioners can practice independently is higher. States with individual practice rights ranked 19 spots higher than states without when it came to patients’ access to care.
 How Missouri’s oversight works 

Missouri is one of only 11 states that still require advanced practice nurses to have oversight from a physician, formally called a collaborative practice agreement.
Nearly every Missouri county has been designated a health professional shortage area when it comes to primary care and mental health care. Recent nationwide data shows that 66% of designated shortage areas were in rural parts of the country.
Research also shows that nurse practitioners are more likely to practice in rural communities. Nationwide, 88% of nurse practitioners are certified in primary care, according to the American Association of Nurse Practitioners.
In Missouri, independent physicians can set the rates they charge to nurse practitioners for their time and oversight.
For Markes, who provides speciality care with oversight from a pulmonologist, it is no small cost.
She budgets more than $50,000 annually to pay her collaborating physician, who she said has little impact on how she cares for patients or runs her clinic.
“He’s there when I need him,” Markes said of her overseeing physician. “There can be as much or as little collaboration, depending on who you’re working with.”
By running her own clinic, Markes is in a unique position. She takes on the cost and administrative burden of meeting the legal requirement of physician oversight.
For nurse practitioners who are part of larger health systems, the hospitals assign an overseeing physician and pay them a bonus for their review. But, practitioners say, the review is retroactive, and mostly means additional time spent looking at patient records that could be spent seeing more patients.
“It’s time that could be better spent taking care of your patients, rather than worrying about the collaborative practice agreement,” said Dawn Stout, a family nurse practitioner in Trenton, near the Iowa border.
Nationwide, 27 states allow nurse practitioners to practice to the full extent of the licensing.
There are limits to what nurse practitioners without full authority can do. They have limits in what medicines they can prescribe, making things like mental health care or pain management especially difficult.
“I have issues maintaining good pain control,” Stout said. “I’m limited to a five-day prescription for narcotics, so I have to jump through the hoop of getting my (physician) to sign off on them.”
Ultimately, nurse practitioners say that beyond checking patient care records and the occasional oversight on what can be prescribed to their patients, they usually don’t have much communication with their physicians or oversight from the state.
“I’ve been at this facility almost 15 years,” Stout said. “Nobody has ever come and checked on our charts to see how many are signed by a physician.”
In an email, the Missouri Board of Healing Arts and the state Board of Nursing, which oversee physicians and nurses respectively, said there is no requirement for state boards to verify collaborative practice agreements.
Physicians must report if they have nurse practitioners they oversee. Otherwise, there is no routine interaction between the boards and the nurses and physicians they oversee.
“It’s a retrospective review,” said Donna Matias, an attorney at Pacific Legal Foundation who is representing Markes in her case against the state. “And there is no enforcement of the review. I have talked to plenty of nurse practitioners who have said, ‘I have never even met my collaborating physician.’’’
“What it does signal is that this is not about health and safety,” she said.
In 2024, legislation to eliminate collaborative practice requirements was introduced in the Missouri House of Representatives. The bill would have removed the requirement for nurse practitioners to have an overseeing physician after 2,000 hours of work — less than a year of full-time nursing practice.
Groups like the Missouri Farm Bureau and individual Missouri nurses submitted testimony in support, citing the changes the legislation could make for patient access.
The Missouri State Medical Association, the Missouri Academy of Family Physicians and individual physicians and osteopathic doctors testified against the legislation, arguing that 2,000 hours is not enough time for a nurse practitioner to gain skills. They also argued the bill would degrade the extensive training other medical professionals receive.
“One thing I do like about collaborative practice is I always have a resource at my fingertips if I need something,” Stout said. “But that same resource would be there even without the collaborative practice agreement.”
 How could full practice authority change patient access to primary care providers?

Although the number of nurse practitioners is growing in Missouri — the state has 16,715 advanced practice registered nurses, double what it did 10 years ago — nurse practitioners are also taking their skills elsewhere.
Nebraska, Iowa and Kansas have all granted advanced practice nurses full practice authority, while Illinois and Arkansas have granted full authority with a few restrictions.
For Terry Thomas, a nurse practitioner who sees patients in Hannibal, making the move from Nebraska to Missouri after the pandemic was complex.
“It was very difficult going from a state with full practice authority in Nebraska to Missouri, which is one of the most restricted states in the U.S. when it comes to nurse practitioners,” Thomas said.
Usually, Thomas said, nurses near state lines will decide to practice in other states.
Stout, the family nurse practitioner in Trenton, is also licensed to practice in Iowa.
“People I’ve known over the years that are from this area, they’re like, ‘I’m not dealing with the restrictions that Missouri has.’ And they’ll go to a state that doesn’t have collaborative practice because it’s so restrictive,” Stout said.
It’s also becoming more difficult to find a physician to oversee your practice, nurse practitioners say. The number of physicians who practice independently is waning, and taking on the liability of another medical professional’s care is a hard sell.
About 77% of physicians in the U.S. are now employed by hospital systems or corporate entities, up sharply since 2019. In the Midwest, hospital or corporate owned practices have increased nearly 40% since 2019.
Acquisitions of private practices by corporate entities skyrocketed 87% from 2019 to 2023 in the Midwest.
“You start adding in 20, 40, 60 extra charts a week that you have to read through,” Stout said. “Physicians don’t want to take on nurse practitioners because it increases their workloads so much.”
Still, there is a projected shortage of 87,000 primary care physicians nationwide by 2037. And in 2022, more than half of working primary care doctors reported burnout.
A 2018 study used Medicare data to track health outcomes with patients who used nurse practitioners as their primary care providers. The data found those patients had lower rates of hospital admissions or readmissions and lower rates of improper use of the emergency room, compared to patients of primary care medical doctors.
States began passing legislation to allow for full practice authority in the 1990s, beginning with Iowa, Montana, New Mexico, Alaska and Oregon. Currently, 27 states allow full practice authority, while 12 have reduced authority and 11 states still require nurse practitioners to have supervision by a physician.
Ultimately, nurse practitioners know that even with full practice ability, they don’t have the same knowledge and training physicians do. And by suing the state, Markes isn’t trying to ban physician oversight for nurse practitioners.
But she does want to end the state-mandated requirement.
“In rural areas, you need to have access to physicians. Having independent practice means providers who normally would not go into rural areas could see patients there,” Markes said. “That’s where all of this stems from, is the ability to take care of people.”

(Photo by Mac Stone, courtesy of Open Space Institute)COLUMBIA — More than 62,200 acres along three South Carolina rivers are permanently protected after the state Forestry Commission closed the deal on a record-breaking conservation easement, officials announced this week.
The public will have access to around 7,500 acres of the land, which spans parts of Georgetown, Williamsburg and Marion counties. A portion of that will join the nearby Wee Tee State Forest, and the rest will become wildlife management areas managed under the Department of Natural Resources, according to a news release.
Called the Pee Dee Basin Project, it protects land around the Black, Pee Dee, and Santee rivers.
Officials touted the project Wednesday in a celebration at Georgetown County’s Pea House Landing, a public boat landing looking out on parts of the Black River, one of 10 segments officially designated by the state as a scenic river.
Largest conservation easement project in SC history underway with $50M grant

The rest of the property will remain private forestland, allowing sustainable timber harvesting to continue. The conservation easement, which is the largest in state history, will limit other activities on the property, according to conservation group Open Space Institute.
“This project is of incomparable scale and extraordinary impact,” said Marie Whitehead, who led the partnership for the land conservation group. “And while it’s been a herculean task to get it over the finish line, this project has been a highlight of my 25-year career.”
Most of the project’s funding came from a $50 million federal Forest Legacy grant, one of the largest of its kind, according to Open Space Institute. The remaining $24 million came from a combination of private investments, grants and state taxpayer dollars.
That included about $3.3 million for the addition to the state forest, according to state budget documents.
This is the first time the state Forestry Commission has held a conservation easement, according to the agency.

With more than 20 miles of land along the Santee, Black and Pee Dee rivers, preventing development will help reduce flooding. At least 115 plant and animal species considered a priority for protection also live on the protected land, according to Open Space Institute.
Officials said they hope the project, which included more than a dozen partners for funding and coordination, can act as a blueprint for more large conservation efforts to come.
“By protecting these timberlands, we’re investing in our future — supporting rural jobs, boosting our outdoor recreation economy, and protecting riverside communities from flooding,” Gov. Henry McMaster said in a news release. “This project establishes a replicable model for large-scale conservation in the future, and we are grateful to our partners who contributed to its success.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MacStone_240814_0350-1024x683.webp,,,2025-10-30 10:57:11.480101

This article is part of a series on the environmental costs of America’s last remaining alumina refinery.

GRAMERCY — A cloudy, rust-colored liquid plume, roughly the size of a football field, flowed into the Mississippi River last week out of a drainage pipe from the Atlantic Alumina refinery in the River Parishes.
Recent state records indicate this runoff into the river is dangerously caustic and the amount has well exceeded what’s allowed under federal environmental standards. It continues a pattern spanning several months during  which the company has struggled to contain toxic releases from its facility despite heightened public scrutiny over previous violations of environmental laws and workplace safety regulations.
About 45 miles west of New Orleans, Atlantic Alumina, which also goes by the name Atalco, is the only bauxite refinery in the United States. The facility turns bauxite, a reddish-brown rock full of various metals, into alumina, a white, powdery substance used to make aluminum. 
Aerial photos the Illuminator took Oct. 21 show whirls of discoloration on the river’s surface next to Atalco’s import dock and white alumina powder near its export dock. The pictures were taken during a flight provided by the nonprofit aviation group SouthWings. Members of the environmental advocacy organization Healthy Gulf were also on the flight.
Scott Eustis, Healthy Gulf’s community science director, said the plumes are likely hazardous chemicals and byproducts from Atalco’s refining operations. Both the discolored water and white powder are consistent with previous discharges Eustis said he’s seen at the same locations. 
“For years, we have watched Atalco dump into the Mississippi River and use the engine of our estuarine land as waste disposal,” Eustis said. “They are not investing enough in their own operation to prevent this product loss.” 
Atalco has not responded to multiple requests for comment for this article and previous ones since the Illuminator first reported on its recurring contamination problems in June. 
The runoff seen last week on the river aligns with the location of one of the Atalco facility’s outfall pipes as indicated on drainage maps on file with the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality. Residents and environmental groups have documented discharges at the same site Sept. 26 and dating back to November 2022.  
According to a state permit, the drainage line carries treated process wastewater Atalco uses for some of its industrial operations. LDEQ requires Atalco to treat the wastewater to neutralize hazardous contaminants and monitor the volume and pH of any discharges going into state waterways. Its river outfall systems have sensors that continuously track those measurements, and the company has to report them to LDEQ every month.
Clean water generally has a neutral pH of 7 on a 14-point scale. Extremes at either end of the scale can be dangerous. A substance with a pH over 11.5 is generally corrosive enough to eat through concrete, soft metals and organic matter like skin, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
Under the provisions of its river outfall permit, Atalco can discharge wastewater with a pH over 10 for no more than seven hours per month, a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency standard. 
A report the company filed with the state detailing its river outfall sensor data from September shows Atalco discharged water with pH readings up to 13.4 for nearly 144 hours over the month. That’s equal to six days with highly acidic discharge more than 20 times permitted levels.

“The facility continues to manage rainwater from weather events and plant upsets,” Atalco executive Steven Smith wrote in a section of the September report where the company is asked to explain the violation. He did not include specifics on when the rain and weather caused the excessive discharges. The area where the refinery is located experienced very little rainfall that month, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.
Atalco’s river outfall reading for September wasn’t just a one-off. A review of LDEQ records going back over two years revealed the facility exceeded its Mississippi River drainage permit in 25 of the last 27 months. The Illuminator’s previous reporting detailed even greater discharge volumes in several of those months. 
Photos from last week show the thickest and cloudiest areas of discoloration on the river surrounding a spot of aerated white water jetting out from the river bank and in line with a drainage pipe coming from the facility that runs through the levee and empties into the river. 
LDEQ spokesman Greg Langley, who reviewed the Illuminator’s photos, said Atalco is permitted to discharge into the river at regulated amounts. He said some of the discoloration could be sediment from the riverbed disturbed by the force of the discharges coming from Atalco’s drainage pipe. 
Eustis, who has monitored pollution events in the Mississippi River for years, said water conditions in the Mississippi River at the Atalco refinery this year are some of the worst he has seen.
“Atalco has neglected its waste ponds and shorted its workers,” Eustis said. “That is the cause of the red, white and brown plumes in the river. We must report each trespass upon our waters.”
A Louisiana refinery spilled toxic waste into the community and knew about it for months

Activists push for steeper fines
In August, the LDEQ issued the company a “Notice of Potential Penalty” compliance order that detailed violations officials documented during a series of inspections that began over a year ago. The agency is also asking the company to address a slate of new requirements regulators have tacked onto Atalco’s solid waste permit renewal application, records show.
The infractions involve the “red mud” lakes Atalco has built on site to hold the toxic slurry produced during the bauxite refining process. In June, an Illuminator investigation found Atalco had polluted public land and state waterways with toxic waste and heavy metals for months without notifying neighbors. 
The state has also asked Atalco to disclose its financial statements to determine if the company made more money because it ignored environmental laws. This is a routine request regulators make when trying to determine penalties for violations.
In an Oct. 22 letter to LDEQ, an attorney for Atalco refused the agency’s request, adding the company would request an administrative hearing on the allegations. Atalco denies it benefited financially from not following the rules, and the company intends to submit a settlement offer to the state to close its case, the lawyer wrote.
It’s unclear how much money Atalco makes, but its parent company, London-based Concord Resources Ltd., is worth billions. Concord, a private company that bills itself as a global commodities trader focused on metals and mining, reported €2.7 billion ($3.12 billion) in total income for 2023, according to its annual report. The report did not break down how much of that income came from Atalco. 
If the Department of Environmental Quality accepts Atalco’s settlement offer, it would go to Attorney General Liz Murrill for a 90-day review and concurrence period, according to the agency’s rules for settlement negotiations. That process includes a 45-day public comment period before the settlement is finalized.

The state can levy fines ranging from $100 to $32,500 per violation depending on its severity and the degree of risk it poses to public health or property. 
The agency uses a penalty matrix to determine whether the violation is minor, moderate or major. A violation is considered major if the hazard is one of “frequent occurrence and/or high pollutant concentrations,” according to LDEQ regulations. The agency can then adjust the penalty based on other specific factors, including the company’s history of previous violations, its gross revenues, degree of culpability or defiance, failure to mitigate the damages and whether the company immediately reported the violation or tried to conceal it. 
Following a 2017 compliance inspection, the state cited Atalco for 78 state Environmental Quality Act violations mostly related to the company’s air pollution permit. In 2020, the state accepted a settlement offer of $75,000 and allowed Atalco to deny wrongdoing. 
The refinery has a history of violations. In 2015, regulators discovered it had been unlawfully emitting mercury into the air for decades. The company, then called Noranda, did not have a permit to release mercury at the time. The Department of Environmental Quality levied a $95,000 fine and issued a permit that allowed the facility to continue releasing mercury into the air, according to The Times-Picayune. 
Healthy Gulf is calling for harsher financial punishment against Atalco to deter the company’s continued pollution of the river, neighboring property and drainage areas, Eustis said.
“We press LDEQ to increase Atalco’s fines until that economic signal shakes some sense into the company,” he said.

Following a 2017 compliance inspection, the state cited Atalco for 78 state Environmental Quality Act violations mostly related to the company’s air pollution permit. In 2020, the state accepted a settlement offer of $75,000 and allowed Atalco to deny wrongdoing. 
The refinery has a history of violations. In 2015, regulators discovered it had been unlawfully emitting mercury into the air for decades. The company, then called Noranda, did not have a permit to release mercury at the time. The Department of Environmental Quality levied a $95,000 fine and issued a permit that allowed the facility to continue releasing mercury into the air, according to The Times-Picayune. 
Healthy Gulf is calling for harsher financial punishment against Atalco to deter the company’s continued pollution of the river, neighboring property and drainage areas, Eustis said.
“We press LDEQ to increase Atalco’s fines until that economic signal shakes some sense into the company,” he said.

John James? 
Those were just a few of the questions parsed Wednesday by Michigan’s Republican candidates for governor in one of three early debates scheduled 10 months out from the August primary.
The candidates who attended the event, which was as much a debate as it was a GOP fundraiser, were Genesee County truck driver Anthony Hudson, Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox, pastor Ralph Rebandt, former Michigan House Speaker Tom Leonard, and anti-property tax advocate Karla Wagner.

Not in attendance was James. The Shelby Township Republican was notably missing, despite being invited to the event and featured on the party’s promotional materials.
The James campaign, hours before the fundraiser, said he would consider a primary debate with his fellow candidates once the field whittles down “and will be speaking to Michiganders in the meantime.”
Instead of attending the debate, James appeared on FOX 2 Detroit’s “The Pulse” with reporter Roop Raj.

Meanwhile, back at the debate, Michigan Republican Party Chair Jim Runestad said the event was sold out, filling the nearly 200-seat Apple Valley at Sunset Ridge venue in Sparta, Michigan, located just north of Grand Rapids.
Each of the candidates were given instructions to stick to the topics at hand and not throw jabs at one another for a clean debate.
Adherence to that request lasted all of one minute, with Nesbitt and Cox hitting James for not showing up right out of the gate.
“I want to thank my colleagues for actually showing up here,” Nesbitt said in his first response. “The first step of winning next year is actually showing up. … It’s unfortunate that John James decided not to show up today, and after two times that he’s lost statewide, I think it’s going to be important. If we don’t figure it out, that next year is [going to be] the third time.”

Adding to the shade were a pair of milk cartons sitting at Nesbitt’s supporter tables, each with “missing” announcements featuring James.
Cox said, “Amen to Brother Aric.”
“We don’t grow Michigan by electing people who don’t show up to work, by electing people who are abandoning President Trump’s majority in the House and now abandoning all of you,” Cox said.
With that, the debate began. Here are a few of the key responses to questions posed to the  candidates who did attend. The questions are in bold and the candidates’ responses follow.
 
How would you grow Michigan’s population?
Nesbitt: You got to have a governor that takes an ax and burn down that red tape to actually allow businesses to succeed and work here. If we’re going to make it here in Michigan, that means we got to lower the cost of insurance, lower the cost of government, lower the cost of taxes, so that our families, our business owner[s], most importantly, our kids, can actually make it here in Michigan.
Cox: Number one, we eliminate the tax on work, the income tax, because the nine fastest growing states, not only by wage growth, not only by job growth, but population growth, have all eliminated the tax on work, the income tax. Prosperity results when you do that.
Wagner: Everybody knows what I’m going to say, right? Property tax elimination. We need to eliminate property taxes in the state of Michigan. I see this as the only solution to the loss of our businesses, our people and our revenue out of the state. When the people prosper, the state will prosper.
Rebandt: [People] want affordable housing and … removing property tax will make homes more affordable. [Residents are] looking for an environment to raise a family.
Hudson: I’m a big advocate for getting rid of property taxes, but for different reasons. It’s going to happen somewhere, folks. … Why can’t we do it here in Michigan first? Why can we be a leader? When you eliminate property taxes, it’s not just for the residents, it’s for these businesses. You’re telling the rest of the country, “Hey, Michigan is open for business.”
Leonard: First and foremost, we need to make Michigan a Right to Work state, again. When Right to Work was repealed a couple of years ago, we were 36 out of 50. Not good enough, but it’s a lot better than the 49 out of 50 we are now. We were actually at the national average for unemployment. Now we are 1.4% higher. Bring back Right to Work, eliminate the income tax.

How would you change Michigan’s education system to ensure the state is no longer one of the lowest performers in fourth grade reading levels?
Cox: We spend $21 billion every year, and our outcomes are in the bottom five. So it’s not really money. … I would issue an executive order opting Michigan into President Donald Trump’s school choice tax credit. I would push for greater school choice, and I mean public, private and homeschool.
Wagner: I don’t think that we need to do that. I think that maybe the teachers need to be graded on how well the kids do. Maybe the schools need to be graded on how well the kids do. We absolutely have to make it easier for people to home school their kids, send them to Christian School.
Rebandt: This is going to sound pretty radical. I know some of you probably said, ‘I don’t know how to teach my kid trigonometry’. But you know what? You can teach your kids, sex ed. I’m not sure we need to have that in the public school system. I would recommend that we remove that.
Hudson: I’m actually the radical one here, because we have 539 school districts in the state of Michigan. I actually propose we cut that down to 83, with one county school district for all the schools in that county. … No more indoctrinating kids. Your son can stay your son. Your daughter can stay your daughter. And if you have a furry, they can stay home. We don’t allow pets in public schools.
Leonard:  Let me be clear here, we cannot expect any teacher with a classroom of 30 students to make certain that they’re all reading at a proficient level. They need help, targeted support. … I believe Michigan ought to have the highest paid teachers in the entire country. But you know what? It should be based on merit, not just because they’re there another year. Pay the good ones well, get rid of the bad ones.
Nesbitt: Governor Gretchen Whitmer has made it tough for our kids to make it here in Michigan, and believe me, Jocelyn Benson ain’t going to make it any better. She’s going to be worse. I’m going to stand with President Trump, on day one, as your next governor, to make sure all kids have a choice, all parents have a choice, because we have to be able to trust parents.

Would you deploy the Michigan National Guard to the southern border if asked by Trump?
Cox: I would do so if asked by the president. … A lot of people ask me today about whether I would accept the help of Donald Trump to fight crime in Detroit and other cities. And the answer is absolutely.
Wagner: We have a northern border where we have crack going through there. So, I think at the president’s order … to send people there because they needed the extra help or relief for a short term, I could see doing that. But I think I’d like to keep my National Guard in here, in Michigan, as much as I can.
Rebandt: I certainly would. I completely support his policies. … I would obviously give some thought to some things that he might ask, but that is one that I would do because I am a part of a 50 state country and they need our help over there. But I have to say that we are a border state, and we certainly want to protect our own people here.
Hudson: If the president thought it was necessary to ask me, the governor of Michigan, for our National Guard troops, I would send them. Hell, I would even authorize them to go to Dearborn so we can protect the people of Dearborn from Sharia law [and] all the crap happening today.
Leonard: We don’t need to. The president did what he had to do, he came in the first couple months and he secured the southern border. … I certainly would accept the President’s help. I would accept National Guard troops coming here, as long as Detroit’s one of the most dangerous cities in the country and as long as we have a crime problem, I would certainly accept that, but we’ve got to keep our resources here.
Nesbitt: President Trump will have a partner with Aric Nesbitt as governor. Period. Paragraph. … I’m going to join with him to ban sanctuary cities here in the state of Michigan, and make sure that our cities and our country is safe again.

,Pennsylvania Capital Star,2025-10-30 14:23:09+00:00,Pennsylvania Capital-Star,The amount of fentanyl seized in Pennsylvania this year set to surpass last year’s figures,John Cole,,,,,https://penncapital-star.com/criminal-justice/the-amount-of-fentanyl-seized-in-pennsylvania-this-year-set-to-surpass-last-years-figures/,"Fentanyl has replaced heroin as the opioid most commonly found in Pennsylvania, state Attorney General Dave Sunday said.","Then-York County District Attorney Dave Sunday, candidate for attorney general, answers questions at a candidates forum in Pittsburgh Oct. 23, 2024 (Photo by Abigail Hakas for the Capital-Star)Standing alongside various law enforcement officials, Pennsylvania Attorney General Dave Sunday announced that as of the beginning of September, the state had seized over 50 million doses of fentanyl.
“With each passing year, fentanyl continues to be pervasive in opioid seizures,” Sunday said during a press conference in Philadelphia on Wednesday. “And in 2025, we have reached a high watermark with regard to the work we’ve done.”
For perspective, Pennsylvania seized 50 million doses during all of 2024.
Sunday credited the collaboration of his office with county district attorneys and law enforcement departments, coupled with federal partners, for the success.
“Any one of those 50 million doses could have killed someone,” Sunday said.
“I’ve been at this for 39 years, this is the best coordination and collaboration I’ve seen in a long, long time,” said Philadelphia Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel.

Although just over half of the fentanyl confiscated in Pennsylvania so far was from Philadelphia and its collar counties, Bethel emphasized that it is not a neighborhood problem specific to areas like Kensington or the city.
“This is a commonwealth problem. It’s an American problem,” Bethel said. “Fentanyl does not care about the borders. It doesn’t care about what zip code you come from. It doesn’t care what politics you’re involved in, it is ending lives, and we’re seeing that on a daily basis.”
Sunday, holding up a small packet, explained that two milligrams is all it takes for a potential lethal dose of fentanyl.
“This is all it takes to end a life, to end the hopes and dreams of a human being, to absolutely devastate a family and circle of friends, causing lifelong pain and suffering,” Sunday said.
Delaware County District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer said his brother died at the age of 50 due to a drug overdose.
“The fentanyl crisis in this country is literally the worst narcotics epidemic this country has ever faced, upwards of 70,000 people die every single year because of fentanyl,” Stollsteimer said.
“This is such a powerful narcotic, it cannot be in the streets anymore,” he added.
Bethel detailed what makes fentanyl different from heroin, explaining it was also a powder. Heroin spoils, he said, but the powder for fentanyl does not and it can be mixed with other narcotics.
“So easy to make, so easy to move, so many ways to move it,” Bethel said. “It is probably one of the greatest challenges we’ve seen in my lifetime, as it relates to fentanyl, what it can do and how it’s being used and how it’s being moved through.”
Sunday also said the heroin seized by law enforcement isn’t always in small packets, but at times it’s packaged in bulk and oftentimes includes fentanyl pills, which are disguised to look similar to other prescriptions. The state has seized more than 76,000 fentanyl pills so far this year, he said.

Fentanyl has replaced heroin as the opioid most commonly found in Pennsylvania.
“And it’s not even close,” Sunday said.
He also described the flow of fentanyl coming into the commonwealth as “non-stop” due to how easy it is to traffic and transport. When responding to a reporter’s question, Sunday said it’s about $10 a dose.
Last week, a drug bust in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia made national headlines after 33 members of a drug trafficking organization were charged in a 41-count indictment.
Treatment for those affected by drug addiction, was also highlighted as a key in addressing the issue.
Although touting the milestone reached so far in 2025, various officials on Wednesday also offered warnings to those who continue to traffick fentanyl.
“I think it’s been stated very clearly here…the pressure is going to continue to increase,” Bethel said. “We will not stop. As the Attorney General said, your time will come, and we are going to work collaboratively to do that.”
“All of us up here either know a friend or a family member who has been impacted by the powerful and addictive nature of opioids and fentanyl,” Abington Police Chief Patrick Molloy said. “We also know that we cannot arrest our way out of this crisis.”
“However, by aggressively prosecuting these bad guys and providing resources for people to get help, there’s no doubt that we will continue to keep our foot on the gas and continue to save lives in our communities,” Molloy added.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/DaveSunday1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-30 10:57:11.480101
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-30 14:22:52+00:00,CT Mirror,"Blumenthal, Murphy introduce bipartisan bill to ban AI chatbots for kids",Molly Ingram | WSHU,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/30/blumenthal-murphy-ai-chatbots-kids-bill/,The bipartisan GUARD Act would require user age verification and a disclosure that the conversation a user is having is not with a human.,"A bipartisan group of U.S. senators, including Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy (D-CT), is seeking to ban AI chatbots for children.
At a recent Senate hearing, and again at a press conference announcing the legislation this week, parents of kids who died by suicide said the chatbots were exposing their children to sexual and suicide-related content.
Maria Raine lost her 16-year-old son, Adam, to suicide in April. She blames ChatGPT.
“My son, Adam, ended his life in April after ChatGPT coached him to suicide over the course of months. I’m here today with my husband Matt to support this critical legislation,” Raine said. “It was only after Adam died that we learned what Chat GPT had done to him, and now we know that OpenAI twice downgraded its safety guardrails in the months leading up to my son’s death, which we believe they did to keep people talking to Chat GPT.
“If it weren’t for their choice to change a few lines of code, Adam would be alive today,” Raine said.
The GUARD Act would require age verification for users. It would also require a disclosure that explicitly told users the conversation they’re having is not with a human.
“1/3 of children today report having deep, intimate relationships with these chatbots,” Murphy said. “These stories that you’re hearing of children taking their lives or engaging in life-altering self-harm, this is not the exception. This is becoming a norm, and if we don’t do something, it is going to get worse.”
The GUARD Act was introduced by Blumenthal and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO). It’s co-sponsored by Murphy and Sen. Katie Britt (R-AL).
When asked why Congress hasn’t acted on the issue yet, Hawley blamed the technology lobby.
“They’re the most powerful companies on this hill,” Hawley said. “They spend like nobody’s business. And I’ve said before, joking, but really it’s more ruefully, there ought to be a sign outside of the Senate chamber that says, ‘bought and paid for by big tech.’”
One tech industry trade group accused the bill of being too heavy-handed, raising privacy concerns.
“We all want to keep kids safe, but the answer is balance, not bans,” Chamber of Progress K.J. Bagchi with the Chamber of Progress said. “It’s better to focus on transparency when kids chat with AI, curbs on manipulative design, and reporting when sensitive issues arise.”
The legislation comes as Blumenthal continues to push for passage of his Kids Online Safety Act. That bill, which would impose a duty of care on social media sites and require companies to allow users to opt out of algorithms, passed the Senate with an overwhelming majority. It did not get called for a vote in the House.
KOSA critics have raised concerns over potential censorship.

Dr. Camelia Lawrence of Shelton said she last spoke with her family Tuesday when the storm hit. She has since been unable to make contact with anyone.
“It’s a lot of anxiety at this moment, because I do have a lot of family that’s on the island, and as of yesterday, at about 2 p.m. shortly after landfall, I’ve lost all communications with family and friends,” Lawrence said.
The breakdown in communication also impacts people on the island, according to Lawrence. She’s now working with advocacy and aid organizations for much needed help.
“Trees are down, power lines are down,” Lawrence said. “Communities are completely isolated, and so there will be coordinated effort to just get food. So we’re collecting a lot of non-perishable items.”
Lawrence is working with the Jamaican American Connection based in New Haven as well as the American Friends of Jamaica, which have both launched fundraisers for relief efforts. Lawrence said the community is resilient.
For others like Hamden resident Nadine Barnett Cosby, that sense of community can take on different forms.
Cosby, who is dean of the School of Communications at Quinnipiac University, said most of her connections to the Jamaican American community are in New York, and she hasn’t made many connections in Connecticut.
But she doesn’t feel alone in a time like this.
“I actually have had friends from really all over the country and parts of the world texting me calling just to check in and ask me if my family is OK,” Cosby said. “And I think even without having that Jamaican network in my immediate vicinity in Connecticut, it really is heartwarming to know that I have such a vast support system.”

(Photo courtesy Gov. Wes Moore's office)Wednesday was a busy day for the European Union’s ambassador to the U.S.
Besides attending the Circular Economy Forum in Annapolis, an event focused on reuse and recycling, Ambassador Jovita Neliupšienė’s also had a chance to meet Gov. Wes Moore for what she described as an “all of the above” chat: Moore’s military service, the Maryland National Guard’s longtime partnership with Estonia, European goods moving through the Port of Baltimore and Maryland’s sustainability work.
“It was a really fruitful dialogue,” Neliupšienė said. “And I hope to continue it, because the next stop is the Army-Navy game.”
Moore and Neliupšienė co-hosted the opening session of the closed-door forum, which convened policymakers and experts from both sides of the Atlantic to discuss ways to reduce waste, including designing items for reuse and expanding recycling.
In May, Moore signed a new law that will require producers of packaging and paper products sold in the state, with some exceptions, to submit producer responsibility plans starting in 2028. The documents will detail companies’ plans for reducing packaging waste.
“Maryland is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our European partners in shaping a future where our work to grow the economy and protect our environment go hand in hand,” Moore said in a statement.
Annapolis is the first stop for the forum, but will not be the last, said Neliupšienė, a Lithuanian native who was named ambassador to the United States in January 2024. Wednesday’s forum was sponsored by the Delegation of the European Union to the United States, Maryland and the city of Annapolis.

In Maryland, Neliupšienė said she sees a willingness to participate in sustainability initiatives, in part because it is “so much exposed to the water.”
“You have the Chesapeake Bay and in general, the ocean, at your backyard. It’s not next door. It’s actually in your backyard,” she said. “So, for example, the initiative on more sustainable packaging is extremely important to protect your ocean and your nature. So there are elements which actually are happening on the state level.”
Neliupšienė noted that President Donald Trump’s (R) return to office has changed the game when it comes to diplomatic topics, including trade, security and energy. But her focus remains on building cooperation between the U.S. and the EU, no matter the talking points of the administration in Washington.
“Energy dominance is the topic here in the United States,” Neliupšienė said. “Liquefying gas is actually European. So what I’m trying to say is, actually, that it’s so extremely important to work together.”
Trump has wielded tariffs to pressure on trading partners, including the EU. POLITICO reporting earlier this month indicated that the White House was pressuring the EU in tariff negotiations to drop climate change-related regulations for American businesses, but EU representatives have pushed back. Neliupšienė said the EU has also developed a green industrial plan, “which actually focuses not only on the environment, but how we can help business to deliver on that.”
“We stick to our principles: That we really have to move our economy and our way of life to be more sustainable,” she said.
But Neliupšienė’s focus remains maintaining stability in the U.S.-EU relationship.
“For 80 years, we have been the closest partners you can find globally, and it should remain so, because our supply chains are so much intertwined,” Neliupšienė said. “It’s very difficult to untangle. And to make sure that we have a predictable relations is the key.”
‘An amazing state’s attorney’
Turns out Prince George’s County’s circuit court judges aren’t the only fans of interim County State’s Attorney Tara Jackson.
The judges tapped Jackson, then the acting county executive, to become state’s attorney when Aisha Braveboy left in June after being elected county executive. Now, Jackson is seeking the job permanently, and her first fundraiser for her 2026 campaign Wednesday was packed with people singing her praises, with dozens putting on stickers attesting to her accomplishments, accolades and achievements in more than two decades of public and private legal practice.

One of those supporters who turned out at the Homewood Suites by Hilton in Largo was former County Executive Rushern L. Baker III (D), who worked with Jackson when she was a deputy county attorney in the Office of Law. The one aspect Baker said Jackson would provide for his family: safety.
“I want to know somebody’s looking out for justice, and that is important,” Baker said in a brief interview. “I’ve seen her work. Her integrity. She does what she says she’s going to do. She’s going to be an amazing state’s attorney.”
Besides Baker, other high-profile attendees who cheered on Jackson included retired Prince George’s County Circuit Judge Sheila Tillerson Adams and her husband, Bowie Mayor Tim Adams; Maryland State Board of Education Vice President Monica Goldson, who was CEO of the county’s public schools; and Elizabeth Hewlett, former head of the bi-county Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission and chair of the county’s planning board.
Part of Jackson’s future plans would be to ensure the state’s attorney’s office collaborates with county government, the public school system and community organizations, especially when it comes to helping youth. But Jackson said her office will still hold youth accountable for their actions.
“We cannot continue to make excuses for the deviant behavior of our young people without teaching our young people that actions do have consequences,” she said. “I have said and will continue to say that accountability is loving. I’m very clear that in many instances, discipline will save a child’s life.”
Jackson stressed that that repeat violent and gun offenders, and those who exploit children will face “serious time.” The state’s attorney’s office, she said, will also provide alternative programs for nonviolent offenders instead of incarceration.
“I firmly believe that accountability is the difference between calm and chaos,” Jackson said.
Some of the most rousing remarks came from Artis Hampshire-Cowan, the first person appointed in December 2023 to represent the county on the Maryland Stadium Authority board. Hampshire-Cowan said she wanted Jackson to run for state’s attorney when current U.S. Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D) ran for county executive in 2018.
“What we need to tell everybody in Prince George’s County, look at the credentials. That’s the most important thing,” Hampshire-Cowan said. “I’m working night and day, and I’m not going to stop until she gets elected.”

Jackson has at least one challenger in the June 23 Democratic primary: County Councilmember Wanika Fisher (D) officially launched her campaign last week. Fisher had her own cast of big-name supporters, including retired Circuit Judge Ingrid Turner, Sen. Nick Charles (D-Prince George’s), House Majority Whip Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s) and District 4 County Councilmember Ingrid Watson.
They may approach the bench
Gov. Wes Moore this week appointed Ralph Laurence Sapia and Evelyn Lombardo Cusson to the Baltimore County Circuit Court and Brett Joann Engler to the Frederick County District Court.
In a statement announcing the appointments Monday, Moore said “Ralph Laurence Sapia, Evelyn Lombardo Cusson, and Brett Joann Engler have demonstrated a commitment to fairness and justice that will serve our people well.” According to the governor’s office:

Sapia is a solo practitioner in Towson, who was a partner at Tillman Sapia, P.A., before opening his own firm. He has taught history and social studies in Baltimore County Public Schools, where he currently serves on the ethics review panel. He is also chair of the St. Agnes Hospital Foundation board of directors, and is a founding member of the Sisters Academy of Baltimore board of directors. Sapia received his law degree from the University of Baltimore School of Law.
Cusson is an assistant U.S. attorney in the U.S. attorney’s office for the District of Maryland, where she has prosecuted white-collar crimes and handled a broad range of both civil and criminal cases. She is also the office’s elder justice coordinator, working to raise awareness of abuse, neglect and exploitation of older adults. She previously practiced at Gordon Feinblat and at Anderson, Coe & King, and clerked for Judge Lynne A. Battaglia on the Maryland Court of Appeals—now the Supreme Court of Maryland. Cusson, who earned her law degree from Catholic University’s Columbus School of Law, also serves as president of the Baltimore City Bar Association.
Engler is chief of the domestic violence unit in the Frederick County State’s Attorney’s Office. As assistant state’s attorney, Engler has worked for more than a decade to improve prosecution of domestic violence cases and strengthen collaboration between criminal justice and community stakeholders.

“Absolutely not. I’ll be introducing legislation to put a stop to this,” Nevada Democratic U.S. Rep. Dina Titus responded on social media.
“This directly contradicts the commitments I secured from Trump nominees — and the opinion of Administration officials who certify our nuclear stockpile — who’ve told me explosive nuclear testing would not happen & is unnecessary,” said Nevada Democratic U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen, adding “I’ll fight to stop this.”
Nuclear waste, atomic testing on tap for Nevada in Project 2025 manifesto

The U.S. conducted above-ground nuclear tests at the Nevada Test Site 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas from 1951 until 1962, according to a brief historical overview from the test site’s successor entity, the Nevada National Security Site.
Following signing of a test ban treaty in 1963, nuclear weapons testing moved underground at the Nevada site, with more than 800 underground weapons tests until the last one in 1992. Since then subcritical tests have been performed to maintain reliability of weapons without actually exploding them.
Along with calling for resuming work on a nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain, Project 2025, the document that has served as a blueprint for multiple Trump administration policies, outlined a plan to “restore the nuclear infrastructure” and to “restore readiness to test nuclear weapons at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS), formerly the Nevada Test Site, to ensure the ability of the U.S. to respond quickly to asymmetric technology surprises.”
Fred Dilger, executive director of the state’s Office for Nuclear Projects, told the Nevada’s Commission on Nuclear Projects prior to last year’s election that “I like to joke that Project 2025 should have been labeled Project 1995 because the ideas are all old and out of date as far as nuclear issues.”
Dilger added that a retired senior official from NNSS told him “they want nothing to do with full scale underground testing. There is no need for full-scale underground testing.”
A spokesperson for Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo, who endorsed Trump, told the Current last year that the governor does not support Project 2025’s advocacy for nuclear weapons testing in the state.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Exercise_Desert_Rock_I_Buster-Jangle_Dog_002.jpg,,,2025-10-30 09:58:11.417933

Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, uses reports of fraud within veterans' disability claims as an opportunity to hold a hearing examining the efficiency of the U.S. Department of Veterans' Affairs. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of U.S. Senate Veterans Affairs Committee video)TOPEKA — U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, wants to get to the bottom of recent reports of fraud by veterans claiming benefits.
“We have an obligation to the men and women who have injuries or illnesses connected with their service in uniform to make certain they are provided the tools and resources they need to succeed in life after the military,” Moran said, convening a hearing Wednesday in Washington. “Our goal today is to examine the facts.” 
Moran, chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, called the hearing in response to a Washington Post investigation that showed the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has antiquated policies that sometimes provided outsized benefits for veterans with minor conditions. It also found cases where veterans lied about their conditions outright.
The investigation found, for example, that the Veterans Benefits Administration typically pays veterans with sleep apnea more than a veteran who had a leg amputated below the knee. Based on documents, videos and interviews, the pair of articles detailed instances of veterans falsifying disabilities to earn higher benefits.
But some lawmakers and officials at the hearing disputed the conclusions of the investigation. 
“There is no massive fraud going on,” said Cheryl Mason, the inspector general for Veterans Affairs.
Jeremy Villanueva, associate legislative director for Paralyzed Veterans of America, said it is “disgraceful when disabled veterans are portrayed as fraudsters and cheats.”
U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, D-Illinois, said the article painted veterans as “dishonest fraudsters,” “cheaters” and “moochers.”
She said no one denied the reality that there are a small number of fraudsters. She said investigative resources should be increased if the goal is to strengthen deterrence and prosecution.
“The mistake we must avoid is allowing a minority of criminals who dictate the redesign of the VA disability benefits system into a bureaucratic black box that is more frustrating and less fair and will leave more veterans waiting and dying waiting to get benefits they’ve earned,” said Duckworth, who is an Army National Guard veteran.
Moran said the articles left the impression that veterans are responsible for widespread fraud.
“The cases of fraud highlighted in these articles do not reflect the reality of who veterans are, the vast majority of the veteran population or the values veterans embody,” Moran said.
The attention the stories received provided the committee with the opportunity to discuss the efficacy of the VA disability claims process, Moran said.
“Is the system ensuring timely, accurate and fair outcomes?” he asked. “Is it empowering veterans to thrive or inadvertently creating barriers to their success and opportunities after service?”
He said he sought to bring different points of view to the committee, inviting six people whose jobs and lives are intertwined with the Veterans Administration. Moran said he had faith in the committee’s ability to hear from veterans and ensure they receive the benefits they are entitled to.
Of Kansas’ 182,000 veterans, more than 83,000 are enrolled in the VA health care system and more than 47,500 receive disability benefits, according to department data from fiscal year 2023.
The Post wasn’t subtle in its examples of fraud, said U.S. Sen. Jim Banks, R-Indiana, citing a veteran who pretended to be blind for almost three decades and a competitive bodybuilder who faked trouble walking and wore a diaper. Banks, who is a Navy veteran, asked Daniel Gade, a retired U.S. Army Colonel and a source in a Post article, how prevalent outright disability compensation fraud really is.
It is rare, Gade said.
“A bigger problem is the problem of lax oversight and easily exaggerated conditions and no follow-up,” said Gade.
Mason agreed that fraud is rare, acknowledging bad actors exist, but they are few compared to the 6.9 million American veterans who receive benefits.
Despite the rarity of fraud and steps to improve the veterans’ disability benefits program, the VA has failed to modernize, said Elizabeth Curda, the director of education, workforce and income security issues for the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
It is a large, decentralized organization and change often faces strong headwinds, Curda said. The VA relies on outdated ratings to determine disability levels, and it is 10 years behind on its goal to bring policies and procedures up to date, she said.
U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, repeatedly pointed to substantial cuts to the VA workforce. He said the system has been dismantled through “reckless policies” that have pushed civil servants to the brink of their abilities. He cited Trump administration policies such as “arbitrary” contract cancellations, return to office mandates and proposed lay-offs.
There are simply not enough people, Blumenthal said.
“The result has been a demoralized VBA workforce who is consistently pushed to sacrifice quality for the sake of quantity,” he said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/251029_moran-1024x540.jpeg,,,2025-10-30 09:58:11.417933

Some of those findings date back to 2008. (File Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The Maryland secretary of Human Resources repeatedly insisted to lawmakers Wednesday that he and his staff are working to transform an agency that was the subject of a scathing audit and responsible for the care of a teen who died while in foster care living in a Baltimore City hotel.
A 70-page report issued by the Office of Legislative Audits identified more than a dozen issues, many repeat findings with some dating back to 2008. Among them, findings included failure to ensure adults with criminal backgrounds didn’t have access to children and that seven registered sex offenders were found living in homes with children under court-approved guardianships.
Secretary Rafael Lopez told lawmakers that many of the problems in the agency were inherited.
“Let’s be real clear, we largely agree with the audit’s findings and no matter where and how the problem started, we own our responsibility to deliver solutions, and we’ll partner with you to lead this transformation, because that’s what Marylanders deserve,” Lopez said. “The safety and well-being of Maryland’s children have been our highest priorities.”
Lopez recounted a list of policy changes made to address some problems, including standardizing criminal background checks, standardizing contracts for one-on-one providers and ending the practice of placing some children in foster care in hotels.
But Lopez and his staff disagreed with audit findings that said the agency had the ability to do background checks on adults living with children in court-approved guardianships.
State may have put children in homes where registered sex offenders lived

“As of right now, we do not believe that we have the statutory authority that you are citing right now,” Lopez said, adding that he would work with lawmakers to find a way “in which to do that constitutionally.”
Some members of the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee disagreed with Lopez’s assertions that court-approved guardianship curtails the agency’s ability to do background checks.
Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Howard and Anne Arundel County) said after the meeting that Lopez’s testimony felt lacking.
“These are difficult and complex issues,” Lam said. “The really frustrating thing is that they could have figured all this out earlier.”
Lam said he expects some legislation in the 2026 session, which may or may not include a workgroup to look at fixes for tougher issues.
Legislative Auditor Brian Tanen told lawmakers his staff believes state statutes and regulations give the agency the legal authority to do checks. But he added that department staffers need to approach the issue thinking as if they were parents protecting their own children.
“So, there’s probably room in between to fill in some of the gaps, in particular related to their response to the guardianship homes,” Tanen said. “We certify the guardianship home. We take the children, we place them there … we have a responsibility to make sure that we’re putting the children in a home that is safe, not on the one day that we walk them across the threshold.”
Tanen said the agency should “look at that and say, ‘If it was my child, what would I want before I put them in this home?'”
The three-hour committee hearing was punctuated by moments of frustration from some lawmakers.
Del. Steven J. Arentz (R-Upper Shore) said agency responses to audits far too often feel like “what I could have wrote.”
“We get a little bit of a list … ‘Here’s what we’re going to do,’ and ‘We’re going to fix this problem,” Arentz said. “Four years later, with a history — not your history necessarily but a history — we’re repeating them [the findings] when you knew about them coming in and they’ve not been addressed.”
Webster Ye, Lopez’s chief of staff, acknowledged the agency is “on the equivalent of academic probation” because of the audit and its repeat findings. He said the agency is “moving forward so that we are positioned in the next couple of years to eliminate that repeat finding and to change our departmental culture so that it doesn’t happen again.”

Some on the committee did not seem swayed, and suggested legislation might be needed to bring reforms. The committee is awaiting a “deeper dive” review by the Department of Legislative Services Office of Program Evaluation and Government Accountability.
“It’s great to identify problems. That’s how I make my living,” Tanen said. “Fixing the problem requires people who are specialized and focused in the areas that we’re identifying, and that’s where we’re running into the problem. And I keep saying, they don’t need more audits. We’re auditing the information. There’s nothing changing.”
Tanen said there is growing frustration over the repeat findings in audits of the department. But he said the agency, absent additional legislation, can address many of the issues it faces.
“There’s 14 findings, a lot of repeats. It’s unsatisfactory, but there’s not a lot of disagreement. And for the most part, they’re saying, we’re working on this, and they put in some effort.”
The latest audit found that the department may have approved guardianship homes for children in state care where registered sex offenders lived, and that it failed to identify a convicted sex offender who worked in a group foster home and later faced criminal charges involving children under his care.
Five days after the audit was released, the body of Kanaiyah Ward, 16, was found Sept. 22 in a room at a Residence Inn by Marriott. The teen, who was in state care, had been living in the hotel on N. Wolfe Street in Baltimore.
An autopsy concluded that she died as the result of an overdose of diphenhydramine, an over-the-counter allergy medication.
“The vast majority of the findings in here … their governance already allows them to go and address the process,” Tanen said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_2340-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-10-30 09:58:11.417933

The survey, conducted Oct. 22–27 by the college’s Institute for Policy and Opinion Research (IPOR), found Spanberger ahead 51% to 41% among likely voters — a 3-point increase from the previous poll in August. Just 4% remain undecided and 1% support someone else. The poll of 1,041 likely voters carries a margin of error of 4.05%.
In down-ballot contests, Democratic Sen. Ghazala Hashmi leads Republican John Reid 42% to 40% in the lieutenant governor’s race, while Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares holds an 8-point edge, 46% to 38%, over Democratic challenger Jay Jones.
 Enthusiasm and key issues

Two-thirds of likely voters (67%) said they are very enthusiastic about casting a ballot, and another 23% described themselves as somewhat enthusiastic. 
When asked to name the most important issue, 29% cited threats to democracy and 24% listed inflation. Immigration ranked third at 12%, followed by taxes (5%), abortion (5%), and crime (5%).
President Donald Trump’s job approval remains unchanged at 40% since the August Roanoke College Poll. Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s approval holds steady at 50%, but his disapproval rating has dropped seven points.
Spanberger’s favorability rose to 47%, with 42% viewing her unfavorably — both figures higher than in August. Earle-Sears’ ratings also climbed to 38% favorable and 45% unfavorable.
 Jones text controversy

The poll found that 80% of likely voters have heard or read about 2022 text messages in which Democratic attorney general nominee  Jones fantasized about shooting then-House Speaker Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah.
Among those who said they already voted for Jones, 87% said they would have supported him anyway, while 1% said they would have switched their vote to Miyares. Another 5% said they would not have voted in that race, and 8% declined to answer.
“Like most elections, this one will be determined by voter turnout and how independents vote,” said Harry Wilson, interim director of IPOR and professor emeritus of political science at Roanoke College. 
“While Spanberger appears to have maximized her Democratic support, Earle-Sears could slightly increase her support among Republicans, and she needs to make more inroads with independents with very little time left to do so.”
Wilson added that “the races for lieutenant governor and attorney general are both within the poll’s margin of error, though the latter just barely so. Reid has done well to solidify his partisan support but needs a little help from independents, while Hashmi could do better with her partisans.”
While Jones has “clearly lost some support among Democrats, they have not moved over to support Miyares,” Wilson continued. 
“As concerning for Jones, Miyares now narrowly leads among independents. It may be unprecedented to see such a divergence between the race for governor and attorney general. Everyone who ever contemplates running for public office might consider holding their tongue and stilling their hands on occasion.”

Wes Moore at the Sept. 10, 2025, meeting of the Board of Public Works. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Comptroller Brooke Lierman (D) joined state lawmakers Wednesday pushing for state action to make up for federal food assistance that may run dry beginning this weekend.
Lierman joined lawmakers, both Democratic and Republican, who believe that the state should step in and cover lost Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits while the federal government is shut down and the U.S. Department of Agriculture is refusing to release funds for the program
During a virtual meeting with lawmakers Wednesday, Lierman said she hopes “that our state will act to extend SNAP benefits for the month of November,” because a disruption in the federally funded food assistance program would have ripple effects on Maryland’s economy.
“Because of its immediate impact on our most vulnerable residents, on businesses that are just scraping by, on some of our most historically challenged communities, and recognizing the cascading impact of these cuts on Maryland’s economy,” she said, “I do hope that our state will act to extend SNAP benefits for the month of November. And I certainly hope, through legal action, we can recoup that funding.”
More than 680,000 Marylanders who currently receive SNAP benefits are expected to lose those food assistance dollars over the month of November. They are among 41 million SNAP recipients nationwide who would be affected.
In previous shutdowns, the federal government would continue to pay for SNAP out of USDA contingency funds, to ensure that low-income families and other struggling households could continue to afford food.
State officials, advocates brace for SNAP dollars ending for 680,000 Marylanders

But after funding benefits when the government was shut down in October, the Trump administration reversed course and announced last week that it is unable to continue funding SNAP next month, unless Congress agrees on a budget — and it may not reimburse states that decide to fill the gap in the meantime.
More than two dozen states, including Maryland, this week sued the Trump administration in hopes of forcing the government to pay for SNAP amid the shutdown.  In the meantime, a handful of governors in other states have signaled they will use state funds to cover SNAP regardless.
Maryland’s top budget lawmakers believe that Gov. Wes Moore (D) should do the same, by tapping into the state’s Rainy Day fund that is projected to close fiscal 2026 with a balance of $2.25 billion, according to state analysts.
House Appropriations Chair Ben Barnes (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) thinks that “680,000 people losing their benefits is an emergency” and that state officials have good reason to use the Rainy Day fund.
“I want to be crystal clear, this committee, this House … believes that we should extend this benefit on a monthly basis – for the month of November and potentially through December,” Barnes said Wednesday. “I think you don’t have to have been poor to know that going hungry creates real hardship. And being poor through the holidays and not having a meal on Thanksgiving creates lasting trauma, particularly for children.”
Senate Budget and Taxation Vice Chair Jim Rosapepe (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) agreed.
“I’m a hawk on protecting the Rainy Day fund,” Rosapepe said. “This clearly is a five-star hurricane for poor people who need food, so I’m totally on board.”
State data shows that in August, $123.2 million in SNAP benefits were distributed to 371,522 households in Maryland, helping 668,162 people afford food that month.
Based on the August figures, analysts with the Department of Legislative Services say that covering SNAP benefits for both November and December would require around $250 million.

Del. Jefferson L. Ghrist (R-Upper Shore) supports using state funds to cover a lapse in SNAP coverage, even if he places the blame of the shutdown on Democrats in Congress.
“As a fiscal conservative, the Rainy Day fund should be used for just that. It should be used to deal with an emergency situation – here we are,” he said. “These are oftentimes single working moms, folks with developmental disabilities. These are folks who are senior citizens that can’t help themselves.
“I hope the Moore administration hears us clearly – that this is a bipartisan effort to make sure that these folks are taken care of, at least temporarily,” Ghrist said.
It’s not just Ghrist. House Minority Leader Jason Buckel (R-Allegany) says the “ball is in the Moore Administration’s court.”
“Republicans want to see children, families, seniors, and the disabled who truly deserve these safety net benefits receive them without interruption,” Buckel said in a written statement. “There certainly are sufficient reserves available to Governor Moore to pay some level of SNAP benefits for a period of time until the bickering politicians in DC can straighten themselves out and get the federal government running again reasonably, just as Governor Youngkin has done in Virginia.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D) has so far offered few details on how he plans to address the potential loss of benefits, saying the state is committed to doing what it can to pick up lost federal benefits, but also warning that no state has the ability to fully cover federal programs.
Not only does SNAP help struggling families put food on the table, Lierman said it is one of the “highest short-term economic multipliers,” meaning that every SNAP dollar spent generates additional economic activity as it moves through grocery stores, food retailers and the community.
“I should add that the economic activity from SNAP generates approximately $289 million in state tax revenue,” Lierman told lawmakers. She added that small grocery stores and food retailers will lose significant business if SNAP recipients are not buying food with their benefits.
David Romans, a Department of Legislative Services budget analyst, said that the “simplest” option for the state to fill in SNAP dollars would be for Moore to declare a state of emergency and tap into the Rainy Day funds.
But the administration appears hesitant. Acting Budget Secretary Jake Weissmann agreed Wednesday that the state has the funds to backfill SNAP funding, but said the “conversations we’re having within the Moore-Miller administration are broader than SNAP.”
Shutdown double whammy: SNAP food benefits ending and federal workers go unpaid

“I want to provide you with a larger picture,” Weissmann told lawmakers. “We are in month 10 of a four-year term, and we are going to continue to face these challenges for the next three years.
“The Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, is close to running out,” Weissmann said. “There are growing questions about Headstart and there are real, valid concerns whether this [Trump] administration threatens Medicaid funding sometime in the near future. We’re also facing over a $1 billion shortfall next year.
“That’s why this administration is taking a week-by-week approach to this,” he said. “With all the outstanding questions, we have to move carefully to protect Marylanders.”
Weissman said that the administration would have more to share “in the next 24 hours.” Barnes questioned the delay and the lack of direct information from Weissmann and Moore.
“You know the comments here today are woefully inadequate and we’re not really getting much information – but I guess we’ll stay tuned for the next 24 hours,” Barnes said.
Moore is scheduled to hold a news conference Thursday to “announce executive action” regarding SNAP and programs affected by the government shutdown.
Earlier Wednesday, reporters asked Moore to clarify how he’ll handle the missing SNAP funds if they run out this weekend. He stuck to his position that federal dollars should fund the benefit while the government is shut down. But he did not answer whether he will tap state funds to cover SNAP.
“We’re going to make sure our people are taken care of and we’re going to be creative, we’re going to work with the private sector, we’re going to work with the nonprofits sector,” he said. “There is no state that can simply say, ‘Oh yes, despite the fact that the federal government is breaking the law, that we’ll just cover down on a quarter of a billion dollars every single month that the federal government is supposed to be providing.’”

The community was just shy of the population requirement but had a median household income below the Commonwealth’s average and a rate of educational attainment of a bachelor’s degree that was also below the state average. 
The 2020 US Census provided hope that a few hundred new residents would be counted so the city might reach the population minimum. But the results came back showing Randolph was just 16 people short of the required 35,000.  
The town appealed to the US Census Bureau, making the case that some properties were not counted properly. But it was futile, not only because Randolph’s population dwindled further after the pandemic, but also because its median income later rose slightly above the state average.  
But census counts and income thresholds haven’t stopped state Sen. Bill Driscoll, who represents the town, from trying to secure its Gateway status. Now, he has introduced legislation that would revise the eligibility criteria of a Gateway City – something previously attempted but never done successfully on Beacon Hill since the Legislature officially codified the designation in state law in 2009.  
“We’re on all the same types of lists in terms of educational issues, public health issues – but we are not a Gateway City technically,” Driscoll said of Randolph. “I think it’s worth talking about.” 
State Sen. William (Bill) Driscoll (Credit: Andy Metzger) 
Gateway Cities are midsize urban centers that anchor regional economies around Massachusetts. Collectively, these communities have shared economic struggles, and many suffered from the decline of manufacturing in the decades since World War II. They are also home to 40 percent of the state’s foreign-born residents.   
The term “Gateway City” was first coined in a 2007 report by MassINC, the nonprofit civic organization that also publishes CommonWealth Beacon, and originally described just 11 cities outside of Greater Boston that were, and still are, struggling regional economic centers. 
In 2009, lawmakers adopted the designation and defined Gateway Cities as any city with a population greater than 35,000 but less than 250,000, a median household income below the statewide average, and a rate of educational attainment of a bachelor’s degree or higher that is below the state average. This expanded the list to include 15 additional cities, including ones just outside of Boston even though they do not anchor the regional economy. 
Today, there are 26 Gateway Cities, including places like Holyoke, New Bedford, and Lowell, that meet the criteria set by the Legislature. But as these former industrial cities have worked to revitalize their local economies and reinvent themselves over the last few decades, defining them has become more challenging. 
To the benefit of Randolph, Driscoll’s new bill would add two additional criteria – having a population that’s at least 40 percent people of color and having 15 percent or more of households that identify as speaking English less than “very well” – to the three that cities must currently meet. Municipalities meeting any three of the five categories would be considered a Gateway City, making them eligible for certain grants, tax credits, and state funding for economic and community development.  
Driscoll’s proposed bill would add eight new communities to the list, according to a CommonWealth Beacon analysis of data from the most recent five-year American Community Survey, which covers 2019 to 2023 and provides an up-to-date snapshot of population data across the state.  
Those communities are Randolph, Weymouth, Southbridge, Framingham, Marlborough, Milford, Tisbury (a town of less than 5,000 on the island of Martha’s Vineyard), and perhaps most controversial of all, Boston. The largest city in New England would qualify as a Gateway under the proposed legislation – meeting the minority population, median household income, and English-speaking requisites. 
Driscoll said Gateway City status should be given to communities with those trying to make their start in Massachusetts – regardless of the minimum population – and the two additional criteria help to capture that.  
“I want to make sure that we’re capturing the essence of what this designation means,” Driscoll said. “Starting a life here, starting a business here, a population that is newer to Massachusetts – trying to support them in a way that I think fits with the spirit of the original law.”  
Driscoll added that he’s not yet committed to what exactly the five new criteria should be, and there needs to be further discussion with the communities that could qualify so the Legislature can cast “the appropriate size net.” But he hopes his bill can revive the conversation on Beacon Hill.  
“There’s at least a handful of communities that I think should be eligible for this type of funding,” Driscoll said. “My intention is to cast a wider net.” 
Ben Forman, research director at the MassINC Policy Center, said they never intended Gateway Cities to be based on a deficit formula, and the designation was meant to be given to centers of economic activity. 
“Our whole argument for strategically focusing on these places was because they have important assets to the state. You don’t graduate from that. If you’re a regional economic center, you should hopefully remain a regional economic center,” he said. “The whole point of this was to draw investment to regional economies outside of Boston.”

There are two current Gateway Cities – Salem and Methuen – that do not qualify for the status under the state’s current criteria. Methuen’s median household income has just surpassed the state average. The most recent ACS data shows that nearly 50 percent of Salem residents have a bachelor’s degree or higher, a bit more than the statewide average.  
Under Drsicoll’s bill, Methuen would still meet three of the new five criteria, but Salem would not. 
There is no mechanism in state law to regularly review each city’s eligibility to ensure they meet the three criteria. But Driscoll’s bill would not only allow the secretary of economic development to certify which municipalities qualify after each decennial census, but also give the office the ability to move a community on or off the list at any point mid-decade using annual estimates from the Census Bureau.  
The Legislature has on some occasions recognized “similarly situated communities” for certain grants or funding opportunities. These are municipalities that lack the population of a Gateway City but otherwise meet the state’s criteria.  
Driscoll believes adding two additional criteria will prevent communities like Methuen from toggling in and out of the status every year or two based on a strict set of three criteria, and will allow communities smaller than 35,000 that are still home to disadvantaged populations to benefit from the state funding.  
“I think that’s something we need to consider. Is 35,000 the right number? Or should we even have a floor?” Driscoll said. “Let’s continue to figure out what the right metrics are and how to how to modernize this.”

Prosecutors with the Alaska Department of Law’s Office of Special Prosecutions have filed seven criminal felony charges against The Knights of Ni LLC and its owner, Ryan Carroll, accusing Caroll of defrauding the state’s Medicaid system of more than $500,000.
Online court records did not list an attorney for Carroll, who could not be reached for comment. 
Records published by Alaska’s division of corporate, business and professional licensing show that The Knights of Ni LLC was involuntarily dissolved in 2024 after failing to meet the requirements to keep operating. A record from 2022 shows Carroll as owning 100% of the company. The Knights of Ni is an apparent reference to the 1975 film, “Monty Python and the Holy Grail.”
The Department of Law declined to comment on the case.
According to the criminal complaint, which was filed in Anchorage Superior Court on Oct. 23, the state charges came after an investigation by the Alaska Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, which operates under the Department of Law.
According to an investigator with the unit, Carroll operated as a care coordinator. A care coordinator is someone who helps a Medicaid patient gain “needed medical, social and other services, regardless of the funding source for the services to which access is granted,” according to court filings.
Care coordinators typically work with people who are mentally or physically disabled and cannot fill out paperwork on their own. Under state law and regulation, a care coordinator can be paid by the Alaska Department of Health for their work if they document their patient visits and submit a report to the state.
According to the criminal complaint, the Department of Health received a message warning that Carroll “was having an inappropriate relationship with one of his … clients.”
That prompted an investigation which found Carroll had missed several reports that could have caused as many as 19 Alaskans to lose health care. Further review discovered Carroll “documenting that he was providing monthly care coordination contacts to more than one client on the same date, time, but at different locations.”
In many cases, state investigators found Carroll had not submitted the proper forms to bill Medicaid, and in some cases, “it was not clear whether Carroll was making any contact with his assigned recipients due to the lack of documentation to support his services.”
Based on a review, “there was a total of $519,855.73 worth of claims between 2018 and 2022 that did not have sufficient documentation,” the complaint states.
The case has not yet been assigned to a judge, and a preliminary arraignment is scheduled for Nov. 21 in Anchorage.",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/GettyImages-1280273369-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-30 09:20:29.093747

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Interest in local elections in Jefferson this fall appears to be greater than usual. It’s a good thing.
City council and school board elections in Iowa are held in odd-numbered years. In both 2021 and 2023, out of about 3,100 registered voters in the city of Jefferson, only a little more than 1,200 voted. A turnout of about 40 percent.
That’s not enough.
In even-numbered years, when national and/or state races are on the ballot in Iowa, Greene County’s turnout nears 70 percent. That’s approaching twice what it’s been recently in local elections.
Are national and state government twice as important to us as local elected councils and boards?
A turnout of less than half the registered voters calls into question the “legitimacy” of the winners. Not the actual legal legitimacy, of course, but the validation that winning candidates deserve from their constituents.
Local residents who submit themselves to their neighbors to serve as leaders and policy-makers in their local governments don’t do it for the money, at least not in small-town Iowa. I remember, decades ago, when the Jefferson City Council doubled council members’ salaries: from $5 a meeting to $10. That was because a council member was paying a babysitter at his home more than he was getting to attend the meeting.
And school board members earn exactly nothing for their service in that capacity.
Decisions made at the local level, needless to say, rarely enjoy unanimous support in the public. The higher the election turnout, the greater the comfort level of elected officials in making the tough policy choices.
And that’s the primary job of local elected officials: to set policy. If an action by a particular employee raises objections among local residents, elected officials will feel more confident in discussing with top administrators how to handle the situation if they earned their seats on the council or board through a strong election day turnout.
Campaign donations are important in elections, at every level. Some candidates enjoy large donations, both cash and in-kind, and some even get funds and help from outside their own community. Some don’t. Money helps candidates get their message out. But at the local level, personal acquaintance and resident-to-resident discussion carry more weight than in elections on a larger scale. A big election turnout can mean more to local candidates than it does for public bodies that represent larger constituencies.

Some communities end up with vacancies on their local ballots, from lack of candidate interest and/or reluctance to serve. That’s not the case here. The Jefferson City Council has five members, with three of those seats up for election on November 4. Six candidates are vying for those three seats.
The Greene County Community School Board, also a five-member body, likewise has three seats on the election ballot. Seven candidates are running for those three school board seats.
Local residents owe it to those seeking to serve on those bodies, and they owe it to themselves, to choose who will set policies for their town and their school. Early voting is now open in the east assembly room on the ground floor of the courthouse during courthouse hours. And on Election Day Tuesday, Nov. 4, polling places are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Dictatorships boast about high election turnouts. We should be able to at least match them.

This story was originally reported by Jennifer Gerson of The 19th.
With 42 million Americans on the brink of losing their SNAP benefits on Nov. 1, many nonprofits and online content creators are asking parents to rethink what they hand out to trick-or-treaters this Halloween.
Some groups and influencers are using their platforms to remind followers that funding for SNAP — short for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and often referred to as “food stamps” — is about to run out because of the government shutdown. Handing out nonperishable food alongside candy, they say, can go a long way to help neighbors in need.
In a viral Facebook post, the United Way Family Resource Center recommended adding things like ramen, microwave macaroni-and-cheese cups, shelf-stable pudding, bags of pretzels and protein bars to the sweet treats in every child’s Halloween basket.

“Every little bit helps keep a child’s belly full — and shows that kindness can be just as sweet as candy,” the post says.
Many popular pediatrician influencers and other content creators who focus on child well-being are repeating a similar message. Among their suggestions is placing a supply of Cup Noodles and mini cereal boxes on the doorstep so families can take what they need without stigma.
Heather Black is the vice president of 211 System Strategy at the United Way. 211 is the three-digit dialing code designated at the federal level to connect people to health and human services in their community — and Black said there has been “very significant increases in calls related specifically to food” to 211 since the government shutdown began four weeks ago. 211 has call centers across the country, reaching virtually all of the United States. Callers are connected with a trained responder who, after completing a short intake, connects them with local resources.
Black told The 19th that housing, utility assistance and food have always encompassed the top needs of 211 callers.
Now, she said, “we are starting to see food needs specifically increase from people who maybe have always been able to rely on SNAP benefits and with the increasing publicity that funding from those benefits will not be available for the month of November, there’s beginning to be a lot of anxiety among families around how they’re going to meet those costs.”
Another group of callers concerned about food insecurity right now, Black said, are federal workers who do not receive SNAP benefits, but who are approaching four weeks without a paycheck while also dealing with increasingly high grocery store prices.
“This is real life for people,” Black said. That’s where the spirit of the now-viral Halloween posts come into play — and speak of ways to extend that energy even further.
“I think that’s a really creative idea, the Halloween idea — but that’s just one brief moment in time,” she said. “We’re going to need to do a lot more.”

In addition to encouraging people to support local food pantries and other community groups that help provide groceries to those in need, Black said there are other ways people can help.
“We need to check on our neighbors,” she said, mentioning people with children and older adults in particular.
“We need to check in and make sure that people that we might know who would be in a situation where their income could either be impacted by the government shutdown where they are now not getting a paycheck or if they have relied in the past on some of these programs where funding has now been paused — we need to check in on those folks,” she said.
Black reminded that giving can also go beyond just donating to local food pantries. She recommended that when checking on people whose access to food might have been impacted by the shutdown in some way, ask if they need any items from the grocery store.
“I really encourage people to think in that way because asking for help is not always easy,” she said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/food-bank-canned-goods-1024x696.jpg,,,2025-10-30 09:20:29.093747

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The genesis of the massacre began with a dance.
During the throes of a continuing drought on the Pine Ridge Reservation in 1890, the Lakota people living there were also contending with severely reduced rations from the U.S. government as it tried to pressure Indigenous residents into yielding valuable reservation land. These punitive restrictions caused widespread hunger and starvation, which turned many Lakota tribal members toward Wovoka, a Paiute prophet who “promised the disappearance of the white man and a return of native lands and buffalo if certain rites and dances were performed,” according to Encyclopedia Britannica.
The central ritual of this hybrid Christian-Indigenous religious movement was the so-called “Ghost Dance,” which struck non-Indigenous settlers in the area, then the U.S. government, with paranoid terror (“ghost shirts” sanctified in the dances supposedly could stop bullets).

U.S. soldiers were then dispatched to deal with the situation, just 14 years after Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer and more than 200 of his 7th Cavalry troopers were ignominiously annihilated by a combined force of Lakota, Northern Cheyenne and Arapaho warriors at Montana’s Little Bighorn River valley. Among Army units sent to Pine Ridge in 1890 was the 7th Cavalry.
Ominously, Lakota holy man Sitting Bull, one of the leaders at the Little Bighorn fight, had been killed two weeks before, as tribal police on the Standing Rock Reservation, northeast of Pine Ridge, tried to arrest him after the Ghost Dance rituals were subdued, further enflaming tensions. This prompted some of Sitting Bull’s followers to join a group led by Miniconjou Lakota leader Sitanka, also known as Big Foot, who fled the Cheyenne River agency with a plan to join other leaders at Pine Ridge. Big Foot and his followers encountered 7th Cavalry troops on Dec. 28, 1890, and spent the night uneventfully at a campsite near Wounded Knee Creek.
Early the next morning, everything went south, as U.S. soldiers encircled the encampment and attempted to disarm the group. A shot rang out as soldiers wrestled with a warrior who refused to give up his weapon, followed immediately by a continuous, deadly volley of gunfire from soldiers. In the end, 200 to 300 Lakota men, women and children lay dead — some corpses were found a mile or two from the site — and another 100 were injured. As many as 40 soldiers also reportedly died in the mayhem.
The frozen Lakota dead (a frigid snowstorm had rolled in the next day), including Big Foot, were dumped unceremoniously into a mass grave several days later.
In 2025, the immediate issue is the insistence of Pete Hegseth, secretary of the newly minted U.S. Department of War, that U.S. history records this terrible tragedy as a “battle” and not what it objectively was, a massacre of many unarmed people, including women and children. To that end, Hegseth will not revoke Medals of Honor — it’s America’s highest military honor today but in 1890 was a less revered military decoration — that were granted to approximately 20 soldiers after the incident (the precise number is in debate, because records for some of the medals are incomplete or unclear). Members of Congress including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, have made repeated attempts to revoke the medals legislatively, which South Dakota’s congressional delegation has not supported.
“We cannot be a country that celebrates and rewards horrifying acts of violence,” Warren said recently. “With this announcement, Secretary Hegseth is valorizing people who committed a massacre.”
Medals awarded for Wounded Knee Massacre won’t be rescinded, Hegseth announces

Deb Haaland, a candidate for governor in New Mexico and the first Native American to serve as Interior Department secretary, under President Joe Biden, said that Hegseth’s rhetoric about the medals represented “cruelty, not justice.”
In 2024, under Biden, then Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin convened a panel to review the actions of each soldier at Wounded Knee, and reconsider the medals’ validity. But a report by the panel was never released and Austin did not make a final decision. Hegseth termed this “careless inaction,” and stressed that the medals were deserved.
This year, South Dakota’s U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson sponsored a bill — the Wounded Knee Massacre Memorial and Sacred Site Act — to preserve a section of land where the massacre took place. It passed the House and is awaiting action in the Senate, where South Dakota’s Mike Rounds and John Thune are sponsoring an identical bill.
In a press release issued by Johnson’s House office, he stated: “In 2023, I visited the site of the Wounded Knee Massacre. I met with descendants of the survivors, and I saw the bloodstained floorboards of St. John’s Church where the wounded were treated. It was a tragic day in America’s history. My bill acknowledges our mistake and ensures this land will be sacred for generations to come.”
Soldiers significantly outnumbered Native Americans that fateful day at Wounded Knee. The troops also fired four cannons from a hilltop at such a distance that, according to a 1980 journal article by Larry D. Roberts of South Dakota State University, neither the age nor gender of those targeted could be clearly distinguished.
Not much of a “battle.”

That money is now grinding to a halt over Republican accusations of bias toward progressive groups in the program’s grant awarding process.
The General Assembly voted in June to bar the awarding of new IOLTA grants from this July until June 2026, cutting off millions of dollars to groups like Legal Aid of North Carolina, who announced in October they are closing offices in Rocky Mount and Pembroke as a result.

In an Oct. 22 House Select Committee on Oversight and Reform hearing over IOLTA, committee chair Rep. Harry Warren (R-Rowan) said the program has violated its mandate by funding legal organizations aligned with progressive causes. The pause, he said, is to allow lawmakers to “investigate the group’s board and how they choose their grantees.”
“We’ve heard from a number of folks that IOLTA does good work, and we have seen evidence of that, but IOLTA has also gone somewhat rogue, awarding grants to leftist groups with leftist ideologies,” Warren said.
As the state legislature carries out inquiries over the political activities of grant recipients and probes the awarding process, tens of thousands of low-income North Carolinians stand to lose access to free legal services.
What is IOLTA?
In its first four decades of operation, IOLTA has been an obscure, noncontroversial program for funding legal aid to those without the means to afford representation, from assistance in the wake of hurricanes to helping remedy elder abuse and family violence.
The funds come from interest accrued on private trust accounts that lawyers are required to maintain in the course of their practice, often arising from real estate transactions and legal settlements among other sources. That interest is used for charitable purposes, issuing grants to programs that provide financial assistance for civil legal aid.
IOLTA executive director Mary Irvine told NC Newsline that until 1983, these trust accounts were all non-interest-bearing, until a voluntary IOLTA program overseen by the State Bar was approved by the North Carolina Supreme Court.
“If these funds are sitting in a trust account, it could be an interest-bearing account, and that interest could be directed to the public’s benefit by supporting activities that would improve the justice system and ensure that folks that didn’t have money to pay for an attorney would have that legal support,” Irvine said in an interview.

The program has awarded $134 million in grants since its inception, more than 90% of which goes to organizations that provide legal assistance to low-income clients. About 7% goes to Administration of Justice grants, which aim to facilitate legal services around the state.
IOLTA has also played a key role in disaster relief in particular, delivering nearly $1 million to residents impacted by Hurricane Helene in 2024 — helping them get justice in consumer fraud cases and navigate complex insurance claims.
In 2025, according to a January press release, IOLTA issued $12 million in grants, about $6 million of which went to Legal Aid of North Carolina. The North Carolina Justice Center and Pisgah Legal Services, a western North Carolina-focused legal aid nonprofit, each received more than $1 million.
“Our primary focus is on individuals who are under-resourced. They do not have the ability to pay for an attorney. They have limited income,” Irvine said. “These are folks that are seniors, veterans, people with disabilities, survivors of domestic violence, families that are facing, you know, some kind of economic hardship.”

Because the funds overseen are entirely private, some Democratic lawmakers argued the General Assembly should not be overseeing them. The Republican theory is that because IOLTA is administered by the State Bar, it is subject to scrutiny by the state legislature.
“Since it was not created as a state-taxpayer-dollar fund, there was no aspiration or expectation that it should be accountable to the state of North Carolina and have accountability here in our legislature, correct?” asked Rep. Maria Cervania (D-Wake) during the oversight hearing.
“I don’t want to speak on what the legislature can and can’t review or take a look at,” said NC Bar Association executive director Peter Bolac. “I think that this was a program from the Supreme Court and the legal profession to be able to provide these services, and it has not in the past had any interactions with the legislature.”
‘An echo chamber’
Republican lawmakers said during the oversight hearing that their primary concern is over funding for progressive legal causes.
Warren began the oversight hearing by listing groups funded by IOLTA whose mission statements espouse left-wing ideas.
He said that the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, which received $55,000 from IOLTA this year, has stated that “the United States’ wealth and power is built upon stolen land from enslaved labor and under the racist lie that white people were superior to Black people, indigenous people, and people of color.”

Warren also took aim at the Carolina Migrant Network, the recipient of a $55,000 grant, for impeding ICE activities in Charlotte, and at Emancipate NC, whose program Carolina Parent Defenders received $98,000, for opposing “mass incarceration and structural racism,” among other organizations whose mission statements have involved diversity, equity, and inclusion aims.
“The IOLTA board of advisors did not have a single Republican from 2015 until 2020. It now has three Republican members,” Warren said. “This is a good program with the potential to improve access to the legal system for those who cannot otherwise afford it. But we need to understand how it strayed from its original mission.”
Bolac said political affiliation plays no part in the selection of IOLTA board members, though he conceded that conservative views have at times been absent from the organization.

“I think it’s fair to say, in the past, there used to be a little bit of an echo chamber,” Bolac said. “Now, while we have put an interest form on our website, we’re promoting it in the State Bar Journal and on our website to make it clear that anyone is eligible to apply and show interest in these positions.”
Rep. Grant Campbell (R-Cabarrus) said his concern is that the General Assembly “may be financing” political activities conducted by grant recipients. He noted that the Amica Center made social media posts celebrating Gov. Roy Cooper’s veto of an ICE cooperation bill in 2022 and describing “how we’re fighting back” against the Trump administration.
“I worry about funds being fungible, where you give an organization and say, ‘Here’s the money and only do it with this,” Campbell said. “But do you have concerns that [that] frees up funds for them to do other things that certainly would not be in line with the mission of this grant program’s purpose?”
Bolac said that the IOLTA program strictly prohibits the use of funds for political activities and is considering additional restrictions on funding to entities that engage in lobbying.
“I recognize that funds given for one purpose can free up funds for another purpose. Part of that acknowledgement and hearing these concerns is [the fact that] we have come to the table when addressing this issue during the last five or six months,” he said.
‘A situation that we didn’t cause’
The funding freeze means the tens of thousands of North Carolinians who depend on legal aid funded by IOLTA are left with few options for assistance. And even if grants resume next July, some organizations may not be able to recover from the impact.
Legal Aid of North Carolina is shutting down two of their 12 rural offices, with more closures likely to come as they seek to recoup about $6 million in lost funding next year. While grants from local governments in places like Durham and Charlotte are enough to maintain those offices, rural counties do not have the same cushion.
“We’ve received IOLTA funding for over three decades, and it is a critical component of our ability to provide access in rural areas,” said Ashley Campbell, CEO of Legal Aid NC. “We have very few grants from local governments in rural areas because they don’t have enough money.”
She questioned why her organization, which receives about half of IOLTA’s grant money each year and which lawmakers on both sides of the aisle praised for its work during the hearing, should be thrown into chaos because of controversy over nonprofits receiving far smaller sums.

“It just feels so frustrating to know that we have $6 million of investments on the line and that, like 8,000 people will be impacted by the loss of that money — and that no one is expressing concern about the work that we do or how we spend that IOLTA money, but it’s frozen,” she said in an interview. “We’re caught in a situation that we didn’t cause. And our clients are, because of our volume, we’re going to have the biggest impact.”
That means more counties where Legal Aid attorneys are unable to attend court alongside their clients. The cuts will cause long-term staffing issues even if funding resumes, due to the difficulty of recruiting rural attorneys, Campbell added.
Some of the largest effects may be borne by residents of western North Carolina still recovering from the impacts of Hurricane Helene. Legal Aid NC handled more than 4,000 cases related to the storm and provided about $3 million in legal assistance — a level of support that would not be possible should another major storm hit the state during the funding freeze.
Some lawmakers raised the possibility of letting funding for Legal Aid NC continue while the IOLTA inquiry proceeds.
“Is it possible that we can unfreeze some of these funds to fully fund Legal Aid?” asked Rep. Allison Dahle (D-Wake.) “We seem to have questions about other organizations and Legal Aid seems to be well-documented, and I’m really concerned that so many lives depend on domestic violation protections.”
Beyond Legal Aid, many of the organizations dependent on IOLTA funds have had to conduct layoffs or roll back operations amid the loss of funding.
In a letter to lawmakers circulated by Cervania, Disability Rights NC wrote that they have had to cut hours and reduce intake, limiting their ability to provide legal services to children and families with disability needs. Inner Banks Legal Services, a family law small nonprofit, will have to cease free services entirely, the firm wrote in its own letter.
“Each delay or denied intake represents a real person whose safety or stability is on the line. One such person is Mrs. Jones, a devoted wife and mother of four,” wrote Inner Banks Legal Services executive director Sarah Beth Withers. “Her husband controlled all family income, assets, and banking. Over time, he became abusive, and the violence escalated until Mrs. Jones was hospitalized. Criminal charges were filed against her husband, but because she has no income and no access to family funds, Mrs. Jones cannot afford legal representation.”
Rep. Mike Schietzelt (R-Wake) (Source: ncleg.gov)
With Inner Banks unable to provide free aid to help her obtain a domestic violence protection order, Withers wrote that Jones and others may “remain trapped in danger.”
Rep. Mike Schietzelt (R-Wake) said that his own personal situation would have been much different if his family had access to free legal aid services during his youth. He said the pause on funding is “deeply unfortunate” but raised his own concerns about resources going to groups that carry out political advocacy.
“I share the concerns voiced by so many of my colleagues that access to justice is being impeded here — that there are great organizations, like Legal Aid and Pisgah Legal Services that are doing critically important work in areas that desperately need it, particularly communities that are impacted by Helene,” he said. “I’m upset that we’re in this situation right now. I would like to find a pathway out of it.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3140930-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-30 09:20:29.093747

California used to be a leader in the anti-drunk driving movement. 
A Sacramento mother started MADD, helping create some of the nation’s toughest DUI laws in the 1980s. They worked: California cut alcohol-related roadway fatalities by more than half.
A new CalMatters investigation shows that things have changed, dramatically. California now has some of the weakest DUI laws in the nation, allowing repeat drunk and drugged drivers to stay on the road with little punishment.
The results have been deadly:

Alcohol-related roadway deaths in California have shot up by more than 50% in the past decade — an increase more than twice as steep as the rest of the country. 


More than 1,300 people die each year statewide in drunken collisions. Again and again, repeat DUI offenders cause the crashes.

Reporters Robert Lewis and Lauren Hepler found that California too often fails to differentiate between drunk drivers who made a dangerous mistake but learn from it, and those who refuse to stop endangering lives.

Here, drivers generally can’t be charged with a felony until their fourth DUI within 10 years, unless they injure someone. In some states, a second DUI can be a felony. 


California gives repeat drunk drivers their licenses back faster than other states. We found drivers with as many as six DUIs who were able to get a license in California.


Many drivers stay on the road for years even when the state does take their license — racking up tickets and even additional DUIs. We found one woman who has 16 DUIs. Repeat offenders rarely face serious consequences until they kill. 

Despite the mounting death toll, state leaders at all levels have shown little willingness to address the issue. Victims’ families are left in anguish to contemplate how the state allowed their loved ones to be killed. 
Sarah Villar was walking the dog with her fiance when a driver with three DUI convictions killed her. Her parents buried her in her wedding dress.

Dave Villar, Sarah’s father: “To the broken justice system that allowed this to happen — shame on you. If I walked out my front door today onto my porch and fired a shot into my neighborhood every day until I killed someone, when would I be a menace to society? When do I become a danger to my community? I say it’s after the first shot. Our system says it’s after the last.”

Prop. 50 payoff?

With only a few days until Election Day, what started out as a mere threat on a July social media post could turn out to be Gov. Gavin Newsom pulling off one of his biggest political gambles.
As CalMatters’ Jeanne Kuang explains, Proposition 50 is polling ahead with likely voters and Newsom took the rare step Monday to urge supporters to stop donating money — an apparent sign of the governor’s confidence that the measure would pass. 
Though the gerrymander proposal was a risk for Newsom, it has also raised his political profile: Former President Barack Obama joined him in promoting Prop. 50, and Newsom’s approval as a 2028 Democratic presidential candidate rose from 12% in June to 25% in August, according to a national Emerson College poll.
But there’s no guarantee Democrats would gain control of the House if Prop. 50 were to pass. Nationwide, voters are also more concerned about crime and the economy than issues related to protecting Democracy, the ostensible goal of Prop. 50.

Matt Rodriguez, Democratic strategist: “There’s still a long way to go, as to whether this passing will leapfrog (Newsom) further than he has already. It’s just not a vote-driver for most Americans.”

Changing toxic waste rules

A proposal from state regulators to lift reporting requirements for tracking toxic waste has environmental advocates ringing alarm bells, writes CalMatters’ Alejandra Reyes-Velarde.
To track hazardous waste in California, businesses must make detailed reports that include what toxic materials are in what containers, where the waste is coming from and where it’s heading. These reports both help generators of waste prove they’re following regulations and aid emergency responders in case there’s an accident during transport.
But the state’s Department of Toxic Substances Control is considering relaxing some of these tracking rules when companies are transporting waste within their own properties and along some public roads. The University of California, which is one of the over 200 hazardous waste producers that would be affected by the change, supports the proposal, arguing it would make disposal processes safer and more efficient.
Critics, however, fear that the change would signal intent to loosen more rules to manage California’s growing waste problem. State regulators also haven’t clarified specific details, such as how many miles hazardous waste may travel without being tracked.

You can buy liquor at wholesale clubs like Costco or BJ’s in Connecticut without a membership. State law requires that alcohol retailers sell to the general public, meaning stores cannot restrict liquor sales to members only. 
This rule applies even to membership-based warehouses such as Costco, Sam’s Club, and BJ’s. In fact, many Connecticut Costco locations have a separate entrance for their liquor departments, allowing anyone 21 or older to shop without entering the main members-only area. Connecticut is one of several states, including Massachusetts, New York, and Michigan, where local laws override warehouse membership requirements for alcohol sales. 
If a store employee says otherwise, you can politely ask to speak with a manager or show proof of the law. Just remember to bring valid ID, as all alcohol sales still require age verification under Connecticut law to ensure compliance with state regulations.

But it’s a start",Jim Newton,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/los-angeles-macarthur-park-fence/,L.A. will spend $2 million fencing MacArthur Park. Critics say it will just hide homelessness and addiction issues in the neighborhood. Supporters say it'll make the area safer.,"Los Angeles struggles to balance its humane responses to addiction and homelessness with its more instant but often less durable alternatives — police action.  MacArthur Park, a 35-acre space in the heart of L.A.’s Westlake neighborhood, is proving to be a frustrating testing ground.
Neighbors want a safer place for children to play and residents to enjoy the outdoors. Does that mean they must tolerate needle exchanges or encourage roundups of  homeless people? Are plans to beautify the park just window dressing or a genuine contribution to safety?
The latest debate involves putting a wrought iron fence around the park with limited access through gates. What does a fence say about how the city approaches and resolves its toughest issues?
Los Angeles’ Recreation and Parks Commission and some public speakers tackled those questions during a recent hearing. Most speakers who could make the hearing — which was held on Thursday during work hours — opposed the fence idea. 
Some said it would wall off their community while doing nothing to address the proliferation of drugs or the intractability of the area’s homeless population.  
“We have to ask ourselves why a fence is needed,” a health care worker who lives near the park said. “A fence will not bring dignity. It’s only going to push people further into invisibility.” 
Others warned about the fence’s “unwelcome” symbolism and the closing off of public space. They said it was shielding the public from the reality of homelessness,  “marginalizing human beings” and wasting city money. 
“I question whether this proposal is truly concerned with improving the community,” another speaker noted, “or whether its true intention is to improve the aesthetics of Los Angeles.”
A fence is not a wall 
Although critics dominated the public comments at the commission hearing, the fence has supporters. A fence is not a wall, those backers argue. Its gates would be open and it could be slatted, offering clear views into the park. And it might help steady the neighborhood and regulate access to the park, cutting down on the foot traffic from surrounding sidewalks, which sometimes teem with drug-addled people who wander in and out of the park. 
After the contentious hearing, during which the commission repeatedly threatened to throw out disruptive activists, the commission voted to approve $2.3 million for the project. Now city staff can produce a more complete design. But it hardly mollified the community’s advocates or brought the two sides together. 
Opponents of this project are roughly split between those who see the park as a magnet for crime and those who see it as a refuge for the city’s most put-upon residents.
For the former group, criminal justice answers — more police patrols and crackdowns on drug trafficking and stolen merchandise sales — are the logical way to make the park safer and more welcoming. 
But for those who see the park’s denizens as victims of misguided social policies, law enforcement solutions seem cruel and doomed to fail in the long run. They instead urge the city to use its resources to develop housing and fund “harm-reduction services,” such as addiction treatment and needle exchanges.
The stark division between them has the unfortunate effect of putting advocates in silos, from which they fail to appreciate that lasting solutions are almost certainly going to require elements of both approaches. 
Things that help can also hurt the park
It is true that the park cannot be cleaned up by arresting those who are homeless, whose principal crime is merely being poor. But it is also true that treating the problems of the park as mere symptoms of deeper societal problems postpones doing something now, and it may actually make things worse.
Take, for example, the understandable desire to treat addiction as a disease and to respond to it not with arrests but with treatment and outreach – with needle exchanges, for instance. Those exchanges save lives, but they also attract users and dealers — hardly what MacArthur Park or its neighbors need.

Police Chief Jim McDonnell has seen the benefits of needle exchanges, but he also cautions that they have their place.  MacArthur Park today already is so burdened by drug abuse that anything encouraging users is misguided. “I feel like it’s enabling people,” he told me recently.
McDonnell acknowledged that some of the efforts at MacArthur Park will need revisiting. The temporary fencing now being used to block off merchants from selling stolen goods – and sometimes drugs – has helped protect stores along Alvarado Street, along the park’s eastern edge, and helped bring down crime in the neighborhood. But the chain-link fences are rickety and fill up with trash. “It’s not a good situation,” he said.
No solution will succeed on its own, and some proposals are more significant than they appear. Even the objection that the park perimeter fence is intended to improve the look of the park rather than to address its substantive problems ignores the connection between the two.
The ‘Broken Windows’  theory of safety
The relationship between an area’s appearance and its safety is not a matter of speculation. It is at the heart of the most important work of policing philosophy in the modern era, the 1982 Atlantic magazine article by James Q. Wilson and George Kelling that laid out the theory of “Broken Windows.” 
That article identified “order” as an essential element of community safety. Disorder, as exemplified by a neighborhood where broken windows are left unattended, is not just blight. It contributes to crime, with small offenses such as vandalism creating space and opportunity for more dangerous activity.
That is precisely what is at work in MacArthur Park today. An atmosphere of disorder is manifest in slovenly streets and the ramshackle attempts to combat it. It is a neighborhood of trash and disrepair, radiating neglect and inviting crime.  And crime has followed, just as “Broken Windows” argued. 
Would a fence fix that? Probably not by itself. But it is wrong to say its effect would just be aesthetic. The feel of a community can create the reality of a community — one that cares about its wellbeing and defends it. A more beautiful park would be a more orderly park, with police to enforce that order and the community to benefit from it.
That’s a goal worthy of a $2-million fence.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-30 12:28:58+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Boston missed its own deadline for applying to a FEMA program. Residents are footing the bill.,Jordan Wolman,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/environment/boston-missed-its-own-deadline-for-applying-to-a-fema-program-residents-are-footing-the-bill/,"Across Massachusetts, more than 300 communities – including Boston – aren’t reaping the benefits of the FEMA program, known as Community Rating System. It’s led to residents in some municipalities collectively paying hundreds of thousands of dollars per year in flood insurance costs that could have been avoided.","GEOFF GAMM GOT his first flood insurance bill and knew he had to do something about it. 
When Gamm purchased his East Boston townhouse in 2022, he knew that he’d need to buy flood insurance because his new home was located in a flood-prone part of the city. 
But the bill was nearly $2,000. That’s roughly the same amount Gamm pays for regular homeowners insurance. 
So he did some research. 
What he found was a federal program that offers discounts for residents with flood insurance who live in municipalities that are certified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to have gone above and beyond minimum national flood-prevention standards. Essentially, it’s a reward for homeowners, renters, and businesses in communities that work to minimize flood risk.  
Residents and businesses vulnerable to flooding elsewhere in Massachusetts – from Quincy to Winchester to Worcester – that have policies through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) can take advantage of the FEMA program, which has triggered discounts as high as 20 percent in some parts of the state.  
But across Massachusetts, more than 300 communities — including Boston — aren’t reaping the benefits of the program, known as Community Rating System (CRS). Officials in those cities and towns say they generally haven’t sought the certification because of the heavy administrative burdens involved with applying for and maintaining the designation. It’s led to residents in some municipalities collectively paying hundreds of thousands of dollars per year in flood insurance costs that could have been avoided. 
At a time in which rising costs of living are dominating Massachusetts policy discussions, the fact that residents across the state – including in its biggest city — haven’t been able to take advantage of a program that could scale back insurance prices even as disastrous flooding events are happening with more severity and frequency adds a layer to the affordability crisis hammering the Bay State. 
In Boston, Gamm and some 5,770 homeowners, renters, and businesses like him are missing out on the discounts because the city has not applied to participate in the program, despite a goal laid out in 2016 to join CRS by 2021.  
The inaction has likely cost Boston residents at least $785,000 in total unnecessary flood insurance costs since the city missed its 2021 self-imposed deadline, according to state data analyzed by CommonWealth Beacon.  
Gamm has raised the issue with city officials multiple times since 2023, according to email communications reviewed by CommonWealth Beacon, and secured a letter of support advocating for Boston’s participation from his state representative, Adrian Madaro. But he’s only felt frustrated and stonewalled since.  
“I don’t think that this has been taken seriously or with the urgency I’d expect,” Gamm said.  
Chris Osgood, director of Boston’s office of climate resilience, told CommonWealth Beacon in a statement that the city is planning to apply to join the Community Rating System next year. That new goal of 2026 participation was set in Boston’s 2021 hazard mitigation plan, the same year the city missed its original target.  
Osgood said the city’s failure to join the program was because of complications tied to its large coastline and aging buildings and infrastructure, which make Boston “uniquely” flood prone. He also said it has taken time to build up the “internal capacity” needed to meet FEMA’s “strict requirements,” including a city review of all floodplain development. 
Nationwide, only 1,700 communities have joined the program out of 22,600 municipalities that could participate. Coastal cities like Miami, San Diego, and Houston participate in CRS, along with others in New England like Portland, Maine, and New Haven, Connecticut. 
When FEMA certifies a municipality has met the requirements to join the Community Rating System, the agency assigns that community a class number between 1 and 9. Each class corresponds with a 5 percent flood insurance discount for all of that community’s residents who have flood insurance through the NFIP. The best class, 1, cuts flood insurance costs by 45 percent for those residents. 
In the four years between Boston missing its goal to join the Community Rating System in 2021 and now, city policyholders have paid roughly $15.7 million in flood insurance premiums, according to the CommonWealth Beacon analysis confirmed by the state Department of Conservation and Recreation. 
Even if Boston received the lowest score of a 9 through the program in 2021, triggering a 5 percent discount, policyholders in the city would have saved approximately $785,000 in flood insurance costs over the four years. Had Boston achieved an even better score, policyholders in the city would have saved even more money. 
Chad Beginnis, executive director of the Association of State Floodplain Managers, said that communities generally work closely alongside FEMA during the application process so that there is a “fair and reasonable expectation” that that community will in fact be accepted into the program. 
But the large volume of documentation that is required by FEMA can make it difficult for municipalities to apply even if they are already engaging in initiatives that count toward the program.  
“That whole process requires a level of focused intention,” said Atyia Martin, Boston’s first chief resilience officer under Mayor Marty Walsh, who initially laid out the goal in 2016 to join CRS by 2021. “And if that is not in place, then you keep kicking the can down the road because it is resource-intensive and there’s no funding for it.”

To achieve Class 9 status, communities need to maintain construction certificates for all buildings in the floodplain. They must also disclose “repetitive loss” properties and develop a plan to address those areas. Boston officials said they have updated requirements for certificates of occupancy for certain floodplain developments and investigated buildings’ compliance with elevation rules. 
To pass on even greater flood insurance savings with a better class level, communities must adopt certain regulatory requirements, including instituting an ordinance or building code that raises new construction higher above the flood level.  
Some communities that are home to a limited number of residents with flood insurance might decide that there won’t be enough savings to justify the work associated with joining the program. In other cases, municipalities said they faced difficulty in dedicating limited staff capacity to reviewing a FEMA manual that often changes which activities count for credits toward program participation.  
The latter is what has held back Peabody from applying to join the program, said Curt Bellavance, the town’s director of community development and planning.  
“I have not taken the time to review the requirements of the program to see if we should strive to become a CRS participant,” he said. “It’s one of those things I’d like to work on but just don’t have the bandwidth to get done right now.” 
Elsewhere in Massachusetts, however, Bay State residents in the 22 communities enrolled in the Community Rating System are receiving flood insurance discounts.  
Worcester, for instance, has been able to climb from a Class 9 when it joined CRS in 1995 to a 7 in 2020, securing for its residents a 15 percent discount. Michelle Smith, Worcester’s assistant chief development officer, said the program forces the city to educate the community multiple times each year – not just for property owners in the floodplain but also real estate agents, engineers, surveyors, and watershed associations.  
“The program has really encouraged us to be intentional about protecting our floodplains – particularly those that are not developed – from an open space planning perspective,” Smith said. 
Smaller communities like Provincetown, which at the tip of Cape Cod is particularly vulnerable to coastal storms, sea level rise, and flooding, have also found success with the program. Officials there hope they can improve their Class 8 level as FEMA reevaluates the town’s participation this year. 
“I think that’s certainly the most tangible benefit,” Tim Famulare, Provincetown’s community development director, said of the insurance discounts. “But what’s hard to measure is what the flood insurance claims would be if we were not so rigorously enforcing the floodplain requirements of the building code. That’s something we can’t really measure … what would flood insurance claims look like if we hadn’t gotten involved, if we hadn’t joined the program? Certainly, that reduces the number of claims and helps bring down premiums for our community.” 
In Quincy, the city’s 3,500 policyholders benefit from $530,000 in annual savings on flood insurance thanks to its Class 7 status, according to city data shared with CommonWealth Beacon. FEMA reaffirmed Quincy’s rating within the program last year. 
For a city as vulnerable as Cambridge, it wasn’t an easy feat to join the program when it did in 2015 after a six-month process.  
And it’s been a “heavy lift” for the city to improve its current Class 9 status, which would require adoption of a new regulation limiting development in the floodplain, said Jennifer Letourneau, Cambridge’s conservation commission director. 
“The reason why Cambridge joined the CRS in the first place is that we were very well aware of climate change, sea level rise, storm surge,” she said. “We thought more people may be buying flood insurance going forward, and so we want to make sure we were doing our due diligence to offer the best possible rates to our residents by being able to offer them at least some discounts.” 
Missing out on these discounts for flood-prone Massachusetts residents is only compounding the financial strain of flood risk. 
A report from Massachusetts insurance commissioner Michael Caljouw found that there was a 6.2 percent year-over-year increase in the number of NFIP policyholders in the state between 2022 and 2023. And more than half of all NFIP policyholders in Massachusetts are seeing an increase in their insurance costs this year after FEMA introduced a new pricing approach.

Gamm, the East Boston resident, said it’s not that the city hasn’t taken proactive steps to address flooding issues — if anything, it’s the opposite. He credited the Piers Park II project on the waterfront — which replaced gravel lots with green space to absorb more stormwater – built in 2023 right across from his home as an innovative initiative specifically designed to combat coastal flooding.  
But without joining the program, efforts like these that lower the actual risk of flood damage “make no difference for me financially,” Gamm said.  
“This feels like a really easy win-win for city politicians to get excited about, putting money back in people’s pockets by protecting their communities,” Gamm said. “We’ve fallen short on actually helping people realize that impact financially.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/geoffgamm2-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C686&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-30 08:56:33.595684

The same thing happened in August that year — another DUI arrest, this time by Fresno police, and another warrant for skipping court.
All three Fresno DUI cases were still open, and all three warrants were out for Conway’s arrest, when police say he sped — drunk again — on his way to a casino in February 2022. This time, he lost control, flipped his Acura and killed his passenger, Khayriyyah Jones. He’s now facing murder charges in Madera County.
California’s DUI enforcement system is broken. The toll can be counted in bodies.
Alcohol-related roadway deaths in California have shot up by more than 50% in the past decade — an increase more than twice as steep as the rest of the country, federal estimates show. More than 1,300 people die each year statewide in drunken collisions. Thousands more are injured. Again and again, repeat DUI offenders cause the crashes.

To understand why so many people are dying under the wheels of drunk and drugged drivers, CalMatters reviewed thousands of vehicular manslaughter and homicide cases prosecutors filed across the state since 2019. We also examined other states’ laws on intoxicated driving and sifted through decades of state and federal traffic safety data.
We found that California has some of the weakest DUI laws in the country, allowing repeat drunk and drugged drivers to stay on the road with little punishment. Here, drivers generally can’t be charged with a felony until their fourth DUI within 10 years, unless they injure someone. In some states, a second DUI can be a felony. 
California too often fails to differentiate between drunk drivers who made a dangerous mistake but learn from it and those who refuse to stop endangering lives. It’s the missed opportunities to prevent tragedies that haunt the loved ones of the dead.
Sarah Villar, a pediatric physical therapist, was out walking the dog with her fiance in San Benito County when a drunk driver swerved off the road and killed her in 2021. The driver had been convicted of driving drunk in 2018, 2019 and again in 2020 — all misdemeanors — and served just a couple weeks behind bars before the fatal crash.
Villar’s parents buried her in her wedding dress.
“To the broken justice system that allowed this to happen — shame on you,” her father, Dave Villar, said in her eulogy. “If I walked out my front door today onto my porch and fired a shot into my neighborhood every day until I killed someone, when would I be a menace to society? When do I become a danger to my community? I say it’s after the first shot. Our system says it’s after the last.”
California also gives repeat drunk drivers their licenses back faster than other states. Here, you typically lose your license for three years after your third DUI, compared to eight years in New Jersey, 15 years in Nebraska and a permanent revocation in Connecticut. We found drivers with as many as six DUIs who were able to get a license in California.
Many drivers stay on the road for years even when the state does take their license — racking up tickets and even additional DUIs — with few consequences until they eventually kill.
When the worst does happen, there’s often little punishment. Drunk vehicular manslaughter isn’t considered a “violent felony.” But in a twist of state law, a DUI that causes “great bodily injury” is — meaning that a drunk driver who breaks someone’s leg can face more time behind bars than if they’d killed them, prosecutors said.
Despite the mounting death toll, state leaders have shown little willingness to address the issue. A bill proposed in the state Legislature this year would have expanded the use of in-car breathalyzers, which research shows can significantly reduce drunk driving. Most other states already require the device for first-time DUI offenders. But lawmakers killed the provision after the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles said it didn’t have the time or resources to carry it out.  
Drunk and drugged driving is now so common in car-centric California that drivers routinely rack up four, five, six DUIs. One woman in Fresno just got her 16th. 
The case files we reviewed are full of horrific reminders of this ubiquity. Like the story of Masako Saenz.
In 2000, Saenz was driving with her 5-year-old son, Manuel, to pick up an uncle in Stockton for the family’s Easter celebration when a drunk driver slammed his pickup truck into her tiny Toyota Tercel, killing the boy.
The driver had been convicted of his fourth DUI two months before. He likely would have been behind bars that day, but San Joaquin Superior Court Judge John Cruikshank was letting him finish a rehab program before reporting to jail.
The case made national news when Saenz broke down during the arraignment. “Murderer! Murderer! You killed my son!” she screamed and had to be removed from the courtroom. 
She told a Sacramento Bee reporter that people would marvel at how well she seemed to be doing. “But they have no idea,” she said. “They have no idea. Sometimes even now I wonder if I can go on.”

In the years after, her life unraveled, police and court records show. Saenz became homeless, sleeping along Sacramento roadways.
She appears to have started posting to an online memorial website for her son — simple messages of love and grief sent into the void. “He will always be with me,” reads the last post from January 2022.
Three months later, a man with a blood alcohol level twice the legal limit — whose license was suspended after a string of speeding tickets — gunned his car, lost control and careened into an encampment just miles from the state Capitol. A witness found her body wrapped in a tent. 
Mother and son were killed two decades apart by drunk drivers who never should have been on the road.
It doesn’t have to be this way.
‘It’s accepted in society until the worst happens’
Once upon a time, California showed that you can reduce drunk driving deaths simply by trying. 
Two decades before Saenz’s son was killed, another Sacramento mother’s unfathomable loss galvanized the state and country. In 1980, Candace Lightner’s 13-year-old daughter was walking to a church carnival when a drunk driver — out of jail days after what was reportedly his fourth DUI arrest — slammed into her so hard she flew out of her shoes, landing 125 feet away.
In response, Lightner helped found Mothers Against Drunk Driving, ushering in the modern anti-DUI movement. California was at the forefront, forming a special task force in 1980. State leaders enacted a slate of new laws, setting a legal limit for blood alcohol content and increasing DUI penalties. In 1982, Gov. Jerry Brown touted the reforms as the “toughest package of legislation in the Nation against driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.”
In the decades that followed, California cut alcohol-related roadway fatalities by more than half. 
Now, the state’s headed backward. And as deaths have increased, law enforcement has done less: DUI arrests statewide dropped from nearly 200,000 in 2010 to 100,000 in 2020.
The death of Masako Saenz launched no new movements. Her killing was briefly mentioned in a local news roundup of homeless deaths from 2022. But that was about it. There wasn’t a picture of her on the site, just a stock photo of a burning candle — a placeholder for a life lost.

The Sacramento County District Attorney’s Office filed a lesser manslaughter charge against the driver, Puentis Currie Jr., instead of the more serious charge police recommended. Currie got three months behind bars, then a few months with a monitoring bracelet so he could keep going to college.
Prosecutors asked Sacramento County Superior Court Judge John P. Winn to sentence Currie to at least community service instead of letting him “sit at home and play video games,” according to a court transcript. But Winn declined, saying he was leaving the department and didn’t want to saddle his replacement with decisions regarding the details of such an order.
Just this past May, police caught Currie driving on a suspended license again after pulling him over for a busted headlight, court records show. That could have meant more jail time. Instead, he got a ticket.
Currie said he needs to drive to and from work and was driving home from a shift when he got the recent citation. Now 25, he hopes talking about his case might keep other kids from driving while intoxicated.
He said that the night he killed Masako Saenz, he had gone out to celebrate his cousin’s birthday. He did tequila shots and took ecstasy and remembers getting in the car but nothing else until after the crash.
One of his attorneys told him about Saenz’s son. The weight of what he’d done hit him.
He said he goes back to the scene of the crash every April.
“I put flowers there just to show, like —” he said, breaking down in tears, “show that I care, or show her that I’m truly sorry.”
He said it’s too easy to ignore the risk of driving under the influence. Lawyers, doctors, everyone gets DUIs.
“I think it’s accepted in society until the worst happens,” he said.
‘It is literally just a matter of time before they kill’
David Alvarado already had three prior DUIs when a CHP officer saw him almost hit another car in January 2019. He admitted he’d been drinking Coors Light at a friend’s house. 
But prosecutors couldn’t charge Alvarado with a felony, which typically brings with it more serious penalties and oversight. His previous DUIs — from 1997, and two from 2006 — essentially didn’t count. In California, a DUI drops off your record after 10 years. He was just another misdemeanor drunk driver in a state with more than 100,000 of them that year.
The Madera County District Attorney’s Office hadn’t even filed criminal charges yet when, 10 months later, law enforcement stopped him again for driving drunk.
Over the next two years, they’d pull him over twice more, citing him once for driving without a valid license and another time for drunk driving, court records show.
That’s three DUI arrests and a ticket in less than three years. 
His punishment: probation. The judge ordered him to wear an alcohol monitoring bracelet for 129 days.
Less than a year after his conviction, he was driving a F-250 pickup truck when he slammed into a car stopped at a red light, killing Mary and Paul Hardin, a Texas couple visiting on a church mission trip. Prosecutors say Alvarado was drunk. He is now facing murder charges in Fresno County.
Benjamin Hardin is the second oldest of the victims’ 11 children. He said his parents touched so many lives with their kindness and love. When the family cleaned out the couple’s California apartment after the crash, he said they found a fresh baked loaf of bread with someone’s name on it that their mother must have intended to deliver.
“I know that my parents would want me and my siblings to forgive him,” Hardin said. “My parents would not want me to carry hate in my heart for him.”
Still, he said he was stunned to learn that someone could get that many DUIs.
“It really does feel like it is literally just a matter of time before they kill someone — or in my family’s case, two someones,” he said.

State data shows repeat drunk driving is not an aberration. A recent DMV analysis tracked drivers who got a DUI in 2005. More than a quarter got another DUI over the next 15 years. Of the drivers for whom the 2005 arrest was at least their third DUI, nearly 40% went on to get yet another.
San Benito District Attorney Joel Buckingham said he views a third DUI as a crucial moment to intervene, aiming for drivers to serve at least 60 days in jail to “really kind of wake them up.”
But he also tries to take matters into his own hands at home. When he teaches his kids to drive, he tells them to “assume everyone is trying to kill you,” he said.
It’s the lack of consequences or meaningful intervention over years that make so many of the cases read like tragedy foretold.
William Curtis was convicted of driving while intoxicated in May 2012. 
Over the next several years, he would be involved in two collisions, receive four traffic tickets and get another DUI, all while his license was supposed to be suspended, Sacramento County court records show.
For the second DUI, he was sentenced to 30 days in jail. Police filed the citations in traffic court rather than sending them to the DA’s office for criminal prosecution. As a result, he got off with little more than a fine for refusing to stay off the road.
And he continued to drive until one night in November 2020, when he sped down Highway 99 drunk and crashed into the back of a stalled car. That vehicle burst into flames. Emergency personnel later found the charred remains of Dominique Howard trapped inside the burned vehicle.
Law enforcement later let him call his mother. Court records reveal what they heard Curtis say:
“I killed someone. I’m going away. I’m sorry, mom. Tell my kids I love them.”
‘You just saved a family of four’
Ryan Nazaroff became a police officer because of the worst day — or maybe one of the two worst days — of his life. He was just 16 in February 2008, with a bunch of friends going from party to party on the roads that run between the farms outside Fresno. There was another car of kids in front of him, Nazaroff said.
He remembers seeing the vehicle in front swerve. It hit the shoulder, overcorrected to the left and started to roll. His 14-year-old brother and another passenger were ejected.
Nazaroff found his brother laying on the dirt shoulder, dead.
In the horror of the moment, he remembers the polite professionalism of the CHP officers who investigated the crash. Nazaroff decided then that he wanted to do that for other people in their worst moments and try to help prevent the types of tragedies his family endured. He eventually joined the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.
The first chance Nazaroff got as a young deputy, he took an assignment working traffic patrol on the graveyard shift, cruising alone along the dark roads of Norwalk and La Mirada, 20 miles southeast of downtown LA, looking for drunk drivers and responding to crashes. Mothers Against Drunk Driving gave him awards for his DUI arrests.
“You try and remind yourself, every DUI arrest you make, you just saved a family of four,” he said.

Nazaroff was up for a promotion in April 2022 when he pulled into the station garage and his phone buzzed. He picked up. A Fresno County sheriff’s deputy was at his mom’s house. 
It had happened again. 
A drunk driver blew a stop sign and smashed into the dump truck his father was driving. Jeffrey Nazaroff was barely a block from where he was supposed to park his truck, finish his shift and go home. Instead, Ryan’s dad became one of the more than 1,400 people killed in an alcohol-related crash in California that year, federal estimates show.
Ryan Nazaroff called off of work and went home. He sat up all night with his wife before driving to be with his family the next day.
The woman who killed his dad was not a first-time drunk driver. Zdeineb Juarez Calderon was arrested two months before the fatal crash for allegedly driving drunk and crashing into a sign post. He thought that should be enough to charge her with murder.
To sustain a murder charge, prosecutors need to be able to prove that the person knew the danger and took the risk anyway. That typically means showing the defendant received a formal warning about the dangers of intoxicated driving, called a Watson advisement. Judges will typically read a boilerplate warning into the court record when someone is convicted of a DUI or have them sign a form.
But Juarez Calderon wasn’t convicted of anything yet for the earlier crash, so there was no Watson warning in the court records. Prosecutors told him the best they could charge Juarez Calderon with was vehicular manslaughter, Nazaroff said.
He was further frustrated to learn that because vehicular manslaughter isn’t considered a “violent” felony, the repeat drunk driver who killed his dad will likely serve only a small fraction of her 10-year sentence in prison. 
That’s because the state requires people convicted of a violent felony to serve more of their time in prison. In general, someone convicted of a violent felony will serve two-thirds of their sentence behind bars while for a lesser felony it’s as little as a third, said Steve Ueltzen, a Fresno County senior deputy district attorney.
“It’s a tough conversation to have with victims,” he said.
Juarez Calderon was sentenced to prison in January 2024. Records show that with the time she already spent in jail pretrial, she’s eligible for release this December.

‘It’s an abuse of authority and power’
California judges and lawmakers have often refused to require one of the few technological solutions most other states use to at least try to cut down on repeat drunk drivers.
Ignition interlock devices, known as IIDs, are those in-car breathalyzers that a driver needs to blow into for the vehicle to start. The technology has been around since the 1960s. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says they can decrease repeat drunk driving offenses as much as 70% while in use. In California, the devices prevented more than 30,500 attempts to drive under the influence in 2023 alone, state legislative reports say. 
But unlike most states, California doesn’t require first-time drunk drivers to use the devices. MADD gave us an “F” on a 2022 national report card of states’ ignition interlock laws. 
More than a decade ago, state Sen. Jerry Hill tried to require the devices for all DUI offenders in honor of a friend killed by a drunk driver. The Bay Area Democrat, now retired, grew dismayed by what he deemed a “soft approach” to DUIs, where legislators and committee consultants worry more about inconveniencing drivers than preventing deaths.
Hill ultimately had to settle for a 2016 bill that required the in-car breathalyzers for repeat DUI offenders.
But records suggest even that law isn’t being followed. Judges in more than a dozen counties ordered the breathalyzers for less than 10% of drivers convicted of a second DUI, according to a 2023 DMV report. In Los Angeles, judges made such orders for just 0.5% of the county’s thousands of second-time DUI offenders, according to the report.
“They should be ashamed of themselves, because how many deaths have they caused?” Hill said. “It’s an abuse of authority and power.”
LA County Superior Court spokesman Rob Oftring did not directly respond to detailed questions about how often the court’s judges order the breathalyzers, instead saying they “regularly submit abstracts of conviction” to the DMV.  
The DMV hasn’t issued new figures showing the use of the devices in more recent years. Asked for comment, the agency responded via email saying: “The DMV follows the laws established by the Legislature in the California Vehicle Code. The department operates within those laws.”

Even drivers who have killed someone in recent years can get on the road without the device. We identified about 130 drivers who were convicted for a fatal DUI since 2019 who have already gotten their licenses back from the state. Alcohol was a factor in the vast majority of the cases. And although some appear to have had a short requirement to use an in-car breathalyzer, fewer than 20 are currently limited to driving vehicles with an ignition interlock device installed, their DMV records show.
Elias Mack thinks that’s a mistake.
Mack said he wasn’t much of a drinker, certainly not an alcoholic, when he drove drunk in early 2023 and caused the crash that killed Aurora Morris, his high school sweetheart.
“I was just young,” said Mack, who’s now 25. 
He was convicted of vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated, and at his sentencing, the judge ordered Mack’s license be revoked for three years. But under state law, the DMV is allowed to ignore such orders if the length of revocation is longer than what the statutes require. The agency gave Mack his license back little more than a year after his conviction and with no requirement that he install a breathalyzer, he said.
“I was trying to get my life back on track. I just wanted to do better and make her proud,” he said, adding that he needed to drive for work.
But the grief was almost too much. “To just live with that every day eats you alive,” Mack said.
He would often drive to see her memorial. “The only thing that’s making me feel good is just going to talk to her,” Mack said. But he was also drinking as a way to cope. 
On one of those trips, just a few months after he got his license back, police stopped him. He got another DUI. 
Mack said he’s sober now and hopes his story can help other people. He wishes the court had ordered him to have a breathalyzer after his manslaughter conviction.
It makes sense the devices would be mandatory, especially after a case like his, and for as long as possible, he added.
“It’s going to save somebody’s life.”
‘You have an opportunity to stop this’
Melanie Sandoval was still a teenager in 1989 when she was convicted in Madera County for driving drunk.
She got her second DUI a couple years later, and the state took her license. 
She got her third a few years after that. And then her fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th. 
It still didn’t keep her from driving drunk. 
Kevin Bohnstedt saw the headlights coming toward him. The next thing he remembers, he was trapped in his seat with the airbags deployed and a woman outside rapping on the window.
Police found a pint of vodka in Sandoval’s car, said Ueltzen, who was the prosecutor in the case. It was her 16th DUI.
Bohnstedt, who spent 21 years flying jets off aircraft carriers as a naval aviator, said for months afterward he’d close his eyes and see the headlights coming for him. It took a while before he felt comfortable driving at night.

Sandoval pleaded no contest to felony DUI and went to rehab. At a sentencing hearing in October 2024, Ueltzen implored Superior Court Judge Charles Lee to also send Sandoval to prison.
In a sharp back and forth, the judge and the prosecutor argued the weaknesses in the system.
Lee noted that if he sentenced her to four years, she would be out in two at most.
“What changes? She has been to prison so many times on so many different DUIs,” Lee said. “We warehouse her for a number of months. She comes out. She is still an addict. How is public safety addressed by a prison commitment here when we know she has gone to prison over and over and over again on DUIs?”
Ueltzen said that at least she could be forced to stay sober for a while. 
“The public safety is addressed by the fact that while this defendant is in the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, she is not behind the wheel of a car,” he said.
Lee was unmoved. For driving head on into another vehicle in what was her 16th DUI, the judge granted Sandoval probation with no additional time behind bars. 
Her own attorney, who asked the court to send her to rehab instead of prison, said in an interview that there was “no accountability” in state law for repeat DUI offenders. 
“If you have 16 DUIs, you likely should be doing 20 years in prison,” Marc Kapetan said.
Sandoval went on to violate the terms of her supervised release by showing up drunk to a probation appointment.
Just this summer a different judge ordered her to serve out the remainder of her four-year sentence in prison. With credit for the time she was in rehab, plus the time she spent in jail pretrial, plus the credit the state gives you just for behaving yourself behind bars, she should be out next year.
Bohnstedt said he recognizes the government can only do so much to stop people from making bad decisions and drivers have a responsibility for their own actions. But he said he was floored the court tried to let her off with mere probation and is baffled California can’t either get people like Sandoval the help they need or keep them from endangering the public.
“The biggest concern I have is the next time that it happens, there could be kids in the car. And she could kill them,” he said. “Or she could run people down. Any number of different horrific things could happen. And it could lead to somebody dying.” 
If that happens, he said the state — lawmakers, law enforcement, the courts — will have blood on its hands. 
“You have an opportunity to stop this.”

Two decades later, the Sacramento mother lost her own life after being hit by a driver with a blood alcohol level twice the legal limit.
Her story is one of thousands that illustrate a stark — and deadly — reversal in how the state handles DUIs. 
California was the birthplace of the modern movement against drunk driving in the 1980s. But over the past decade, alcohol-related roadway deaths have shot up by more than 50% — an increase more than twice as steep as the rest of the country, federal estimates show. 
To understand why so many people are once again dying in fatal DUI crashes, we reviewed vehicular manslaughter and homicide cases filed all around California from 2019 through early 2024. We also examined other states’ laws on intoxicated driving and sifted through decades of state and federal traffic safety data.The records reveal a state that too often fails to differentiate between drivers who made a dangerous mistake but learn from it and those who refuse to stop endangering lives. Drunk and drugged driving is now so common in car-centric California that drivers routinely rack up four, five, six DUIs. One woman in Fresno just got her 16th. 
Here are the key takeaways from our investigation:
1. California has some of the weakest DUI laws in the country, allowing repeat drunk and drugged drivers to stay on the road with little punishment. 
Here, drivers generally can’t be charged with a felony until their fourth DUI within 10 years, unless they injure someone. In some states, a second DUI can be a felony. 
Missed opportunities to prevent tragedies haunt the loved ones of the dead. The driver who killed Sarah Villar while she was out walking with her fiance in 2021 had already been convicted of driving drunk in 2018, 2019 and 2020 — all misdemeanors — and served just a couple weeks behind bars before the fatal crash.
Villar’s parents buried her in her wedding dress.
“To the broken justice system that allowed this to happen — shame on you,” her father, Dave Villar, said in her eulogy. “If I walked out my front door today onto my porch and fired a shot into my neighborhood every day until I killed someone, when would I be a menace to society? When do I become a danger to my community? I say it’s after the first shot. Our system says it’s after the last.”
2. The state gives repeat drunk drivers their licenses back faster than other states. 
In California, you typically lose your license for three years after your third DUI. That’s compared to eight years in New Jersey, 15 years in Nebraska and a permanent revocation in Connecticut. 
We found drivers with as many as six DUIs who were able to get a license in California.
3. Even when the state does take their license, many drivers stay on the road for years — racking up more tickets or new DUIs — with few consequences until they eventually kill.
One of the best ways to avoid punishment appears to be simply skipping court. 
Sylvester Conway was arrested three times in Fresno County from 2019 through 2021 for driving drunk but failed to show up to court. All three cases were open with outstanding warrants when prosecutors said he drove drunk again in early 2022, flipped his car and killed his passenger.
4. Courts and lawmakers don’t treat DUI deaths as violent crimes. 
Drunk vehicular manslaughter isn’t considered a “violent felony.” But in a twist of state law, a DUI that causes “great bodily injury” is — meaning that a drunk driver who breaks someone’s leg can face more time behind bars than if they’d killed them, prosecutors said.
The discrepancy came as a shock to Ryan Nazaroff, who decided to become a law enforcement officer after his younger brother died in a DUI-related crash as a teenager. Years later, it happened again — his father was killed by a repeat drunk driver in 2022.
He learned that the driver who killed his dad will likely serve only a small fraction of her 10-year sentence in prison. In general, someone convicted of a violent felony will serve two-thirds of their sentence behind bars; for a lesser felony it’s as little as a third, prosecutors said.
5. California has fallen behind on a simple solution embraced by many other states: in-car breathalyzers.
Ignition interlock devices, known as IIDs, are those in-car breathalyzers that a driver needs to blow into for the vehicle to start. In California, the devices prevented more than 30,500 attempts to drive under the influence in 2023 alone, state legislative reports say. 
But unlike most states, California doesn’t require first-time drunk drivers to use the devices. MADD gave us an “F” on a 2022 national report card of states’ ignition interlock laws.
State law does require the devices for repeat offenders — but records suggest even that isn’t being enforced. Judges in more than a dozen counties ordered the breathalyzers for less than 10% of drivers convicted of a second DUI, according to a 2023 DMV report. 
“They should be ashamed of themselves, because how many deaths have they caused?” said retired state Sen. Jerry Hill, a Bay Area Democrat who wrote the existing law. “It’s an abuse of authority and power.”
6. Despite the mounting death toll, state leaders have shown little willingness to address the issue.
In his time trying to address drunk driving in the Legislature, Hill grew dismayed by what he deemed a “soft approach” to DUIs, where legislators and committee consultants worry more about inconveniencing drivers than preventing deaths.
Just this fall, California lawmakers gutted the latest of several bills that would have required anyone convicted of a DUI to use an in-car breathalyzer. The state’s Department of Motor Vehicles said it didn’t have the time or resources to carry it out. 
State data underscores the threat: Drivers with prior DUIs are involved in a majority of fatal and injury DUI crashes in California. 
Melanie Sandoval was still a teenager in 1989 when she was convicted in Madera County for driving drunk. She got her second DUI a couple years later, and the state took her license. 
She got her third a few years after that. And then her fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th. 
In 2023, she pleaded no contest to her 16th DUI after she crashed into the car of a retired naval aviator named Kevin Bohnstedt. He recognizes the government can only do so much to stop people from making bad decisions, but Bohnstedt said he was floored that the court tried to let her off with mere probation. 
“The biggest concern I have is the next time that it happens, there could be kids in the car. And she could kill them,” he said. “Or she could run people down. Any number of different horrific things could happen. And it could lead to somebody dying.” 
If that happens, he said the state — lawmakers, law enforcement, the courts — will have blood on its hands. 
“You have an opportunity to stop this,” Bohnstedt said.

Critics say it’s full of holes,Khari Johnson and Levi Sumagaysay,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/technology/2025/10/openai-restructuring-deal-full-of-holes-critics-say/,The company behind ChatGPT is converting to a for-profit company and settling an investigation by California’s attorney general. Experts and advocates say the company could still exploit its charitable roots.,"In summary
The company behind ChatGPT is converting to a for-profit company and settling an investigation by California’s attorney general. Experts and advocates say the company could still exploit its charitable roots.


OpenAI said Tuesday it would restructure as a for-profit company in a way that addresses concerns from California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who signed off on the transformation.
But details of the move could revive worries that OpenAI is misusing charitable tax exemptions, experts and advocates told CalMatters. The ChatGPT maker is putting its nonprofit arm nominally in control of the for-profit entity, but there are numerous ways the for-profit company could end up calling the shots, these people said. There are also important, unanswered questions about the safeguards that are supposed to keep that from happening.
Under the restructuring, the newly-formed OpenAI Foundation will hold about 26 percent of OpenAI’s valuation, a share amounting to $130 billion, instantly making it one of the most well-endowed philanthropic organizations in the world. Microsoft, company employees, and other investors will hold the rest. The controlling nonprofit foundation can appoint members of the for-profit board of directors and, through a special committee, step in to address AI safety concerns. The company also pledged to remain in California.
OpenAI did not respond to a CalMatters request for additional details about potential safeguards to preserve the independence of the OpenAI Foundation.
OpenAI’s plans came under scrutiny in California because Bonta, along with Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, wanted to ensure the company stayed true to the mission laid out in its charter when the organization was founded as a nonprofit a decade ago to make artificial intelligence that benefits humanity. The company had pledged all “assets are irrevocably dedicated” to this purpose.
OpenAI has faced criticism for a wide range of impacts on society. In August, the parents of California teenager Adam Raine alleged in a lawsuit that ChatGPT coached him on how to commit suicide. The company put restrictions on its generative AI video app Sora 2 after depictions of Martin Luther King Jr were criticized as disrespectful. Lawmakers in California have also moved to mitigate rising power consumption and proliferation of data centers driven by ChatGPT and similar tools. At the same time, the company has helped drive an AI boom that has seen Big Tech companies surge money into state tax coffers.
Bonta and Jennings have both now signed agreements with OpenAI blessing its new structure.
“We will be keeping a close eye on OpenAI to ensure ongoing adherence to its charitable mission and the protection of the safety of all Californians,” Bonta wrote.
Robert Bartlett, a professor of law and business at Stanford Law School, has studied and worked in the venture capital ecosystem for three decades. He said OpenAI’s start as a nonprofit was unusual and related to its unique mission around artificial intelligence. But it found being a nonprofit restrictive, making it difficult to raise capital and compensate its employees with equity in the company. Its restructuring should pave the way for an eventual initial public offering.
Bartlett said the new arrangement that the nonprofit, a minority stakeholder, will have oversight of the public benefit corporation is also unusual. He said the deal envisions a “pretty active role” for the nonprofit’s safety committee, which will include the right to control safety procedures and halt the release of AI models made by the corporation. OpenAI previously named four members of the safety committee on its website and has said all current members of the non-profit board will serve on the for-profit board, with some as observers.
But not knowing exactly how much overlap there might be between the boards of the nonprofit and the corporation is a big question, as is the ultimate composition of the committee, Bartlett said. 
“We’ll have to see what happens, who’s on the committee, how active (they are), and their relationship to OpenAI,” Bartlett said. “Will (the structure) be meaningful and consistent with the AG’s focus on safety?”
Steven Adler previously led a product safety team at OpenAI. On Tuesday he published an op-ed in the New York Times that argues that the company can’t be trusted when they say they can safely deploy erotica chatbots in part because it has a history of ignoring risks.
He told CalMatters that under the restructure that he thinks the nonprofit’s safety committee needs more independence to operate effectively. “I hope that a truly independent body will do a better job of protecting the organization’s mission than one that feels any pull toward profits,” he said.
“There’s a bazillion conflicts of interest here.”Judith Bell, San Francisco Foundation
OpenAI’s restructuring drew ire from Eyes On OpenAI, a coalition of more than 60 California nonprofit organizations who have argued for more than a year that attorneys general should force the company to transfer its assets to an independent nonprofit entity. The precedent for this approach comes from Blue Cross of California, which started as a nonprofit. Following a transfer of assets to a for-profit subsidiary in the 1990s, that organization gave more than $3 billion in stock to two foundations.
San Francisco Foundation chief Impact Officer Judith Bell, a member of the Eyes on OpenAI coalition, said the deal could set a precedent for startups to evade taxes, and is also concerned that under the restructuring the same people can serve on boards of directors for the for-profit and the nonprofit.
“There’s a bazillion conflicts of interest here,” she said, adding that those conflicts are particularly worrisome given the broad potential harms the foundation needs to keep an eye on, including how the tech impacts children, the economy, the workplace, and society.
The deal speaks to the tremendous influence of a corporation to push forward a deal, said Orson Aguilar, director of the advocacy nonprofit LatinoProsperity and a member of the Eyes On OpenAI coalition.
He believes OpenAI lost its way when key executives realized they could make an enormous amount of money for themselves.  Members of the nonprofit board, meanwhile, variously quit and lost influence after some of them attempted to oust CEO Sam Altman in 2023.
“The nonprofit continues to operate under the influence of the for-profit it supposedly oversees and that’s been our biggest objection and nothing today tells us that anything meaningful has changed that,” he said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/111623_Sam-Altman_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-30 08:56:33.595684

The plan to bring a long-awaited university to Chula Vista took an important step towards reality as Gov. Gavin Newson signed a law that reserves land for the project and creates a task force to guide development. 


By 2027 students in South County San Diego County will be able to earn eight different bachelor’s degrees from three public universities while enrolled in the new Chula Vista University. That’s before it even has a campus.
The university, which opens for class next year, promises a novel approach to higher education, as a hybrid institution with programs from San Diego State, Cal State San Marcos, UC San Diego and Southwestern College.
It’s part of a long-awaited plan to bring a four-year campus to the city of Chula Vista. City officials have pursued that goal for decades, seeking state support and buying land for an eventual campus. Assemblymember David Alvarez, a Democrat from the community, made it his top priority when he was elected in 2022.
“South County has long been considered a college desert,” Alvarez said at a town hall meeting on the project Saturday. “This is one of the most diverse, fastest growing parts of the state, yet it has been underserved in regards to higher education.”
Chula Vista introduced its vision for the campus as part of its city plan in 1993, Alvarez said. In 2006 California education leaders and local officials proposed building a combined university and research park, so students could live, learn and ultimately work in their own community. 
By 2014 the city acquired 383 acres of land for the new campus. But in 2017 the state Legislative Analyst’s Office concluded that there wasn’t enough enrollment demand to justify building a single UC or Cal State campus.
“Reports were that it wasn’t the right time,” Alvarez said in a video about the project.“That California didn’t need another public university.”
While the state might not need one, proponents insisted that South County San Diego did. So they agreed on a multi-institutional campus to train students for key jobs. This would be more focused than a traditional liberal arts university, with degrees targeted at regional workforce needs in fields such as nursing, public health, business and education.

Alvarez got to work on the project as soon as he was sworn in. He secured $25 million for the city’s Millennial Library, which will open next fall and host one of the first degree programs. And he introduced a law to reserve the accumulated land for the university project, and another to form a task force to guide development of the campus. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom signed that law this month, authorizing the South County Higher Education Task Force to study governance models for the higher education facility, including how the different university systems interact, how they will share authority and resources, and how to pay for the new campus. It will include representatives from the Cal State and UC systems, Southwestern College, the legislature, city and local high school district. Its report on the project is due by July, 2027.
The initial phase of the campus will cost an estimated $2.17 billion, according to an architectural report, and would consist of “a walkable campus gathered around a central open space.” Conceptual drawings show light-filled buildings with wall-to-wall windows, and walkways meandering around landscaped commons and decorative ponds.
The task force will consider those plans, and decide when to start construction and how to fund it. Although the full campus hasn’t even broken ground, Chula Vista University is slated to start degree programs next year. 
“While the end goal is the university campus, it also became clear to me that we need and deserve university education now,” Alvarez said.
In fall 2026, it will offer a bachelor’s degree in nursing at classrooms in the Millennial Library, which is now slated to open at the same time.
It will also introduce degrees in industrial psychology from San Diego State, business administration, computer information systems and cybersecurity from Cal State San Marcos, and public health from UC San Diego.  In fall, 2027, Cal State San Marcos will add degrees in bilingual speech pathology and human development. All those programs would be located at Southwestern College.
Proponents are also exploring the potential for accelerated degrees in hospitality, kinesiology and public administration from San Diego State, Alvarez said. They’re discussing cross-border programs with Mexican universities. And they may collaborate on film and TV pathway programs with the upcoming Chula Vista Entertainment Complex, a production studio set to open in the Millennial Library. 
These joint ventures across institutions and locations aren’t typical, but Alvarez points to nearby Cal State San Marcos, now one of the fastest-growing CSU schools. It launched its first programs as a satellite branch of San Diego State in a middle school in 1979, before expanding to a nearby strip mall, and then building its campus on a former chicken ranch a decade later.
“The research demonstrated to me that a world-class university often starts with humble beginnings,” Alvarez said.
As part of their planning, Alvarez and other proponents visited Auroria Campus in Denver Colorado. It’s a hybrid facility that hosts Community College of Denver, Metropolitan State University of Denver, and University of Colorado Denver. However, Alvarez said Chula Vista University will be unique for California.
“We are building something new, so we have to figure out how to do that,” he said. “They’ll also work to identify funding sources for both the construction of the physical campus and for the long-term operation of the university campus. Those are big commitments that we need to make.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/052424_Southwestern-College-Graduation_AH_CM_16.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-30 08:56:33.595684

Gov. Gavin Newsom is staking his political future on Prop. 50. How long will it pay off?


As President Donald Trump prepared to send a phalanx of federal immigration agents into the Bay Area, Gov. Gavin Newsom bemoaned the lack of outrage about Trump’s actions and ramped up his own warnings about election manipulation. 
“He is going to try to rig this election,” he told reporters last week, referring to Trump’s pursuit of Republican gerrymandering in red states to ensure the party holds onto its slim majority in Congress next year.
He called the potential deployment of immigration agents — later called off by Trump — a dictator’s move to suppress the vote. Repeatedly, he’s told the story of Border Patrol agents showing up to his ballot measure kickoff event and said he expects federal agents and troops to monitor polling places next week. 
As the campaign for Proposition 50, the anti-Trump Democratic gerrymandering effort California voters are deciding on, reaches a fever pitch, so too has the rhetoric of Newsom, its chief promoter. 
“God help us if we lose in California,” he said in a Prop. 50 fundraising email this month. “We may have enjoyed our last free and fair election.” 
Approaching his final year as governor, Newsom is staking the next phase of his career on the proposition that he first suggested as a bluff to discourage Texas’ redistricting and that he’s now casting as central to American democracy. 
After a few months this year of attempting to make nice with Trump, exploring on his podcast why so many voters shifted right in 2024 and angering the left in the process, the governor spent the summer and fall delighting many Democrats again with a renewed sense of combativeness against the second-term president. 
So far, he’s reaped the benefits. 
From June to August, he doubled his approval in polls of potential 2028 Democratic presidential contenders  rising from 12% of surveyed voters picking him to 25%. Appearing before a friendly Late Show with Stephen Colbert audience in September, he touted his willingness to be a Democrat who fights Trump on his own terms by using social media trolling. He got former President Barack Obama to join him in promoting Prop. 50.
“They’re going to send a very powerful message to the rest of the country that there has to be a new approach to dealing with Trump and Trumpism,” Newsom said of California voters on Tuesday. “It’s about the United States of America, it’s about what our founding fathers lived and died for.”
The big bet is paying off
Whether the measure passes is not just a test of whether the self-styled resister-in-chief can capture national support in 2028, but also whether he has his finger on the pulse today.
“Failure is not an option,” Newsom said last week. “We’re going to win, because people understand how precious this moment is.”
It’s a bet that risks his credibility, said Democratic strategist Matt Rodriguez. Though he added he believes the measure will pass, Rodriguez said Prop. 50 poses political “downsides” that “are bigger than the upsides.”
“His entire messaging is, ‘This is the end of the world if it doesn’t pass,’” he said. “If it doesn’t pass, it’s going to be pretty discouraging.”
Newsom has remained defiant, arguing it’s a bigger risk for Democrats to sit quietly. Asked last week if he had a contingency plan should the ballot measure fail, Newsom instead set up sky-high stakes, vowing it will pass and that Democrats will take the House and spell the “de facto end” of Trump’s presidency.

It’s working, for now: His ballot measure, which allows California to use gerrymandered congressional maps favoring Democrats to offset gerrymandered Republican House gains in Texas, is polling ahead with 56% of likely voters this month saying they would vote yes. The campaign has received so many donations that this week Newsom took the extremely rare step of telling supporters to stop sending money, seemingly an early declaration of victory.
Even Democrats who have fought Trump-backed, GOP-led gerrymandering in their own states are on board. 
After Newsom placed Prop. 50 on the ballot, Missouri Republicans at Trump’s behest passed their own gerrymandered congressional map, carving out the seat held by Kansas City’s Democratic congressman. The lines cut through the suburban district of state lawmaker Keri Ingle, who said she nevertheless supports Newsom’s effort because red-state Democrats “are depending on Newsom for representation in Congress right now.”
Missouri Republicans, Ingle said, argued that because they lead the party of the majority there, they should be allowed to redraw that state’s map to gain another seat in Congress. 
“To that I say, ‘OK, have it your way,’” she said. “Go get ‘em, Newsom.”
‘Long way to go’
Should the measure pass, using it to propel Democrats — and Newsom himself — further nationally is still a tall order. 
There’s no guarantee that passing Prop. 50 will ensure Democrats win back the House. Few other blue states have even considered starting their own redistricting efforts, and none have nearly enough population to produce more than one or two new Democratic congressional seats. This week, Virginia Democrats approved a temporary redistricting proposal similar to California’s, though it couldn’t go to voters there until next year. Meanwhile, three GOP-led states — Texas, Missouri and North Carolina — have already passed their own gerrymandered maps. This week, Republican Indiana Gov. Mike Braun called in a special legislative session to do the same. 
And Rodriguez said there’s still little sign Democrats have a platform to win back the middle-ground voters most concerned about crime and their economic prospects.
A September Reuters poll of American adults showed Democrats only two percentage points ahead of Republicans on the issue of “respect for democracy,” and four percentage points behind on “political extremism.” A Reuters poll this month showed 40% of American voters will vote in the midterms based on the cost of living. Protecting democracy was second in importance, at 28%.
“There’s still a long way to go, as to whether this passing will leapfrog him further than he has already,” Rodriguez said of Newsom. “It’s just not a vote-driver for most Americans.”
In red, rural Modoc County, erstwhile Democrat Sarah Merrick said she’d like to see the party develop a clearer national platform “instead of just being anti-Trump,” that includes reining in health care costs, campaign finance reform and committing to winning back moderates. She and her husband left the party in recent years, feeling it was “so leftist” and unnecessarily alienating cultural conservatives. 
Prop. 50 and Newsom’s highlighting of democratic principles got her more energized about politics for the first time in years, said Merrick, who leads a local Indivisible activist group. But she’s not sure if she’d support Newsom for president, saying she wants to know more about the state’s decision to provide health care for poor undocumented immigrants and why it hasn’t lowered housing prices. 
“I really like his backbone right now, I think it’s awesome,” she said. “I think stressing on Prop. 50 and anti-dictatorship and all that is OK for now, through Nov. 4. After Nov. 4, I think a big shift needs to happen in messaging.”
An economic plan will be important for both swing voters, and for the party’s faithful. 
Lorena Gonzalez, leader of the California Labor Federation, has led union workers across California in running an aggressive anti-Trump campaign to help pass Prop. 50. But she said the governor’s future political prospects will depend in part on how he handles American workers’ anxiety around artificial intelligence and job losses, which Gonzalez predicted will be a prominent election issue in 2026 and beyond. 
“It’s catapulted him,” she said of Prop. 50 and Newsom. “I don’t think it lasts beyond this time.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/081425-Newsom-Redistricting-Rally-TS-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-30 08:56:33.595684
,California,2025-10-30 12:02:00+00:00,CalMatters,Why a small change in paperwork is generating a big fight over hazardous waste in California,Alejandra Reyes-Velarde,,,,,https://calmatters.org/environment/2025/10/hazardous-waste-manifest-regulation/,"The University of California system says lifting tracking requirements will make managing hazardous waste more efficient. Hundreds of other waste handlers will benefit too, but the state hasn't identified them.","In summary
The University of California system says lifting tracking requirements will make managing hazardous waste more efficient. Hundreds of other waste handlers will benefit too, but the state hasn’t identified them. 


Just as consumers can track a package from a warehouse to their doorstep, California regulators keep tabs on the movement of hazardous waste, even on a short journey. 
Now the Department of Toxic Substances Control is considering whether to lift some of those tracking requirements in situations where companies transport hazardous waste within their own properties and along some public roads. 
The University of California system and large corporations say this change in what’s called the manifest rule would make hazardous waste disposal processes safer and more efficient. It could benefit car manufacturer Tesla, giant agribusiness in the San Joaquin Valley or industrial chemical manufacturers in the Los Angeles Basin. 
But environmental advocates say state regulators have no good reason to weaken California’s regulations, which are more stringent than federal rules. They fear the department’s proposal signals regulators’ intent to weaken regulations as a strategy to manage some of the state’s growing waste problem. 
“Certainly you don’t have to assume that everybody’s a bad actor, but you probably also shouldn’t assume that nobody’s a bad actor,” said Angela Johnson Meszaros an attorney for the environmental group Earthjustice.
Where does the waste go?
To track hazardous waste, businesses make detailed reports, including what toxic materials are in what containers, where the waste is coming from and where it’s going. This manifest protects generators of hazardous waste, helping them prove that they followed regulations. If there’s an accident on the road, the records help fire departments and other responders keep the public safe. 
According to the Department of Toxic Substances Control, the rule change would apply to about 235 hazardous waste producers. That includes the University of California system, which produces waste at every campus, in hospitals, in maintenance operations, and in research. 
At UCLA, if researchers have slides with chemicals on them, or vials that were used in experiments, that toxic waste is stored in the labs until it can be collected.
What happens next is expensive and inefficient, said Ken Smith, who directs environmental health and safety systemwide for the University of California. 
Every time waste moves from collection sites to disposal sites off campus, someone has to write a manifest. Large trucks come to labs to pick up the hazardous trash, no matter how small the load. 
“Imagine if you had to send a big dump truck just to pick up your individual waste container from your kitchen or bathroom. They’re going to charge you a trip every time,” Smith said.
Since 1997, California’s manifest rule has demanded more information from more waste generators than the federal system. That’s when a federal rule change exempted other waste generators including the military from having to make detailed reports when waste is transported onsite.  
In announcing a proposal to adopt federal exemptions for waste that travels within a businesses’ property, state regulators wrote that the change would “increase overall public and environmental safety” because with fewer records to make, large, registered-transporter trucks like those for the UC system could collect waste at fewer central locations. 
“California has the most protective, rigorous requirements for hazardous waste management in the nation,” said department spokesperson Alysa Pakkidis, in an email. “The manifest exemption continues our state’s high standards and does not alter transporters’ obligations.” 
Advocates seek answers 
If the Department of Toxic Substances Control changes the manifest rule, it’s not just the UC system that benefits: according to regulators’ announcement, “miscellaneous chemical businesses,” military and other government businesses would qualify for the proposed exemption. 
But the department is sharing little information about exactly which facilities will stop reporting some information or how many miles hazardous waste may travel without being tracked. 
At the only public hearing on the rule change so far, regulators gave no presentation. Pakkidis said the department does not have a list of qualifying facilities and hazardous waste generators have no obligation to notify the department if they take advantage of the new rule. 
“DTSC regularly inspects hazardous waste transporters and generator facilities to ensure they follow all the rules, including manifesting when required,” she said. 
Without details, community advocates and skeptics for the rule say they’re left to speculate. 
Smith, the UC official, said chemical waste from a research lab at UCLA may travel miles along the perimeter of campus where homes and schools are located. If the rule applies at large agricultural farms too, said Johnson Meszaros, the Earthjustice attorney, hazardous waste might be transported multiple miles from one side of property to the other. 
“Just because it’s not going far doesn’t mean that it’s not vulnerable to an accident,” Johnson Meszaros said.  
Tesla and Pacific Gas & Electric Company say the exemption would benefit them.  
In a letter to state regulators, Tesla wrote that the proposal to lessen manifest requirements “is critical to provide operational flexibility when handling hazardous waste.” 
A spokesperson for PG&E said that the change would allow the utility to minimize truck traffic and centralize waste storage areas ”oftentimes to a location that is better suited for the surrounding community.” 
“This exemption is really setting everybody up for a lot of confusion and therefore a lot of noncompliance,” said Rebecca Overmyer-Velázquez, an advocate with the Clean Air Coalition for North Whittier and Avocado Heights, at the August public hearing. “We’re entering into this period of just confusion and lawlessness, where anyone can decide that they’re not going to have to manifest the waste that they’re transporting.”
Members of her coalition have raised questions about whether changing the manifest rule would change operations at Ecobat, the only lead-acid battery recycling facility in California. Regulators have been considering an update to Ecobat’s permit, which was expected in July this year after some delays. 
A spokesman for Ecobat says the rule does not apply at its City of Industry facility. The DTSC has not clarified whether Ecobat is one of the 235 facilities that would benefit from a changed manifest rule. 
California’s toxic trash problem
The Department of Toxic Substances Control characterizes the manifest proposal as a “clarification.” But advocates fear it’s a harbinger of weakening hazardous waste laws, one potential strategy to deal with California’s toxic trash problem. 
In the last 25 years, the amount of hazardous waste generated in the state has decreased by more than 40%, even though the number of hazardous waste generators has doubled, according to the department. But the waste stream is changing, and the state lacks the capacity to handle certain kinds of waste; specifically, lithium-ion batteries that are critical to clean energy plans.  
A 2021 state law, recognizing that problem and its complexity, directed the Department of Toxic Substances Control to reform how it manages hazardous waste.  
Just two landfills can accept the state’s most toxic trash; a CalMatters investigation in 2023 found that, even two years ago, nearly half of it is driven to states that have weaker environmental protections. DTSC estimates the landfills will reach capacity by 2039. 
In March, DTSC recommended weakening hazardous waste disposal rules for contaminated soil, one of the state’s largest streams of toxic waste. The department removed the recommendation after the Board of Environmental Safety – recently created to oversee the department – raised concerns. 
The latest draft of the state’s hazardous waste plan has three goals: to reduce the amount of waste that is burned or goes to landfills, to manage waste in a way that protects peoples’ health and the environment, and to use data “from cradle to grave” to help manage the state’s hazardous waste sustainably. 
Johnson Meszaros said she thinks these recommendations leave room for weakening regulations, including those that protect people from exposure to contaminated soils. 
DTSC, for instance, is planning to review other federal exemptions that the state could adopt and evaluate how harmful waste is, when it’s considered hazardous under California law but not federally. 
“There’s nothing in this revised version that suggests that DTSC has stepped away from their deregulatory approach, and in fact, they continue to speak directly to a desire to do that,” said Johnson Meszaros.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/112822_UC-Berkeley_GETTY_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-30 08:18:09.498826

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama senator is reviving a bill for the 2026 legislative session that would require health insurance companies to cover prostate cancer screenings for all high-risk patients. 
SB 19, sponsored by Sen. Steve Livingston, R-Scottsboro, would allow all men over 50 and high risk men over 40 to be screened for prostate cancer without any cost-sharing obligations.
Livingston said in an interview earlier this month that a constituent brought the issue to him in the middle of the 2024 session.

“It was late in the session, so I really didn’t expect it to go anywhere that year,” Livingston said. “Then last year, we got down to the wire with it. We were in a position to go and just ran out of time.”
The American Cancer Society estimates that 5,440 men in Alabama will be diagnosed with prostate cancer this year. It also estimates that 10% of those will die from the disease. 
“This bill would make Alabama a nationwide leader in helping to reduce the cancer burden,” Jane Adams, government relations director for ACS CAN in Alabama, said in a press release. “People at high risk for prostate cancer should be able to access impactful screenings without the threat of extra costs.”
The 2025 version of the bill was approved by the Senate and committees in both chambers by the end of April. It was never considered by the full House. 
According to the American Cancer Society, Black men are at higher risk for the disease. The mortality rate for prostate cancer was 18.7 per 100,000 men in 2022, half of what it was in 1993. The 5-year survival rate for the disease is 100% for the majority of men diagnosed with localized- or regional-stage prostate cancer, but drops to 37% for those diagnosed with distant-stage disease, according to the American Cancer Society. The 10-year survival rate for all stages combined is 98%.

,California,2025-10-30 12:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,Erie Canal creation contrasts with the glacial pace of public works in California,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/public-works-pace-california/,"The historic canal was hand-dung and open in eight years. Today, some of California's public works projects are taking decades just to start.","This week one of the nation’s earliest and most important public works projects, the 363-mile Erie Canal linking the Hudson River with Lake Erie, marked its 200th anniversary.
There was only negligible media and political notice. That’s regrettable, because the canal opening in 1825 utterly transformed the nation’s economy and ignited its expansion from a few sparsely populated former colonies on the Atlantic Coast some 3,000 miles westward to the Pacific Ocean.
Rugged mountains had stymied westward expansion from the coastal plain into the Ohio River valley and the Great Lakes region. But New York Gov. DeWitt Clinton saw an opportunity for New York City to become the nation’s commercial capital, outfoxing rival Philadelphia.
The New York Legislature authorized construction with bonds in 1817 and just eight years later, having been dug mostly by hand, the Erie Canal opened. Tolls repaid all of its construction debt in the first year.
Eventually, of course, the canal’s commercial importance was superseded by railroads and later highways. But it continues to operate for recreational and excursion boats and remains a symbol of how timely public works can have major economic impacts.
A quarter-century after the Erie Canal opened, California was admitted as a state. During its first decades it was somewhat isolated, with an economy based on resources — gold, timber, farm produce, cattle, fish and, eventually, oil.
However, as California entered the 20th century, massive public works projects surfaced to encourage economic expansion and transformation, notably in Southern California. Los Angeles and Long Beach created deep-water ports from what had been coastal mudflats. Los Angeles secretly tapped the Owens River 250 miles away on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada, and built an aqueduct to carry its water to the city, making its meteoric population growth possible.
The Great Depression spawned other historic public works projects that were not only beneficial unto themselves but created much-needed jobs.
The federal government built the Central Valley Project, a network of dams, including Shasta Dam, and canals to provide water to farms in the 450-mile-long valley.
The state built a long-planned bridge over San Francisco Bay while simultaneously, a consortium of counties constructed the iconic Golden Gate Bridge. Both were finished in just a few years.
World War II was a massive public works project in California, as billions of dollars were poured into military bases, aircraft factories, shipyards and other tools of warfare, transforming the state into an industrial powerhouse. The postwar era brought the construction of freeways to handle traffic from the state’s population explosion.

Mid-century also saw arguably the state’s last truly transformative public works project, the California Water Plan. It dams the Feather River near Oroville with an aqueduct to carry its water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to Southern California.
The last decades of the 20th Century and the first decades of the 21st have been a period of stasis in public works.
Projects such as the tunnel to carry water under the Delta and the Sites Reservoir to divert and store high flows on the Sacramento River have kicked around for decades. Sites appears to finally be on track, but the tunnel struggles to overcome opposition from local landowners and environmentalists.
And then there’s the bullet train to link the northern and southern halves of the state, first proposed a half-century ago and approved by voters in 2008 —  but limping along, neither fully alive nor dead, with some construction underway but no firm financial footing.
Looking back, it’s amazing that the 363-mile Erie Canal could have been dug by hand in just eight years, or that the two San Francisco bridges were erected in just a few years. The contrast with 21st Century foot-dragging is palpable.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/032623-Lake-Oroville-AP-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-30 08:18:09.498826

(Photo: Jeniffer Solis/Nevada Current)President Donald Trump’s latest business partnership may place him at odds with Nevada and other states suing to stop prediction markets from accepting what regulators say are nothing more than illegal bets. 
The business endeavor also raises questions about Trump’s conflict of interest in appointing the commissioners charged with oversight of his venture, as well as bets being placed on outcomes of events or issues that as president, Trump could control.
Crypto.com, the company teaming up with Trump’s Truth Social to allow its users to make crypto bets on the outcome of future events, is suing Nevada and other states that seek to impose gambling oversight on the platform, which is regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 
Congress, in 2010, gave the CFTC exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of sports event contracts on commodity exchanges. The sites are known as places to bet on political races or cultural happenings but have exploded in popularity as outlets for placing sports bets. 
In June, Crypto.com went to court to stop the Nevada Gaming Control Board from enforcing state law against the platform’s sports events contracts, which the Gaming Control Board deems to be wagers.
“Engaging in unlawful sports wagering in another state or entering into a business relationship with another entity offering unlawful sports wagering in another state may call into question the good character and integrity of the licensee,” the GCB said in an advisory to licensees.  “Further, the Board will consider any such conduct when evaluating suitability for new applications filed pursuant to the Gaming Control Act.”
Trump, who currently owns a non-gaming hotel in Nevada, had a certificate of registration from Nevada regulators in 2004, but was never licensed for a casino. 
Crypto.com and other prediction market platforms, such as Kalshi, which is also suing the state, charge a 2% fee to arrange the contracts on events, such as political races and sport competitions. 
The framework established by Congress to regulate prediction markets pre-empts Nevada law, the platform asserts.  
“These contracts are subject to extensive oversight by the CFTC, and— critically—they are lawful under federal law,” Kalshi argued in its complaint against Nevada. The CFTC recently allowed the exchange to accept sports outcome contracts without the CFTC’s review, and a federal court has upheld the legality of contracts on the outcome of political races, the complaint says.  
Last month, U.S. District Judge Andrew Gordon denied Crypto.com’s motion for an injunction to stop Nevada regulators from enforcing state law, finding that its sports event contracts do not comply with the Commodity Exchange Act’s definition of swaps.  
On Friday, GCB Chairman Mike Dreitzer announced Crypto.com agreed to stop arranging contracts in Nevada while the legal case proceeds. 
Gordon’s ruling stands in contrast to an injunction he previously granted to Kalshi, ruling that Nevada regulators “have no jurisdiction to decide that Kalshi’s conduct violates state law where, at least at present, those activities are legal under federal law.”
The Nevada Resort Association, which represents casinos and is an intervenor defendant in Kalshi’s case against the state, argued Kalshi’s position “would result in the complete upheaval of Nevada’s gaming regulations, reversing over one hundred and fifty years of state control over this area and over seventy-five years of regulated sports betting.”
‘No interest in upholding the law’
“The expansion of prediction markets is bad for the regulated gaming industry, bad for consumers, and bad for states and tribes,” Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV), a fervent opponent of prediction markets, said in a statement to the Current on Wednesday. “In particular, it is a backdoor way to legalize sports betting in states that have not authorized it.” 
Titus contends that Kalshi and others like it “are attempting to circumvent both federal and state laws by conducting illegal sports betting” through the CFTC. “Unlike licensed operators, prediction markets do not comply with requirements for consumer protection, responsible gaming, tax revenue, integrity safeguards, and anti-money laundering compliance.”
Titus says opposition to Kalshi’s sports betting contracts “is bipartisan and nationwide,” noting Nevada led an amicus filing by 36 attorneys general in a case opposing the contracts in New Jersey.  The company faces lawsuits from Arizona and Illinois, in addition to New Jersey and Nevada. 
Gambling experts contend consumers are likely to confuse prediction markets with legal gambling sites. 
“The CFTC is a small, independent agency that regulates the trading of contracts related to agriculture commodities and other financial instruments. It has no expertise in the complexities of sports betting,” Titus wrote in a recent commentary. 
The agency, Titus said in a statement, “is not equipped to be a national gaming regulator and handle consumer disputes or integrity issues; furthermore it is laden with conflicts of interest. This Administration, however, has shown no interest in upholding the law. It will have even less as Truth Social enters this market.” 
“We are thrilled to become the world’s first publicly traded social media platform to offer our users access to prediction markets,” Devin Nunes, chairman and CEO of Trump Media, said in a press release. 
Crypto.com is the third major prediction market platform to tie its fortunes to the Trump family. Donald Trump Jr., the president’s son, is an advisor to Crypto.com rivals Polymarket and Kalshi.
Trump nominated Brian Quintenz, a member of the Kalshi board, as chairman of the CFTC in February, but withdrew the nomination last month. Last week Trump named Securities and Exchange Commission regulator Mike Selig to the position. 
The CFTC’s five commissioners are appointed by the president. The CFTC currently has an interim chairperson and no commissioners, according to its website.
Gov. Joe Lombardo did not respond to a request for comment on Trump’s involvement with the prediction markets or the president’s apparent conflict of interest.
“The media’s continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public’s distrust in what they read,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in response to the Current’s inquiry. “Neither the President nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.” 
Kevin Thompson, CEO of 9i Capital Group and host of 9innings podcast, told Newsweek that since the president took office for the second time, the Trump family’s fortune has “surged by more than $800 million, a roughly 17-fold increase, largely tied to crypto holdings and the World Liberty Financial venture.” 
Crypto.com reported revenue of $1.5 billion last year, and boasts some 140 million users. 
Meanwhile, Mark Masnick, a journalist at Techdirt, pointed out the potential conflicts of a president having a financial interest in a prediction market.
“So the company the president currently owns is teaming up with a cryptocurrency company to create a prediction market, which will take bets… on things the president himself has quite a lot of control over?” Masnick wrote on social media. “Gosh, I’m sure nothing bad will happen.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DSC04730-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-30 08:18:09.498826

(Photo: Ronda Churchill/Nevada Current)While federal food assistance benefits are expected to stop Nov. 1, federal housing vouchers providing rental assistance for low-income households should continue as normal, according to housing authority officials.
And legislation passed by the Nevada Legislature in 2019 was designed to offer eviction and foreclosure protections for households with federal workers who aren’t getting paid during a federal government shutdown. 
An estimated 2.4 million households nationwide, including 17,137 households in Nevada, rely on the Housing Choice Voucher program, previously referred to as Section 8, to pay for rent. 
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development can not process new voucher applications during the shutdown, now in its fourth week.
But HUD has obligated funding for existing vouchers through Dec. 31, the Reno Housing Authority told Nevada Current in an email. 
The Reno Housing Authority, which provides assistance throughout Washoe County, allocated around 2,094 housing choice vouchers last year. Additional funds related to operating public housing have already been secured through Nov. 30, said Jerri Williams Conrad, the government and public affairs manager for the Reno authority.
The Nevada Rural Housing Authority, which facilitates roughly 1,100 vouchers, also confirmed via email funds are obligated through the year.  
The Southern Nevada Regional Housing Authority, which administers roughly 12,000 vouchers in Clark County, did not address requests for comment about how long funding for vouchers and public housing is secured, or what kind of reserve the agency has to continue operation if funding lapses. “We do not know the full impact of a prolonged shutdown,” the agency said in brief statement.
Eviction, foreclosure protections
Legislation passed and signed into law in 2019 by former Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak expanded protections for federal workers, facing eviction, mortgage foreclosure, and vehicle repossession during a federal government shutdown. 
For federal employees who are unable to pay rent and receive an eviction notice, they “have the right to request to stay in the property until 30 days after the shutdown ends,” according to Legal Aid Center of Southern Nevada.
The protections also extend to an employee of an employer who has entered into a contract with a federal agency, or a “household member of such a worker.”
Assembly Bill 393, sponsored by former Democratic Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson during the 2019 session, was introduced after the government shutdown of 2018-19 during the first Trump administration, which lasted 35 days. 
“Given the record of the past few years and the polarization on the federal level, I think we can safely assume that government shutdowns will occur from time to time in the future,” Frierson said. “We at the state level must take action to protect our citizens.”
No state lawmakers opposed the measure. 
The current shutdown, which currently has no end in sight, is the first time the law will be put to the test. 
In addition to eviction protections for federal employees, the legislation:

Prohibits landlords from charging late fees or terminating a a lease due to unpaid rent; 
Prevents a foreclosure claim from being started against a worker during the shutdown and for 90 days after it ends;
Stops vehicles from being repossessed during the shutdown and for 30 days after the shutdown ends.

The bill requires outstanding rent to be paid 30 days after the shutdown ends. Federal workers also have to provide proof they are employed by the government.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/EvictionCourt_RC_103123_006-1024x715.jpg,,,2025-10-30 08:18:09.498826

(Photo by Fran Baltzer for New Jersey Monitor)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]With most political observers in New Jersey focused on the gubernatorial election, Jersey City is seeing its most competitive mayor’s race in more than 20 years.
The stakes are high for the voters here, New Jersey’s second-largest city and perhaps its most ethnically diverse and economically buzzing municipality. Seven people are competing to succeed Mayor Steve Fulop, a Democrat who is stepping down after three terms, with his potential successors promoting themselves as the most capable to keep attracting new people to the city while making sure that rent and other costs of living don’t force longtime residents out.
The front-runners in the nonpartisan race are Jim McGreevey, a former governor; Bill O’Dea, a Hudson County commissioner and former city councilman; and James Solomon, a city councilman who represents the city’s waterfront and downtown areas. They are joined on the ballot by Mussab Ali, a former school board president; Christina Freeman, a city police officer; Kalki Jayne-Rose, a musician; and Joyce Watterman, the president of the city council.
Voters will likely wake up the morning after Election Day with another campaign ahead. If none of the candidates garners more than 50 percent on Tuesday, the top two vote-getters will go head-to-head in a Dec. 2 runoff.
The governor’s race has focused largely on concerns that New Jersey has become unaffordable. The same issue is also at the center of the campaign in Jersey City, where critics have said for years that the city’s leadership is too interested in promoting luxury housing at the expense of longtime residents who worry about being priced out.

O’Dea believes that the city needs to grow using a mix of small, medium, and large real estate projects in order to expand housing options while keeping costs down. He has also criticized city leadership for not enforcing rent control laws already on the books.
“My cell phone blows up with text messages and calls on a daily basis of people that are being evicted. People don’t know how they’re going to pay their rent,” said O’Dea, 66, who also serves as the executive director of the Elizabeth Development Company. “Until recently, the city wasn’t enforcing the rent registration law. Anybody who’s part of the municipal government shares the blame for that.”
Solomon has decried what he called a “luxury-only” model of housing development over the course of Fulop’s mayoralty, leading to extraordinary profits for developers. He added that he would strive to cap rent increases and aggressively enforce rent control.
“We’re going to make sure that if developers build, they’re building for the whole community, not just for a small part of it,” said Solomon, 41. “If you’re in a unit that already has rent protections, we’re not going to let landlords and developers push you out so they can make greater profit.”

McGreevey said in Jersey City, “We build buildings, not communities.”
“To deal with affordability, it’s a combination of factors like controlling spending, upzoning houses of worship, and making sure we have 20% affordable housing in new projects,” said McGreevey, 68, who also wants to establish a municipal office of tenant advocacy. “We have to begin to look at other opportunities, whether it’s distressed or municipally owned properties, and develop workforce housing for teachers, police officers, firefighters, and middle-class communities.”

Questions over candidates’ support from real estate developers have led to sniping, with Solomon crowing that he takes no campaign dollars from them.
“The history of Jersey City is the history of developers buying politicians and getting exactly what they want, how they want it, and the people getting screwed over,” Solomon said. “McGreevey has followed the exact same status quo playbook.”

McGreevey denied that he would do developers’ bidding. He cited his time as Woodbridge mayor and his support for the 2004 Highlands Water Protection and Planning Act, a law that promotes conservation and regional planning by regulating development in the 850,000-acre Highlands region of northwest New Jersey.
“They criticized me for not building affordable housing in Woodbridge, and the point is the whole bloody town was affordable. I’m the guy who passed the Highlands Act, and I was excoriated by the developers. I was Nosferatu,” McGreevey said. “Solomon can give wonderful speeches, but I actually took developers on.”
This election marks the first time that McGreevey is seeking elected office since he resigned as governor in 2004 after coming out as gay and admitting to an extramarital affair with a staffer. O’Dea, Solomon, and Ali have all cast a jaundiced eye at McGreevey’s attempt at a political comeback.
“Jim McGreevey’s career has been marked by controversies that call into question his integrity and decision-making,” Ali wrote in a recent opinion piece.
O’Dea said he can forgive McGreevey for the 2004 scandal, but “can’t forgive the fact that since McGreevey came back to Jersey City, it’s always been about himself.”
“The only real redemption would be for him to become the governor of the state of New Jersey again and get back what he lost,” he said.
Since initially leaving politics, McGreevey has dedicated much of his time to running job-training programs for people recently released from prison. He sees himself as a different man than he was 20 years ago, driven by different goals.
“I want to run a competent and ethical Jersey City. This city is at a turning point. My parents, who were raised here, aren’t here anymore. I was born here, and now I’ve come home. I have a second chance every day of my life when I serve the people I live and work with,” he said.
There are some matters where McGreevey, O’Dea, and Solomon agree, like finding a better use for funds planned for a French art museum project and opposition to the New Jersey Turnpike’s bid to widen a section of the roadway that cuts through Hudson County.
One key difference is whether they would accept Fulop’s endorsement. O’Dea and McGreevey said they would. Solomon, who represents the same city neighborhoods on the city council that Fulop once did before becoming mayor, said he would not.
“No, we want change,” Solomon said.

In an interview, Fulop, who has not issued an endorsement in the race to succeed him, said they have all asked privately for his support.
“All of them,” Fulop said. “They’re going to say whatever they want to say to get elected. And whether they govern the same way is to be determined.”
Fulop takes issue with Solomon’s campaign, saying it will be hard for him to govern if he wins because he may face council members who ran alongside his mayoral opponents (all nine council seats are also on the ballot on Nov. 4).
“When you run a campaign like Solomon, who’s taken a very negative tone in his campaign towards O’Dea and McGreevey, it’s going to be very hard for him,” Fulop said. “A person’s rhetoric during the campaign at this point is going to set the tone for their ability to govern.”
McGreevey and O’Dea acknowledged they had private discussions with Fulop about his support in the campaign. Solomon campaign manager Stuart Thomas denied that Solomon did.
“This campaign has been focused on affordability since we kicked off last September, which is why James is going to be elected mayor,” Thomas said.
When Fulop started his political career as a city councilman, Fulop railed against corruption in Jersey City, the seat of Hudson County, long seen as the core of Jersey political rot. He was elected mayor during the fallout from the federal Bid Rid corruption probe, with the residual outrage accelerating his path to power.
As Fulop readies to leave the scene — he will head a business group in New York City when he leaves office — he said he believes the half-life of local corruption has faded from the minds of local voters.
“When I came in, it was 2013, just after a corruption arrest that swept up dozens of people, the largest corruption arrest in the history of New Jersey. And the epicenter of that was Jersey City,” Fulop said. “The electorate doesn’t want to hear that everybody is guilty and corrupt. A lot of people are choosing to live in Jersey City. They want someone who focuses on how to make basic services better. After 12 years, that’s what resonates.”

A one-size-fits-all approach is bound to be problematic and is a simple way to handle a deeply nuanced issue.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rep. Larry Satcowitz: Gov. Scott’s return-to-office plan will cause upheaval and chaos.","This commentary is by Rep. Larry Satcowitz, D-Randolph.


Upon taking office in January, one of the first directives issued by President Trump was to order federal employees to report to work in person. It was clear at the time that this was done with the expectation that many of those workers would, in response, leave their jobs — helping to accomplish Trump’s goals of destroying large swaths of our federal government and concentrating power in his hands.
Here in Vermont the administration of Gov. Phil Scott announced in late August that state employees will be required to spend at least three days each week in the office starting Dec. 1.

They were told that more in-person days will enhance productivity and make use of existing, underutilized state office spaces. But the administration has not produced any data to indicate that productivity is likely to improve. And while it’s wasteful to maintain office space that’s not being used, we can consolidate state offices to a smaller footprint. Less office space means less expense. We should welcome that possibility.
Large organizations of many types have had varying experiences with remote work. For some it seems to work quite well and for others not so much. We just don’t know if this kind of general return to office will lead to more productive work. The experts on the running of our state government — our state employees — were not consulted.
What we do know is that this unilateral directive will result in the upheaval of many employees’ established, proven workflows, cause chaos in their family lives and cost them precious time and money. I have personally heard from state employees that many have begun to look for work elsewhere. Of the hundreds of employees who live out-of-state, it seems clear that we’re at risk of losing a large proportion of them. 
While it’s not clear that this will make our government work better, it’s not hard to imagine how it could make things much worse. Hiring qualified people in the current environment is challenging at best, and impossible at worst. It’s not unusual for positions to remain open for long periods for lack of qualified applicants. And given our housing shortage we will likely lose out-of-state workers who would be willing to relocate but won’t be able to find an affordable place to move to.

Positions are unfilled across state government, and the staff is stretched thin in many departments. This has already led to burnout and inefficiencies. With return-to-work we could easily see a dramatic number of resignations that will exacerbate our current, difficult situation.
If the governor’s plan is to make our government less effective, a general return-to-office, especially on such a short timeline, would be a good way to go about it. This is what Donald Trump has done to our federal government — with disastrous results.
Our state government is complicated, and our state agencies handle logistically complex operations all the time. Managing workers differently depending upon their needs and the requirements of their jobs is attainable and is exactly what good managers do. A one-size-fits-all approach is bound to be problematic and is a short-sighted way to handle a deeply nuanced issue.
I urge the governor to work with his employees to find a better path forward.

The plans for the fertilizer plant are still alive though. (Rendering courtesy of Atlas Agro)A Swiss company behind a $1.5 billion climate-friendly fertilizer factory proposed in central Washington is not giving up on the project despite the Trump administration’s termination of a significant federal subsidy.
In fact, CEO Petter Østbø said Atlas Agro will double down with a further $500 million investment in a large data center next door to the planned fertilizer plant.
Atlas Agro’s plans represent a potential economic boon for the Tri-Cities and Washington state. But local enthusiasm for the projects is paired with a dose of caution.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Department of Energy nixed funding for the Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub, which was set to pass through a large subsidy to Atlas Agro for making zero-carbon fertilizer using clean hydrogen. Funding for the hub won approval during President Joe Biden’s time in office. 
Apart from the lost federal dollars, other hurdles lie ahead for the project.
In an interview Wednesday, Østbø described an unexpected way to recover from the funding setback: by tacking on a second costly and energy-intensive component to his company’s plans in Washington.
“One very interesting thing is the ability to share infrastructure,” Østbø said about adding a profit-making data center. He said sharing the cost of construction for power infrastructure at the site could be “very beneficial” and that this expense alone amounted to almost twice as much as the canceled federal funding.
City, state and federal taxpayers have skin in this game. Atlas Agro secured a city property tax abatement. It should qualify for federal production tax credits and has already pocketed several million dollars in Washington state economic development grants.
But the slice of the $1 billion in Northwest hydrogen hub money that the Trump team yanked would have been the most valuable subsidy of all. 
Atlas Agro’s share of that award was roughly $150 million. It was slated to cover about 10% of the costs to design, permit, construct and start up the Pacific Green Fertilizer plant. 
Trump’s Energy Secretary Chris Wright justified the grant rescission by saying taxpayer money shouldn’t flow to questionable projects that would not provide a good return.
Østbø responded that the economic case for the green fertilizer factory is solid, as shown by the fact that Atlas Agro has already lined up a distributor and has major customer commitments from farmers in the region who want cheaper, locally-produced nitrogen fertilizer that is not derived from fossil fuels.
“It is economically viable,” Østbø said. “With industrial megaprojects, they always hit challenges along the way that you did not foresee. And then it’s critical to have good partners to work with. All of that is still in place, and we’re super excited about taking this forward.”
Power-hungry projects
Data centers typically require oodles of electric power and need water for cooling, both of which are supply-constrained in Central Washington. 
Atlas Agro’s CEO expects sufficient water can be secured, especially if adjacent industrial developments recycle water among their operations. Sourcing the vast amounts of needed renewable electricity on the open market and arranging for its transmission is the more vexing issue.
The fertilizer factory alone needs 320 megawatts, which is much more than the entire city of Richland currently consumes. Østbø said the new data center would require at least that much additional electricity, if not more.
Atlas Agro is in competition with other data center developers in the Northwest to buy the entire output of multiple new wind farms or solar farms with battery storage that are not yet built.
Østbø was not in a position to announce a power supply contract yet, but said with certainty, “It’s available.”
He said he’s more concerned whether the Bonneville Power Administration will come through in time with high-voltage transmission upgrades to increase capacity to move the electricity from its sources to waiting industrial customers. Other executives in a variety of industries around the Northwest are in the same boat.

The multinational fertilizer company has no prior experience in data center development. Østbø said it was fortunate that the biggest investor in Atlas Agro is the global finance firm Macquarie Group, which has expertise he can draw upon from backing other data centers. 
Østbø anticipated his company’s proposed data center would serve customers in the hot sectors of cloud computing and artificial intelligence. 
‘Creative, or desperate’
The proposed fertilizer factory and adjacent data center are proposed to be built on undeveloped desert parcels that were once federally-owned buffer lands between the growing city of Richland and the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. A decade ago, the Department of Energy transferred 1,641 acres from that buffer to the Tri-Cities community for economic development.
The Port of Benton responded cautiously a couple weeks ago when Atlas Agro asked for a one-year extension to complete the purchase of the 150-acre parcel for the fertilizer factory, which the port controls.
Port commissioners moved to shorten the requested extension to six months to be followed by an update on the project’s viability before they would consider a further extension.
“I’m fully supportive of this project. However, it sounds like there are a lot of uncertainties,” Port Commissioner Lori Stevens said at the meeting on Oct. 15.
Meanwhile, the Richland City Council has the final authority over the property sale for the data center development. A citizen-led economic development advisory committee voted 7-0 on Oct. 20 to recommend that the city give Atlas Agro an exclusive option to purchase the 275-acre parcel. Before the vote, one committee member wondered out loud whether the Atlas Agro data center proposal was “creative, or desperate,” according to the Tri-City Herald’s meeting coverage.
The full Richland City Council still has to weigh in, which could happen in November. Then, multiple parties are waiting for clarity about when the new Bonneville Power Administration transmission lines, upgraded substations and grid connections will come through.  
Atlas Agro needs to begin serious construction on its green fertilizer plant by the end of 2027 in order to qualify for valuable federal tax credits that are still available outside the hydrogen hub program. Østbø anticipated that the innovative and complex factory would take three to four years to complete.



Status of other hydrogen hub projects
Atlas Agro’s green fertilizer plant was the largest funding recipient within the terminated Pacific Northwest Hydrogen Hub project, but there were others in the mix. 
The next biggest was a proposal to redevelop a closed aluminum smelter near Ferndale, Washington, to make green hydrogen for refinery use, truck fueling and possibly backup power generation. At last report, this redevelopment was undergoing further review by its proponent, Calgary-based firm AltaGas.
Lewis County Transit is proceeding with a small hydrogen fueling depot for its zero-emissions fuel cell bus fleet. Previously received state and private grants will cover the cost to complete construction, which is already underway. But the loss of the multi-year federal hydrogen hub grant stalls plans to scale up hydrogen production to fuel other jurisdictions’ fleets, the Chehalis mayor told OPB.
A plan to build a hydrogen liquefaction and distribution plant in Boardman, Oregon, led by Air Liquide, now looks doubtful without the hydrogen hub funding or a nearby supplier of green hydrogen.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/atlas-argo-fertilizer-plant-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-30 07:16:37.999548

ASU, one of the nation’s Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), received $38 million from philanthropist Mackenzie Scott, the largest contribution in the school’s 158-year history.
“We are deeply grateful to MacKenzie Scott for her unprecedented generosity in supporting the vision of Alabama State University. The message here is clear: the work being done at this University is being held in high regard,” Dr. Quinton T. Ross, Jr., ASU president, said in a statement Monday. “This investment allows us to continue to make a significant impact as an institution of higher learning now and for generations to come. This is a history-making moment at the place where history is made.”
The university said in the statement that the money will be used for “bolstering the university’s endowment, enhancing student success initiatives, expanding its research and technology infrastructure and deepening ASU’s engagement within the Montgomery community and beyond” but did not provide details.
ASU’s total budget in 2024 was $113.6 million. About 4,081 students were enrolled at the university for the Fall 2024 semester. ASU is budgeted to receive $66.5 million from Alabama’s Education Trust Fund budget in the 2026 fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1.
This marks the third HBCU that Scott has donated to this month. Earlier this month, she gave $63 million to Morgan State University in Baltimore and $38 million to The University of Maryland Eastern Shore in Princess Anne, Maryland.
Scott also donated $70 million to the United Negro College Fund to help the organization support the 37 HBCUs it serves.
The university said they had no indication that they would be receiving the money from Scott.
“We’ve just been doing the work — staying true to our mission, our students, and our community,” Ross said in the statement. “You never know who’s watching, and to be recognized in this way reminds us that our efforts matter. Alabama State University’s impact is reaching farther than we sometimes realize.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Alabama-State-University-sign-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-10-30 07:16:37.999548

Mike Kehoe and state health officials on Wednesday announced continued funding for food assistance amid worry that key federal safety net programs will run dry as the government shutdown enters its fifth week.
The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services said federal nutrition benefits for low-income mothers and their young children will remain available into November, through the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, better known as WIC.
Over 98,000 Missourians received WIC benefits in September, according to the department.
“At this time, there is no plan to pause WIC operations or benefit redemption,” said Lisa Cox, a spokesperson for the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, in an email to The Independent. 
The department said in an earlier press release that it will notify retailers and WIC recipients if it becomes necessary to suspend benefits “in the latter half of the month.”
Kehoe also announced the transfer of $10.6 million to Missouri Area Agencies on Aging to help provide meals to seniors and the early distribution of a $5 million appropriation to food banks that was planned for later in the year. 
While advocates welcomed the measures, they cautioned that they won’t replace a funding plan for the federal government that would place programs like WIC on a firm footing in the longer term.
Wes Buchholz, vice president of programs at Crosslines Resource Center in Springfield, said he was “really excited” to hear that WIC will stay afloat for now, because baby formula is so difficult for food pantries like his to source.
“We have never found a way to buy formula at a good price, and it’s not something that gets donated hardly ever,” Buchholz said.
“Obviously, December is in question.”
Casey Hanson, deputy director at Kids Win Missouri, a nonprofit that advocates for children and families in the state, said the stopgaps will help families, but the shutdown is “continuing to create an environment that is difficult for parents to navigate.”
‘How can you not worry?’: Missouri food pantries brace for families to lose federal aid

A much larger federal food assistance program, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is expected to run out of funds at the end of the week. 
In addition to SNAP and WIC, federal funding for Head Start programs, which provide early childhood education, nutritious meals and other support services to families, is also in jeopardy while the shutdown continues.
As the end-of-year holidays approach, Hanson said, “kids are going to be home more, and families are going to need access to all of those resources.”
“Those families are already navigating tough situations in most cases, which is why they need those safety net programs,” Hanson said.
State Senate Minority Leader Doug Beck called Kehoe’s transfer of just over $15 million a “hollow gesture” in a post on X, noting that Missouri disbursed $131.5 million in SNAP benefits in September. 
“We need real solutions,” Beck said. “Not Washington-style stunts that don’t fix anything.”
Cox, the spokesperson for the state health department, said the continued availability of WIC is thanks to the program’s funding structure and cost-saving measures taken by the department predating the shutdown.
The department receives an annual sum from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and must adjust its offerings to ensure funding lasts as the number of WIC participants rises or falls each month. In October, for instance, the department cut yogurt, goat milk and evaporated milk, as well as some name brand items, from WIC-eligible purchases in response to rising costs.
Sarah Willson, the department’s director, said the measures “have been valuable in extending the benefits to WIC families longer.”
Buchholz urged Missourians hoping to help ease hunger to volunteer and donate to their local food pantries. Financial donations allow food pantries to purchase needed items at lower prices than are available to consumers, he noted.
“We’re going to need greater community support,” Buchholz said, “if the shutdown continues for a prolonged period of time.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/WIC-food-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-30 07:16:37.999548

When automobiles first started tearing through American streets a century ago, they weren’t exactly welcome. One of the main problems was that they were killing children: in 1921 alone, 286 children in Pittsburgh, 130 in Baltimore, and 97 in Washington, D.C. Cities memorialized the dead with monuments and solemn marches. A safety council in Detroit commemorated traffic deaths by ringing bells at city hall and churches; another in Brooklyn put up a “Death-O-Meter” near a major traffic circle that kept a running tally of those injured or killed.
It wasn’t just in cities. At the beginning of the 20th century, rural residents revolted as drivers of “horseless carriages” rammed into their livestock and their neighbors. Across the country, they threw stones and dung at cars, shot at them, and trapped them in ditches dug across roads, or with ropes and wires strung between trees.
The arrival of automobiles was at first greeted with skepticism that they could ever replace horses and then shock at the dangers they posed. Newspapers in the early 20th century called drivers “killers” and “remorseless murderers.” Cars weren’t seen as necessities but rather the dangerous playthings of those wealthy enough to afford them. Today, media coverage defaults to the passive voice and to calling crashes “accidents” even as they continue taking lives — more than 39,000 people just last year in the United States.
This history of hostility to cars has been largely forgotten. “There’s the myth that the Model T rolled off the assembly line, and it was love at first sight,” said Doug Gordon, co-author of the new book Life After Cars: Freeing Ourselves From the Tyranny of the Automobile. Gordon wrote the book, an accessible account of the collective damage the automobile has brought to the world, with his fellow hosts of “The War on Cars” podcast, Sarah Goodyear and Aaron Naparstek.
It’s part of a growing opposition to car culture in the literary world — a trend that suggests more people are willing to entertain these criticisms than in previous years, at least by publishers’ estimations. September brought the release of Roadkill: Unveiling the True Cost of Our Toxic Relationship With Cars, a philosophical book arguing that cars don’t represent freedom, as we’ve been told, but constraint. Depending on cars drains our bank accounts, limits our transportation options, and locks in damage to our health and the environment. Roadkill was published the same day as Saving Ourselves From Big Car, a condemning investigation of the way automakers, oil companies, and related industries gained control of the road to rake in profits, no matter the consequences.
The facts about cars are alarming: Far more Americans have died from car crashes than from all the wars the United States has fought. The average driver in the U.S. spends more than three-quarters of a million dollars on cars in their lifetime. If the fleet of SUVs around the globe were a country, they would be the world’s fifth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide, behind Russia and ahead of Japan.
None of these problems are new — in fact, people have been warning us about many of them for decades. So why is it so easy to ignore these glaring flaws?
One theory is that growing up in a world dominated by vehicles puts them in a collective blind spot. In other words, car culture changes your brain. “It’s so endemic, it’s so pervasive, it’s so ubiquitous that people don’t recognize just how much it is all around them,” said Ian Walker, an environmental psychologist at Swansea University in the United Kingdom. “And if it’s all around you, it’s shaping your perceptions.”
Walker coined the word “motonormativity” to describe this bias, which causes people to apply laxer moral standards to driving than to other activities. Take the matter of air pollution. In 2023, Walker’s research found that 75 percent of people in the United Kingdom agreed with the statement, “People shouldn’t smoke in highly populated areas where other people have to breathe in the cigarette fumes.” But when two words were swapped — “People shouldn’t drive in highly populated areas where other people have to breathe in the car fumes” — only 17 percent agreed.
The bias can come from a conscious love for cars or it can be learned subconsciously as people go about their days living in places clearly designed for driving, as opposed to those built to make walking or biking easier. Walker’s study earlier this year found that people in the Netherlands, where biking is encouraged by urban design and much more common, have lower levels of pro-car bias than those in the United States or United Kingdom.
The reality is, without great transportation alternatives available, most people find it easier to ignore the risks of getting in a vehicle. “Driving a car or being a passenger in a car is by far the most dangerous thing that most of us do on a daily level,” said Sarah Goodyear, a co-author of Life After Cars (and a former Grist writer). “If you allowed yourself to think about how dangerous that is, it would be debilitating.”

As cars began to dominate the road — pushing out bikers, horse-and-buggy drivers, streetcar riders, and children playing in the street — the early critiques of them mostly faded away. But they never entirely disappeared.
A 1939 issue of the Superman comic book shows the superhero smashing cars after a reckless driver killed his friend. He terrorizes Metropolis’ mayor into rigorously enforcing traffic rules and confronts an auto company executive about prioritizing “profits at the cost of human lives” before wiping out his automobile factory. A few decades later, Ralph Nader’s 1965 book, Unsafe at Any Speed, uncovered how the auto industry resisted safety features like seat belts in favor of making flashy, visually appealing cars, sparking a national conversation that led to President Lyndon B. Johnson signing into law the first mandatory federal safety standards the following year.
Car companies poured a lot of effort into overcoming criticism. The auto industry spread the term “jaywalking” in the 1920s through a campaign to shame and blame pedestrians for traffic deaths, which included Boy Scouts reprimanding people who crossed the street wherever they wanted. In 1939, the same year Superman launched his war on cars, General Motors introduced a utopian vision of skyscrapers and seven-lane highways at the World’s Fair in New York, Futurama, which proved to be the most popular exhibit. It wasn’t long before those highways got built, and cars were sold as symbols of freedom and prosperity, with ads of families riding into the sunset on road trips. Even the phrase “America’s love affair with cars” was an industry invention, first coined in a Chevrolet ad in 1957.
Automakers still spend billions on advertising every year. Every football game on TV is punctuated by trucks rampaging through fragile deserts, woodlands, and streams, often accompanied by Will Arnett’s husky voice-over. What’s rarely seen is the reality of being stuck in traffic. “The industry isn’t just selling cars with those images,” write the authors of Life After Cars. “What they’re really hawking is a fantasy veiled in chrome and steel, the fantasy of power and control and independence. The American dream on wheels, no matter where in the world one lives.”
Cars have become intertwined with our lives, not just a practical way to get around but an aspirational one, tied to our social status and identity. It’s a tough combination to break free from, one that would require overhauling the system that feeds us a message of car dependency: the design of streets, the laws that encourage driving, the advertisements, and more. “Until especially the public and the policymakers recognize there is actually a problem, I think we’re pretty stuck,” Walker said.
Walker has found that his idea of “motonormativity” resonates with people trying to make the transportation system more sustainable and more welcoming to other modes of travel, but not so much with the general population. (Street engineers, he says, are especially hard to convince.)
Getting people to listen to criticisms of cars may feel as daunting as ever, but Goodyear and Gordon say there are some promising signs. “I would say more people are ready than you might expect,” Gordon said.
Recent years have given people a glimpse of how the transportation system could change: The burst of outdoor dining after COVID-19 presented a picture of what streets could look like when cities didn’t prioritize cars. E-bikes, too, have become increasingly common, offering another way to get around. Drivers may find themselves open to other options as they struggle to pay for their vehicles, especially as more of them fall behind on their car payments. Policies are changing, too: Earlier this year, New York implemented a congestion pricing plan that put a toll on driving in lower Manhattan. Already, it has led to less traffic, more transit riders, fewer car crashes and cleaner air.
Taken together, these trends help explain why books like Life After Cars are now on bookstore shelves for the public to peruse, not just marketed to bikers and transit nerds. “It’s almost impossible to imagine this book coming out 10 or 15 years ago from a major publisher,” Gordon said.

Thomas/Getty Images)Running a business in Washington is getting harder due to rising health care costs, a challenging regulatory and tax environment, and trade uncertainty.
Surveys from the Association of Washington Business in 2024 and 2025 reveal that nearly half of employers rank health care affordability as a top concern on par with inflation and taxes.
Nearly 4 million Washingtonians, or 52% of the state’s population, are covered by employer-provided health insurance. Recent national surveys by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce show that 89% of Americans prefer to get their coverage through their employer.
But rising health care costs are straining budgets across industries, forcing employers to make tough trade-offs between investing in compensation, innovation, and growth. As health benefits become one of the largest expenses on the balance sheet, they increasingly limit a company’s ability to remain competitive and expand.
At the same time, Washington passed $9.4 billion in new and higher taxes, the largest tax increase in state history. 
Through the expansion of sales tax and business and occupation taxes, local businesses of all types will be impacted. AWB members report significant concerns: a tree service company will face an $80,000 annual increase; an engineering firm projects between $300,000 to $400,000 in additional taxes.
And even a not-for-profit health plan like Premera expects to add several million more dollars to the roughly $75 million we already pay annually in state taxes, fees and assessments. These costs will further drive up prices on everything, including health care.
Unfortunately, the challenges don’t end there. 
Medicaid and Medicare are used by 40% of Washingtonians. State and federal reimbursements — already low — will soon shrink further, but the cost of care won’t. Who is left to close the gap? Employers and families who get charged more, on top of last year’s double-digit hikes.
The gap will widen even further if enhanced tax credits associated with the Affordable Care Act go away. The Washington Health Benefit Exchange estimates that 80,000 people in Washington could lose coverage if the credits expire.
Employers are not powerless. In fact, they have more influence than they often realize.
The AWB survey makes clear that while taxes, regulation, and health care are top-of-mind, businesses are already taking steps to address these challenges. Many are working through organizations such as the Association of Washington Business, the Washington Roundtable, and local chambers to support more balanced tax and regulatory policies that promote predictability and competitiveness while sustaining essential services. 
There is a growing emphasis on health care affordability, with businesses exploring ways to stabilize costs for both employers and consumers. This includes efforts to minimize the factors driving price increases while maintaining access to high-quality care.
Employers are also helping their teams make informed health care decisions, encouraging preventive care, and integrating benefits to improve coordination.
Strengthening connections to primary care is another area of focus, as ongoing relationships with providers have been shown to improve health outcomes and reduce costs. A 2022 study by the National Institutes of Health found that each in-person primary care visit is associated with $721 in annual savings, with even greater savings for high-risk patients. 
Finally, businesses are increasingly sharing their experiences with policymakers, offering insights into how rising costs affect their ability to invest, grow, and support their workforce.
Washington’s strength has always come from its ability to adapt and innovate. By tackling health care affordability and building a fair tax and regulatory system, we can position our state to remain a place where businesses thrive, and communities prosper.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/business-opening-for-the-day-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-30 07:16:37.999548

(Photo by Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana will not issue new child care vouchers to impoverished families until at least 2027, Family and Social Services Administration leaders said at a quarterly fiscal meeting Wednesday, in the agency’s latest strategy to contain enrollment — and cut expenses.
“As Indiana looks ahead, the story of 2024 and 2025 will hopefully be remembered as a turning point — a year when policymakers chose to prioritize children and families, even at the cost of short-term strain on child care businesses,” said Adam Alson, director of FSSA’s Office of Early Childhood and Out-of-School Learning.
Amid cuts, Indiana child care providers mobilize

He spoke from a lectern in Government Center South’s sparsely filled auditorium, prompting scoffs from a contingent of hard-hit child care workers seated front and center.
Alson knocked former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration for “overenroll(ing)” Indiana’s voucher programs using temporary pandemic aid, instituting “artificially inflated” reimbursement rates and not planning for a wind-down to normal funding levels.
“We have a responsibility to Hoosier families, Hoosier child care businesses and Hoosier taxpayers to make policy decisions based on the simple constraint of funding,” he said. “We have, and will continue to have, a laser focus on our costs in order to maximize available funding to CCDF vouchers.”
FSSA has cut contracts, staffing and provider reimbursement rates to make ends meet, Alson said. Lawmakers also appropriated $147 million in “hold harmless” funding — enough to renew vouchers for families already on the program and at the same income requirements.
Enrollment in the federal Child Care Development Fund and state On My Way Pre-K programs peaked at 69,000 in December. That month, FSSA closed enrollment and opened a waitlist.
Vouchers have dropped to about 55,000 as of September, according to meeting slides.
Almost 31,000 low-income Hoosier children were on the waitlist for vouchers that month, up from about 29,000 the month prior.
About 80% of those on the waitlist in September were under the federal poverty line, compared to roughly 60% of current participants. New enrollees must meet narrowed income standards.
The 10-month freeze has crushed enrollment, according to the updated figures.

The number of infant voucher-holders — born after the waitlist opened — has dropped 95% since last November, according to the slides. Enrollment for toddlers has dropped 33%, pre-schoolers 14% and school-age children 8%.
Alson’s office projects that it will not take CCDF voucher hopefuls off the waitlist through 2026, assuming federal contributions remain flat. 
“OECOSL simply does not have the funding available to prudently begin enrollment before that,” Alson told the auditorium.
Vouchers for OMWPK were also curtailed for the current school year, including a cap of 2,500 enrollees that FSSA doesn’t expect will be hit.
After the presentation, FSSA spokesman Marcus Barlow posed questions submitted by meeting attendees about the waitlist, funding, rate-setting and more.
Asked how much money is required to open the waitlist, Alson replied, “We need to be at a point, as an office, that we feel comfortable in — let me take a step back.
“What’s happened here, in the last year, with OECOSL, can never happen again,” he said. “We cannot be so far off what we enroll versus what our funding is. It just cannot happen again.”
There’s one small exception, according to FSSA spokesman Tyson Runkle: Indiana Code requires the office to provide vouchers for 200 foster children.
Providers complain the enrollment freeze and double-digit rate cuts threaten their livelihoods — 23 locations have closed since June, per the slides — and the care of low-income children.
Dawn Justice, owner of A New Dawn Daycare in Clark County, told the Capital Chronicle that she hasn’t raised rates since 2012. In the auditorium seat next to her, Mary Rudolph, owner of Where Kids Count Childcare in Floyd County, said she’s made no hikes in 21 years of business.
The pair drove two hours to attend Wednesday’s meeting. Justice said it’s a “burden” on families to offset the rate cuts. Parents are responsible for paying the overage — the difference between the rate providers charge and the reimbursement they receive from the state.
FSSA cut rates 10% for infant and toddler care, 15% for preschoolers and a whopping 35% for school-age children. The rates went into effect Oct. 5, with the first pay date being Nov. 6.
Several child care providers confronted Alson outside the auditorium, after the presentation.

He defended the office’s changes, repeatedly noting that it can only spend what’s appropriated, during a conversation lasting at least 10 minutes. As the minutes ticked past, tempers flared.
“Why are you against us? It feels like you’re against us,” said Kelly Dawn Jones, owner of Love Your Child’s Childcare in Marion County. “Why does it feel like you are against the people who truly — we’re literally out here ready to fight for the children.”
She said she has kids at her facility staying for free, essentially, like a child whose voucher paid out just $4 even though it used to provide $120.
Jones continued until Alson interrupted, saying, “I need to go. I thank you for your time.”
As the incensed providers accused him of not caring, he repeated his thanks and departed.

In Minnesota, 440,000 people will lose SNAP, including 152,000 children, 72,000 seniors and 52,000 people with disabilities. 
This is the most devastating impact of the government shutdown so far. 
Over the past couple of weeks, I’ve noticed more people dropping off donations at the food shelf where I volunteer. Regular people with a few bags of food, a few stray items they had in the back of their cupboards, sometimes an envelope with a check. 
Gov. Tim Walz has freed up $4 million to support food shelves. 
We’re all doing what we can. 
But as I wrote earlier this year, all the donations and volunteers and amazing people at the food banks who deliver food for hungry people can’t make up for the impact of SNAP, which is the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps.  
Minnesota spends about $1 billion a year on SNAP, or more than $80 million dollars a month. The funding is all federal though. 
Our voluntary efforts can help families bridge a short gap — mitigate the suffering for a week or two. It’s unlikely we can do more than that. The hole left by SNAP is too large. 
There is one party that is not doing all that it can to help: The federal government, particularly the Trump administration.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture — the federal agency that runs SNAP — has a $5.5 billion contingency fund that could be used to help states starting on November 1. But they recently shifted their position — without explanation — and declared the funds could not be used for SNAP benefits. 
And, as a reminder, they also cut federal funding for the voluntary food sector as part of the DOGE cuts earlier this year. 
And now SNAP has become another bargaining chip, caught up in the politics of the federal government shutdown. 
Even the $5.5 billion that USDA has available is short of the estimated $9.2 billion needed to fully fund SNAP benefits nationwide for November. 
Democrats are refusing to provide necessary votes in the U.S. Senate to fund the government until Republicans restore health insurance subsidies; without them, millions of Americans will suffer through a massive spike in their health insurance premiums.
This may be a game of chicken. USDA may be holding the funds as leverage to force congressional Democrats to vote to reopen the government. If enough pressure is applied, however, perhaps USDA will relent.
There may be a small glimmer of hope, however. 
Some Republicans in Congress seem to be noticing what I’ve noticed: People are aware of what is happening, and they are not happy about it. 
Several congressional Republicans have introduced bills to separately fund SNAP for a full year. A few Republican governors are making plans to use state funds to bridge the gap.
None of these politicians wants to see weeks of local news coverage filled with images of people — seniors, families, kids — lined up at under-stocked food shelves. Daily stories of desperate families, isolated seniors with no food.  
Because the real losers in this D.C. Beltway game of chicken are not the politicians. The losers are the 42 million Americans that may go without food assistance; the 152,000 Minnesota kids who might go to bed hungry.  
When I was volunteering at the food shelf last week, an older man wearing a U.S. Navy hat brought in a donation — some bags of food and an envelope with a check. 
He asked me how it was going. I told him we had been busy in the morning, and I expected it would get busier as we approached November 1. . 
He shook his head and said, “This isn’t America.”
I hope not. But it’s hard to be sure anymore.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/food-stamps-sign.jpg,,,2025-10-30 07:16:37.999548

It is happening in large part […]","Cattle operations, one shown here in Kansas in March 2022, are not able to use the federal government’s migrant worker visa program, but workers rights advocates worry expanding the program without added protections could lead to more problems (Jill Hummels for the Kansas Reflector).TOPEKA, Kansas — Blueberries unpicked and dropping from plants in New Jersey, crops left to dry up in North Carolina fields and understaffed rural Kansas cattle operations are becoming more and more common, and food in the United States is going to waste, according to farmers and agriculture professionals.
It is happening in large part because of a labor shortage crisis, they said during a Thursday press call hosted by a coalition called Grow It Here that brought together the topics immigration, government and farming.
“It is clear to me that we can either import our workers or import our food, and that’s a key question, a key issue we need to answer,” said Matt Teagarden, CEO of the Kansas Livestock Association, representing around 5,000 members involved in Kansas’ multi-billion dollar cattle industry.
Farmers from North Carolina, Wisconsin, California and New Jersey also weighed in, expressing their frustrations with labor challenges and describing their reliance on a federal guest worker visa program that can act as a band-aid to larger issues. The program is often framed as a win-win for employers and workers, but that isn’t always the case.
Brandon Batten of Triple B Farms in Four Oaks, North Carolina, said his farm began using the federal government’s H-2A visa program about a year ago. The program allows employers who meet certain requirements to hire foreign workers for temporary jobs while providing a mandated base wage and housing. Recent changes to the program increased application and processing fees and stripped worker protections.
Labor has been Batten’s biggest challenge, he said, and while H2A provides a safety net, it isn’t always efficient.
“As expensive and onerous as the program is, it’s more expensive to plant a crop and not get it harvested,” he said.
Cattle operations often cannot use the visa program. The jobs aren’t seasonal, so Teagarden said rural Kansas employers are trying to take a holistic approach by recruiting locally, sometimes visiting high schools to encourage fulfilling careers in agriculture and trying to retain existing workers.
John Rosenow owns a 700-cow dairy farm in western Wisconsin that employs 18 people. Thirteen of them are from Mexico, he said. But he cannot use the H-2A program.
“The dairy industry has been asking Congress and asking the federal government for years to modernize the immigration system because dairy is specifically excluded from having H-2A employees,” he said. “We rely on immigrants.”
He said 90% of dairy harvested from Wisconsin cows is done so by immigrants.
Brandon Raso, a fourth-generation blueberry farmer in New Jersey, started using the H-2A program more than a decade ago.
“Aside from its challenges, logistically, and its costs, it’s been a program that has helped us stay afloat,” Raso said. “But I do have to admit, due to the rising costs and increasing challenges that the program has provided, we have dramatically decreased the number of workers we utilize through that program.”
The farm used to have 250 workers through the H-2A program to help offset local labor shortages, Raso said. This season, the farm had 30 workers.
Historically, New Jersey farmers could produce about 60 million pounds of blueberries each season, or about $140 million, Raso said. This year, it was around 36 million pounds. Raso attributes the primary cause of the decrease to labor shortages.
“I know, myself, we left about two million pounds on our farm on our plants to fall off and hit the ground because there was just no one to get that fruit,” he said.
About 70% of crop farm workers in the U.S. are foreign-born, said Zach Rutledge, a professor and economist at Michigan State University. Most of those workers are from Mexico, and about 41% are not authorized to work in the U.S.
About half of farmers say they don’t have the labor they need, Rutledge said, and they gauge their shortage at lacking 21% of needed workers. He said that labor reductions result in production and revenue reductions for farmers. Current trends could lead to billions in lost revenue, an increase in food prices and a heavier reliance on imports, he said.
He added that if immigration enforcement targets agriculture, “there could be major problems.”
“Including the direct effects of having arrests and deportations of workers on the farm and what we call chilling effects, which are when workers get scared because they hear about immigration enforcement and don’t go to work because of fear of being deported,” Rutledge said.
Employers face significant burdens under the federal H-2A program.
So do employees.
“On top of increased immigration enforcement, which is already exacerbating a chilling effect among workers facing abuse, from the start of the Trump administration, we’ve seen sustained efforts to roll back hard-earned worker protections,” said Jimena de Haro of the Centro de los Derechos del Migrante, a binational workers’ rights organization.
The Trump administration has reversed Biden-era protections for workers under H-2A rules and proposed at least $17.29 billion in wage cuts for H-2A workers over 10 years.
The administration’s deportations and efforts to strip people in the U.S. of their immigration and work authorization statuses exacerbate labor shortages, de Haro said.
“In response, we are seeing growers and lawmakers coming up with ‘Band-Aid solutions’ to increase the number of available workers — mainly focused on expanding guest worker programs— without taking into account workers’ wellbeing or rights,” de Haro said.
Recent proposals, also mentioned on the Grow It Here call, include pushes to make H-2A year-round and make it available to other industries, she said.
“But in a program rife with abuse, expanding it would just cause more abuse and exploitation of migrant farmworkers, especially when calls for expansion are accompanied by the rollback of important worker protections,” she said.
A report by Centro called “Ripe for Reform” and a September investigation by ProPublica showed the H-2A program as prone to worker abuse and exploitation.
Kristi Boswell, a former agriculture labor advisor during the first Trump administration and advisor to Grow It Here, said the campaign was created to educate policymakers and the public about labor shortage struggles and the repercussions that come as a result.
The word “crisis” was used several times by the group.
“I’ve been working on this issue for 15 years,” Boswell said. “The situations, the circumstances, have worsened. Labor costs have increased. We’ve seen a trade deficit in specialty crops and fruits and vegetables. I think it is going to continue to elevate.”

Bestselling mystery writer Louise Penny hopes a weekend reading at the border-straddling Haskell Free Library and Opera House will show “what happens politically is one thing, and transitory. What happens in our hearts is indestructible.”

When Canadian mystery writer Louise Penny canceled her fall U.S. book tour amid tariff threats to her country, American fans questioned if they’d ever again spy the author praised by Publishers Weekly for her criminal mind yet “clear-eyed optimism about human nature.”
On Saturday, Vermont’s border-straddling Haskell Free Library and Opera House will offer an answer when it hosts an appearance with a surprising backstory — and back-door story.
Three years ago, Penny was plotting the latest in her series of Chief Inspector Armand Gamache novels, set in the fictional village of Three Pines just north of the Green Mountains in her home province of Quebec.
After going big to sell more than 18 million copies globally, the author pushed her limits further by proposing a cabal of characters who scheme to mine Canada’s resources by making it the 51st state.
“I remember thinking ‘Have I jumped the shark? Have I gone too far? Will anyone believe this?’” Penny told CTV News.
Then came the return of President Donald Trump.
“Turns out maybe I didn’t go far enough,” she said.
Penny’s 20th Gamache book, “The Black Wolf,” hit stores Tuesday and immediately skyrocketed up online sales lists. But disheartened by a U.S. trade war, the author has dropped a 20-year tradition of touring her country’s southern neighbor.
“What is happening is not just a potential economic catastrophe for Canada and so many other nations, it is a moral wound,” she wrote on social media. “With that in mind, I am so sorry to say that until things change, I cannot do in-person events in the United States.” 
Enter the Haskell Free Library and Opera House on the border of Derby Line and Stanstead, Quebec, just 40 minutes from Penny’s home.
“The Haskell was built by both countries as a symbol of our strong bonds of friendship,” the author wrote of the 1904 landmark. “It is the physical reflection of what we believe. That what happens politically is one thing, and transitory. What happens in our hearts is indestructible.” 
The Haskell plays a pivotal role in Penny’s new novel, reviewers hint without spoiling. With black floor tape marking the border, the building has a front entrance in Derby Line and a back-door emergency exit in Quebec — the latter which Penny is aiming to upgrade by contributing 50,000 Canadian dollars (about $36,000 in U.S. currency).
To raise more money, Penny will present two sold-out readings at the 400-seat opera house on Saturday and Sunday, with the audience divided equally between Canadian and U.S. residents.
“If you do come to one of the Haskell events it would not hurt to bring your passport,” Penny has warned people who snatched up all the tickets in days. “A few months ago saying that would have sounded ludicrous, but we are living in times when the ridiculous is made manifest.”
For supporters without seats, the event’s two sponsoring stores, Vermont’s Phoenix Books and Quebec’s Brome Lake Books, are selling online links to a livestream of Saturday’s program.
Phoenix employees are preparing 400 books for the Haskell readings and another 300 and counting for people set to log onto the broadcast.
“We still have spots available,” Burlington store manager Tod Gross said of the online program, “but I would encourage people to sign up quick.”
The readings come after the Haskell’s recent appearance on CBS News’ “Sunday Morning” and just weeks before the opera house is set to host CBC radio’s “The Current.”
As for Penny, she’ll cap her book tour Nov. 28 in Toronto.
“Please understand this decision is not meant to punish Americans — this is about standing shoulder-to-shoulder with my fellow Canadians,” the author wrote on social media. “I am hoping Americans will come to the Canadian events. You will be welcomed with open arms. As friends. As fellow villagers of Three Pines. Where goodness, and decency, exist.”

(Getty Images)A new study commissioned by the Indiana Gaming Commission identified downtown Indianapolis as the top location for a potential relocated casino, projecting it could bring in almost half a billion dollars in revenue annually and more than $170 million in state tax receipts.
The findings, presented Wednesday to the State Budget Committee, come from a 45-page analysis by Spectrum Gaming Group. 
The firm was hired in response to Senate Enrolled Act 43 — passed during the most recent legislative session — which called for the state to commission an independent study by Nov. 1 to identify and assess the top two regions in Indiana where a casino license to operate a riverboat could be relocated.
“The statute was very direct,” Indiana Gaming Commission Executive Director Joe Hoag told lawmakers. “We wanted the study to look at projected annual gaming revenues and corresponding tax revenues … the impact on other casinos, the impact on the horse racing industry, (and) the impact assessment of a potential tribal casino in the region.”
Study eyes possible downtown casino
The commission initiated the relocation study earlier this year “to ensure that its licensed casinos are optimally located amid a rapidly changing gaming landscape in the Midwest,” the report said.
Spectrum’s analysis found that relocating a casino license to an area near downtown Indianapolis would yield an estimated $493.3 million in adjusted gross receipts annually — roughly eight times more than the state’s lowest-grossing casino — with $170.7 million in gaming-tax receipts for the state.
Story continues below.
Spectrum-Relocation-Report-to-Indiana-Gaming-Commission-9-30-2025-Final
 
Adjusted gross receipts are the casino’s total gambling revenue after paying out winnings to players. “Gaming-tax receipts” or “state tax receipts” refer to the wagering and supplemental taxes Indiana collects from those adjusted revenues. The taxes largely fund public services, but a small share goes to local development agreements where casinos operate.
A second possible location, near the intersection of I-69 and State Road 8 in northeast Indiana, could generate $204.3 million in adjusted gross receipts and $61.1 million in tax receipts, according to the study.
The Indianapolis site, referred to in the report as the “Downtown Proxy Point,” was modeled near the Statehouse and convention center area “to show the potential for a downtown casino – and not a specific site downtown,” Hoag said.
“Just like in real estate, what’s the most important factor of what casino you go to? Location, location, location,” he continued. “People go to the first casino they come to. They’re not going to drive by one or two casinos to get to another unless it’s new and shiny.”
Spectrum concluded that either of those two “optimal areas” for a relocated license could significantly increase gaming revenue and corresponding state receipts compared with existing locations.
The study focuses on relocating an existing license rather than issuing a new one because state law currently limits the number of riverboat casino licenses. Relocation allows the state to capture higher revenues in a prime location without creating additional licenses.
Horse racing industry could lose millions
But the study also noted that a downtown Indianapolis location — while drawing the most revenue — would divert roughly $140 million in gaming revenue from existing racetrack casinos, particularly Hoosier Park in Anderson and Horseshoe Indianapolis in Shelbyville, both owned by Caesars. The industry currently receives 12% of adjusted gross receipts from those two racinos.
The report additionally warned of “significant differences” in how a new casino could affect Indiana’s horse racing industry, depending on if it’s located in downtown Indianapolis or farther northeast.
‘Destabilizing’ Indiana casino relocation study could also recommend new license

If a downtown Indianapolis casino opens, Spectrum projected a loss of $10 million to $17 million annually for horse racing, “reducing purses and breeding incentive funds” and knocking Indiana from 10th to 19th nationally in average purse size for thoroughbred races.
By comparison, the northeast Indiana option would have a much smaller estimated loss of $1.7 million for the industry.
And while a downtown casino could draw substantial visitation, Spectrum concluded it would not meaningfully boost tourism without being tied to other major attractions.
“Unless a potentially relocated casino in Indiana were to include – or be proximate to – a regionally prominent convention center or other major attraction, it would not impact tourism beyond attracting gamblers from its core market catchment areas,” the report said.
Indiana’s 14 commercial casinos generated $3 billion in adjusted gross receipts in the 2025 fiscal year, a 5.4% increase from the previous year, boosted by the opening of Terre Haute Casino Resort. 
But Spectrum noted the state’s gaming landscape is evolving amid new competition across the Midwest: from historical horse racing machines in Kentucky to expanded casino and video gaming in Illinois and Ohio.
Still, Hoag told budget committee members that the report “provides a wealth of information” that lawmakers can use as they weigh whether to authorize relocation of any casino license.
Lawmakers weigh in
State Budget Committee Chair Sen. Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka, questioned whether allowing a struggling casino to relocate makes sense.
He pointed specifically to Churchill Downs-operated Rising Star Casino Resort, located along the Ohio River near Cincinnati, which the Spectrum study identified as the smallest of Indiana’s 14 casinos and a likely candidate for relocation.
Sen. Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka (Photo courtesy Indiana Senate Republicans)
The report found that Rising Star generates about $42 million in adjusted gross revenue annually — far below the state average — and that if the casino were to close, Indiana would lose only about $1 million in total gaming-tax revenue, since most of its players would shift to other casinos in the state.
“Just because a casino is doing bad, to say, ‘Let’s let them move because they’re doing bad’ — I mean, do we want them to run another casino? Maybe they’re poorly run,” Mishler said. 
“I think the real question is, A, do we want to have another license? And B, if we do, where do we want it to be? And then just open that up,” he added. “I just don’t like the idea (of) saying you get to move to here. I’d rather just be yes or no — we’re going to do a license, we’re going to do it either in Indianapolis, or y’all bid on it or something.”
Rep. Greg Porter, D-Indianapolis, also weighed in, referencing the report’s mention of a potential tribal casino and the difference between the federally recognized Miami Tribe of Oklahoma and the Miami of Indiana.
Hoag said Spectrum’s analysis included only a high-level estimate of what a tribal casino might mean for state revenues.
He told lawmakers the study “touches on a little bit” of that issue but “doesn’t have a lot of color,” since local development agreements and tribal compacts would depend on future negotiations between the state and federal governments.
Sen. Andy Zay, R-Huntington, who authored Senate Enrolled Act 43, said in a Wednesday statement that he believes the study “is a good first step in understanding how a potential casino relocation could strengthen Indiana’s economy while supporting development in areas where there is much room to grow.”
“It’s great to see this study recognize the strong economic potential of northeast Indiana,” Zay said. “Our region continues to show signs of growth and investment opportunities, and I look forward to continuing my work and reviewing this study to see what possibilities are available to our state and region.”
But Sen. Tyler Johnson, R-Leo, “rejected” the proposal to relocate a new casino near his district in northeast Indiana, citing the gaming study’s “narrow financial focus and failure to assess full community impacts.”
“The recent report released by the Indiana Gaming Commission ignores risks to families, schools and public safety — issues my constituents, colleagues and I demanded be studied,” Johnson said in a statement. “We needed an independent, comprehensive review of social, traffic and infrastructure costs before any informed decision could possibly be made. Understanding things the way I do now, I oppose this attempt to relocate a casino to my community.”

(Courtesy of Denise Powell for Congress)OMAHA — An influential abortion-rights group is weighing in on the crowded Democratic primary in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District.
EMILY’s List on Thursday endorsed business owner and political action committee co-founder Denise Powell. The group’s president, Jessica Mackler, said they’re “proud to support her in this race as she fights for Nebraska.”
“She stepped up to be the leader her community needed when public schools were threatened and extremists tried to pass abortion bans, all while helping women in Nebraska run for office,” Mackler said. 
EMILY’s List endorses Democratic women running for office who support abortion rights; it doesn’t typically endorse in Democratic primaries if more than one woman is running, especially in high-profile races like the 2nd District. 
But there have been some recent exceptions, including 2018, when the group backed former Georgia State Rep. Stacey Evans in the Democratic primary for Georgia governor. The 2nd District Democratic primary has two other women running, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades and Navy veteran Kishla Askins. 
The group pointed to Powell’s role in state politics as the reason for the endorsement. It said she had helped with organizing recent ballot initiatives seeking to codify the right to an abortion, which failed, and to repeal a publicly funded voucher program for private K-12 schools, which succeeded. 
The race’s other Democratic candidates are State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, former congressional staffer James Leuschen and Evangelos Argyrakis. 
Rhoades received an endorsement from Omaha Mayor John Ewing last month. Cavanaugh announced the endorsements of four local unions this week. 
The Omaha-based race is typically competitive, but it’s drawing more attention with U.S. Rep. Don Bacon retiring.

Oct. 29, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/Michigan AdvanceAs the death knell for a controversial electric vehicle battery plant in Mecosta County rang out last week, members of the House Oversight Subcommittee on Corporate Subsidies and State Investments held a post-mortem on the state’s support for the project.
On Wednesday, members of the subcommittee welcomed John Mozena, president of the Center of Economic Accountability, which works across the country to promote transparency, accountability and reform of state and local economic development efforts. 
They also heard testimony from state Reps. Tom Kunse (R-Clare) and Joe Fox (R-Fremont), with Kunse representing the district where the project was sited while Fox represents the neighboring district. 
Mozena said he first became involved with the Gotion project in October 2022, noting his initial concerns were based on “the scanty information available just a few days after the announcement.” 
“It made no sense to make a 30 year deal around a technology that has such an uncertain future,” Mozena said, calling it “pure madness” for officials to try and predict which technologies would be viable 30 years into the future.

Mozena said he became more involved in the project in early spring 2023, when he was invited by members of the Big Rapids Township Board to speak at a community meeting when the township was still the planned location for the plant. 
While residents weren’t monolithically for or against the project, they did feel they were only getting one side of the story on the plant. 
“There seemed to be a severe lack of transparency and engagement with local residents and even with local elected officials such as township board members. That is a recurring theme, that would become a recurring theme for the rest of [the] Gotion project’s lifespan,” Mozena said, noting he’d seen similar concerns in other communities where the state has aimed to court mega site projects.
With the Michigan Economic Development Corporation sending a letter to Gotion in September holding the project in default of its obligations to its Critical Industry Program grant agreement, state support for the project has ended.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Danielle Emerson, public relations manager for the corporation said that none of the $125 million Critical Industry Program grant was disbursed to Gotion, and that they are actively seeking repayment of $23.6 million in site readiness dollars used to purchase land for the project. The remaining $26.4 million in site readiness dollars were not spent and will return to the state, Emerson said. 
With that deal at an end, Mozena said very important questions are left for members of the committee to present to the various stakeholders who worked on the deal: “Well, what did we learn from that?” and “What are you planning to change to avoid a similar failure in the future?”
In Gotion’s Oct. 15, response to the default notice first reported by Crain’s Detroit Business, attorney Mark Heusel attributed the project’s failure to the community.
“These well-documented challenges, false accusations, and politically motivated attacks were not through any actions or inactions by Gotion, but solely due to racist and ethnically charged stereotypes that led Green Charter Township to breach the parties’ Development Agreement,” Heusel wrote.
Both conservative politicians and local activists repeatedly criticized the project over its parent company’s Chinese ties. While Gotion Inc. is based in California, the parent company, Guoxuan High-tech Co., is based in China.
Asian American lawmakers and civil rights advocates voiced concerns that anti-China rhetoric over the project – which was condemned by a number of Republican officials within Mecosta County – created increased risks for hate crimes and discrimination.
While there may be some who harbor anti-Chinese sentiments, Mozena contended that the concerns around the projects had more to do with the harmful policies enforced by the Chinese government.

He also pointed to testimony from former U.S. Ambassador to Fiji Joe Cella at a previous meeting of the subcommittee, where Cella pointed to requirements in Chinese law demanding Chinese-based companies, no matter where they are located, to surveil, collect and report as directed.
Chuck Thelen, the company’s vice president, has pushed back against these arguments, previously stating “Despite what any current politicians might say, there is no communist plot within Gotion.”
Committee Vice Chair Rep. Dylan Wegela (D-Garden City) contended that most people in the nation would agree that no corporation – regardless of  their national origin – should receive taxpayer money, after noting that China, like most nations, is not free from criticism.
“I mean, our country is actively sending our tax dollars to fund a genocide right now as well,” Wegela said, criticizing the United States’ continued support for Israel. 
In response, Rep. Matthew Bierlein (R-Vassar) walked out of the committee telling Wegela “I’m not going to sit here and listen to your crap anymore.” The subcommittee continued its discussion without him.

Mozena agreed with Wegela, that companies should not be subsidized regardless of their nationality or background. 
“That is one of the founding principles of our organization, is that at the long run, there is no evidence that we should be doing this.” Mozena said. “It’s morally wrong, it’s economically wrong, and the real-world evidence just is that it doesn’t work. So let’s stop doing things that don’t work.”
Concerns over organizations backing international trade missions persist
At the beginning of the meeting, Mozena also discussed Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s efforts to build and maintain relationships with overseas investors, continuing a discussion from the previous committee meeting. 
Last week the committee probed members of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and counsel for the Michigan Economic Development Federation over their role in planning and funding international trade missions led by the governor. 
While the Michigan Economic Development Corporation – a public private partnership intended to support the state’s economic development – and the Michigan Economic Development Federation – a private nonprofit – repeatedly emphasized their independence from each other, two members of the federation’s board were also appointed to the board of the Economic Development Corporation.
The governor also serves as the ex-officio chair of the Michigan Economic Development Federation, though the role is not unique to Whitmer’s tenure, with the organization’s legal counsel, Eric Doster, emphasizing that the role is “more of an honorary position than a functionary one.”
Courtney Overbey Martinez, the Economic Development Corporation’s vice president of communications, told the Michigan Advance in an email last week there are protocols in place to ensure that as the foundation has conversations with new donors, that they do not have active projects in the economic development corporation’s pipeline. There is also a 90-day black out period when the Michigan Strategic Fund Board approves funding for a project before the foundation can conduct donor outreach.
Mozena raised further concerns about the connection of the foundation’s members to the state’s economic development efforts, pointing to reporting from the Detroit News which found that companies with seats on the foundation’s board received about $2.2 billion in economic development incentives from the Whitmer Administration in years past.

In his own research, Mozena found that at least 20 of the 29 companies the foundation lists as supporters received some form of tax abatement grant or other subsidy. 
“I think that that is sort of a telling, whether it’s a coincidence or there’s the nature of the beast,” Mozena noted. “Obviously, the intent is to, you know, sort of get that access and to be able to have a voice on the topic of economic development, whether it is broad policy or whether it is a specific deal.” 
With companies that contribute $25,000 or more to the foundation receiving a seat on the board, companies who do not make that donation do not have the same access to the governor and the Economic Development Corporation as those who do, Mozena said. 
He once again pointed to the Detroit News’ reporting that members received access to Whitmer and Economic Development Corporation CEO Quentin Messer Jr. at private events.
While 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations like the foundation are allowed to engage in political lobbying, Mozena questioned Doster’s comparison of the group to a church or the Red Cross, noting that the Center for Economic Accountability holds the same type of nonprofit status.
“We know what we are doing. We’re just trying to influence policy, trying to influence the way the world works. And that’s the kind of thing that this organization is doing, and it would be good for them to be, I think, a bit more upfront and open about it,” Mozena said.

A state law enacted in 2012 requires that when the animal isn’t protected on the federal endangered species list, a hunt must be held. DNR staff say the permanent rules will prevent a potential future hunt from being stopped by a lawsuit while tightening some of the provisions that resulted in the highly controversial 2021 wolf hunt in which hunters exceeded their 200-wolf quota in just three days. 
The wolf has been back on the federal endangered species list since a ruling by a federal judge in California in 2022. 
The rules largely govern how a hunt must be held if and when the animal is no longer considered endangered. During previous hunts, the DNR was operating under emergency rules. DNR officials have warned that a future hunt without permanent rules in place could be halted by the court system. 
The new rules include shortening the window by which hunters must register wolf kills, update wolf harvest zone boundaries, issue zone-specific tags and provide protections for wolf dens. 
They were passed unanimously by the state Natural Resources Board in October 2023 at the same time it enacted the first full rewrite of Wisconsin’s wolf management plan since 1999. The management plan stirred debate because it doesn’t specifically declare a numerical population goal. Instead, the plan divides the state into sub-regions in which DNR staff will regularly determine if the local wolf population needs to be reduced, maintained or allowed to grow. 
Farm and hunting groups, who are often fiercely opposed to the growth of Wisconsin’s wolf population because of concerns about wolf attacks on livestock, hunting dogs and pets, as well as longstanding societal and cultural fears of the animals, were largely against the new wolf management plan. Those groups pushed for the plan to include a statewide population goal of 350 wolves — which is the number stated in the 1999 plan, written when the animal was beginning its slow comeback to the state’s landscape after being extirpated in the 20th century. 
Estimates put the current Wisconsin wolf population at about 1,200 wolves, with signs that number is stabilizing. 
Environmental groups and the state’s Native American tribes were in favor of the new management method, stating it matches the best available science for how to responsibly manage animal populations and fearing that the anti-wolf crowd would see a 350-wolf population goal as a ceiling. The wolf is especially important to the Ojibwe people, who have a deep spiritual connection with the animals. 
Some Republicans in the Legislature were also opposed to the new wolf management plan and for years the implementation of the new rules had been held up by a Republican-controlled committee. A recent state Supreme Court ruling found that the committee couldn’t indefinitely prevent the passage of administrative rules, allowing the DNR to move forward. 
Also this year, Senate sporting heritage committee chair Sen. Rob Stafsholt (R-New Richmond) wrote a letter to the DNR asking if it would make changes to the rule. Stafsholt’s requested changes included setting a statewide population goal or range, increasing the harvest registration window to 12 hours, allowing harvest tags to be used anywhere statewide and eliminating all subzones, including areas set aside as a measure to protect wolf packs on tribal reservations. 
Despite those objections, the DNR has continued to move forward without any changes. 
Amy Mueller, a member of the Sierra Club of Wisconsin’s executive committee, says she feels like the rules and the management plan are the best possible compromise on an issue as polarizing as wolves, in which one side is opposed to wolf hunting in general and the other would like to see the population reduced. 
“I think this is probably the best kind of compromise we can hope for coming out of an emergency rule that had been on the books for, you know, decades — a plan from 1999 that still had a population goal hoping that we could reach 350 wolves,” she says. “I feel like these are important steps, and probably good wins where we need them. And of course, I’d like to see more, but I think being realistic, this is still worth supporting.” 
Mueller adds that she believes the DNR gets an “unproportionate amount of flak that’s misdirected” about wolf hunting because it has to follow the law and the law requires wolf hunts. 
“Unfortunately, if we want to stop wolf hunting we need to look at the makeup of the Legislature, and we need to figure out how to amend Act 169. So I think the DNR is doing what it can with a very controversial issue and having their hands tied by this law,” she says. 
Tyler Wenzlaff, director of national affairs at the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation, echoes Mueller, saying public opinion is at “two different extremes” but that the new rules and plan do seem to represent a good compromise that will help guide the state whenever a hunt happens again.
“We have two forces here that are — we’re trying to get the number as low as we can, and the tribes are at a zero quota. And so the DNR is in the middle, trying to navigate these two forces and bring us to some kind of compromise,” he says. 
“And looking at the rule,” he adds, “we support the rule and some of the changes that were made. We believe that it’s a strong compromise for both the agriculture and hunting community, but also those that want to see wolves remain on the landscape in strong numbers. And so moving forward, we believe this rule is in a good place. And really a permanent rule is necessary for Wisconsin to delist the wolves in the future and have a hunting season.” 
As the DNR works to implement the new rules, Mueller, who has a seat on the DNR’s Wolf Advisory Committee, says she’s looking forward to working on the plan’s provisions for education about wolves and their role in the ecosystem and efforts for non-lethal abatement of wolf conflicts with humans and livestock. 
Wenzlaff says the Farm Bureau is going to continue pushing for a numerical population goal to be set, even if it’s set to a level higher than the 350 wolves advocates have sought. 
“If the population were to be gradually reduced to a more socially acceptable range, it would restore balance between maintaining a healthy wolf population and protecting farmers’ livelihood, pets and livestock,” he says. Wenzlaff says farmers are willing to hash out the right number with the wolf management committee, “but unfortunately, the DNR didn’t want to have that conversation. So we’re left with broad guidelines that can be reinterpreted by the next administration, which we don’t really support.” 
For both sides of the wolf debate, the outcome of next year’s midterm elections are going to play an important role in their efforts. 
For tribes and environmental groups, the prospect of Democrats gaining control of the Legislature and holding the governor’s office presents an opportunity to repeal or change the wolf hunting law to block whatever actions the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress take. 
“There’s a lot at stake, because right or wrong, wolves are highly political,” Mueller says. “So I think [I’m] optimistic about the potential changeover in our state but cautiously optimistic. Understanding there’s a lot at stake, and it could really change things for wolves in Wisconsin, for the better or for the worse.” 
For the farm and hunting groups, the prospect of a Republican governor would mean the state government is pushing in the same direction as the Trump administration. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany, who is running for governor and seen as the frontrunner in the Republican primary, has authored legislation that would take the wolf off the federal endangered species list. 
Wenzlaff says the Farm Bureau is ready to work with either party and wants to focus on how to get wolves delisted by Congress. 
“It really comes down to the federal government and what their plans are,” he says. “What Wisconsin does really doesn’t matter until we have that delisting … There’s a lot of different ideas on what that could look like, but we’re willing to work with anybody, any stakeholders that are willing to talk about a reasonable wolf management goal.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/wolf.jpg,,,2025-10-30 06:56:18.359117

(Getty Images)On nearly every line of families’ household budgets, costs are climbing. Rents and mortgage interest rates are making it difficult to afford housing, grocery prices are making it harder to put food on the table, the average new car price just topped $50k, and utility rates are increasingly stretching families to the breaking point.
All of these financial stressors are happening in a state already struggling to meet Hoosiers’ mental and behavioral health needs and are adding to the unprecedented level of consumer debt households are carrying.
At this time when families are feeling the pain of increased costs, especially from energy prices – and when energy is increasingly vital to everyday life – the Weatherization Assistance Program can be part of the solution. Congress established the program in 1976 with a mission to decrease energy usage while ensuring health and safety for low-income people. This bipartisan program prioritizes weatherization for the elderly, disabled, and people with children and has led to over 7.2 million homes across the country receiving services. As the Director of the accredited Indiana Community Action Weatherization Training Program, I get to see firsthand how this program improves lives.
Weatherization services are available to families in both rental units and owner-occupied housing, and our weatherization professionals serve Hoosiers in all 92 counties. If furnaces or water heaters need repair, we can provide that service. If a full replacement is needed, we can install a new high-efficiency system that decreases the home’s energy use. We place smoke and carbon monoxide detectors in every home we visit. Another big part of the work is educating clients, including teaching them to change furnace filters and decrease their daily energy use, so they are equipped with the knowledge they need to maintain healthy, habitable homes for themselves and their families.
Return on investment
For every weatherization dollar spent, there is a return of $2.78 in non-energy benefits. Families also save big on energy – on average, $374 annually. We also see an additional $500 in savings per year from fewer days of missed work and lower out-of-pocket medical expenses. There is also a ripple effect of environmental benefits as those families with weatherized homes now use fewer energy resources, putting less strain on our energy grid and natural resources.
In a state where more than one in ten (13.25%) households have reported at least one utility shutoff in the prior year, these cost savings can mean the difference between having the heat on, living in the cold, or relying on unsafe heating sources. I know this firsthand. My gas bill used to be $500 a month when I was raising my son. As a single mom trying to keep the mortgage paid on her drafty 1957 house, I took cold showers and would heat water on the stove to bathe my baby. We used space heaters to stay warm because I simply could not afford to run the gas furnace. I eventually was able to weatherize my own home and bring these bills down– but had I known about this weatherization program at the time, it would have absolutely changed our lives.

Weatherization keeps people in their homes. It keeps them warm and safe. There have even been instances where families we have served told us that weatherization resulted in fewer headaches, asthma attacks, and hospitalizations. This is not surprising; studies show improvement in indoor air quality when a home is weatherized.
Like many federal programs, Weatherization’s future is uncertain. Indiana receives about $9 million per year from the Department of Energy for weatherization, along with additional funding from IIJA and LIHEAP, to serve as many people as we can.
We are thankful to Gov. Mike Braun for proclaiming October 30th as National Weatherization Day in Indiana, and I personally hope that this recognition helps raise awareness of this program for all the folks who, like me many years ago, may not even know this is an option.
While eligibility varies based on different criteria, an Indiana family of four earning up to $62,400 per year is eligible to receive weatherization services like air sealing, home insulation, and furnace repair, among others.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Lindel Fields’ path to teaching was anything but orthodox. The same could be said for his route to Oklahoma’s top education office.
Fields, of Tulsa, was a retired CareerTech leader unknown to most Oklahomans when state Superintendent Ryan Walters announced his resignation on FOX News a month ago. Walters, who had spent his time in office pursuing national media attention, said he was leaving for a nonprofit job with 33 months left in his term.
That put Gov. Kevin Stitt in the unusual position of appointing a state superintendent. He chose Fields, who is no stranger to unconventional beginnings.
A rural northeast Oklahoma native and the son of a homemaker and a welder, Fields was the first in his family to become a teacher. His first class of students were inmates at Dick Conner Correctional Center, a state prison in Hominy where he taught horticulture.
Fields, then 20, had seen the instructor job advertised in the Sunday newspaper. He was working in landscaping at the time and figured teaching was another way to put his horticulture certification to use.
“I loved it from day one,” he said in a sit-down interview with Oklahoma Voice. “I think when I interviewed I said I wanted to manage a greenhouse or a nursery later in life. But after doing it for six months, I knew this is where I’d be for my career.”

Fields, now 54, earned his horticulture certification from Tulsa Technology Center, foreshadowing his long career in other vocational training institutions. 
But, going to Tulsa Tech wasn’t his idea. His father insisted he enroll while in high school.
Until then, Fields was enjoying attending Skiatook High School, where he was part of a state-championship-winning wrestling team and was a state runner-up wrestler himself. 
His father, though, wanted him to learn a trade.
“He said, ‘You’re going to Tech because you’re going to get a skill that nobody can take from you,’” Fields recalled.
He ultimately loved the experience at Tulsa Tech, he said, and his certification led to his first teaching job at the prison in 1991. 
Fields taught for three years at Dick Conner, where he said the inmates were challenging but respectful students, before he became a director overseeing instruction at multiple prisons.
He also started night courses at Oklahoma State University’s Tulsa campus. That led to a bachelor’s degree from OSU in trade and industrial teacher education and a master’s degree from Southern Nazarene University in educational leadership.
“Certainly, in the beginning I had a lot to learn, like all new teachers, but teaching is teaching,” Fields said. “I think it comes down to connecting with people before you can impart your skill or your knowledge.”

Relationship building became a cornerstone of Fields’ philosophy as he moved into leadership in the CareerTech system. He spent a year as an assistant director at Central Technology Center in Drumright until he joined Tri County Technology Center in Bartlesville in 1999.
Fields remained at Tri County Tech for more than two decades until his retirement in 2021, starting as an assistant superintendent and advancing in 2009 to superintendent and CEO.
Under his leadership, the organization received the nation’s highest recognition for excellent management and performance, the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, and multiple “great place to work” accolades.
Bartlesville Public Schools Superintendent Chuck McCauley said he got to know Fields throughout that time as a “good person” and a “great leader” in charge of a CareerTech center that local students were eager to attend. The two have known each other since 2001 as colleagues in Bartlesville’s education sphere.
“We are never going to hear anything come out of his mouth that is going to embarrass the state of Oklahoma,” McCauley said.
When Fields was announced as the next state superintendent on Oct. 2, McCauley texted him a simple message: “Thank you.”
The Oklahoma State Department of Education had a turbulent 33 months with Walters at the helm — a period marked by significant staff losses and senior leadership turnover, heightened political rhetoric, numerous lawsuits and disarray in agency functions.
In McCauley’s words, it’s “been a trainwreck,” and the “ridiculous” rhetoric has made things difficult for public schools. Stitt tapped Fields and a team of professionals to turn the Education Department around.
“As schools, we count on that organization,” McCauley said. “I think he’s the perfect person to steady that ship.”

When announcing Fields as his appointee, Stitt said he wanted to “get politics out of that agency,” improve its transparency and refocus its leadership’s attention on education. Fields confirmed he isn’t interested in running to keep the office in the 2026 elections, which Stitt said was essential.
The task is, in part, personal for Fields. The youngest of his three children, Eva, is a fifth grader in Tulsa Public Schools. He said he shares the same hope as other Oklahoma parents that his child’s public education will prepare her for the future.
“That’s why steadying the ship matters so much right now,” he said at an introductory news conference at Eisenhower Elementary, where his daughter attends school.
Fields, whose older children are adults, pledged to focus on improving literacy rates, connecting students with future careers, and recruiting and retaining more teachers. 
So far, he’s suggested continuing a Walters-era policy of funding high-dosage tutoring for students who have fallen behind in reading. His yearly budget request, which is now in the hands of the state Legislature, would dedicate $11.9 million to that initiative. His budget proposal also includes a $42.3 million spend on teacher incentives, primarily for the existing Oklahoma Teacher Empowerment Program that offers bonuses to high-performing educators.
Fields also set out to untangle the Education Department from a web of lawsuits that sought to stymie some of Walters’ most controversial policies. 
To do so, Fields has reversed some of his predecessor’s priorities, such as retracting Walters’ order that public schools teach from the Bible. He also said he intends to rewrite Walters’ polarizing social studies standards, which mandated biblical teachings and other controversial content.

Walters purchased over 500 Bibles and collected donated copies to distribute to public schools. 
The Education Department’s new spokesperson, Tara Thompson, said she found hundreds of these Bibles in boxes stored in the agency’s communications department.
Districts are welcome to take copies from the agency’s stack if they wish, Fields said, but he won’t force schools to place a Bible in every classroom like Walters intended. He said any unused copies could be designated as surplus property or donated.
“Bibles have long been allowed in schools,” Fields said. “That hasn’t changed. So, to the extent schools at the local level want to use those in their curriculum, I support that. Our stance is simply we’re not going to fight a lawsuit to force them.”
The difference in the new administration is already evident at the state Capitol, where Education Department staff are present and available to answer lawmakers’ questions at interim studies, said Rep. Dick Lowe, R-Amber. State legislators frequently complained of having difficulty communicating with Walters’ administration.
Lowe, a former CareerTech educator who now leads the House Common Education Committee, described Fields as a “culture builder,” which is something “we are definitely needing.” Lowe witnessed Fields’ leadership first hand when visiting Tri County Tech in 2016 while serving as president of the Oklahoma Association of Career and Technical Education.
“I knew several of his staff and they said, ‘If we have something — an idea, a thought or a change — we can always go to him,’ and the culture is there that he was willing to listen and talk through programs or ideas,” Lowe said. “That culture, it doesn’t happen by accident. There has to be a catalyst, and I think he was the great catalyst.”

Since his 2021 retirement, Fields started a consulting business to advise other organizations in culture building. Creating a world-class culture comes down to building trusting relationships and strong two-way communication, he said. 
That’s why one of his top priorities as state superintendent is repairing relationships and improving the communication coming out of the Education Department, particularly with public school educators, the news media and the public at large.
The Oklahoma State Board of Education, which he leads, already appears more harmonious with Fields replacing Walters, whose relationship with the board had soured.
It remains to be seen whether the extra dose of positivity will lift Oklahoma’s poor academic performance, but Fields said he believes it will help. 
Public education, from the state board to local classrooms and communities, need “to row in the same direction” for outcomes to improve, he said. Negativity will only slow that progress.
“We’re leading children,” Fields said. “We’ve got to set the expectation. If we’re not getting the results, maybe we ought to look at how we’re leading.”

Taking the long way across Wyoming's open range can be a little reckless and a lot liberating, writes Susan Stubson.
The post Think time appeared first on WyoFile .","Earlier this month, I took a quick trip to Denver to check in on my parents and hang out with people I love. It was a whizzer of a round trip, less than 18 hours. I was on borrowed time already, but it was late fall, the roads were dry and the sky was big. So I did what every self-respecting Wyomingite would do. I took the long route. 

Opinion

I left Casper early in the morning and headed south, planning to go from Shirley Basin to Laramie, before hitting the maw that is Colorado. It’s peak visitation time in the Shirleys, where the hills are dotted with hunters. Barren ATV trailers snuggle into the shoulder, their occupants miles away, scouting and stalking their prize. There is something about watching hunters, barrel to sky, trampling through the high prairie’s shortgrass. They are in their best place, taking cover in scrub and sage, thrumming with life, hopeful of the trophy beyond the brow.
As I approach the ascent to the Basin, a force unknown presses me to the alternate road, County Rd 77. It’s the redneck route where the speed limit is a suggestion and the range is open, center line be damned. It’s a little reckless and a lot liberating. 
This is where the think time begins. First comes the hard stuff: itchy relationships, family drama, my mom sinking into her final chapter. I grate against the outrage du jour, the division swallowing every conversation, every headline. I fester over the latest cruelty from the pulpit at my beloved but former MAGA, I mean, mega-church. I wallow in the countless ways the Freedom Caucus is ruining our state. I grieve for both my faith and political communities, now indistinguishable from one another.
I pass blistered snow fences, their shards reflecting the brutality of our winters, a reminder of forces we cannot control. So many things to worry about; getting stuck in the middle of the Shirleys during a blizzard at night, no signal, no help. I worry whether my boys will find work in the state, wonder if they’ll choose to stay. I am perplexed by the Trump administration’s movement toward autocracy and our congressional delegation’s cowardice to stop it. 
Notably, of my many frets, I do not worry about sharing a bathroom or a community with someone who does not look like me, someone who, by the way, is made in the image of God. 
As I crest a hill, castled, bloomy clouds greet me where the bluffs meet the crystalline sky. I feel engulfed by and grateful for its comfort, this crappy road pulling me back from my dark thoughts. 
I look to the skies; this is where my hope comes from. Whatever is pure, lovely, admirable, that is what is before me now. 
Those of us in the faith community would tell you faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance for what we cannot see. It’s the closest we have to knowing, a simplicity for which Christians are mocked by some and admired by others. You choose.
There are so many things right in this world and our state. The lottery that brought my people to the territory of Wyoming. The luxury of raising my boys, free range, feral and surviving to tell the story. The opportunities my family has, because there are fewer of us, we had something to offer and were willing to work for it. I think of the access we have to our public servants, the product not of privilege and status, but because they are our neighbors. 
It is those relationships I cling to, the idea that we can still talk to one another, if the opposition is brave enough to meet us away from their keyboards, eyeball to eyeball. 
The succor of this road gives me clarity. Now back on the main road, I see the town of Medicine Bow in the distance. The town alights with promise, which says everything about my trippy drive and nothing about the realities of this town. I don’t care. I see opportunity in this day, hope for the next and space to figure it out. 
Back to reality, I cruise toward Laramie, where my boys and I eat burritos and discuss, among a host of trivialities, the most efficient technique for blowing milk out your nose. Perhaps the most meaningful moment of all. After lunch, we hug, tell each other we love one another, and they set off to class. 
I head to Denver, my yoke now easy and my burden is light. 

We are all going to be okay.

Oct. 29, 2025. (Courtesy of UNL AAUP chapter)LINCOLN — A new external analysis indicates the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the NU system are “financially healthy,” leaving some UNL faculty “scratching our heads” as to why administrators are again seeking to trim 1.8% from the budget.
UNL Chancellor Rodney Bennett proposed the $27.5 million in budget cuts in mid-September. The total includes $21 million to eliminate a structural budget deficit that Bennett said had “compounded over time,” plus $6.5 million to “help safeguard against repetitive budget reduction cycles.” 
Over the past five years, UNL has already weathered more than $75 million in combined cuts.
“We can’t take the budget justification on face value,” said Sarah Zuckerman, president of the UNL’s chapter of the American Association of University Professors, which sought the analysis.
However, an NU spokesperson responding to the financial analysis report said while it raises important questions, “it does not adequately reflect the complexity of university finances.”
UNL proposes $27.5 million in ‘devastating’ cuts, six program areas for elimination

Zuckerman is one of many faculty continuing to push back on the necessity of the cuts, questioning the data used to identify a host of programs proposed for elimination or merger. Among the proposed eliminations are six academic areas, including the Department of Educational Administration where Zuckerman is an associate professor.
Every campus in NU’s system is paring back budgets, and regents are set to vote on chancellor recommendations at a Dec. 5 meeting. A UNL committee of faculty, staff and students had until last week to respond to Bennett’s recommendations and offer alternatives.
UNL has declined to release the committee report before Bennett finalizes his proposal, expected by early next month.
Instruction 20.2% expenses, 69% cuts
On Wednesday, Bonnie Fox Garrity, a financial analyst for the national AAUP and a business professor at D’Youville University in Buffalo, New York, shared her October analysis of UNL and the NU system requested by Zuckerman’s AAUP chapter. She’s done similar reports for other campuses, too.

Among Garrity’s findings are that of UNL’s proposed $27.5 million in cuts, trims to “instruction” account for 69% of the proposed reductions, yet the area is 20.2% of UNL’s total expenses.
The report found that there are fewer instructional employees at UNL since 2019, a decrease of 7.8% to mid-2024, and these employees’ salaries had risen by 4.5%. The increases were not adjusted for inflation. Meanwhile, the number of non-instructional employees at UNL — which includes top administrators — had grown by 7.6%. Salaries for that group of employees grew by 31.7%.
Over the past decade, Garrity said UNL’s total expenditures grew 39.1%, which accounts for a 97% increase in athletics, which is financially independent. There also was a 53.1% increase in administrative spending and 30.3% increase in instructional spending.
“Our approach is that the financial expenditure should be focused on the core mission of the institution, on the students, on the educational experience,” Garrity said.


UNL budget reduction proposal
$7.7 million, academic program eliminations
$5.5 million, buyout program for tenured faculty (anticipated savings)
$4.61 million, reducing all state-aided budgets by about 1%
$2.69 million, executive administrative and staff “efficiencies”
$2.5 million, unfunded tuition waivers covered with “targeted philanthropy”
$2 million, department realignments/mergers
$1.1 million, administrative and staff “efficiencies” across four colleges
$850,000, reductions to the Student Life division
$550,000, fewer graduate assistantships in College of Arts and Sciences and College of Engineering


Garrity, at a news conference Wednesday announcing the report, said she doesn’t see a “financial crisis” justifying the cuts.
“Even in the announcement of the cuts it was clear that a portion of the cuts were something like a proactive move,” Garrity said. “It is my thought that the cuts could be avoided.”
‘Scratching our heads’
Zuckerman said she came to UNL nine years ago happy to be at a “real university” with resources and support. However, she said “year after year” those resources “disappeared,” with budget reductions in eight of her nine years.
The AAUP asked for a similar financial analysis in 2021, Zuckerman said, which also indicated UNL was in strong financial health. She and other faculty worry UNL’s actions will hurt the trajectory of UNL, diminish its educational offerings and hurt student opportunities.
“That analysis left us scratching our heads as to why there had been so many cuts,” Zuckerman said.
Value of ‘shared governance’
A UNL spokesperson directed the Nebraska Examiner to a spokesperson for the NU system, Cara Pesek, who said NU values the “essential” role of faculty and appreciates the engagement of Zuckerman’s AAUP and others around “shared governance.”
Pesek noted NU and its NU Foundation are financially strong in part because of “careful fiscal stewardship.” There are also many restricted or designated university funds that Pesek said can’t be used for academic salaries or instruction.
In the end, there is another challenge NU has faced for a decade: Lagging state support to the tune of over $200 million that hasn’t kept up with inflation. NU’s main “state-aided budget” consists of tax dollars and tuition. Pesek said this is “creating structural pressures that require careful ongoing management.” 
The NU Board of Regents froze tuition rates during the COVID-19 pandemic but increased tuition in each of the past three academic years, including 5% before this fall semester began.
“These campus-led efforts are part of a long-term plan to achieve and maintain fiscal balance, protect the university’s core academic mission and ensure that Nebraska’s only public university remains strong for generations to come,” Pesek said in a statement. “We deeply value the role of shared governance in achieving these goals.”

Thompson issued seven commutations in addition to 202 pardons.
The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Subsequently, with the exception of  former  Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who served from 2011 to 2019, governors have offered hundreds of pardons.
Gov. Tony Evers set a record for the number of pardons he’s offered during his seven years in office at 1,640.
However, like his fellow Democratic Gov. James Doyle, who issued 326 pardons, Evers has not issued any commutations.
Members of WISDOM, a non-profit faith-based organization that works to end mass incarceration, say Evers told them in 2023  that he would begin issuing commutations.
However, Evers has never made an official statement on his position concerning commutations. He did not respond to a request for a comment on the matter from the Wisconsin Examiner.
Evers ran for office promising to reduce Wisconsin’s prison population. After a dip during the COVID-19 pandemic, the prison population is experiencing an upswing. There were 23,495 people in prison in Wisconsin as of Sept. 26, compared with 23,292 when Evers took office on Jan. 7, 2019. Nearly every prison in the state reports a population exceeding the facility’s official capacity.
Criminal justice advocacy groups like WISDOM and Ex-incarcerated People Organizing (EXPO) of Wisconsin have noted that one way Evers could address the prison population is by offering commutations, especially for those who have served long sentences and have proven to be low risks to return to society.
In 2023, Beverly Walker of WISDOM led a team that included legal scholars to study how commutations were conducted in neighboring states and prepared a proposal for how Wisconsin could begin implementing commutations again.
“We wanted to offer [Evers’] legal team something that could be advanced and not be a hindrance that they could move forward with and be implemented,” said Walker.
Walker said the proposal had two components:

     The commutation would make the resident eligible for parole, with a parole board considering the application and making a recommendation.
     The governor could issue a direct commutation resulting in a shortened sentence, including possible release from prison.

“We said if you are uncomfortable releasing people from prison, we ask that you just make them eligible for parole,” said Walker.  “Allow them to go before the parole board, and the parole board make the decision on their eligibility based on what they see.”
“A lot of these people will never see the light of day without a commutation,” she said. “But a lot of these people have done college, gotten degrees, have been doing amazing work inside prison, and some have even been allowed to work outside of the fence and are just doing great, exhibiting great behaviour. They have transformative stories, and they have proved that they have put in the work.”
Walker’s team is asking Evers to consider commuting the sentences of people serving long-term sentences in prison whom the group identified for their good behavior and good prospects for release. In anticipation of release, Walker’s team also researched the availability of work opportunities, housing and even resources such as food pantries.
Commutation candidates
In response to a request from the  Examiner for  information on the candidates, Walker said her team decided not to release their names for fear of damaging their WISDOM’s Sherry Reames, a retired University of Wisconsin-Madison English professor and volunteer on the commutations committee, offered a general description of all the present candidates for commutation. 
According to Reames, the candidates were all convicted of a serious crime, mostly first-degree intentional homicide (either alone as party to a crime) in the 1990s when they were young men, between 20 and 22.
All the candidates were sentenced to decades in prison and will not be eligible for parole until the 2040s.
“Historically a life sentence in Wisconsin had allowed for the possibility of parole after about 15 years, a length of time which the Sentencing Project and other authorities have determined is about long enough to punish most crimes, especially by young offenders,” said Reames, “but it was the ‘tough on crime’ 1990s when our commutation candidates were convicted.”
Walker also said the candidates have used their years in prison to change their lives.
“Some of them initially had a hard time adjusting to the prison rules, but they have matured into model citizens, who lead and train other workers and earn positive reviews from staff,” said Reames. “Some have been continuously employed by Badger State Industries (now BSE) for a decade or more at a time, while others have rotated through the whole gamut of prison jobs (kitchen, laundry, custodial, library, clerk, maintenance, tier tender, etc., etc.). What they all have in common, however, are their obvious work ethic and self-discipline.”
Reames also said some candidates have obtained their high school degrees in prison and then certification as electricians, barbers, carpenters, bakers or building-service managers. 
Some have also earned college credits from four-year universities, she said.
“Several have completed Trinity International University’s whole four-year degree program in Biblical studies with a minor in psychology, laying the foundation for careers as pastors and counselors,” said Reames, “and others have completed the necessary training to assist younger prisoners as certified peer mentors and tutors.”
Some also participated in Restorative Justice and Victim Impact programs.
Post announcement
When Evers announced this summer that he wasn’t going to run for another term, advocates expressed renewed interest in pressing him for commutations before he leaves office.
Walker told the Wisconsin Examiner that her group is engaged in an ongoing dialogue with the governor’s legal staff. In September, while acknowledging gratitude for all the pardons Evers has issued, Walker also expressed frustration over the lack of action on commutations.
“I am challenging him (Evers) to uphold these things that he has said,” said Walker. “He made these campaign promises that he was going to reduce the prison population, that he was going to do all these things as it pertains to people incarcerated and that included commutations, and it has been over two years and I don’t want to be disappointed, and at what point will I be able to be proud of this man that I elected?”
At the end of October, however, Walker was more upbeat about the possibility of a commutation: “It does look promising,” she said.
Marianne Oleson, operations director for EXPO, said her advocacy group also sees a window of opportunity in Evers’ last year in office and has also discussed commutations with the governor’s office and with legislators and their aides.
“Whenever we have the opportunity, we put out eblast constantly; we put out social media, “ said Oleson.
“We have individuals who are currently incarcerated, who have been incarcerated for decades, who have zero infractions (disciplinary reports generated within prisons) that have gone over and beyond, done everything that has been asked of them to do,” she added. “ … they’re caught in this loop because of Truth in Sentencing. If they’re not going to be paroled, give them a commutation. And then there’s individuals who have life sentences that were really, quite frankly, only due to being party to a crime where these individuals were very young at the time, and their situations deserve at least to be considered and looked at.”
Truth in Sentencing is a tough-on-crime policy from the 1990s that, in  Wisconsin, requires a mandatory period of prison time be served before release, with no discretion given to a parole board that in previous years had the authority to review the status of prisoners and could authorize early release.
The reality today for those sentenced after Dec. 31, 1999, when Truth in Sentencing  took effect, is that the possibility of early release has become very remote. 
A commutation by the governor would be one legal way to shorten the confinement and extended supervision for both those sentenced before and after Truth in Sentencing was implemented.
However, in Wisconsin, there is currently no process for applying for a commutation.
There is a process to apply for a pardon through the Governor’s Pardon Advisory Board, but it requires that the sentence of confinement and extended supervision have been fulfilled, followed by a five-year period of a clear record. If one meets the condition for a pardon in Wisconsin, there is no need for a commutation because the sentence has been fully served.
“When I have approached the governor’s office to even discuss commutations, I’m automatically referred to the pardon application,” said Oleson. “You are comparing apples to oranges. A pardon eliminates the conviction, a blank slate; a commutation maintains the conviction, maintains the accountability, but says you’ve served enough time. You no longer should be serving decades or years longer. You have proven you have served enough time. You still hold the conviction, but you are not chained to the DOC.”
Other voices for commutation
The ACLU of Wisconsin is encouraging Evers to exercise his authority to offer commutations in Wisconsin.
“For decades, commutations have been vastly underutilized at the state level,” said David Gwidt, deputy communication director. “Commuting sentences has gone from a relatively routine practice historically to an exceedingly rare one since the rise of mass incarceration, as governors on both sides of the aisle are reluctant to commute sentences out of fear they will be labeled as ‘soft on crime’ for doing so. But that’s starting to change in other states.”
Governors in New Jersey, Oregon, California, Alabama, and Oklahoma, have all used their commutation authority in recent years, Gwidt added.  “Commutation is a tool that can help decarcerate our overpopulated prisons, rectify unjust, wrongful or excessively long sentences, and offer incarcerated people a pathway to redemption,” he said. “We hope Gov. Evers uses his remaining time in office as an opportunity to grant commutation and clemency to those who earn a chance at freedom.” 
Speaking as a member of a panel discussion on solitary confinement and conditions inside Wisconsin prisons,  on Sunday, Oct. 12 in Madison, state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison), a  candidate for governor, said commutations should be used for those who have been incarcerated for decades and are no longer a threat to society.
“Just in general, I think the clemency powers have been very underutilized in Wisconsin,” she said. “We have people who have been incarcerated for decades and decades. People age out of crime… and now you have people, some of whom have terminal and chronic illnesses. They are in their 60s, their 70s, their 80s, and they could easily and very safely live back with their loved ones after many decades of incarceration. And yet they are being denied this and then state taxpayers are being asked to essentially fund their incarceration and their health care.”
National discussion
In a July 13, 2025 op-ed in the New York Times, “Governors, Use Your Clemency Power,” CUNY law professor Steven Zeidman wrote:  
“President Trump is making shameless use of his constitutional clemency power, rewarding insurrectionists, cronies, campaign contributors and sundry others. But this is not the only problem. Mr. Trump’s acts of commission are paralleled by American governors’ acts of omission. Even though they control the bulk of the country’s prison population and typically have the power to grant clemency, many governors have consistently failed to exercise the power of forgiveness, to all of our detriment.”
Zeidman notes that of the two million people currently in confinement in the United States, most are in state prisons, under the authority of governors.
Zeidman, who has pursued over 100 commutations in New York and won 21, talked to the Wisconsin Examiner about the reluctance he sees in governors to exercise their constitutional authority.
Addressing the perception of being soft on crime, Zeidman said it might be easier for Republicans who have established a tough-on-crime posture to offer commutation. That might be why the last commutation in Wisconsin was under Thompson, a tough-on-crime Republican.
According to a  2023 report, “Executive Clemency Power in Wisconsin” by Jillian Slaight for the Legislative Reference Bureau, Thompson commuted the sentence of seven people serving parole, stating, “further supervision would serve no useful purpose.”
The same report found that Gov. Patrick Lucey, a Democrat who served from 1971 to 1977  issued 177 commutations, including one to a man who had failed to provide child support. Lucey stated that sending the man back to prison prevented him from working and providing support.
Democratic Gov. Gaylord Nelson, who served from 1959 to 1963, issued 27 commutations for people he considered “rehabilitated.”
Cautionary tales vs. data
Zeidman and others who advocate for commutations argue that those eligible for commutation should undergo rigorous screening, including having members of the victims’ families and the district attorney participate in the commutation process.
“There should be a real careful vetting process,” he says, adding, “I would say to Wisconsin, have a very careful vetting process, go over it with a fine-tooth comb, and at the end of the day, it’s not going to be none (who are eligible for commutation) and it’s not going to be thousands either.”
Zeidman and the advocates say reincarceration rates are low for those who have served long sentences.
The Wisconsin DOC’s data on reincarceration shows a notable decrease for those who have served five years or more in prison.
A study prepared for the New York City Council in 2023 called “Justice on Aging” also noted older residents in prison tend not to return: “Nationwide, 43.3 percent of all released individuals recidivate within three years, while only seven percent of those aged 50-64 and four percent over 65 return to prison for new convictions—the lowest rates among all incarcerated age demographics.”
 “It’s a fact, people age out of crime,” Zeidman says. 
Another argument for restoring the possibility of early release is that rewarding good behaviour with commutations motivates more good behavior in prison. 
“Give people an incentive to improve themselves and get on with their lives,” says Tom Denk, an advocate for WISDOM who has served time in prison. 
“It does seem that too many governors are thinking about clemency and commutation in particular as a political act instead of an act of mercy or grace,” says Jennifer Soble, executive director of the Illinois Prison Project, who represents clients in Illinois who have a case for early release.  “And so they are shying away from commutations on the statistically very unlikely event that a commutation could end up harming them politically, and that’s a real tragedy, because we are talking about real human beings who are living their lives in prison, many of whom are doing so under the extraordinarily unjust circumstances.”
Soble says many in Illinois prisons received long sentences, even life sentences, under older laws, but if processed today, their sentences would not be as extreme.
As an example of how laws have changed in Illinois, she says, formerly, any death resulting during a pursuit of a crime by law enforcement, such as the police chasing a suspect and firing a weapon, killing an innocent person, could result in murder charges to the suspect being pursued, even if the suspect had not directly participated in the death.
“And the only way for those folks to get out is through clemency and there’s no other path,” she says, “and so although I understand political caution, especially in these very challenging times, that caution cannot come at the expense of a person’s entire life.”
Zeidman also notes there is movement across the country to take a second look at sentences. In Wisconsin, a bill that stalled in 2024 would review the life sentences without parole for those who were convicted while they were under 18 years of age but were prosecuted as adults.
“The prison system is intentionally sort of secreted away,” says Sobel.  “Incarcerated people are not visible on purpose. And so your average person walking down the street is not thinking about, you know, is there or is there not a reasonably plausible way for an incarcerated person who shouldn’t be in prison to come home?”
Before he left office, President Joe Biden issued one of the largest commutations of all time for 2,500 people in the federal Bureau of Prisons system who had committed non-violent crimes.
“The recidivism rate of that group has been extraordinarily low,” says Sobel of the 2,500 Biden commuted. “That effort saved taxpayer dollars. It made good sense. It was a good policy decision. It was also a just and humane decision, but governors at the state level have been just pretty unwilling to follow suit, even in cases that feel very, very obvious.”

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)To comply with Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s directive to permanently extend 3% budget cuts, state agencies are planning to cut $88.7 million next fiscal year.
As part of those extended cuts for fiscal year 2027, Idaho plans to extend 4% Medicaid provider pay rate cuts for another year. The Idaho Department of Correction also plans to cut costs to house prisoners — including for contracted medical providers or reducing drug testing for inmates. 
“The governor was pretty intentional about giving agencies the flexibility to decide where we could best find those holdbacks from spending and expenditures,” Little’s budget chief, Lori Wolff, told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. 
The governor exempted K-12 public schools from the cuts, but not higher education institutions. To offset $13.3 million in permanent cuts, many Idaho public colleges and universities are cutting dozens of jobs, Idaho Education News reported. 
State agency budget requests that show the proposed cuts are publicly available on the Idaho Division of Financial Management’s website.

 Extending Medicaid provider pay cuts could save $41.6M

As a result of the budget cuts the governor ordered for this fiscal year, agencies expect to spend about $86.7 million less than they had planned, Wolff said. For next year, the state’s 2027 fiscal year, the expected cuts could grow to $88.7 million, she said. 
Idaho cuts doctor pay rates for Medicaid. More cuts could come, Health and Welfare says.

Some future cuts proposed by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare and the Idaho Department of Correction aren’t tracked like normal budget cuts. 
Their cuts — to forecasted costs to cover populations the agencies are required to cover, like Medicaid enrollees and people incarcerated in prisons — don’t show up in the Division of Financial Management’s estimate for the total cuts across state agencies, which Wolff shared with the Sun.
Extending 4% cuts to Medicaid provider pay rates accounts for almost half of the fiscal year 2027’s cuts, or $41.6 million, she said. 
In Health and Welfare’s other reductions, the agency is proposing nearly $7.4 million in cuts and cutting three jobs. The cuts are largely from trustee and benefit costs, which are costs from distributing benefits through programs like public assistance. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare declined to comment on its budget cut plans for fiscal year 2027.

The bulk of the Idaho Department of Correction’s ongoing budget cuts for fiscal year 2027 are nearly $8.5 million cuts, which include cutting 10 and a half jobs, the agency’s budget request shows. 
“Through our budget strategy, (the Idaho Department of Correction) is working internally to renegotiate or remove contracts within the agency to reach the required $10.6M reduction in (fiscal year 2026) and ongoing,” agency spokesperson Sanda Kuzeta-Cerimagic told the Sun in a statement. “A primary driver of these cost reductions has come from our Community Supervision budget unit as that area contains the most ability to absorb the holdback versus costs associated with housing residents.”
Health and Welfare and the Department of Correction are still requesting more money this fiscal year. The supplemental budget requests ask for $60 million more for Idaho Medicaid, and nearly $13.7 million for prison populations. 
 Idaho still on track for budget deficit this year, projections show

It’ll take months before any of the new proposed cuts for fiscal year 2027 are officially approved, or implemented. 
The governor, and the Legislature, will sift through those requests while they set the state’s budget during the 2026 legislative session, which starts in January. 
Idaho projected to end fiscal year with unconstitutional $56.6M state budget deficit 

Little’s order for 3% midyear budget cuts across state government — which he later made permanent — was meant to avoid a projected $80 million budget shortfall, which would violate the Idaho Constitution’s requirement for the state to maintain a balanced budget.
But the most recent state projections show Idaho is still projected to have a $56.6 million budget deficit at the end of fiscal year 2026, even with the 3% budget cuts factored in, the Idaho Capital Sun reported. 
Asked if more cuts are needed this year, Wolff, the governor’s budget chief, said state officials “try not to overreact to early revenue numbers.”
“We have seen a few trends that are not necessarily consistent with what we’ve seen in the past,” she said. “So the governor’s budget is due the first part of January, and we want to make sure we have October, November and December numbers in before we overreact to some of the revenue and how it’s being tracked and coming in. But obviously, if they are coming in lower, and if we need to reduce further, we’ll be looking at other pots of money to be able to do that.”

Heritage Action, the advocacy arm of the Heritage Foundation, held a free event Tuesday night at the Idaho State Museum on the ways in which state and local leaders can help enforce federal immigration laws. 
Speakers at the event in Boise discussed renewed efforts to create a new state crime for concealing, harboring and shielding people who are in the U.S. illegally; tracking and reporting immigration status and nationality of public school students; and tracking and sharing the immigration status of those arrested by Idaho law enforcement. 
The panelists supported use of E-Verify to verify work authorization, and the proposed state constitutional amendment to make English the official language of Idaho — which will appear on the November 2026 general election ballot. 
 
The panelists were Theo Wold, former Idaho solicitor general and current Heritage Foundation visiting fellow for law and technology, and Lora Ries, director of Heritage Foundation’s Border Security and Immigration Center and former Department of Homeland Security acting deputy chief of staff under the first Donald Trump presidential administration. 
Ries was listed as a contributor to Project 2025 — the most recent installment in a series of presidential transition documents created for conservative presidential candidates since it was given to Ronald Reagan in 1980, according to the Heritage Foundation. Trump has carried out or expressed support for many of the policies laid out in the 920-page document. 
Idaho state lawmakers Rep. Dale Hawkins, R-Fernwood, and Sen. Phil Hart, R-Kellogg, were in attendance. 
 Speakers: Idaho governor’s agreement with ICE a ‘good start’ but ‘more is needed’ 

Ries said states began passing more immigration-related bills while Joe Biden was president, as they became increasingly concerned about illegal immigration. 
“I just implore you to please stay engaged and keep trying those bills that deal with immigration where states have primary jurisdiction, primary authority,” she said, “whether that’s employment or business licenses, (or) public education.” 
Idaho State Police has sent more than 50 immigrants to facilities for deportation

Wold characterized Idaho Gov. Brad Little’s announcement of an agreement between Idaho State Police and federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, a “good start, but there are a lot of illegal aliens who are not being picked up in that effort.” 
Little has said the agreement is meant to focus on those who are convicted of dangerous crimes and complete their sentence in Idaho jails and prisons. Under the agreement, used under a program known as 247(g), ISP troopers help transport those individuals into ICE detention facilities for deportation. 
Most — but not all — of those transported thus far have state criminal convictions, according to an analysis of Idaho court data by the Idaho Capital Sun. 
 Immigration enforcement, and reporting bills likely to return to Idaho Statehouse

Wold said he worked with Hawkins during the last legislative session to write a bill to require the documentation of how many inmates in Idaho jails were undocumented.
“If the problem is small, then everyone should take credit that the problem is small,” Wold said.”If the problem is significant, you should all know that.” 
The bill, House Bill 474, was introduced late in the 2025 legislative session as a personal bill — a largely symbolic action that bypasses the legislative committee hearing process where the bills are stored in the desk of the Office of the Chief Clerk and do not advance.  
Wold also highlighted another bill he said he worked on with Hawkins, which would have required public schools to collect and report the immigration status and nationality of each student. 
House Bill 382 was introduced in March in the House Education Committee, the Sun reported, and did not return for a hearing and thus did not advance. Hawkins co-sponsored the bill with Nampa Republican Rep. Steve Tanner. 
A previous attempt to introduce the bill, made earlier that session, failed to clear the committee vote amid some members’ concerns about its constitutionality, Boise State Public Radio reported. 
Ries noted a 1982 Supreme Court ruling that public schools cannot deny admission to students based on immigration status. She said that the court didn’t rule on whether tuition could be charged to students based on immigration status. 
“It is long past time to retry that case, particularly around the tuition part,” Ries said. “… that’s something that we’ll be working on, but I implore any state to really press on this issue.”
Hawkins also introduced a bill creating a new state-level crime and penalties for concealing, harboring or shielding from detection someone who is in the U.S. illegally. The bill was introduced in February but did not receive a hearing or advance. Copies of Heritage Foundation model legislation that was largely identical to what Hawkins proposed were distributed to attendees at the event. 
 Heritage Foundation speakers oppose driver’s licenses for undocumented residents, ‘misplaced generosity’ regarding ICE removals 

Both speakers spoke about efforts, including past efforts in Idaho, to provide a limited driver’s license for undocumented residents. State Sen. Jim Guthrie, R-McCammon, most recently proposed the idea in Idaho in 2023.
FBI backtracks on denying children were zip tied in Idaho raid, saying instead no ‘young’ kids were

The idea was supported by the Idaho Dairymen’s Association, the J.R. Simplot Company, the Amalgamated Sugar Company and many other companies across the state. 
The proposed identification would not be valid for voting, purchasing a firearm, boarding an airplane or obtaining a passport. The license would also be vertical instead of horizontal.
Wold said he opposed the proposal because he thought it could lead to increased voter fraud, access to public benefits or for transportation uses such as getting on a plane. Ries argued that the effort would begin with a limited card and then be opened up to be used as a traditional driver’s license would be. 
Both speakers spoke to mass detentions and removals by ICE officials across the nation, and concerns that those detained were not getting due process. Ries said that because immigration actions are civil, rather than criminal, then immigrants aren’t entitled to a public defender. 
Under the law, people undergoing deportation efforts are entitled to a lawyer at no expense to the government.
She and Wold argued that these cases are drawn out to buy time for the person facing deportation. The Trump administration had recently been using an expedited removal process to bypass judicial review from an immigration judge. The legality of this expedited process is being evaluated in the D.C. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals, the States Newsroom reported. 
Ries and Wold argued that immigration proceedings can drag on, and people don’t always show up to their hearings, which can prolong the process. 
“We have this phrase in our house we try to teach our children, it’s called ‘misplaced generosity,’” Wold said, “And that’s … the difference between being a good Christian in giving of your treasure to someone in need, and then just being a sucker. And part of being a sucker under immigration laws, as Lora said, well they’re trying to buy more time.”
He said that the more established someone may become in their community, the more difficult it may be to remove them. 
“A lot of people who hear these stories about what ICE is doing, they feel bad,” he said. “It makes their generosity, their hackles are raised. ‘This doesn’t seem American. This doesn’t seem fair,’ but it’s very American.” 
He said that in many cases, people have had “years to come to the conclusion that they should remove themselves from the country, and they don’t.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/ Tennessee Lookout)As the funding for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) runs dry at the start of November, Marilyn Murrell expects a spike in those needing help from the Of One Accord Ministry’s Hancock County food bank.
Almost 20% of Hancock’s over 6,000 residents are enrolled in SNAP, data from July to September published by the state shows, the most of any Tennessee county.
“We don’t have much, but we’re going to try our best to have enough food,” said Murrell, who has volunteered at the food bank for almost a decade. “It’s sad that it’s come to this. This is America, and no family should be in this situation.” 
SNAP helps feed nearly 41 million Americans, including almost 700,000 Tennesseans. The program designed to ensure the country’s poorest residents don’t go hungry is running out of money because of the federal government shutdown. 
The impact of the sudden end of these funds will be felt across the state, but in Tennessee, many rural counties have the highest SNAP participation rates.
Rhonda Chafin, the Executive Director of the Second Harvest Food Bank of Northeast Tennessee, said the problem is exacerbated by the fact that the communities her organization serves have fewer grocery stores and food processing plants, which traditionally help food banks in times of need.
“We serve a population with higher food insecurity,” Chafin said. “People are giving what they can, but we’ve never faced a situation like this.”

The U.S. Congress funds SNAP, but Republicans and Democrats have been unable to reach an agreement on a short-term government funding measure, leading to the Oct. 1 shutdown and the program’s lack of funds. Democrats are pushing for any funding bill to include enhanced subsidies for Affordable Care Act Insurance, while Republicans have balked. 
The two sides don’t appear close to a deal. 
U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Williamson County, signed on to legislation that would separately fund the SNAP program without interruption as the shutdown continues. A coalition of Democratic officials in 22 states sued the Trump administration, seeking a federal judge’s order to force the release of food assistance funds. No Tennessee official is part of the suit.
In Tennessee, Gov. Bill Lee declined to take any action on the funding, saying the state isn’t able to upload the funds to SNAP recipients’ cards. At the same time, state House Democrats urged Lee to call a special session to fund the program.
Chafin said Second Harvest sent Lee a letter encouraging the state to use some of its emergency cash to help. 
“They are really putting this shutdown on the backs of the poor,” Chafin said.

Aftyn Behn, the Democratic nominee for the special election in Congressional District 7, is trying to close the electoral gap in a traditionally Republican district. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The upcoming special election in the 7th Congressional District, triggered by Mark Green’s decision to vacate the seat in the middle of his term for greener pastures, affords Tennessee Democrats a rare and precious opportunity to parlay the quirks of special election turnout into a stunning upset that would flip an otherwise safe red seat blue, further narrow the Republican Party’s razor thin majority in Congress, and stun the nation with a message of blue renaissance heading into the 2026 midterms. 
Or so Aftyn Behn, who survived a tight four-way primary contest to be the Democrat facing off against Republican Mark Van Epps on the Dec. 2 ballot for the seat, wants you to believe. So should we believe her?
The hill Behn seeks to scale is pretty steep. When Tennessee Republicans in 2022 cracked what was Nashville’s city-coherent 5th Congressional District into three pieces, they made a reliably blue district vanish by submerging thirds of Nashville into three safely red  and largely rural districts — the 5th, 6th, and 7th. And just as intended, House incumbents in 2024 kept their GOP butts in all three seats by comfortable margins of 17%, 36%, and 21%, respectively. 
The headwinds grow stiffer if CD7 is trending redder. Although it wasn’t redrawn until 2022, if you look at how the 2020 presidential race would have turned out in the 7th district’s current configuration, Joe Biden would have lost it to Donald Trump by 15 points, while in 2024 Kamala Harris lost to Trump there by 22 points. 
But pushing back against those winds is the very fact of a special election — an unexpected contest at an unusual time on the calendar. That means much lower turnout than usual, and special elections tend to draw voters who skew older, more educated, more politically active and more motivated — for instance by being out of power. That translates into a substantial Democratic edge in specials right now. Flipping a bright red district is a tall order in a regular cycle, but in a special election anything can happen. At least that’s the theory. 
If Behn’s prospects are riding on these trends, which is to say low turnout with a blue tilt, how low are we talking about? What is the number of votes she actually needs to find and turn out to pull off the upset?

That’s hard to pin down, but here are some numbers we know. In Nov. 2024 — with a presidential race at the top of the ballot — there were about 322,000 total votes cast in the congressional district.  A spirited midterm election in Nov. 2022 saw 181,000 total votes in the 7th District, 43% lower compared to votes cast in the presidential. 
In the Oct. 7 primary for this election, Democratic candidates collectively drew 31,000 votes, and Republicans just under 37,000, for a total of 68,000. Local Democrats were encouraged by this as it was  well below the 21-point win that kept the seat in GOP hands last year. 
History and data suggest that not many more will turn out for the general. A Pew Research analysis of trends in U.S. House special election turnout points to common drops of 50% or more from regular election turnout. Where I land for CD7 is on a loose expectation that Dec. 2 might see somewhere between 100,000 and 120,000 total votes cast, which would mean a win number for Behn of 50,000 to 60,000 votes. Or to put it another way, she needs to double the Democratic primary turnout, and hope that Republicans cannot double theirs. 
One key thing previous specials have shown is that turnout correlates (unsurprisingly) with campaign spending. An expensive air war may well juice interest and turnout significantly compared to a quiet ground-game focused race where most of the work is under the radar. No such air war has yet taken flight, and we are less than two weeks until the start of early voting. Behn and Van Epps each began October with not much left in the till after the primary: Behn with $20,000 and Van Epps with $54,000. Behn told supporters in an email this week that she has raised $325,000 since the primary and hopes to add another $400,000 by the start of early voting to spend $150,000 per week on TV ads. Unless he says something publicly, we won’t know where Van Epps stands financially until pre-election FEC disclosures required by Nov. 20. 
So where does the race stand as we barrel toward early voting? There have been no public non-partisan polls to date but in a call with donors and campaign insiders earlier this week Behn’s pollster John Hagner at Workbench Strategies —who also polls for New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani — discussed at some length a campaign poll conducted in mid-October. 
With a sample size of 300, and a 5.6% margin of error, their full-ballot test (with four independent candidates included) found Van Epps leading Behn by 10 points at 51-41. An email blast from the campaign Wednesday puffs it as a single-digit race, but they get there in the poll only after forcing poll respondents who chose an independent to make a D-vs.-R choice (which of course the actual ballot will not do). 
The executive summary from a recent poll conducted by Democratic Rep. Aftyn Behn’s campaign shows Democrats are motivated to vote in the Dec. 2 special election. (Screenshot)
But puffery aside, a 10-point margin in a Trump +22 district is nothing to sneeze at. Data compiled by journalists at The Downballot shows Democrats overperforming how Kamala Harris did in 2024 by an average of 12 points in special elections this year in federal and state districts held by Republicans, so the Behn poll fits in the larger scheme of things. But if we take the poll at face value, where does she find those last 10 points?
On the Behn campaign call this week her media guy, Ian Russell of Washington, DC-based Beacon Media, outlined a strategy that starts with heavy use of digital communication and field operations to activate their motivated base before early voting gets going. They plan targeted TV to reach those they believe their poll surfaced as persuadable voters, who skew older and get their news in traditional ways. Russell emphasized a messaging approach that contrasts outsiders (Behn) with insiders (Van Epps) and avoids partisan framing (I wouldn’t look for Behn to use the word “Democrat” in her paid media.) 
Van Epps did fire a bit of an opening salvo on the messaging front Wednesday with the release on social media of a video spot hitting Behn on immigration enforcement, calling her (gasp) a “woke liberal.” No word yet on whether that spot will be backed with a media buy, but when campaign videos on the socials are exactly 30 seconds in length as this one is, they have a funny way of turning up in paid media. Behn quickly responded with a fundraising email saying the attack ad shows “the GOP is scared.” 
I’ll leave that for others to assess but if I were Behn I’d be worried about Van Epps and the Republicans using paid media to define her before she can define herself. Her own polling showed her favorable ratings among those who know about her are solid and comparable to those of Van Epps, but she is much less well known. Almost half in her survey haven’t heard of her (only 21% don’t know of Van Epps, no doubt because of heavy ad spending on his behalf in his primary), and the combined total of never-heard-of-her and unfavorable-view-of-her is almost 70%. If Van Epps or surrogates start hitting Behn hard with negative messages on paid media before she starts spending she runs the risk of being framed by her opponent before she can properly define herself. Recall how this worked for Kamala Harris.  
As the underdog Behn has two adversaries: an opponent and the calendar. Playing heavily on his military service background Van Epps comes with a central-casting biography and a Trump endorsement, though he comes off as superficial and robotic — an “empty suit” is how one GOP insider put it to me in a private moment. A less-than-inspiring opponent gives Behn an opening to mount the sort of turnout-driven upset that a special election makes theoretically plausible. 
But time is not on her side. If over two-thirds of voters don’t know her or don’t like her, and her opponent is starting to throw messaging mud her way, with early voting just days away this thing needs to kick into a gear beyond phone banking the base.

Memphis school leaders are planning to expand student bus services to combat attendance drops caused by the recent surge of law and immigration enforcement in the city.
Memphis-Shelby County Schools board members voted unanimously during a meeting Tuesday to approve the resolution, which says the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard and Immigration and Customs Enforcement this month has “created a climate of heightened fear and anxiety for many students and their families leading to significant increases in absences from school.”
“This is not just about expanding a bus route; this is about protecting lives and families,” said board member Michelle McKissack.
There haven’t been any reports of ICE activity on Memphis school campuses. But MSCS educators told Chalkbeat Tennessee that parents and students are afraid of being detained by ICE while traveling to and from school buildings. That’s caused Hispanic students in particular to miss class in recent weeks or withdraw from school.
The resolution hopes to curb those attendance effects by expanding bus eligibility to students living less than two miles away from their school building. Previous district policy designated those areas as a “parent responsibility zone” for transportation.










This is not just about expanding a bus route; this is about protecting lives and families.


– Michelle McKissack, Memphis-Shelby County Schools Board


Superintendent Roderick Richmond is tasked with developing an emergency plan and budget for increased bus service in the next 30 days. It’s unclear how much the expanded program will cost or how many additional buses will be needed.
During public comment, dozens of Memphis educators and community organizers pushed the district to adopt the protective measure for students and families. Lucero Amador, an MSCS kindergarten teacher, said she sees patrol cars parked along the street when she leaves work each day.
“A couple of families have withdrawn their students and claimed they’re going back to their home countries,” she said. “The students that do attend are living in fear.”
The resolution says Richmond will also lead a study on the long-term feasibility of expanded bus routes, including cost and legal parameters.

The eating season is what many dietitians call the time between Halloween and the Super Bowl. This is the time when people gather to celebrate various holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah, Kwanza, etc.) using food as a basis for getting together.
But this year is different. The government shutdown is impacting much more than closed offices; it means thousands of government employees are furloughed or laid off and currently have no income. These families must balance the need for food and paying bills with their available savings with no paycheck or government subsidies in sight.
For people who count on government assistance, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Oct. 24 it will not use its contingency fund to feed the 42 million Americans, including 130,000 Idahoans, who reply on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP. This is a reversal from only a week earlier when it was noted Congress had already approved the funds. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare said it will refer people to local food banks for assistance after Nov. 1.
According to ProPublica, all this comes shortly after the Donald Trump administration cancelled 94 million pounds of food aid for local food banks. These cuts included $500 million in deliveries for U.S.-produced meat, eggs and produce to organizations across the country.
Therein lies the rub for many local food banks nationwide who have been overwhelmed in the past year just due to rising inflation.
Orders of more than 370,000 pounds of food for low-income Idahoans were canceled this spring

In the past three years, many local food banks have seen demand for their services increase by 100 percent or more. Some regional food relief organizations have seen walk-ins increase from 200 per month to more than 2,000 per month due to inflation and job cuts. This is before the federal shutdown and the SNAP benefits are stopped.
The strain is now maintaining the difficult task of keeping the shelves from emptying too quickly coupled with the organization’s inability to apply for federal grants to maintain operations.
Colleges and universities are not immune as campus food pantries are now in high demand. For example, at the Vandal Food Pantry at the University of Idaho, the numbers are also increasing, up to 50 visits on some days as opposed to three years ago when the pantry averaged 11 visits per day. Sandra Kelly, who runs the Vandal pantry, said it scares her to see how many students are using the pantry as their primary food source.
“Ramen, rice, soups and pasta noodles go out as fast as they come in,” Kelly said. “I have students almost in tears as they are thanking us for the food.”
To combat the incoming situation, some local food banks are appealing for help from local churches to fill shelves. In Moscow, the West Side Food Pantry run by Inland Oasis is holding an emergency food drive on Sunday, Nov. 2 in preparation for the expected influx.
Specifically, food organization officials consistently said they need canned goods, including soups, milk, vegetables and fruit. Also needed: oatmeal, boxes of mac and cheese, condiments (especially salt, pepper and ketchup), and gluten-free items.
Dairy products are also welcome; after all, one cannot mix a box of macaroni and cheese without milk and butter or margarine.
People who don’t want to shop for these items can donate money (cash, check or electronic transfer) to any food group, earmarking the money for food.
Although many Americans pride themselves as being a wealthy nation, this current situation should give them pause. After all, people should not go hungry in the wealthiest country in the world.
Food insecurity and hunger often lead to a variety of preventable long-term physical and mental health problems, especially in children and the elderly, increasing health care costs for everyone.
In the last government shutdown, it was the air traffic controllers calling in sick or holding work slowdowns which brought Congress together. This time, it is very likely to be the food emergency. People unable to access food are very likely to ring alarm bells, especially for officials with re-election campaigns next year.
Hopefully, Congress can see the hunger issue before it becomes dire for millions of Americans and open negotiations to end the shutdown.
In the meantime, if possible, please support local food banks this eating season and every season. It shows there is a quality of mercy and kindness left in America.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)News that the Trump administration intends to let Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) payments lapse this November is deeply concerning as it will cause significant harm to the roughly 42 million people across our country who rely on this vital federal program to put food on the table. This includes 1.4 million people right here in Michigan.
Not only is it unconscionable and unprecedented to suspend these monthly benefits, it’s illegal. 
The Trump administration has several tools to keep food assistance flowing — as has been done throughout every previous government shutdown — but is now illegally choosing not to use them. They are currently sitting on billions in contingency funds set aside specifically for situations like this, but have thus far refused to tap into them. These contingency funds consist of the American people’s tax dollars and the administration’s failure to use them as intended is nothing short of wasteful and reckless.
USDA won’t shuffle funds to extend SNAP during shutdown, in about-face from earlier plan

The administration also has the authority to redirect funds from other sources to keep SNAP afloat as was recently done for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program using tariff revenue. This redirection of funds to ensure WIC benefits continued to be provided in October prevented a major crisis and set an important precedent for SNAP.
The human cost of delaying SNAP benefits is very real here in Michigan. SNAP is a critical lifeline for 1 in 4 Michigan children, 1 in 10 Michigan workers and roughly 1 in 10 veterans in the state. People who are struggling to get by in every Michigan county will be harmed if action is not taken, and this delay is coming at a time when grocery prices and food insecurity are already on the rise in our Great Lakes State.
In addition to the human cost of letting payments lapse, it will also have an adverse economic impact on the more than 9,000 authorized retailers across Michigan that participate in SNAP. These retailers redeem nearly $2 billion in SNAP benefits annually.
Michiganders are already reeling from the cuts made to SNAP and Medicaid through the passage of the federal Republican megabill earlier this year. Now, the federal budget stalemate is subjecting them to even greater hardship related to food and health care access, which are indelibly linked. When families can’t afford medical care, they have to cut spending on other survival needs, like food. And, in turn, increased hunger leads to more health problems. 
With SNAP benefits paused, Michigan recipients, advocates and lawmakers determine how to respond

That is why any budget deal to reopen the federal government and resume SNAP payments must include extension of critical health premium tax credits, which keep health coverage affordable for nearly half a million Michiganders. In the meantime, any delay, reduction or complete shutdown of SNAP benefits is entirely avoidable and unacceptable. Steps should have already been taken to ensure participants are able to continue feeding their families. 
The tools are available to keep SNAP benefits in place until Congress reaches a budget deal that preserves the health insurance tax credits. Reserve funds are sitting untouched as families, children, workers, seniors and veterans across our country and state brace for their SNAP payments to be illegally stripped away this November.

The agreement signed Wednesday will allow students at Dickinson State to take pre-pharmacy classes, either online or a hybrid format. High-achieving students at Dickinson may qualify for early admission to NDSU’s doctor of pharmacy program, the only such program in the state.
The program launches in the spring semester.

Amy Werremeyer, professor and chair of the NDSU College of Pharmacy, said Dickinson State can help fill a big geographic hole of pharmacy school access. 
“Western North Dakota, Dickinson, is smack dab in the middle of that hole,” she said. 
NDSU is the closest pharmacy college to Dickinson, even though the Fargo campus is nearly 300 miles away. 
“We really see a lot of opportunity for attracting people to Dickinson to train to enter the profession of pharmacy,” said Werremeyer, who grew up in Dickinson with her parents running a pharmacy. 
President David Cook said part of NDSU’s mission as a land grant university is to serve the whole state. 
“We know there are health care needs in just about every discipline, in every area, and extending our reach out to western North Dakota and Dickinson is really quite important,” Cook said. 
There are about 30 active job postings for pharmacists across the state, with more than half of those in western North Dakota.
Scott Molander is a western North Dakota native who was named Dickinson State president in March.  
“The most important thing is we’re taking care of our students and our communities,” Molander said.

(Getty Images)The number of West Virginians who say they are caregivers has increased by more than 125,000 over the past few years, according to a data analysis by AARP and the National Alliance for Caregiving. 
About 375,000 West Virginians —  more than a quarter of adults in the state — are providing care for a family member or friend or have cared for someone in the past year, according to state specific data from “Caregiving in the United States 2025.” The report is based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau. The number of caregivers in the state was 250,000 in 2021. 
“That’s a significant increase, I think, and that’s pretty compelling that we’re seeing more and more family caregivers,” said Gaylene Miller, state director for AARP. 
Associate state director Tom Hunter said AARP would have to do a deeper look into the data to know all the reasons for the increase, but West Virginia’s population is aging. 
More people are also likely choosing to identify themselves as a caregiver because of an increasing awareness of family caregivers, Miller said. AARP has run one such campaign with the Ad Council, Hunter said.
“In the past, when we talk to family caregivers, they’re like, ‘Oh, no, I’m not a caregiver. I just take my mom to the doctor’s appointments and help her with her meals.’ And that’s caregiving,” Miller said. “But they didn’t necessarily self-identify [as a caregiver].”
West Virginia caregivers provide more than $3 billion in unpaid care each year, helping family members live independently at home, the report says. Caregiver responsibilities include bathing, meal prep, managing medications, transportation and medical tasks.
Earlier this year, AARP West Virginia backed a bill in the Legislature that would have provided a tax credit to people caring for aging spouses, parents, veterans and others. The bill would have established a nonrefundable tax credit of up to $2,000 for eligible family members 18 years of age and older for eligible expenditures incurred in their caregiving duties. The legislation was sponsored by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, but did not pass. 
Miller said that $2,000 is “modest,” considering that the average amount caregivers contribute out of pocket is around $7,200 per year for adult day care, respite care, transportation and other expenses. 
At the federal level, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., has introduced the Credit for Caring Act — aimed at providing financial relief for family caregivers. The bipartisan legislation would offer a tax credit of up to $5,000 for eligible working family caregivers to help offset caregiving expenses.
“The reason for a family caregiving tax credit is again, to provide that financial relief, because they’re already spending this money out of pocket,” Miller said. “And if we can help support them and put a little money back in their pockets, that would go a long way to keep them doing what they’re doing.”
State lawmakers have been supportive of providing funding for home and community-based services, she said. 
“At one point in time, there was an imbalance, if you will, between what we were spending on as a state, on long term care services or nursing home services, versus what we were spending on keeping folks in their homes and communities,” Miller said. “That is starting to balance out more.”
Over average, it costs about $145,000 per year for a nursing home, and keeping someone at their home or community is around $25,000 on average per year, she said.  
“So not only is home the place where folks want to stay and get care, but it’s also more cost effective for the state to provide for that care,” Miller said.

These are investments funded by a set percentage of severance taxes or royalties collected by the state. These states recognize that one day their natural resources will be exhausted. Sovereign wealth funds are long-term investments[...],"The West Virginia Legislature created the Future Fund in 2014, but the fund was terminated in 2023 after it had remained empty for nine years. (West Virginia Legislative Photography)Several states with economies dependent on natural resource extraction have had the foresight to create sovereign wealth funds. These are investments funded by a set percentage of severance taxes or royalties collected by the state. These states recognize that one day their natural resources will be exhausted. Sovereign wealth funds are long-term investments which usually have limits on the purposes for which governments can spend the money. West Virginia had a sovereign wealth fund called the Future Fund. But the Future Fund died in 2023 with a whimper, not a bang.
The largest state sovereign wealth fund is Alaska’s Permanent Fund, which has over $83 billion in assets. It is funded by at least 25% of mineral royalties collected by the state. The APF has two accounts, one permanent nonspendable account and one into which earnings from the permanent fund are deposited. The legislature makes appropriations from the earnings account, but the main use has been annual dividends to all Alaskan residents, which have reached as much as $3,200.
Another prominent sovereign wealth fund is New Mexico’s State Investment Council. It consists of four permanent funds built on royalties and taxes from natural resources, as well as income from the sale or lease of public lands and minerals. Income generated by New Mexico’s funds contribute around 15% of the state budget and saves each New Mexico household around $1,300 in taxes each year.
West Virginia’s Future Fund was created in 2014, promoted strongly by former Senate President Jeff Kessler, who introduced legislation four times before it was finally passed. In 2014, Kessler said, “We haven’t planned for the long-term future of this state. It’s always been short term, Band-Aid solutions. This will put us on the path of long-term prosperity in using the law of simple economics of supply and demand that West Virginia is sitting on what the rest of the world needs.”
Future Fund legislation stalled several times because legislators were concerned about earmarking money for future use that could be spent to address present needs. This is a legitimate concern, one that is shared by everyone who tries to save for retirement. But as a result, Future Fund deposits were hedged with so many conditions, it never got off the ground.
For example, no deposits could be made in any year when the balance in the state’s separate Rainy Day Fund was less than 13% of the general revenue fund budget. No deposits could be made in years when the governor’s general revenue fund estimate relied on transfers from the Rainy Day Fund. And any deposits made in fiscal years when midyear spending reductions or hiring freezes were required because of revenue shortfalls would be retroactively removed from the Future Fund.
A good way to think about this lack of legislative courage is to imagine the guy who promises to save for retirement — except if the electric bill is too high, or if he might need the money for something else. Guess what? He never saves for retirement.
It might be too much to expect legislators to have the kind of discipline from year to year that is necessary to build and preserve a sovereign wealth fund. This is especially true in a poor state like West Virginia that experiences boom and bust natural resource production cycles. But that is also true of many of the states which have sovereign wealth funds.
The answer is a constitutional amendment that removes from the Legislature any discretion not to make deposits into the Future Fund. For example, Alaska’s Permanent Fund was created when Article IX, Section 15 of the Alaska Constitution was ratified. North Dakota’s Legacy Fund is supported by 30% of total revenue derived from taxes on oil and gas production or extraction. This contribution is mandated by the North Dakota Constitution, Article X, Section 26.
A constitutional amendment is the way forward for West Virginia. It wouldn’t need to require a huge annual contribution, maybe only 5% of severance tax collections. But whatever contribution is selected must be guaranteed in the constitution — beyond the reach of the legislature. How the income from the Future Fund would be spent, and when spending could begin, could also be determined in the constitution.
The political value of solving this problem with a constitutional amendment is plain. An amendment adopted by the people is direct democracy in action. No legislator could be criticized for giving the people a chance to decide this important question. After a particular level of annual contribution is selected in the amendment, that contribution would no longer be a political football.
As the balance in the Future Fund grows, and its income begins to reduce the tax burden on West Virginians, the Delegates and Senators who supported putting the amendment on the ballot will have created a real legacy they can be proud of for the rest of their lives.

(Getty Images)When the Breeders’ Cup is run Friday and Saturday at Del Mar near San Diego, horses from around the world and their jockeys, trainers, owners and hangers-on will receive TV-star treatment. Some $180 million will be wagered on the races. And amid the glow and cash, the sport and business of U.S. Thoroughbred racing will hope for some reflected good will that, for one weekend at least, can eclipse its woes.
The latter  — from declining revenue, drug convictions, on-track horse deaths, shuttered racetracks, sports betting competition, unwanted weanings from casino partners and more — are widely known and mostly chronic. But just as the dwindling fan base who still pays attention to the sport seems to have made their bargain with it, a new affliction is upending any status quo and threatening to torpedo the whole slowly sinking enterprise. 
The affliction is computer-assisted wagering, known by its crow’s-call acronym CAW, a betting system that uses advanced algorithms and high-speed computing to analyze vast data sets on horses, pool sizes, odds movements and more to identify and exploit inefficiencies and then execute thousands of large-scale, automated bets in the blink of an eye. 
Expanding steadily over the past two decades, CAW is conducted by a handful of teams operating through betting platforms owned by major racetrack operators. The largest one, Elite Turf Club, is owned by The Stronach Group (Santa Anita and Gulfstream) and the New York Racing Association; another, Velocity, is a Churchill Downs, Inc. entity. Although not all numbers are transparent, computer-assisted wagering is now estimated at $3 billion to $4 billion a year, accounting for some 30% or more of annual racetrack handle. 
CAW bets usually come seconds before a race begins and often result in dramatic odds changes that aren’t reflected in pari-mutuel pools until it’s too late for average bettors — in person at the track or on an online platform — to do anything about it. At the recent Keeneland meet, for instance, a horse left the starting gate at 8-1 but won the race a minute and 12 seconds later at 3-1. That’s a 63% odds drop, and a $10 win bet expected to pay $80 paid only $30. It’s hard even for casual fans not to notice something off.            
If late odds changes are the observable face of CAW, its private underbelly — and the engine that makes it work —  is rebates it receives from tracks. The rebates are from takeout, the percentage of every wagering dollar removed from the betting pool to cover taxes and operating costs before winnings are paid. Takeout rates are regulated by state laws and vary by jurisdiction and type of wager. 
Average takeout across all wagers nationally can be estimated at 20%. CAW platforms and tracks (which often own the platforms) negotiate a much lower rate, estimated at 5% to 9%, meaning they retain at least 11% of their bet. That’s their rebate. It allows them a significant profit margin, independent of bets made. So, even when CAW players lose a bet, they can still make an overall profit after their rebate. Bet $100,000 on multiple wagers on a race and lose $10,000, let’s say, then get rebated $11,000, ending up $1,000 ahead. To quote the Gershwin song, nice work if you can get it. Retail bettors — from occasional punters to online professionals — end up netting the short end of the stick.
A pushback and reckoning seem to have arrived. Under some public pressure, tracks in California and New York have closed betting two minutes before post time on win bets (but not on multi-horse wagers like exactas, trifectas, superfectas and pick 3,4 5 and 6s), theoretically giving average players a chance to cancel or modify their wagers. Kentucky tracks haven’t followed suit. And, even though it will be held at Del Mar, the Breeders’ Cup won’t either.
For many retail bettors, the two minute cutoff is too little and too late, and they’re quitting the game. Most prominently, Dave Portnoy, founder of the digital media company Barstool Sports and a well-known horse racing bettor, posted on X (where he has 3.7 million followers) that “CAWs have basically forced me to stop betting horses except the huge days.”  
Beyond these reactions, a class-action lawsuit was filed last week in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against The Stronach Group, the New York Racing Association, Churchill Downs and associated entities alleging they colluded via their CAW platforms to disadvantage everyday bettors in a rigged system that favors the wealthy. 
According to the suit, filed by the firm Hagens Berman, artificial intelligence and other advances in technology have systematically led to the unfair transfer of billions of dollars to a small group of inside bettors and the operators of racetracks and betting platforms. The suit includes claims of unjust enrichment, conspiracy, conversion and violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). It seeks compensatory and treble damages for the plaintiffs as allowed under RICO, as well as restitution for alleged widespread economic losses suffered by retail bettors in CAW-impacted wagering pools.
If successful, the lawsuit would likely radically change the way the U.S. racing industry operates. But it could take years to resolve. As it works its way through court, controversies over computer-assisted wagering will intensify. Calls for legislation to regulate it or tracks to limit it more effectively as well as cries to “Let the market take care of it” or “Leave it alone” are already being heard and more like them will come. 
CAW has put horse racing between a rock and a hard place. Unlike Cracker Barrel and its logo, the sport can’t bring a glorified old familiar back. That’s dead and buried. Few remember Secretariat any more, let alone Citation or Man o’War. 
For decades since its Hollywood heroes, the industry has been desperate for new fans and more revenue. In theory, CAW seemed to offer an AI future of techies and secure cash flow. But soon enough its reality started to seem like insider trading, impacting its traditional bettors and average fans and driving them away. So, with no solution in sight, racing’s desperation — and its need for some kind of Solomon — seems destined to continue, CAW or no CAW.

Right now, nearly two million Pennsylvanians who rely on the  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program face genuine and chilling uncertainty over how they will feed themselves and their families next month. 
This unprecedented dilemma also threatens the economic foundation that underpins this vital program – the businesses  that make, transport, and sell the food we all eat, no matter how it is purchased. 
From convenience stores and independent grocers to major supermarkets and their  distributors, Pennsylvania Food Merchants Association (PFMA) members are the backbone of the SNAP delivery system. 
On behalf of  our membership, we are sounding a clear alarm to our elected leaders in Congress: Failure to resolve the lapse in federal funding and delaying SNAP benefits for November will  directly and severely impact food businesses and their customers, including, but not only, the millions of Pennsylvanians who rely on SNAP.

SNAP is an essential economic driver, channeling more than $350 million in federal funds  through Pennsylvania’s food retailers every month. This money supports Pennsylvania farms, pays the wages of thousands of grocery workers, and keeps the entire supply chain moving. 
It is an enormously popular, and successful, public-private partnership. 
The October 10th United States Department of Agriculture memo directing state agencies to “hold their November issuance files and delay transmission to State EBT vendors” threatens to disrupt this vital system. If it comes to pass, this delay would create immediate, critical challenges for the businesses  processing millions of EBT transactions and serving SNAP customers. 
Supply Chain Shock and Inventory Issues
 Our member businesses rely on a predictable schedule of SNAP disbursement to accurately forecast demand, schedule staff, and order  perishable inventory like fresh produce, dairy, and meat. A delayed, unscheduled, and unpredictable influx of shoppers arriving on arbitrary dates would make demand forecasting impossible. 
Not knowing when SNAP recipients will have the funds to shop, retailers will struggle to manage potential supply shortages, food waste, and the specter of  bare shelves at a time of year when store resources and staff are already stretched to breaking.

Cash Flow, Personnel Strain, and Customer Confusion
 Sudden changes to the predictable purchasing cycle will severely strain the cash flow of many small and independent food retailers. Our frontline grocery workers — who are already managing high stress customer environments — will be forced to navigate mass customer confusion, chaotic checkout lines, and potential conflict as they deal with families whose benefits haven’t arrived and who may not understand why. In-store impacts will be felt by SNAP and non-SNAP customers alike.  
What we are seeing in Washington, D.C. is not just a budget squabble. It is a direct threat to  food security and economic stability in Pennsylvania. 
We are proud to feed the people of the commonwealth, but this potential disruption profoundly challenges our ability to do so  efficiently and reliably. 
As we enter the holiday season — for all its many associations, also the busiest time of year for our industry — political uncertainty threatens to create a two-pronged food and  economic crisis in Pennsylvania. 
We must not let it.

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)A Fairfax County Public Schools teacher announced Wednesday she is suing the school division after nearly 20 years of service for allegedly retaliating and defaming her after she said staff at her high school paid for students’ abortions without their parents’ consent.
Fairfax County Public Schools lawyers’ internal probe refutes school-assisted abortion allegations

Zenaida Perez, the FCPS teacher, was placed on leave by the division after her claims about school-facilitated abortions for minors that she said occurred over three years. FCPS has denied the claims and an outside firm that investigated the case concluded Perez’ allegations were “likely untrue.”
Virginia law requires minors to obtain either parental consent or a successful court petition to undergo the procedure.
Dozens of supporters gathered outside the Fairfax County Courthouse on Wednesday morning to show their support for Perez. The press conference also featured speakers from Americans United for Life, a conservative organization that Perez retained for legal counsel, and others sharing information about pregnancy centers, emphasizing informed consent and alternatives to abortion.
“I feel hopeful that justice will be served,” Perez said, adding that she has faith in her lawyers and God that the truth will prevail. 
“I felt retaliated against, I was absolutely slandered, and they told a lot of things in the media that were absolutely not true,” she added. “We will come out with the truth, and we will prevail with honesty.”
Fairfax County Public Schools did not respond immediately to requests for comment. 
 Teacher’s claims

Fairfax’s school system is facing four accusations that it violated the U.S. Constitution and Virginia whistleblower protection laws by retaliating against Perez. Perez also said the system made false claims against her and violated her free speech protections.
“We filed this lawsuit in order to put a stop to all of that and to force Fairfax Public Schools to give Mrs. Perez what hasn’t been given to her throughout this whole process — respect and due process,” Steven Aden, chief legal officer and general counsel with AUL, said on Wednesday. “Our judicial system is the foundation of civil society because it requires all sides to an argument to make the case under oath before a jury of their peers, not hiding behind high-powered lawyers in the press.”
Monique Miles, co-attorney representing Perez, added that it “saddens” her to see her client on administrative leave for doing her job.
“We had to put to rest this claim that she had somehow done something unlawful or misled people that is absolutely false,” Miles said.

Perez is seeking a trial by jury and $1 million for all compensatory damages. No trial date has been set. 
On Oct. 20, Perez joined a webinar hosted by Americans United For Life to talk about the allegations from Fairfax. 
She explained how a student who’d allegedly previously obtained an abortion approached her in May 2022 regarding another student who was absent after having a child. The first student, Perez said, expressed how the other student could have tapped a school social worker for help. 
Perez described spending the summer pondering the situation before reconnecting with the student who’d allegedly had an abortion in the fall. Perez said the student outlined how she’d obtained the procedure with the assistance of a school social worker. 
Perez also addressed a handwritten letter purportedly from the student that was featured in an August article in a conservative blog that first reported the allegations against the school. 
A recent legal review, lawyers for Fairfax County Public Schools noted similarities in the handwriting of the letter and Perez’ own handwriting. 
In the webinar with Americans United For Life, Perez admitted that she physically wrote the letter, but asserts it was informed by the student who’d had the abortion. 
“She didn’t write it, she was absolutely not well with the writing — she cannot write in English or in Spanish — and she told me she ‘only had 15 minutes for my break,’” Perez said of the student, who was working at a restaurant in Chantilly at the time they spoke about the allegations. 
Meanwhile, FCPS’s legal probe claims to have contacted the other student who had a baby as recently as Oct. 9 of this year and who said they felt supported by the school system in their decision and was not coerced to get an abortion.. 
Amid Perez’ lawsuit and FCPS’ probe, a state police investigation is still underway to look into matters further.
The U.S. Department of Education is also investigating the claims to determine if federal funds were misused. A Virginia State Police investigation into the allegations against the school system, begun at the behest of Gov. Glenn Youngkin, is ongoing.

(Photos courtesy of campaigns)One of Virginia’s most competitive House of Delegates races is heating up in Chesapeake,  where two sharply contrasting candidates are pitching plans to ease the cost of living and strengthen public education.
The race for Virginia’s House District 89 — represented by Del. Baxter Ennis, R-Chesapeake, who announced in February that he wouldn’t seek reelection — is now wide open.


Key races: 2025 Virginia House of Delegates elections
• Data centers dominate House District 21 race between Thomas and Gorham
• House District 82 rematch could help decide control of Virginia’s legislature
• In House District 22, candidates tackle data centers, rising costs in race for legislature’s future
• Familiar foes, new stakes: Coyner–Dougherty rematch tests Va.’s suburban swing in House District 75
• Democrat Mehta aims to unseat Republican Earley in Chesterfield-based House District 73 race
• Growth, tourism and turnout collide in House District 71 rematch
• House District 97, anchored in Virginia Beach, could determine party majority in House of Delegates
• Big money, tight margins define Obenshain–Franklin rematch in House District 41


The district generally leans Democratic but has swung between parties in recent years. It backed Donald Trump in 2016, Glenn Youngkin in 2021 and Kamala Harris by just under three points in 2024. The Virginia Public Access Project ranks it among the 10 most competitive House contests this year.
Democrat Kacey Carnegie, an attorney, and Republican Mike Lamonea, a Chesapeake school board member and former Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, are offering voters starkly different ideas for tackling rising costs and improving schools. 
Carnegie has outraised her opponent by more than $700,000, pulling in over $1.7 million in campaign contributions, according to VPAP. Much of that came from the House Democratic Caucus, which has poured $850,000 into her campaign since late August. As of Oct. 23, Lamonea has raised just over $1 million.
 Top issues

Both candidates have made affordability central to their platforms.
In a recent phone interview with the Virginia Mercury, Carnegie said raising the minimum wage would help ease financial pressures for Virginians. 
“Individuals who are working 40 hours a week, making minimum wage, do not make enough to survive,” Carnegie said.
She said she supports a “tiered system” to raise the minimum wage and pointed to climbing  home and grocery costs as major burdens for 89th district voters.
Home and rent prices in the Virginia Beach-Chesapeake-Norfolk area, which generally track the national average, have risen steadily since 2015. 
“If someone wants to live in Chesapeake, if someone wants to live in Suffolk, they should have that option.” Carnegie said. “They shouldn’t be priced out.”
Lamonea’s campaign, which responded to questions from The Mercury via email, said affordability is the top issue for voters heading into Election Day.
“Families are struggling to make ends meet while Richmond politicians keep adding more taxes and regulations,” Lamonea wrote. “We need to make Virginia more affordable — by permanently eliminating the grocery and car taxes, supporting small businesses, and keeping energy costs low.”
He said cutting grocery and car taxes in particular would deliver quick relief. 
“Working families are stretched thin, and those taxes hit everyone,” Lamonea wrote. “Cutting them would make an immediate difference in people’s lives and show that Virginia is serious about lowering costs and helping families thrive.”
 Education platforms

Both candidates call education policy a top priority.
Lamonea highlighted his record on the school board, where he said he helped raise teacher and staff pay, improve school safety and expand technical education programs. In March 2024, the board approved a budget increasing pay for teachers and administrative staff. 
“Every student deserves a path to success — whether that’s college, a trade, or military service — and I’ll keep fighting to make that a reality across Virginia,” Lamonea wrote.
Carnegie said she would focus on reducing class sizes and boosting teacher pay, listing education investment as one of her top campaign priorities.
“A strong future starts with strong public schools,” her campaign website reads. 
Lamonea’s website says he would “ensure parents have a voice in their children’s education, protect classrooms from political agendas, and expand mental health resources for students.” 
The stance echoes Youngkin‘s 2021 campaign message that parents should have greater influence over what their children are taught. 
 The candidates’ backgrounds

Carnegie said that she draws inspiration from former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg — whose dissent collar she has tattooed on her arm — “along with the number nine on top of it.” 
She said Ginsburg inspired her to become an attorney and “give back to the community.” Her office, she added, is covered with Ginsburg memorabilia. 
“Everything from a bobblehead to wine bottles to quotes, because she was such a pioneer in protecting individuals’ rights and making sure that people were heard and not forgotten,” she said. “That’s really what my campaign is focused on.”
Lamonea’s path to politics has been different. Before joining the school board, he worked as a special agent for ICE and later with Homeland Security investigations to “get narcotics, human traffickers, child predators, and violent gangs off our streets.”
“I believe my background is not only a benefit to my campaign — it is more importantly a benefit to our community,” Lamonea wrote.
Virginia voters will go to the polls on Tuesday, Nov. 4, to choose a governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and all 100 members of the House of Delegates. The 89th district race is one of several that could decide control of the chamber. 
Democrats currently hold a narrow 51-48 majority. A Democratic pick-up in the 89th District would expand that edge, while a Republican hold would strengthen the GOP’s push to retake the chamber it lost in 2023.

(Photo courtesy of the Chesapeake Bay Program)Menhaden fisheries along the East Coast will have to reduce how many of the forage fish they catch in 2026 by 20%, or a limit of 186,840 metric tons, after the Atlantic Menhaden Management Board voted this week to make the change to help striped bass populations and other species who depend on the small oily fish.
The Virginia-based reduction fishery Ocean Harvesters, which contracts with Omega Protein,  will still be subject to the special cap of 51,000 metric tons of menhaden within the Chesapeake Bay’s limits. Though there are also efforts to try and lower the Bay cap, the amount the fishery  can catch in the open ocean will be impacted by the new limit starting next year. 
“There will likely be some operational adjustments required at our Reedville facility to comply with a 20% harvest reduction; we are evaluating the extent of those changes now,” Ocean Harvesters said in a statement. “Looking ahead, pushing harsher cuts in 2027 and beyond—particularly in the absence of new data— would impose needless harm on working families and a 150-year-old fishery, without ecological justification under the Ecological Reference Point risk analyses.”
Ahead of the meeting, the Menhaden Fisheries Coalition said they would agree to precautionary reductions of no more than 15%. They said that amount would guard against overfishing and protect the incomes of workers at the fisheries.
This move comes two years after the board voted to allow an increase in menhaden harvest caps based on stock assessments at the time. The 2025 assessment shows that menhaden are not over-fished but are below thresholds of producing offspring to maintain the population. 
Environmental groups like the Chesapeake Bay Foundation have been using the striped bass and osprey populations, which have shown signs of concerning decline, as a proxy for the need to bolster menhaden numbers. Fishermen have reported menhaden entering the Bay in the summer, which is months behind their usual schedule.
Representatives from up and down the East Coast have their own concerns about the forage fish population impacting other seafood species that are economic drivers for their states. 
Maryland has been pushing back against Ocean Harvesters, claiming the sole reduction fishery in the Bay is harming the state’s seafood and bait industry.
Robert Lafrance, a board member from Connecticut, said during the meeting that the group needs “to continue to put pressure on making certain that the science moves forward, and making certain that we have the availability for the species where they need to be again — Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, that’s where the lobster fishery is.”
The initial proposal for the cap reductions was set at 50%, which fishermen and advocates for the menhaden fisheries said would devastate the industry. A second proposal would have ramped up the reductions over three years, starting at 20% in 2026 and gradually increasing it up to the 50% limit that some studies suggest is needed to protect the striped bass population.
“Economically, it’s going to cost jobs, it’s going to cause an issue,” said Joe Cimino, a board member from New Jersey. “With striped bass, we talked about socioeconomic all the time, and this one, we don’t, and that’s kind of strange, considering it has the best stock assessment of any species we deal with. So why is this not also an equally important element to this?”
The final decision was to opt for the 20% next year, which is more than the fisheries wanted and significantly less than conservation groups wanted, and to revisit the cap again at the next annual meeting before the 2027 numbers are determined. 
“Our understanding of menhaden as a species and of the ecosystem suggests that we need to take a reduction, not just a small reduction, a significant reduction,” said Caitlin Craig, with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. “So I would encourage this board to think, just as we were confident in increasing the total allowable catch when the science says we should, that we need to be as willing to take reductions when the science indicates that that’s warranted as well.”
The Chesapeake Bay Foundation, which has been a lead driver for restricting the reduction fishing of menhaden in the Bay, said there is still not enough research into the fish population inside the estuary where they are seeing crab and osprey populations dwindle.
“This is nothing more than a performative nod to ecosystem-based fisheries management. The ASMFC failed to fully respond to the science, jeopardizing the ability of menhaden to fulfill their role in the food chain,” Will Poston, CBF forage campaign manager, said. “This lack of meaningful action is not only risky for menhaden, but also the many fisheries and small businesses that depend on a thriving ecosystem.”
The Science Center for Marine Fisheries recently funded a study to investigate the type of research that is needed to understand the scope of the health of menhaden schools in the Bay and if further caps would be needed. There have been multiple efforts in the General Assembly to fund that kind of research that have failed to pass.
“New Chesapeake Bay–specific limits are not warranted,” Ocean Harvesters said in a statement. “With SCEMFIS now funding a Chesapeake Bay research roadmap—led by scientists from UMCES’s Chesapeake Biological Laboratory, VIMS, and NOAA—to define what a scientifically defensible, ecologically meaningful Bay cap should look like, the Board should await those results before adding new measures.”

Georgia will be conducting a survey of the critters and studying devices meant to protect them. Photo by Timothy RussellThe Georgia Board of Natural Resources has rejected a petition aimed at protecting diamondback terrapins from crab nets, but state wildlife experts will perform a statewide terrapin survey and study methods for protecting the unique turtle.
Terrapins live in brackish tidal creeks along the Atlantic coast as far north as Cape Cod in Massachusetts and along the Gulf Coast from Florida all the way into Texas.
Terrapins are especially vulnerable to wandering into crab pots and drowning in a matter of hours when they can’t surface to breathe. The gregarious little turtles also tend to follow one another into the pots, increasing the death toll, and according to the petition, two derelict crab pots in one Georgia tidal marsh were found to contain 133 terrapin carcasses.
And because terrapins take a long time to reach maturity and typically only lay one or two eggs at a time, the death of a small number of adults can have a major impact on their population growth.
Georgia has implemented some policies to protect terrapins from poaching and vehicle collisions, including banning commercial harvesting and placing terrapin crossing signs on roads during nesting season. But researchers say crab pots still have the capacity to decimate their numbers.
“They are one of Georgia’s most gorgeous species,” said Will Harlan, regional director and senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity, which authored the petition. “They are beautiful turtles with concentric square rings on their shells, and they are just jaw-droppingly beautiful. They’re a species of great southern pride and Georgia pride. Sadly, they’ve declined by 75% since 1975. Many populations along the Georgia coast have been wiped out completely.”
The center and other advocacy groups are calling on the state to mandate something called bycatch reduction devices in crab pots in state waters less than 200 feet in width or within 100 feet of a river or sound shoreline, where terrapins are found.
Bycatch reduction devices are small rectangular or oval portals that attach to the netting of a crab pot. They are small enough that crabs can get in but turtles can’t. Several states including Maryland and North Carolina require the devices to varying extents to protect the turtles, according to the petition.
The board rejected the petition at its Tuesday meeting after DNR Wildlife Conservation Chief Matt Elliott said the devices are “the solution long term to keeping terrapins out of crab traps,” but recommended against mandating them at the moment.
“While we share an interest with the petitioner in addressing this issue – the terrapin is a high priority species in our state wildlife action plan and dealing with this issue is something that we identified in that plan – we can’t amend our current regulations now due to several critical information gaps that we have,” he said.
One of those gaps is data on terrapin population and trends. According to DNR, a 2007-2008 estimate showed a pattern of declining terrapin population associated with commercial crabbing, but the study was not precise enough to track changes over time.
Elliott said DNR will use a new survey methodology the department says will allow for population monitoring over a wide scale starting next year.
“We would like to take a more fine scale, targeted approach to this, rather than a full approach of regulations,” he said. “And to do that, we really need updated data on where the terrapins are and where they’re coming into contact with the crab traps, so we are going to begin this spring with using the new census technique to help us better inform how many terrapins we have out there.”
Elliott said the department’s study will also include an economic assessment on the potential impact on crabbers, including the costs of adding the devices and potential catch reductions, as well as an evaluation on the effectiveness of different bycatch reduction configurations, including new designs not yet tested in Georgia waters.
Details about the study, including the cost, were not immediately available.
Speaking after the board voted down the petition, Harlan said the decision was disappointing, but he’s encouraged by the department’s commitment to study the critters and the devices intended to protect them.
“We’re really excited about their commitment to conduct coast-wide studies of diamondback terrapins,” he said. “That’s needed to happen for a long time, and it’s promising that they’ve now committed the funding and the resources to make that happen. That’ll give us the data we need to really understand what’s happening to diamondback terrapins. We know from studies throughout Georgia that they’re declining everywhere they’re surveyed, but this will be the first comprehensive statewide study, so that’s really promising.”
Harlan said he’s hopeful the examination of the bycatch devices will mean the board will consider mandating them in the future.

(Photo by Eric Thayer/Getty Images)In the absence of much federal action, states have enacted dozens of laws this year to lower prescription drug costs for their residents — and many more are considering following suit.
States cannot lower drug prices directly, but they can go after different parts of the drug supply chain to try to lower patients’ out-of-pocket costs and reduce excessive spending in state-run health plans.
Nearly two-thirds of the new state laws are aimed at pharmacy benefit managers — the drug middlemen who negotiate deals among the manufacturers that make the drugs, the insurers that allow the drugs to be prescribed, and the pharmacies that sell them.
Several states are considering drug affordability review boards. Others have passed laws to hold manufacturers and PBMs to higher transparency standards.
“So a lot of states went into looking at drug costs — trying to understand and follow the dollar,” said Maureen Hensley-Quinn, a senior program director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, a nonpartisan group that works on health policy issues. “Is it the price that manufacturers are setting? Is it the supply chain where there are different entities?”
Advocates of these laws say it’s up to states to take the lead as the federal government lags in compelling drug companies and insurers to lower prices for patients. But critics say some state interventions could lead to local pharmacies shuttering and may stifle innovation in the pharmaceutical industry, leading to fewer new drugs.
Laws targeting PBMs are wide-ranging in scope, requiring PBMs to pass discounts on to consumers or to be more transparent in their drug purchasing activities. Some states have created drug affordability review boards to assess manufacturers’ prices. Some laws aim to place copay caps on critical medications like insulin.
So far this year, at least 31 states have enacted nearly 70 laws designed to lower drug costs, according to a state drug affordability law tracker from the National Academy for State Health Policy.
To lower prescription drug costs, states head to the courthouse

“States have no leverage, really, to put pressure on manufacturers to lower their prices, and that’s why I think most of the legislation at the state level has been on the intermediaries, the supply chain,” said Geoffrey Joyce, chair of the Department of Pharmaceutical and Health Economics at the University of Southern California.
Those interventions can go a long way in trying to reduce patients’ expenses, he said.
“The concern [is] about, well, ‘States really can’t lower drug prices, per se,’ but they can,” Joyce said. “I think there’s been evidence.”
California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in October signed legislation to cap the cost of insulin for people covered by state-regulated health plans, including the state’s Affordable Care Act marketplace, private health plans and its Medicaid program. The state also plans to start offering its own generic version of insulin, costing just $11 a pen, in January.
Colorado’s drug affordability review board capped the cost of a widely used rheumatoid arthritis medication.
And Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore signed a law in May to expand the authority of the state’s drug affordability review board to lower prescription drug prices for all residents, not just state employees.
Pointing fingers
The federal government has taken some steps to lower prescription drug prices. The Inflation Reduction Act under the Biden administration created annual caps on out-of-pocket drug costs and capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for patients with Medicare, the health care program that primarily serves people over 65. The law also gave the federal government more power to negotiate drug prices for Medicare patients.
President Donald Trump has promised to slash drug prices by percentages that some experts say are mathematically impossible. He threatened tariffs on manufacturers that import their drugs if they didn’t lower their prices, which led to a deal with biopharmaceutical company Pfizer. And in May, he signed an executive order designed to ensure the U.S. government can secure drugs at prices on par with other nations.
Kush Desai, a spokesperson for the White House, said in a statement that the Trump administration’s website, TrumpRx, which hasn’t yet launched, will lower drug costs by allowing people to purchase drugs directly from the manufacturer.
But some states are going further.
In October, Colorado became the first state to cap the price of a prescription drug for all consumers. Starting in 2027, new insurers and patients will pay no more than $31,000 a year for Enbrel, a drug that treats rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases — a sharp decrease from the average insurance payment of $53,049 in 2023. Nearly 2,600 Coloradans used Enbrel, in 2022, according to state research.
States want to lower drug prices. A federal law stands in their way.

Colorado Democratic state Sen. Julie Gonzales, who sponsored the bill creating the state’s drug oversight board, said states have to deal with a lot of competing interests in the drug supply chain. When it comes to establishing who is setting high drug prices, she said, “everyone is pointing the finger at everyone else.”
It took four years from the law’s passage to set up the board and approve its first payment limit because there were so many special interests involved, she said. “We had to overcome a tremendous amount of angst and fear.”
Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon and Washington also have prescription drug affordability boards. New Hampshire created a board but dissolved it in July because of budget cuts.
In California, Newsom signed a bill this year to cap the consumer copay of insulin at $35 per month for all state-regulated health plans, after vetoing similar legislation in 2023. More than two dozen other states had already opted to cap insulin for state health plans. He also signed a PBM regulation bill that, among other provisions, requires pharmacy benefit managers to pass drug discounts on to payers and patients.
California Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener, who sponsored the PBM and insulin bills, said states have the power to lower patients’ out-of-pocket expenses, even if they can’t force manufacturers to lower drug prices.
“The federal government right now is a disaster zone when it comes to health care,” Wiener said. “That’s why it’s more important for the states to step up.”
Other states such as Illinois, Iowa and Louisiana enacted similar PBM laws this year, according to the National Academy for State Health Policy.
A complicated system
The system for developing, selling and distributing prescription drugs is complex.
Pharmaceutical companies determine the initial costs of drugs, but are often accused of setting prices too high. Pharmacy benefit managers say they exist to negotiate lower drug prices, but are often accused of pocketing discounts or engaging in predatory practices. Meanwhile, health insurers pay for the drugs and decide what copays patients may end up with, and are often accused of not reimbursing enough.
Experts note that three pharmacy benefit management companies — CVS Health, Cigna and United Health Group — dominate the PBM industry, which adds to concerns about their market power.
“There’s also some truth to the fact that this industry is very concentrated, and there’s not a lot of transparency around how much money they’re making and how they make their money, and if that’s being shared back with plans and with consumers,” said Pragya Kakani, a health economist specializing in drug policy at the Weill Cornell Medical College.
The pharmaceutical industry typically opposes drug affordability boards.
Independent pharmacies know their communities. But many are struggling to stay open.

In Colorado, Amgen Inc., the manufacturer of Enbrel, sued the state in 2024 over its drug affordability review board, alleging that a price cap would cause economic harm to the company. A federal district court dismissed the challenge in March.
“Instead of fixing the root causes of patient affordability concerns, the board has rushed into a reckless experiment,” Reid Porter, senior director of state public affairs for PhRMA, a group that represents pharmaceutical companies, wrote in an email statement in regard to the board’s upper payment limit. “Colorado is risking patient access and jeopardizing the development of new medicines.”
Porter argued that PBMs and health insurers, not drugmakers, drive high costs.
But PBMs say their negotiations lower costs.
“Big Pharma sets the price — and the price is the problem when it comes to Americans facing difficulty affording their prescription drugs,” Mike Baldyga, a spokesperson for the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, which represents pharmacy benefit managers, wrote in an email statement. “PBMs are the only entity in the drug supply chain that lower prescription drug costs on behalf of patients, and there is no correlation between the rebates they negotiate and list prices.”
Hensley-Quinn, of the National Academy for State Health Policy, noted the challenge of making drugs affordable and accessible.
“There is no silver bullet for lowering drug costs,” Hensley-Quinn said. “You have to balance being able to innovate and making sure that drugs are affordable so that what you have just created, which is life-changing, actually gets to the people that need it.”
But this challenge is in some ways expected and more evidence that states must take action, said Priya Telang, communications manager at the nonprofit advocacy group Colorado Consumer Health Initiative.
“Manufacturers point the finger at PBMs, and PBMs point the finger at insurers. And so it’s really hard to get a sense of who the actual bad players are all at the same time,” she said.
“And so that’s why it’s critical for affordability boards to exist, because they get to see the data, they get to see behind closed doors what the root causes are and really work to bring affordability to consumers.”
Drug affordability boards
When Mary Fowler Simmons, 54, was diagnosed with an advanced cancer three years ago, she had to give up her steady job as a state government worker in Virginia to go through months of expensive and painful treatment. Fowler Simmons survived and is cancer-free today, but is still reeling financially.
Fowler Simmons told Stateline that after being saddled with a hospital bill totaling over $323,000 and depleting her savings, she and her husband continue to pay around $300 a month — after insurance — for prescription medications to maintain her health.










I need them to actually consider what they are doing to the American people and just have affordable prescription drugs available.


– Mary Fowler Simmons, a cancer survivor


Fowler Simmons, who also has Type 2 diabetes, says she wants her state and federal lawmakers to recognize that some Americans are having to choose between paying for their next meal or their necessary prescription drugs.
“They need to have more compassion for people. We’re not in the position that we are making millions, that we can afford this. We’re working-class people,” Fowler Simmons said. “I need them to actually consider what they are doing to the American people and just have affordable prescription drugs available.”
Otto Wachsmann, a Republican in the Virginia House of Delegates and a pharmacist, said that he doesn’t think there’s enough evidence yet that prescription drug affordability review boards work.
He said if states set upper payment limits on drugs, that doesn’t mean a pharmaceutical company would necessarily lower the cost. Rather, he says, pharmacies may just get reimbursed even less than the cost of the drug. This year Virginia lawmakers tried to create a drug affordability review board.
“There’s nothing to prevent the board from saying we’re only going to reimburse $100 for this prescription, although those pharmacies may have to pay $120 for the drug,” Wachsmann said in an interview.
He added that if review boards target expensive and rare drugs for which to set upper payment limits, they could stifle innovation.
“If those manufacturers think that those are the type of drugs that are going to get hit by these boards and they realize they’ll never get their investment back, they’re not going to develop those drugs anymore,” Wachsmann said.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a bill this year that would have created a drug affordability board in the state, saying in a statement, “This approach could limit access to treatments and hinder medical innovation, especially for life-threatening or rare diseases.”
Wachsmann had voted against the board. Instead, he says it’s better to target PBMs, because he said they are engaging in predatory practices that freeze out small pharmacies and leave consumers with nowhere to go.
Neighboring Maryland created the nation’s first drug affordability board in 2019; it got a boost of resources and revved up activities in 2023.
“It will not hurt pharmacists. It will help everybody except Big Pharma,” said Vincent DeMarco, president of health care advocacy group Maryland Health Care for All, in speaking about the state’s drug affordability review board.
The original bill creating the board only authorized the board to create upper payment limits for drugs purchased by states and local governments in Maryland. But this year, Moore signed a law to expand the authority of the board to create upper payment limits for everyone, except patients on health plans regulated by the federal government.
DeMarco said he’s hoping the board will move to create limits on two popular drugs prescribed for Type 2 diabetes, Jardiance and Farxiga.
“In addition to individuals who can’t afford their drugs, all of us pay the price in higher health insurance premiums, because a big part of our health insurance premiums is high-cost drugs,” DeMarco said.

They all […],"Child care file image. (Photo by Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent/States Newsroom.)The leaders of multiple child care businesses in Ohio urged state lawmakers once again to support measures to boost child care in the state.
Members of the business and advocacy sectors also joined in to ask for further supports for those who take care of the state’s children while the children’s parents work.
They all spoke in support of Ohio House Bill 484, which would create a pilot program within the Ohio Department of Children and Youth to allow child care workers to themselves receive Publicly Funded Child Care regardless of household income.
The pilot program would last from fiscal year 2026 to 2027 if approved, similar to measures states like Michigan and Kentucky have already put into practice.
Tashianna Kwakye said the legislation represents an optimistic future for child care businesses like the one she owns, with workforces dwindling because of the need for their own child care.
“Many providers are waiting for this, it’s the hope that we hold on to so that we don’t close,” Kwakye said.
The business owner told the Ohio House Children and Human Services Committee the high cost of child care, the shortage of workers and the lack of public funding for those workers “cripples our businesses and thereby cripples our economy.”
“Previously, I testified that 80% of our child care workers needed child care,” Kwakye said. “Since that testimony, we have lost 60% of our staff at our Dayton and Columbus locations. The employees left work after not qualifying for (Publicly Funded Child Care).”

Kwakye said the business attempted to lighten the burden for workers by discounting tuition by 50%, and increasing salaries.
Still, workers weren’t able to afford tuition, forcing the closure of rooms and elimination of slots in the rooms that are still open.
Without open slots in child care facilities, families are often forced to leave the workforce to take care of their kids, impacting the economy of the state as a whole, along with the individual families.
“We have a window of opportunity now to ensure that Ohio has a stable and qualified workforce ready to meet employer needs,” said Rick Carfagna, senior vice president at the Ohio Chamber of Commerce.
“Unfortunately, we have an entire demographic of Ohioans that are skilled, educated and hardworking, yet not able to fully participate in the labor force because child care in our state is too scarce, and when available is too expensive.”
Even those who are working and can find available child care have to shell out much of their paychecks to gain access.
According to recent research by the national First Five Years Fund, the annual price of center-based care in Ohio for one child is estimated at $13,780, or more than $1,100 per month.
Home-based care runs an estimated $880 per month, according to the research.
Child care costs in Ohio represent 11.1% of the median income for a married couple, and 40% of a single parent’s household income for center-based care.
“It costs just as much to have someone watch your kid while you go to work as it does to put your kid through college,” Carfagna said.
The child care challenges are having an impact on the amount of kids that are coming into existence as well, with Carfagna citing a state report that shows projected population decline of 675,000 people by 2050, a drop of 5.7%.
People “simply are not having children to the extent that they once did,” Carfagna said, attributing the change “largely” to the expenses of child care.
That concerns Ohio Right to Life, a lobby group that promotes pregnancy and speaks out against abortion.
“From our interactions with parents and caregivers across all demographics, we know that child care remains one of the largest obstacles in building a family,” said Katie DeLand, Ohio Right to Life’s director of policy and legislative affairs.
The bill has a chance of making it through the legislature with Republican sponsors at the helm.
It follows other measures attempting to improve child care in the state through the most recent state operating budget, though some changes in the budget left advocates and workers wanting.
The budget included $10 million for a “Child Care Cred Program,” allowing cost-sharing among employers, employees and the state for child care.
Under the budget, participating employers and eligible employees would pay 40% each for the care costs, while the state would cover the other 20%.
The Child Care Choice Voucher Program was also left in the budget, with $50 million in Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) dollars set to go to the program over the next two years.
The budget also included a grant program for child care worker recruitment, but the provision saw a cut amid the budget process, receiving $2.85 million over two years in the final approved budget.
The budget did not include one of the most sought-after items for child care advocates: a jump in eligibility for Publicly Funded Child Care.
Researchers in the state have said more funding for child care needs to come directly from the state, rather than from federal sources, but the assistance for low-income families topped the lists of many who engaged with the legislature as budget talks went on.
After the budget was signed by Gov. Mike DeWine, Lynanne Gutierrez, president and CEO of child advocacy group Groundwork Ohio said without new action, the state would face a $600 million “shortfall in child care funding next biennium as one-time federal dollars dry up.”
Legislators maintained the previous eligibility for Publicly Funded Child Care of 145% of the federal poverty level, though advocates had pleaded for a raise to at least 160%, if not 200%.
The level keeps the state as one of the lowest in the country in household eligibility for the program, something that is a hardship for Kwakye’s workers.
Many workers who were forced to leave her facilities said they were denied Publicly Funded Child Care because they didn’t meet the income qualifications, but some were denied “out of error” or the need for further employment verification.
In all cases, the lack of help with child care forced them out of the workforce.
The new bill comes as a government shutdown threatens a number of federal Head Start early childhood programs in the state.
Groundwork Ohio urged supporters on Tuesday to contact Congress members and demand an end to the shutdown.
If the shutdown continues, seven of the state’s 59 Head Start providers “will be forced to close as early as Nov. 1,” according to the email from Groundwork.
“That means 3,738 children could lose access to early learning, nutritious meals and health screenings,” Groundwork stated.
“More than 900 teachers and drivers could be furloughed and over 1,500 working parents could lose the child care they depend on to stay employed.”
The government shutdown has been ongoing since Oct. 1, when Congress couldn’t agree on the appropriation of funds for the federal government to continue.
The stalemate carries on as Republicans say they won’t negotiate while the government is shutdown, and Democrats won’t agree to a reopening that doesn’t include Affordable Care Act premium tax credits that are set to expire.

(Photo courtesy of Maine Governor's Office)Celebrating the launch of a new affordable housing development in Brunswick earlier this week, Gov. Janet Mills, Maine House of Representatives Speaker Ryan Fecteau and other leaders said the project exemplifies Maine’s efforts to combat the state’s affordable housing shortage.
Developed by sustainable development company GreenMars and Acadia Realty Partners, Wilbur’s Woods includes 21 single-family homes priced at $325,000 — nearly half the median home price in Cumberland County. 
Most units are already sold, with several going to first-time homeowners, Fecteau and Mills said. The homes are part of Maine’s broader strategy to create 84,000 new housing units by 2030.
More affordable housing is being built across the state due to legislation passed in recent years. This includes bills passed in 2022 and this most recent legislative session that eased zoning restrictions that previously made it difficult to meet the demand for affordable housing in densely populated areas. 
For almost two decades, Maine developers were building an average of 250 affordable units per year, Mills said. In part because of the news laws, she said, “we’ve now finally eclipsed 1000 units per year.”
“While the need for housing is still significant, I’m proud of the number of homes we’ve built so far for Maine families,” Mills added.
In 2022, the state passed a law removing certain land use and zoning barriers to housing production while preserving environmental protections. It also required municipalities to allow two to four housing units on lots where housing is permitted, permit accessory dwelling units on lots with single‐family homes, and establish exceptions for affordable housing developers to allow them to bypass certain municipal zoning limits related to parking and the number of units per lot.
The more recent law, sponsored by Fecteau, also made comprehensive zoning changes to make it easier to build more units on the same lot, and removed some restrictions on height, density and where housing can be built. 
Fecteau’s goal was to increase the construction of smaller developments. He also wants to increase housing production closer to existing infrastructure, such as sewer and water systems, so that developers and municipalities don’t have to spend millions of dollars to extend those lines out to more rural areas.
Another factor that has led to the rise in housing prices is minimum requirements for lot sizes. Experts previously told Maine Morning Star that these rules forced new homes to be built on one or two-acre lots, driving up the cost of each unit. Reducing that requirement under Fecteau’s recently passed law will pave the way for increased housing density.
The two laws are already making a difference, said Nate Green, a partner and cofounder of GreenMars, which built the Brunswick project. The developer is in the pre-construction phase for two lots in Portland, he said, which prior to the new law would have only allowed 16 units but now, with changes to rules about vertical construction, those lots can house 286 units with a mix of rental and home ownership options.
“We’re at a turning point,” said Green. He said the news laws “have laid a strong foundation by promoting density and affordability in the right places.” 
But he said developers need to “keep pushing for policies like administrative permitting” to streamline housing development approvals, which he said would “close the gap between the haves and the have nots and sustains economic growth.”
Under that process, projects that already meet pre-approved zoning ordinances would receive automatic approval, without additional scrutiny and delays from planning boards. 
He said such reviews are often triggered by a vocal minority of home owners opposed to construction in their neighborhoods.
For example, he said construction on Wilbur’s Woods would’ve been complete six months earlier were it not for pushback throughout the planning and development process.
The Brunswick Planning Board after months of debate struck down all opposition to the construction project last June. 
“Most projects do eventually prevail, but these delays cost uncertainty and time … the end result is more expensive housing,” Green said.

State Rep. Melanie Miller, R–Ashland, recently introduced Ohio House Bill 485, also known as the “Enact Baby Olivia Act.” 
The three-minute Meet Baby Olivia video was produced by Live Action, which advocates against abortion, and it shows fertilization and fetal growth.
Abortion rights advocates call the video misleading and inaccurate.
The minimum the bill requires is showing either the Baby Olivia video or an ultrasound video at least three minutes long.

Eleven people submitted supporter testimony and five people testified in person during Tuesday’s Ohio House Education Committee meeting. 
“The Baby Olivia educational video provides clear, scientific, and visually compelling evidence of fetal development and humanity,” Dr. Bill Lile, a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist who is also known as the ‘The ProLife Doc,’ said during his testimony. “These babies in the womb are not abstract ideas — they are living, growing human beings, and they are patients.”
Abortion is legal in Ohio up until 22 weeks of pregnancy. Ohio voters passed a ballot measure in 2023 that added protections to abortion care and reproductive rights to the state’s constitution.
Dr. Alicia Thompson, a board-certified obstetrician-gynecologist, said the Baby Olivia video shows human life begins the moment of fertilization. 
“The video illustrates these realities in a way that is both scientifically sound and accessible to students, using clear visual milestones to demonstrate the beauty and complexity of early human life,” she said during her testimony. 
Planned Parenthood calls the “Baby Olivia” video “inaccurate, misleading, and manipulative.” 
Right to Life Action Coalition of Ohio President Kate Makra said, “The video is medically accurate.”
Planned Parenthood notes that the video counts the embryo’s age from conception, which doctors do not do; claims a fetal heartbeat can be detected at six weeks despite there not being a heart formed and this sound actually an electrical flutter where the heart will later form; and inaccurately displays the look of the embryo, mischaracterizes its activity, and leaves out critical information about at what point it can survive outside the womb.
The Ohio bill would require the video to be shown to students every year starting in third grade through twelfth grade beginning with the 2026-27 school year. 
State Rep. Sean Brennan, D-Parma, questioned showing the same video to a third grader and a high school senior. 
“Is it appropriate to show the same video to elementary school kids, middle school kids, high school kids?” Brennan, a former educator, asked. “Wouldn’t it be a better idea to allow a lot more flexibility to the district to tailor the video to the students’ developmental capabilities?” 
State Rep. Gayle Manning, R-Avon, spent much of her career teaching third grade. 
“I can’t imagine explaining to my children what is going on in the video when at third grade, many kids don’t have any idea,” she said. “To me, that is something that a parent should have a discussion before I would, as a teacher.” 
Makra agreed parents should have conversations with their children about fetal development, but said that does not always happen. 
“I think a lot of parents are not doing that, and that’s why we find there are so many unplanned pregnancies,” she said.  “I think even a young child would be able to look at the images and be able to gain an understanding of what’s being conveyed in the video.” 
Ohio students deserve to know the science behind conception, Makra said. 
State Rep. Jena Powell, R-Arcanum
“Ohio’s science curriculum requires teaching animal and plant reproduction from the First Grade — seed growth and frog cycles — yet inexplicably skips human prenatal development,” she said in her testimony. “If we teach life cycles of plants and animals, why aren’t we teaching humans from conception?”
Former Ohio state Rep. Jena Powell said the purpose of the bill is educational, not political. 
“It gives young Ohioans access to scientific, factual information about the earliest stages of human life,” she said, reflecting on seeing her own baby’s ultrasound. “By seeing what happens inside the womb—the heartbeat, the movement, the growth—students will gain a deeper understanding of biology, of life, and of the impact their choices can have on others.”
Similar bills have been introduced in more than 20 other states so far this session and Idaho, Kansas, North Dakota, Tennessee, Iowa, and Indiana have enacted similar bills into law.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)The Executive Council is holding up $5.5 million of funding for indigent defense attorneys in New Hampshire after councilors questioned whether courts are adequately scrutinizing defendants’ claimed financial status.  
In a 3-2 vote Wednesday, councilors moved to table the New Hampshire Judicial Council’s request for extra funding, which would come from the state’s General Fund.
The Judicial Council is asking to increase its current two-year budget from $2.1 million to $7.6 million, more than tripling it. In an explanation to the Executive Council, the Judicial Council said the costs have risen due to more hearings after the end of the “Felonies First” program; increased complexity of cases; a jump in the billing rate for assigned counsel; difficulty hiring dedicated public defenders, requiring more expensive outside counsel; and other factors.
According to state law, the Judicial Council is required to request additional funding from the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee and the Executive Council if its expenses exceed its budget. The Fiscal Committee approved the $5.5 million request earlier in October. 
But on Wednesday, Councilor John Stephen, a Manchester Republican, said he’s concerned that courts are not sufficiently examining defendants’ claims of being unable to afford a lawyer in the first place.
“We’re not even checking to see if these individuals have assets, have income,” he said. “I don’t know what we’re doing.”
A spokesperson for the Judicial Branch was not available to comment Wednesday. 
Stephen, a former New Hampshire assistant attorney general and former deputy commissioner for the Department of Safety, said he supports indigent defense funding and commends the Judicial Council. But he asked that Supreme Court Chief Justice Gordon MacDonald sit down with the Executive Council to discuss improvements to verification. 
Republican Councilors Joe Kenney, of Wakefield, and Dave Wheeler, of Milford, joined Stephen in voting to table the funding. 
Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Gov. Kelly Ayotte, the former state attorney general, said she appreciates public defenders and that they “have an important constitutional role in our justice system.” But she said she was open to finding ways to better review indigent defendants.
“The idea of looking at whether there’s ways to put processes in place to make sure that the verification of whether someone’s indigent is done properly: that’s a legitimate issue to look into,” Ayotte said. 
Lebanon Councilor Karen Liot Hill, the sole Democrat on the council, said she understood Stephen’s concerns but argued the council should not hold up funding. The New Hampshire Constitution guarantees all defendants in the state a right to representation.  
“I don’t think tabling is necessary to achieve some of the policy issues that Councilor Stephen is concerned with, and it potentially opens the state to liability related to this constitutional obligation that we owe to indigent (people) in New Hampshire,” she said. 
In his explanation for the funding increase, Jay Buckey, the executive director of the Judicial Council, wrote the end of the “Felonies First” program, in which felony cases were diverted to superior court, means there are more hearings at the circuit court level, increasing the need for defense.
He also wrote the cost increase has been driven by “particularly serious” defense cases, such as a murder trials and cases related to sexual abuse at the state’s Youth Detention Center.
The recent tightening in state bail laws under House Bill 592 will likely raise the number of people held in jail before their trial, putting more burdens on public defenders, he said. 
Meanwhile, changes in state statutes have required assigned counsel in all juvenile delinquency cases, as opposed to “contract counsel,” raising the case load. A law taking effect in January will mandate court-appointed attorneys for children in placement scenarios, Buckey noted.
The Legislature has also increased the amount that assigned counsel gets paid; as of January 2025, counsel will receive $125 per hour in standard cases and $150 for major crimes. “This change was supported by the Judicial Council to maintain the number of attorneys willing to take indigent defense cases,” Buckey wrote. 
Exacerbating all of those costs is the hiring difficulty by New Hampshire Public Defenders, the private organization that assists in many cases. “Due to budget uncertainty and constraints, NHPD was unable to hire the full number of attorneys it planned to (hiring 9 instead of 19), which led to ongoing attorney shortages at certain offices,” Buckey wrote.
And there are not enough attorneys willing to accept contracts directly with the Judicial Council, he added.
In New Hampshire, a defendant who is requesting an attorney be provided to them must fill out an affidavit before the court asserting that they are unable to afford representation. 
After a change made by House and Senate Democrats in the 2019 budget trailer bill, House Bill 2, the court has the power to conduct an “ability-to-pay” hearing, at its discretion. If the court finds the defendant can pay some or all of the fees, it can order the defendant to do so. 
Stephen acknowledged that the Judicial Council is not responsible for investigating defendants’ ability to pay, but he said the tabling motion would allow for the conversation with the Judicial Branch.
“I feel like I’m just throwing away $5 million in taxpayer (money) and no one’s doing any checks.” Stephen said. 
The next opportunity for the council to pass the $5.5 million funding request is Nov. 12.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0667-1024x624.jpg,,,2025-10-30 05:02:27.501137

(Photo by WEWS.)Some public schools are fighting for Ohioans’ votes this November, urging community members to pass their levies as education faces funding challenges — and warning what could happen if they fail.
“Local school levies have always been part of the equation,” Ohio Education Association President Jeff Wensing said.
“Unfortunately, it seems like there’s a great possibility that they’re gonna become a bigger part of the equation.
This November election, 108 school districts across the state have levies on the ballot
Wensing, a former Parma math teacher, cited data from the nonpartisan research group Policy Matters Ohio, which showed the state slashed the expected public education spending by nearly $3 billion over the next two years.
“In order to deliver on that promise of a great public education, we need to provide the resources that our students need, as well as our educators,” he said.
Because of rules passed by lawmakers, a levy “seems like the only option,” he added.
For months, we have covered the funding woes that schools have — and why many GOP legislators say they aren’t legitimate.
But when we asked state lawmakers like House Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, about schools consistently going back to the ballot, he said he didn’t “think that’s true.”
“I trust our very able school boards and administrators can find ways to do their job, living within their means,” Stewart said.
But schools are facing another challenge.
Legislators changed state law starting after the November election, so districts will no longer be able to put emergency levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy.
That legislation eliminated levy replacements on property taxes for all political subdivisions.
Recent bills or provisions restricting school funding will provide much-needed property tax relief for homeowners, House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, said.
“It’s an extraordinary tax savings,” Huffman claimed.
Last week, lawmakers passed H.B. 186 and 335, which limit how much money school districts can get from rising home values — tying tax increases to inflation.
“When it comes to schools, they’ve been saying that this will put them in a constant levy cycle. What do you have to say to them — especially given the fact that they now have less options after this election to put a levy on the ballot?” we asked the speaker.
“It’s sort of a different answer… We have over 600 school districts,” Huffman responded.
School districts will differ depending on how they manage their finances, he said.
“Right now, you have plenty of money. Why would you have to go into a constant cycle?” he said, referencing schools that keep a rainy day fund.
Many districts don’t need the cash, while others are better at maintaining their costs.
But for districts like Parma, ones that haven’t been able to pass a new levy in more than a decade, Wensing said that isn’t true.
“You can’t create property tax relief on the backs of public schools,” Wensing said.
“Because the General Assembly has done what they’ve done, people have to make hard choices.”
That is why the fall election is essential for districts with proposals on the ballot.
“What happens if these levies fail this November?” we asked Wensing.
“If the levies fail this November, public schools, public school students, communities will suffer,” he responded.
“When you don’t have the money to provide the services that you used to, things get cut and educators’ jobs get cut. Class sizes go up, opportunities for students decrease, and that’s not right. Our General Assembly needs to do better.”

(Ethan DeWitt | New Hampshire Bulletin)With Congress showing no signs of resolving its stalemate and ending the ongoing federal government shutdown, those waiting on government food assistance are facing a halt to benefits Saturday. In New Hampshire, state officials have approved a plan to fill the gap, at least partially.
If the shutdown doesn’t end this week, New Hampshire residents in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program won’t receive their November benefits. To alleviate that loss, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services is reallocating $2 million from the Medicaid Enhancement Tax to fund food assistance and partnering with the New Hampshire Food Bank to create a series of mobile food pantries throughout the state. The plan will pay the food bank to operate up to 20 locations twice a week for the next five weeks, just for SNAP recipients. The contract with the food bank lasts until Dec. 5 or whenever the shutdown ends, but the state has the option to extend it by one week eight times should the shutdown continue. The mobile pantries would be in addition to the ones the food bank already operates, officials said.
“This is a Band-Aid,” Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Weaver told lawmakers Tuesday. “We recognize that it falls short of what they typically would get.”
The $2 million plan pales in comparison to the $12.6 million the federal government typically gives New Hampshire for SNAP monthly. Weaver said it was too difficult to find that money in her department’s budget, particularly after back-of-the-budget cuts made by the Legislature earlier this year.
The plan was approved by the Joint Legislative Fiscal Committee Tuesday and the Executive Council Wednesday.
Gov. Kelly Ayotte also acknowledged the underwhelming nature of the plan.
“This is a temporary solution,” she said. “I want those in Washington to get this done and to get the government open, get these benefits back in place for people who need them. And so we’re just doing our part to say, ‘We’re not going to just let Washington say that nothing’s going to happen here.’ We want to get some more food in the community and work together to make sure that people don’t go hungry.”
Around 75,000 people are enrolled in SNAP in New Hampshire, per DHHS. About 47,000 of those are adults and 25,000 are children. To find mobile pantry locations, people can visit nhfoodbank.org online. State officials said more information will also be on dhhs.nh.gov.
The federal government shutdown began Oct. 1, when Congress failed to pass a spending plan to fund the government. Senate Democrats have refused to vote for any plan that doesn’t extend a series of Affordable Care Act tax credits Americans use to purchase health insurance, while Republicans say they won’t negotiate on the tax credits until the government reopens.
Weaver told the Bulletin the state has had trouble communicating with federal officials at the Food and Nutrition Service and Department of Agriculture. She said many of their typical contacts have been furloughed amid the shutdown.
Weaver said it should be “an all hands on deck” effort to help hungry families.
“We’re doing our part to be able to increase the access and the supply,” she said. “But it also takes a community, right? So get with your local communities, get with your food pantries, get with your neighbors, get in the schools.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0659-1024x637.jpg,,,2025-10-30 05:02:27.501137

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)People of Kansas, we need to have a heart-to-heart conversation.
I don’t know what you want. This year’s Kansas Speaks opinion survey from the Docking Institute of Public Affairs at Fort Hays State University suggests that you have a lot of straightforward, admirable views on public policy. You want to expand Medicaid, legalize cannabis and keep abortion legal. You like Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly more than Republican President Donald Trump. You worry about the national economy and don’t like the U.S. Congress.
On the other hand, you voted for Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris by a 16-point margin in November. You voted in a Republican supermajority whose leaders have devoted themselves to limiting health insurance for the poor, arresting and prosecuting people who smoke weed, and ultimately banning abortion.
You could think that Kansans have an easy alternative: Vote for Democrats. But that doesn’t account for the party’s horrendously tarnished brand and longstanding challenge of gaining traction in generationally Republican Kansas.
Political scientist Michael Smith told Kansas Reflector editor Sherman Smith that people have an “abysmal opinion” of the Democratic Party.
Moderate Republicans might seem like the answer. Yet their power in Topeka has been systematically targeted by rock-ribbed conservatives, beginning with then-Gov. Sam Brownback’s purge in 2012. Moderates managed a brief comeback in 2016, but they have faced repeated setbacks since. The mechanics of primary elections — in which only die-hard partisans vote — has made it difficult for sensible members of the GOP to prevail.
So we end up with this situation. Kansans keep voting for people they disagree with.
I mean, you can cast your ballot for whoever you want. I’m not in the business of making campaign ads or juicing voter turnout. I write my thoughts down and send them out into the wider world. But if you keep voting for people who have explicitly stated they want to do the things that you don’t approve of, what do you think will happen? Do you expect Kansas Republican leaders to experience an epiphany and decide to expand Medicaid, free the weed and renounce regulations on women’s bodies?
Fat chance.
So what do you want, Kansans? How many times do you need to be betrayed by the people you elect? Or are you just fine with everything? The survey suggests that a healthy chunk (45%) think Kansas is moving in the right direction. Or maybe we just don’t like change.
“Once you’ve been a Republican, you’re more likely to stay a Republican and continue to vote for Republicans,” said Alexandra Middlewood, chair of the political science department at Wichita State University, speaking about the survey. “Same with Democrats.”
I’ve written columns like this before. I’ve even written columns like this before about the Kansas Speaks survey. But I keep writing them because I think we can never hear enough that Kansans do not agree with Republican leaders’ policies. Not in Kansas, and not in the United States. There remains today, just as there was decades ago, a broad swath of moderates who want the government to provide a strong social safety net, stay out of residents’ personal business and run government efficiently.
Oddly few Kansas politicians have tried to fill this gap. Democrats have fitfully attempted the task, but they’re absurdly outmatched financially and clustered in urban areas.
Moderate Republicans appear to have gone into hiding, with the high-profile exceptions of gubernatorial candidate and Insurance Commissioner Vicki Schmidt and Emporia Rep. Mark Schreiber. I’ve covered efforts to boost commonsense candidate’s visibility, but the power of entrenched interests has proved wrenchingly difficult to overcome.
This contradiction has played out at the national level during the first 10 months of Trump’s second term. A majority of American voters did not vote for the current president. Opinion polling shows that an even larger majority don’t like his performance in office. A smart and disciplined opposition could theoretically make major inroads.
Instead, we have the national Democratic Party.
As humorist Will Rogers put it: “I don’t belong to an organized political party; I am a Democrat.”
The party has all but collapsed into a heaving pile of interconnected squabbles, leftists and liberals and centrists whaling on one another with the fervor of sugar-addled toddlers. Everyone agrees the party is seen as elitist, out-of-touch and ineffective, but no one agrees on the solution.
One group suggests a more moderate approach. Another suggests a more progressive one. Meanwhile, guardrails protecting our representative democracy have been efficiently stripped by a new class of nihilistic MAGA drones. Democrats have decided to take a stand with the current government shutdown, but given unified GOP control in Washington, D.C., they can’t hope to accomplish many tangible results.
Yes, it’s bad. But we also know that people want better.
Kansans and voters generally don’t understand politics in the same way as enthusiasts. They see current events through the prism of their own lives and their families’ economic health. Their policy preferences can align in unexpected ways — an ardent abortion-rights advocate can support gun rights and same-sex marriage while opposing immigration. People believe what they believe and choose candidates that make sense to them at the time.
Spend a few minutes with this web feature from the Survey Center on American Life. It allows you to guess how various people voted in the 2024 election based on their beliefs and personal information. You will be repeatedly surprised.
People of Kansas, I don’t understand you. Not entirely. But I know you want a state that does right by its people. Let’s see if politicians step up to make those desires reality.

(Photo provided.)One of the greatest gifts of getting older is changing your beliefs when your own circumstances change.
If someone asked me 15 years ago to define an au pair, my beliefs most likely were aligned with common misconceptions.
These are misunderstandings that an au pair is only an option for wealthy families or that au pairs only provide child care.
However, after becoming a mother, it is not surprising that my perspective of child care drastically changed. As a mom struggling to find solutions I began looking into options that went beyond the traditional, like using a nanny or daycare center.
Data from 2024 shows that inadequate care options in Cleveland and Cuyahoga County cost parents nearly $6,000 a year in lost wages and employment, and nearly 2 in 5 Ohioans live in a child care desert.
When our kids were young, my husband and I navigated this complex childcare landscape while working full time. Like many other families, we relied on a patchwork of support.
Although we had managed to juggle resources to cover our child care needs, my acceptance into a challenging doctoral program forced me to look for more consistent support.
I knew that I would need flexibility and consistency, which I expected to come at a significant expense.
Child care in Ohio costs more than college, on average. We needed to explore alternative options. That is what led us to the au pair program.
The au pair program is a cultural exchange program regulated by the Department of State where American families welcome young individuals from abroad into their home and as part of their families.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Au pairs on a cultural exchange visa receive a weekly stipend, room and board, and support to take classes at American colleges.
In return, they provide up to 45 hours per week of flexible child care support.
Regardless of the number of children in the home, the cost of hosting an au pair is one flat fee — compared to the more variable and per-child rates of more traditional options.
When we began the matching process, our expectations were more modest: an au pair who would help keep our family afloat during a grueling season of life.
But, as the search progressed, our priorities evolved.
We set aside strict preferences for country of origin and language in favor of finding someone who was the right fit for our family’s needs.
As we looked through the personalized au pair profiles, we didn’t know what would come true when we connected with our current au pair, Tiiso.
From the time she arrived, Tiiso has shown our family love, laughter, and new perspectives.
Her experiences have shaped our world view.
Hosting an au pair offers a unique way for parents to access a trusted and personalized child care solution while immersing their family in new cultures, languages, and traditions.
Tiiso came to us in December from sunny, warm South Africa, and landed in an unusually snowy Cleveland.
Part of me feared she’d take one look at the landscape and turn right back around.
Instead, she embraced the cold winter with a sense of wonder.
We watched her make social media posts about her first time scraping snow off the window with wide eyes and a grin.
She had joy while walking through parts of our life that we would have normally considered mundane. These are the types of experiences that reflect the true meaning of cultural exchange.
I didn’t anticipate how fulfilling it would be to support this young woman as she navigates a new environment.
It took some encouragement to help Tiiso become comfortable driving our minivan around the neighborhood.
Four months later, she flew across the country, rented a car, and drove across California, from San Francisco to Lake Tahoe.
I doubt I’ll ever completely understand all the ways Tiiso has impacted my family for good.
She shares her delight about the funny things the kids say and how they are growing right before our eyes.
I can imagine that when my children are older, they’ll reflect on the core memories that they formed with her.
I’m excited for the day that we can visit her family in South Africa, which will be both a comma and an exclamation point within our au pair story.
There are many reasons people choose to have an au pair, and they are likely unique to each family.
However, the opportunity for good and personal growth are universal.
If I were to define an au pair today, I would say: “Someone who helps care for your family and brings a unique and joyful perspective to your home.”
I know now that the story will go on for a very long time after that and I don’t think that I’ll ever be able to express my gratitude enough.

(Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent)When Congress returns to work and Nebraska lawmakers prepare for the 2026 legislative session in January, there are few issues that garner as much bipartisan support on the federal or state level as child care.
New data from research conducted in four states, including Nebraska, shows something that may surprise many: Nebraskans share more common ground than our divisions often suggest.
Almost three-quarters of Nebraska voters believe families with young children are struggling a lot in this economy, and 60% say the government is doing too little to help. The vast majority, across the political spectrum, support programs that help children and families and don’t want to see them cut.
At the center of this agreement is one of our state’s deepest values: children and families. Nebraskans believe that supporting families with young children is essential to the strength of our communities and the future of our state.
Shared values, shared solutions
Families are facing the ever-rising costs of groceries, housing, health care and child care. Nearly half of Nebraska voters (44%) say they are personally concerned about the cost of child care. And more than three-quarters (78%) agree government should make it easier for families to get the help they need, noting that Nebraska’s income thresholds to qualify for assistance are too low.
When asked what matters most, voters consistently point to flexibility and choice, recognizing that different families need different supports to thrive. That’s why proposals like expanded assistance for working parents resonate so strongly. Nebraskans value accountability, but we also value fairness. We don’t want to cut off families who are already working hard. We want to help them succeed. People respect independence while acknowledging reality: families need more support, not more red tape.
Moving beyond the divides
Too often, policy debates become bogged down in arguments that lose sight of what makes our state the Good Life and keeps our communities strong. Nebraskans are clear: they don’t want new barriers that punish families. They want their elected officials to keep their eyes on the bigger picture.
The truth is simple: When parents lose child care or can’t afford food or health care, children pay the price. And Nebraskans agree that’s unacceptable.
A moment to lead
U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer recently reintroduced the Child Care and Development Block Grant Reauthorization Act of 2025, a bill that strengthens parental choice, supports Nebraska’s child care workforce and invests in the supply of high-quality options for families. Her leadership shows what’s possible when we focus on practical solutions that help parents succeed at work and at home.
As our congressional delegation and state lawmakers return to the people’s work, they should take note of this consensus. Supporting families with children is a Nebraska value. If federal progress is made while state leaders roll back assistance for child care in Nebraska, it sends a mixed message to families. We should work together to ensure that child care remains strong at both the national and state level.
Families raising the next generation of Nebraskans deserve no less.

Senate President Bill Ferguson said he and the Senate are opposed to such an effort.  (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Gov. Wes Moore (D) hinted that he may move ahead with plans to redraw the state’s eight congressional districts, and for a possible special session, despite opposition from a key lawmaker.
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City), in a letter to Senate Democrats Tuesday, said he opposed mid-cycle redistricting, which he called “too risky” for Democrats who could end up losing a seat in their efforts to redraw congressional districts to gain one.
Ferguson said that redistricting in the middle of a decade “twists rules for potential short-term advantage while undermining trust in institutions and ultimately, democracy, but that is not the reason we should not pursue it.”
“Simply put, it is too risky and jeopardizes Maryland’s ability to fight against the radical Trump Administration. At a time where every seat in Congress matters, the potential for ceding yet another one to Republicans here in Maryland is simply too great,” he wrote.
But Moore signaled the potential for a fight with Ferguson over the issue.
“The General Assembly is a large body, so while I have read the Senate President’s letter, I also know that one person cannot stop a process,” Moore told reporters Wednesday.

“My commitment stays firm that we are going to make sure that we have fair maps inside the state of Maryland, and we are not going to bend the knee to Donald Trump,” Moore said, adding that “a special session is not off the table, regardless of what anyone else says.”
‘I understand that pressure’
States typically redraw their congressional district lines every 10 years, after the decennial census reports on population shifts. But some Republican-led states, at the urging of President Donald Trump (R), began redistricting this year in an effort to make the map more friendly to GOP candidates in the 2026 elections.
Texas, where Republicans hold 25 of 38 House seats, approved a new map in August that could net five more GOP seats next fall. Soon after, Missouri and North Carolina moved to pass new maps that favor Republicans.
Democratic states are responding, led by California, which could pass a map that would add five Democratic seats, and other states are under pressure to follow suit. In his three-page confidential letter to the 34 members of the Senate’s Democratic caucus, Ferguson acknowledged the political pressure many Democrats are feeling to challenge Trump on this, the budget and other issues.
“This push means that you are feeling the need to fight back, not just intrinsically, but from neighbors, family, other electeds, and constituents,” Ferguson writes. “I understand that pressure, as I am experiencing it alongside you.”
But Ferguson implies that GOP effort to game congressional districts in their states is a form of cheating Maryland should shun.
“In state after state, leaders are considering redrawing congressional maps in the middle of the decade to disenfranchise minority party voters; not because the census changed — not because population shifted — but because the political winds did,” he wrote. “The result of all this has been an all-out attack on the Democratic Party and the core of democracy.”
Maryland Democrats have largely had their way with redistricting over the last quarter-century.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Nearly 25 years ago, Democrats and Republicans shared an even split of the state’s eight congressional districts. But under Gov. Parris Glendening (D) in 2002, lawmakers approved a map that gave Democrats a 6-2 advantage. In the 2012 redistricting, rural, Republican Western Maryland was combined with portions of largely Democratic Montgomery County to give Democrats a 7-1 edge.
But a map three years ago that could have given Democrats all eight House seats was struck down by a state judge who called the plan “extreme partisan gerrymandering.” Senior Judge Lynne A. Battaglia’s ruling linked partisan map-making to potential violations of Maryland’s Declaration of Rights.
The maps were redrawn to create the 7-1 map in use today — a map Ferguson noted has never been reviewed by the courts but could become collateral damage in a legal challenge of a mid-decade redistricting effort.
“We do not know how a court would assess a revised midcycle map and whether the court would use party affiliation as a measure,” Ferguson wrote in his letter. “We do, however, have a certainty under the current map; that evaporates the moment we start down a path of redistricting mid-cycle with an unclear legal landscape and an even more unclear legal timeline.”
Va. Democrats roll out redistricting amendment to counter GOP map changes in other states

Ferguson’s letter notes that Republican-controlled states that can still redistrict control 55 congressional seats. States with Democratic supermajorities control 35 Republican congressional seats. The result could be a net loss of 20 Democratic controlled seats, he said.
Ferguson claimed Maryland is holding other Republican states from redrawing their maps. He said “several Republican states are resisting the pressure to redistrict and are mostly able to do so because Maryland and other Democratic states are not redistricting either. In short — if Maryland redistricts, Republican-led states that were not planning to do so, will. That means that Maryland’s potential gain of one seat is immediately eliminated, and, in fact, worsens the national outlook.”
Moore’s legislative math problem
If he calls for a special session, Moore would still need to get 24 votes to pass a redistricting bill in the 47-member Senate.
All of those will have to come from the 34-member Democratic Caucus, a supermajority in the Senate. And he would need at least 29 votes to ensure the ability to end any filibuster in the Senate.
For Ferguson, the math is easier.
The Democratic Senate president starts with 13 Republican senators who are likely to oppose any redistricting effort. He will also likely bring with him the chairs and vice chairs of the standing committees and other members of leadership as well as other loyalists.
Without the votes in the Senate, a redistricting effort goes no further than the House.
Moore is not the only one who is not giving up on Maryland redistricting. U.S. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) told reporters Wednesday that Moore “has been very clear that Maryland is prepared to respond … to the Trump Republican effort to rig the midterm elections.”

“It’s my expectation, based on my conversations with Gov. Moore, my conversations with leadership in the Maryland General Assembly and certainly my conversations with the Maryland delegation, that the state of Maryland knows what the stakes are, understands the assignment — and as we are seeing in multiple other states beginning with California, will respond aggressively and appropriately in short order,” Jeffries said.
Moore ‘hates gerrymandering,’ calls for competitive districts
Maryland — a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-1 — has one congressional district held by a Republican.
Moore last week hinted at the possibility of a special session focused on redrawing Maryland’s eight congressional districts. In an ironic turn, he told reporters the effort to revisit the state’s congressional maps before the 2030 Census was about fair and competitive districts.
“I know that if you look at the maps all across the country, less than 10% of all maps are even competitive,” Moore said.
“There’s gerrymandering that is taking place right now inside of our maps all around the country and I hate the gerrymandering process, but we’d be lying to ourselves if we didn’t act like the maps that we have right now are not gerrymandered,” Moore said.
That goes for Maryland’s congressional districts, he said.
“I think if you look at the process of how these maps are laid out, you cannot look at the win margins, you cannot look at how it’s established right now and say that Maryland’s maps are not worth reexamination,” Moore said. “They are worth reexamination if you look at just the average win portion that we have for the members of our delegation.”
Speaker Jones leaves door open to redistricting
Moore can call a special session, but what happens next could be difficult.
Neither chamber is obligated to pass nor even take up a specific bill. There is some question about whether the Senate could simply adjourn its proceedings after taking up overrides of any vetoes issued this year by Moore.
The governor has some allies in the push.
House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) said she is open to a discussion about redrawing congressional districts, though her statement does not speak to the possibility of a special session.
House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) said the House of Delegates is open to a midcycle redistricting proposal. (File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)
“Mid-cycle redistricting should concern anyone who cares about the health of our democratic institutions and the future of fair elections,” Jones said in a statement. “Closing the door now on the mid-cycle redistricting debate denies our constituents the opportunity to voice their opinion on an issue that goes far beyond their district lines. As I’ve stated before, my door remains open to my colleagues in the Senate and to the Governor to jointly pursue efforts to protect our democracy.”
Del. David Moon (D-Montgomery), the House majority leader, announced in August he would sponsor redistricting legislation. And Del. Jheanelle K. Wilkins (D-Montgomery) said this week that mid-decade redistricting in Maryland is an imperative.
“We can’t miss this moment to ensure accountability and fair representation,” Wilkins said. “Our democracy is at stake in a real way, and we have an obligation to make sure district lines truly reflect our communities. At a time when voting rights, diversity and basic freedoms are under assault, Maryland must step up to ensure we have the strongest and most representative government possible.”
Wilkins, vice chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, is also chair of the Legislative Black Caucus, but said she was speaking only for herself.
The effort has some support in the Senate.
Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Howard and Anne Arundel) has said he would sponsor redistricting legislation in his chamber, but he declined to comment on redistricting when asked Wednesday afternoon.
Moore, speaking to reporters Wednesday, insisted “Maryland needs to go through a process of establishing, do we have fair maps, especially if Donald Trump is trying to rig a system to try to win an election by asking only Republican states to do that.”
“I will work with Senate President Ferguson,” Moore added. “I also work with all of the other senators and all the other members of the House, because it is a large body, and one person does not decide whether or not Maryland goes through this process.”

Sifrit and her husband Tom appeared before the Manatee County legislative delegation on Monday to make their case in advance of the next regular legislative session, slated to start Jan. 13.
Stephanie Sifrit placed her mother in a Bradenton facility in February 2021 due to her severe dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Sifrit says that on three separate occasions she asked the nursing home administrator for permission to install a recording device in her mother’s room but was told no. The administrator, she said, denied her request because of privacy concerns for the long term care staff who care for the residents. 
The Sifrits allege Stephanie’s mother was sexually assaulted at the facility on or about March 4, 2021, approximately two-and-a-half weeks after she entered the facility.
After the alleged incident, the Sifrits filed a lawsuit in 2023 claiming negligence and a breach of fiduciary duty, but the case was ultimately dismissed after the company declared bankruptcy in 2024. 
Stephanie Sifrit told the Phoenix she also filed a complaint regarding the incident with the state Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA), but was told by the agency the allegation wouldn’t be investigated. AHCA did not immediately respond to the Phoenix’s request for comment.
“I implore you to hear my request, to my plea, and now my cry, which is on behalf of thousands of vulnerable citizens who are in their difficult end-of-life journeys and cannot self-protect, self-defend, nor self-advocate,” Sifrit told the panel of Republican legislators, including Senate President Designate Jim Boyd, R-Bradenton.
Sifrit, a high school teacher, has created a website highlighting the issue and along with her husband has been calling on state legislators to enact laws permitting families to place cameras in their loved one’s rooms. Approximately 20 other states allow for the use of so-called “granny cams.”
“I’m here to ask you to please fight for the patient,” Sifrit added to the lawmakers on Monday. “Currently in the state of Florida, the [nursing] home can say, ‘No, no cameras here.’ And you can be evicted or they can retaliate. Please sirs, please represent my voice in Tallahassee. I am your constituent, and I am advocating for vulnerable people.”
The Sifrit’s story of abuse may not be unique.
The Tampa Bay Times reported in 2023 that nursing homes were cited 83 times in 2022 for putting older adult residents at risk of immediate danger. Between 2019 and 2022, the paper reported, the number of serious allegations levied against nursing homes with the state were double the amount for the previous six years.
 Legislation hasn’t moved 

Florida legislators have filed bills over the past several years addressing the issue, with little success. During the 2025 regular legislative session, a “granny cam’ bill was sponsored in the Senate by Sen. Ileana Garcia, R-Miami, and in the House by Rep. Susan Plasencia, R-Orlando.
Mrs. Sifrit testified on behalf of Plasencia’s bill earlier this when it was considered by the House Health Care Facilities & Systems Subcommittee. Representatives from the Florida Health Care Association, the Florida Senior Living Association, and the Florida Assisted Living Association all spoke out against the measure.
House panel OKs the use of ‘granny cams’ in long term care facilities

Senate Health Policy Committee Chair Sen. Colleen Burton, R-Winter Haven, never brought the companion bill up in committee for consideration and ultimately the legislation failed.
Tom Sifrit says that he and his wife have heard “a lot of reasons” from lawmakers and officials in the long term care industry who have resisted such legislation, including privacy concerns for the other residents and their visitors as well as the long term care staff who care for the residents. 
And while some of those concerns have merit, Mr. Sifrit told the Manatee County delegation members, resident safety is more important.
“I want you to imagine that it’s your mother. It’s your wife. How many of these reasons would matter?” he asked.
 Industry opposition

There are differences between nursing homes and assisted living facilities (ALFs).
An ALF provides personal care services in the least restrictive environment. ALF residents must be able to move independently or with the help of devices like walkers or wheelchairs. Nursing homes treat more frail residents and provide nursing care, case management, and health monitoring, as well as personal care.
There are more than 3,000 ALFs in Florida, and close to 700 nursing homes in the state, according to the USF School of Aging Studies.
At press time no bills authorizing the use of granny cams had been filed for the upcoming 2026 session.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Bijou Ikli, the CEO of the Florida Assisted Living Association, said many of its member facilities already allow cameras to be installed. It’s a facility by facility decision.
“Not all ALFs are equipped to do this effectively,” she told the Phoenix in an email this week. “Unlike skilled nursing facilities, residents in assisted living communities are generally more independent and mobile.”
She adds that individuals and families have choices when it comes to placing their family and friends into ALFs. If placement decisions are based on whether cameras are permitted, “individuals can choose a community that allows them,” Ikli said.
“I would not oppose legislation that requires ALFs to make public their policy on cameras and audio recordings in resident rooms to help consumers make informed choices and perhaps establishes reasonable parameters for their use to protect the dignity of residents, visitors, staff, and other health care professionals involved.”
The Florida Health Care Administration (FHCA) is the state’s largest nursing home association in the state. A spokesperson said the FHCA is waiting to see any legislation before taking a position.
However the group opposed the legislation in 2025. In testimony before the House Health Care Facilities & Systems Subcommittee earlier this year FHCA representative Jen Lawrence said “at this time we would like to cast our vote in opposition.” 
FHCA Senior Director of Strategy & Communications Kristen Knapp says the use of surveillance cameras carries several challenges, and that “it’s important to remember that cameras observe, they do not protect.”
Knapp said that cameras would “provide access to footage of residents in their most intimate moments” including bathing and using the restroom and could reveal conversations with physicians. She added it could also be “complicated” when there are roommates involved and lead to potential violations of federal health privacy laws.
“We recognize that technology continues to evolve, but it’s important to balance the growing digital dependence with the expectations that our residents have for privacy and independence,” Knapp told the Phoenix in an email. 
The Sifrits have championed granny cam legislation for the last several years but in that time Stephanie Sifrit has become less optimistic of its passage.
She shared in a phone interview with the Phoenix this week that one member of the Bradenton City Council told her she was trying to “move a mountain.” 
Sifrit replied, “I know I’m trying to move a mountain, to protect people from being raped, neglected, and abused.”

If you haven’t picked a Halloween costume yet, I have a suggestion: Dress up as a Rice’s whale.
You maaaaaay need a few friends to help out if you want your costume to look authentic. Rice’s whales are about as long as a Greyhound bus. But what makes this a compelling Halloween outfit is that these massive mammals remain largely (ba-dum-bum!) mysterious. 
We often fear the unknown, and the Rice’s whale is definitely unknown. Most people who live along the Florida coast have no idea they’re there. Until recently, scientists didn’t even know for sure they existed. 
Now that we do know they exist, we also know that they’re endangered — and that they will likely be harmed or killed by a new plan to expand offshore oil drilling.
“The Trump administration is readying a proposal to open almost all U.S. coastal waters to new offshore oil drilling despite opposition from state governors and the president’s previous efforts to close off some of the territory,” Bloomberg News reported last week.
Even parts of the Gulf of Mumblety-Mumble that he had decreed off-limits to drilling during his last term are included in the current proposal, the Bloomberg report says.

Expanding offshore oil drilling is bad for a lot of reasons, but it’s especially bad for the Rice’s whales. There are fewer than 100 left, and maybe as few as 50. There used to be more, but the population dropped by about 22% after the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon spill, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Scientists also estimate that nearly a quarter of the female Rice’s whales that survived the oil spill suffered “reproductive failure.” In other words, they’re now unable to produce healthy, live calves to rebuild the population.
These whales are way too big to compare to canaries, but in a way that’s what they are for our aquatic coal mine.

“Protecting Rice’s whales protects the health of the Gulf,” said Laura Engleby, a recently retired marine mammal scientist for the National Marine Fisheries Service. “They play a really important function in the ecosystem.”
They’re so important, in fact, that saving these whales may just save us humans.
  World’s weirdest

I’ve lived near the Gulf nearly my whole life, but I had no idea there were whales out there until one popped up almost in my backyard in 2019.
That’s when a dead Rice’s whale washed up near the Everglades. Scientists pushed it ashore, then swarmed the carcass, taking measurements and samples. They wrapped the 38-foot carcass in a blue tarp, loaded it on a flatbed truck and transported it to St. Petersburg. 
There it was buried in a deep sandy pit at Fort DeSoto to make it easier to strip the flesh from the skeleton, which would then go to the Smithsonian. I well remember the day several months later when they dug it back up. It’s not every day you see people with doctorate degrees wielding shovels and reminding everyone to breathe through their mouth, not their nose.
The Smithsonian’s collections manager was particularly eager to get the skull and skeleton to Washington.
“The way this population is going, I don’t know that I’ll ever get another chance,” he told me that day.
In case you were wondering what killed this big creature, it was done in by a small piece of plastic that became lodged in one of its stomachs. In other words, the cause of death should have been listed as human stupidity.
At the time, the scientists were referring to this as a type of Bryde’s whales, which are named after Johan Bryde, a Norwegian who built the first whaling stations in South Africa. 
A British newspaper, the Daily Mail, once called Bryde’s whales “the world’s weirdest whale,” because of their oddly eel-like appearance. Given Florida’s rampant and innate weirdness, it made sense to have the weirdest whale show up here.
But the whole time, the scientists suspected it might be something entirely new. 
In 2021, scientists announced they were finally sure. This whale was from a species they had never identified before. They named it after Dale Rice, a biologist who had looked at a photo of a whale stranded near the sleepy Panhandle town of Panacea in 1965 and theorized it was a new species. 
In the four years since then, scientists have put in a lot of work to learn about these rare mammals. They have lowered microphones underwater to pick up their moaning, mournful cries. They have dropped drones down over them to collect DNA samples. They have mapped their preferred terrain and habits, such as feeding near the sea floor in the daytime but swimming near the surface at night.
One group of biologists spent 21 days at sea in a 70-foot sailboat and floating lab called “The Song of the Whale.”

“The team successfully tagged seven Rice’s whales and collected approximately 65 hours of dive and movement data,” NOAA reported last year.
At the rate things are going, we’ll learn everything possible about them around the time the last one dies off.
 Time travel for whales

“Save the Whales” has been a rallying cry for environmental groups for decades. Activists were galvanized in 1975 when Greenpeace launched its initial anti-whaling campaign, sending its own boats to confront and stop the blood-soaked whaling ships.
There was even a Save the Whales benefit concert in 1976, featuring Joni Mitchell, John Sebastian, and Country Joe McDonald (who apparently didn’t bring his Fish, perhaps out of fear the whales would eat them.)
Back then there was bold talk about how saving the whales would save us humans. That was even the plot of a popular movie, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. The Enterprise crew had to time-travel back to Earth 1986 and rescue a couple of whales that could communicate with a destructive alien civilization threatening to end all humans.
But it turns out to be true. Not the time-travel part, but the rescuing the humans part.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The one difference is that the civilization destroying the Earth is our own. Our reliance on fossil fuels has created a warming world. As a result, we’re now seeing rapidly intensifying hurricanes like Melissa, beaches repeatedly eroding because of sea level rise, more pollution-fueled toxic algae blooms, and other symptoms of impending disaster. 
Our governor and Legislature are fighting back by shutting down discussions of what’s happening, which — surprise! — doesn’t fix the problem. Instead, we should be looking for potential solutions.
The International Monetary Fund — not exactly a gang of wild-eyed tree huggers — says one good strategy is protecting our whales.
“When it comes to saving the planet, one whale is worth thousands of trees,” the IMF said in 2019. “The carbon capture potential of whales is truly startling.”
The whales themselves sequester tons of carbon from the atmosphere, the IMF pointed out. And they attract phytoplankton, which suck up a lot more carbon before it can further heat up the planet.
“Nature has had millions of years to perfect her whale-based carbon sink technology,” the IMF noted. “All we need to do is let the whales live.”
But it seems we just can’t do that.
 A little batty

On the surface, so to speak — our size-obsessed president is a yuuuuge fan of whales.
He has repeatedly talked about how much he dislikes windmills because they supposedly kill lots of whales.
“They are washing up ashore,” Trump said in 2023. “The windmills are driving them crazy. They are driving the whales, I think, a little batty.”
Rice’s whale core distribution in the Gulf via NOAA.
Shortly after he was sworn in for his second term, he signed an executive order halting any new offshore federal leases for wind turbines.
 “If you’re into whales,” he said then, “you don’t want windmills.”
There are three yuuuuuge problems with that batty statement: 
1) According to NOAA, “There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities.”
2) His minions have stopped providing funding for two scientific research programs that were actually looking into the windmills’ non-lethal effects on whales.
3) Windmills aren’t nearly as bad for whales as offshore oil drilling.
Seismic surveys for offshore wind turbines and noise during their operation can cause problems for whales coping with the underwater clamor. But with offshore drilling, you get all the noise of the offshore wind industry, plus the additional risks of toxic oil spills that poison them and vessel traffic that can clobber them. 
In fact, five months ago, NOAA issued a biological opinion that said offshore oil drilling in the Gulf could doom the Rice’s whale to extinction unless the industry finds ways to lessen its impacts.
That’s not going to stop the plans to expand oil drilling, though. Our dear leader is insisting we’ve got to drill, baby, drill, because our energy industry is facing a dire national emergency.
Except it’s not. 
As one smart aleck (okay, it was me) wrote in January when Trump declared the energy emergency: “During Biden’s four years in office, the oil companies set records for both oil production and oil and gas company profits. Their only emergency is finding new pockets in which they can stuff all that cash.”
Instead, the oil industry is employing all its political influence to avoid being held liable for the damage done to our climate. If only they’d realize that the whales could help them out.
 Sea of chaos

A lot of environmental groups are gearing up to oppose this unnecessary offshore expansion. One of them is called Healthy Gulf. 
Christian Wagley via Healthy Gulf
Healthy Gulf’s Florida and Alabama organizer, Christian Wagley, told me they’re lining up scores of elected officials, business folks, and concerned coastal residents to bombard the federal government with their reasons for opposition. 
They will cite the BP oil spill’s obvious harm to the economy, chasing away tourists and spoiling everything from tourism to seafood. They will also bring up the harm to the whales and other wildlife.
“These are amazingly beautiful animals that are trying to survive in an industrialized sea of chaos,” Wagley told me. “They just need a little bit of quiet space to survive, and that’s not compatible with an aggressive plan for expanded offshore drilling.”
To boost participation — and increase public awareness — Healthy Gulf has been staging an annual springtime Gulf Coast Whale Festival on Pensacola Beach for the past two years. 
Tommy Tucker (Photo via Linkedin)
One of the people helping with the festival is a woman named Tommy Tucker, who’s listed as a “whale biologist and artist.” She makes whale puppets and banners to show people the size and features of the Rice’s whales.
During this year’s festival, she told me, she met a family who had been to the last one.
“I asked the kids what they knew about whales, and they told me, ‘Oh, we came last year, and we learned all this stuff,’ and they started rattling it all off from memory,” Tucker said. “That’s the whole reason we’re doing this.”
On second thought, maybe the scariest Halloween costume isn’t a Rice’s whale outfit.
Instead, I think you should dress up as an offshore oil well, one that’s leaking all over the place like Deepwater Horizon. 
Because that’s what’s going to doom the whales and then doom us all.

And we don’t know if that contract could be extended for even more money. Instead of developing an internal process that built on deep and genuine consultation with the broader UConn community, they have imposed outsiders on us.
We don’t need a cookie cutter budget approach that drains funds from UConn and passes the money instead to consultants who shop their same ideas from one university to the next. Heck, it would have been much cheaper to just buy a copy of the report from their last client!
As proud faculty members with decades of experience at UConn, we do agree that now is a good time to reconsider UConn’s budgetary and planning process. Higher education faces a difficult set of pressures. Yet at its core, a research university like UConn should be about research, teaching, outreach, and learning, and the beneficial ways that these things all complement and enrich each other. 
But for years UConn’s upper administration has sought to weaken academic departments and other units by draining their funds and reallocating the money for their own initiatives. Indeed, the administration has claimed that the goal of this new Kennedy & Company driven “Budget Transformation Initiative” is to “incentivize units to allocate resources in alignment with institutional priorities, rather than viewing funds as exclusively owned by individual departments.” 
But we have brilliant, creative colleagues and sharp, energetic students; the best model would directly empower them rather than let a few upper administrators decide budgets based on their latest initiatives. Such a heavy-handed approach has not worked well in the past, and it harms the scholarly and programmatic life on campus. It has weakened many of our graduate programs and, at least anecdotally, reduced the opportunities for stimulating scholarly and other student events on campus.
Academic departments and units are the beating hearts of the UConn community. They are where we find the writing, the labs, the projects, the presentations, and so much more that both strengthens UConn’s ties to Connecticut’s towns and cities and places our state at the forefront of national and international innovation. To repeatedly cut academic departments and units suggests that our administration neither understands nor values UConn’s distinct mission as a public land grant university. 
Let’s note, too, that when UConn’s leaders recently revised the FY26 deficit downward from $37.9 million to $12.6 million, they did not correspondingly reduce the amount they were pressing academic departments to cut. Not a peep about reducing or rescinding previous calls for departmental cuts.
The broader UConn community – the students, staff, and faculty who know UConn best and who make it work – was not involved in the decision to hire Kennedy & Company and to bring its “Budget Transformation Initiative” to our campus. While the administration imagines a multi-year process in which UConn’s “stakeholders” will serve on subcommittees and offer feedback, this is nothing like the genuine collaboration and shared governance that should guide the decisions of a major university. At best, these subcommittees will be placed in a position in which they are expected to endorse the BTI as a fait accompli while upper administration organizes a few “town halls” that are intended to, in Kennedy & Company’s words, gain the “buy-in” of the broader campus community. This is not shared governance.
This is, instead, a struggle over the best vision for UConn. We believe that the university – its students, staff, and faculty – thrive when the people who do the teaching, the research, and the learning that distinguishes UConn have an equal say in how its funds are spent. Outsourcing our flagship state university’s future to drop-in budget consultants is not the way forward.

The agency told residents they had a right to request hearings on major air permits — then turned around and denied every single one, claiming people failed to meet a secret standard the agency never told anyone about.
This wasn’t a technical mix-up. It was a quiet, deliberate move that shut out a town, a citizens’ group, and an environmental nonprofit from challenging a fossil fuel project proposed next to a middle school in one of the state’s worst ozone zones.
DEEP Told the Public One Thing, Then Did Another

Daniel Myers
Over the summer, DEEP rolled out new procedures under Public Act 25-84, a law meant to expand the public’s right to demand hearings on air permits. On its own website, DEEP instructed residents to “submit a petition form” — a form that has been online for years and requires no oath or notarization.
Three groups followed those instructions to the letter: the Town of Brookfield, Save the Sound, and Stop the Brookfield Compressor Station Expansion, a grassroots coalition of residents. Together, they represented roughly 20,000 people and more than 200 public comments.
All three petitions used DEEP’s form. All were rejected.
On October 15, DEEP’s hearing officer ruled that the petitions weren’t “verified pleadings,” a phrase borrowed from a completely different section of state law. This so-called requirement appears nowhere in the statute, nowhere on DEEP’s website, and nowhere in the form the agency itself provided.
In short, DEEP set the public up to fail.
The agency could have allowed petitioners to amend their filings, updated its forms, or offered a chance to correct the technical defect. Instead, it denied the petitions outright — stripping the public of the ability to contest the permit and relegating everyone to a toothless “informational hearing.”
What This Means for the Rest of Connecticut
This isn’t just about Brookfield. DEEP’s ruling sets a precedent for every air permit in the state. If it stands, no member of the public can rely on DEEP’s own instructions when trying to participate in environmental decisions that affect their communities.
The public did everything right. DEEP moved the goalposts.
And Governor Ned Lamont and Commissioner Katie Dykes appear content to let it happen.
For a law that was supposed to make government more accountable, this outcome does the opposite. It tells citizens that even when they play by the rules, the state can rewrite them afterward.
That’s not just bad governance. It’s an insult to every resident who believes transparency and public participation are the cornerstones of environmental protection in Connecticut.

“The message we can’t send to the entire world is that, ‘Entering the country illegally, it’s a crime, but don’t worry about it,’” Homan told the audience of over a thousand at the Sioux Falls Convention Center. 
Homan praised President Donald Trump’s immigration and border security policies. He said they have created “the most secure border in U.S. history.” He also criticized the Biden administration’s approach as relaxed enforcement that led to crime, trafficking and terrorism risks. 
Homan was invited to headline the event in person, but the federal government shutdown upended his travel plans.
Event organizer and lawyer Scott Abdallah said this year’s event drew record interest.
“Given what has happened in the last year with border enforcement in our country, we thought local law enforcement would be very interested to hear directly from the border czar,” he told South Dakota Searchlight.
He said former South Dakota governor and current Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem did not help coordinate the event.
“They’re different offices, as I understand it. I think they’re all kind of part of the same umbrella, but I worked with somebody separate and apart from Governor Noem’s office, if you will,” he said. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Homan formerly served as acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the previous Trump administration, from 2017 to 2018, and backed policies separating families at the southern border. Under that 2018 “zero tolerance” policy, at least 5,000 migrant families were separated. The Department of Homeland Security reunited about 74% of those families, according to a later report, but 998 children were not reunited.
MSNBC reported last month that Homan accepted a $50,000 cash payment from undercover FBI agents in a bribery sting before he began his current job with the Trump administration. Homan denies the allegations. 
Homan is also controversial for his role in mass deportations and other stepped-up immigration enforcement actions of the current Trump administration.
A group of South Dakota organizations denounced Homan’s selection as speaker for the Sioux Falls event. They included South Dakota Voices for Peace, NAACP Sioux Falls, The Hub SD, Que Pasa Sioux Falls, Bienvenidos a Brookings, Leaders Engaged and Determined (LEAD), COUP Council, and All Souls Unitarian Church. 
“The inhumane and degrading treatment of innocent people in the United States in broad daylight should be a red flag to all law enforcement and people of conscience that the values and laws that set the United States apart from other dictatorships across the world are eroding before our eyes,” said Taneeza Islam, CEO of South Dakota Voices for Peace.
The groups said in a statement they are “outraged” that the hosts would invite someone “who has clearly refuted the protections of due process and rights” found in the U.S. Constitution. 
“To elevate Tom Homan at a community celebration dishonors the very ideals of protection and compassion that law enforcement should uphold,” said Nieema Thasing, president of NAACP Sioux Falls.
The groups called Homan one of the “key decision makers ripping children from the arms of their moms and dads, deporting U.S. citizen children, deploying federal agents to cities across the United States, arresting U.S. citizens by stopping cars in the middle of the road and dragging innocent people into the street, publicly humiliating and shaming them and throwing them in jail.”
Scott Abdallah said the groups are “entitled to their opinion.”
“I think the law enforcement officers in this room would likely disagree with them,” he said.
Abdallah said ICE is unfairly critiqued. 
“Are people perfect? Is law enforcement perfect? No profession is perfect,” he said. “But I think the folks in this room are thankful that we have people out there that are willing to put their lives on the line to enforce the laws in the country.”

About 10,000 attendees packed into the Sandy and John Black Pavilion on the university’s Oxford campus. It was the latest stop on a tour of college campuses across the nation by the conservative grassroots organization Turning Point USA, founded by Charlie Kirk. 
“Your generation is living at a crossroads, and we are witnessing in real time the battle raging for the soul of your generation,” said Erika Kirk.  
The event marked the only joint appearance of the vice president and Erika Kirk, the newly minted CEO of Turning Point USA.   
Charlie Kirk, one of the nation’s most famous conservative activists, was scheduled to speak at the event before he was assassinated last month in Utah. Vance was asked to speak in his place in Oxford by Erika Kirk. The vice president delivered brief remarks honoring the life of Charlie Kirk, whom he called a personal friend. 
Vance also took questions from audience members, a hallmark of the late conservative activist Kirk, who built a media empire in part based on viral videos of himself verbally sparring with college students.

“We ought to have faith that the best way to make sure the best idea wins is to actually just have a discussion. And that is what this event is all about, that is what Turning Point USA is all about,” Vance said. “We’re going to have a discussion tonight, and that is what Charlie would want us to do.” 
Calling himself a “geriatric millennial,” Vance aimed a large portion of his remarks at young people. He said the Trump administration’s immigration policies would limit competition for new entrants to the labor market, which he said would prevent immigrants from driving down wages. 
Vance, who has in the past railed against “childless cat ladies,” also filled his remarks with appeals to college students to have children when they are young and anchor their lives around family.
“While you’re young, have those babies if you’re able to,” Vance said. 
The future of the country would be best served with a “properly rooted Christian moral order” at its core, Vance added. 
That sentiment pulsed through both Vance’s remarks and Erika Kirk’s. She called her presence on campus “a spiritual reclaiming of territory.”
She called Generation Z, which is trending rightward according to some surveys, the “courageous generation.”
“My husband believed that to his core,” Kirk said. “That’s why he went on campuses. That’s why he was trying to reach you.” 
Vance also revealed what he said was a never-before-shared anecdote about Kirk, whom he called the most effective political figure he had ever seen. The vice president said Kirk once called him with concerns about the Trump administration’s policies in the Middle East. The call reminded the administration that Kirk’s audience no longer supported sending American soldiers to fight in foreign entanglements, Vance said.     
A sea of red “Make America Great Again” and white “47” caps were worn by much of the jubilant crowd inside the arena. Seated in the front rows was a who’s who of Mississippi’s Republican political leadership. Attendees included Gov. Tate Reeves, U.S. Sens. Roger Wicker and Cindy Hyde Smith, Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and Attorney General Lynn Fitch. 
Emily Lecler, a University of Mississippi student from Green Bay, Wisconsin, attended the event as a volunteer for the Turning Point chapter on campus. Kirk and his organization appealed to her because it counters what she sees as an “anti-American” sentiment on college campuses
“If you want the cookie-cutter model of how we should be. He is the umbrella of everything Turning Point stands for. Godly, American,” Lecler said. “I think when he died it was really hard, but it pushed people in the right direction and opened a lot of people’s eyes.”
But there was also opposition on campus. 
A coalition of student groups opposed to the Turning Point rally hosted a counter event that featured speakers such as California Congressman Ro Khanna and Tennessee state Rep. Gloria Johnson, a member of the “Tennessee Three,” a group of Democratic lawmakers who were expelled by the Republican majority over a protest over a gun-control protest in the Legislature in 2023.
The coalition also released a statement focusing, among other issues, on the Trump administration’s attempts to exert more federal control over the American higher education system. The administration has threatened to withhold federal funding from disfavored institutions and has asked universities to agree to conservative priorities such as caps on numbers of international students, limited definitions of gender and embracing the idea that “academic freedom is not absolute.”

The student groups, which included the College Democrats, called Wednesday’s Turning Point event an attempt to “provide academic legitimacy to the hatred, suppression of free speech, and over-partisanship championed by the administration of President Trump and Vice President Vance.” 
The statement also referenced what it called a “complicated history, full of troublesome lapses in moral clarity, and this event brings just one more speaker whose legacy will not endure the test of time.”
The University of Mississippi occupies a unique status in the nation’s history of political divisions playing out on college campuses. 
In 1962, a white mob erupted in violence when James Meredith, a Black man, fought to integrate the university. U.S. marshals protected him on and off the Oxford campus. The episode became one of the most consequential confrontations over desegregation in American higher education, and the university has honored Meredith several times since. 
Decades later, against the backdrop of new political division, a heavy law enforcement presence again watched over the university after Kirk’s assassination seven weeks ago.  
Turning Point became a multimillion-dollar operation under Charlie Kirk’s leadership and was credited with helping to return Trump to office. 
Since Kirk’s killing, his podcast and social media have attracted millions of new followers. There has been an outpouring of interest in expanding Turning Point’s footprint on college and high school campuses, the group has said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29201455/829A0307.jpg,,,2025-10-29 23:16:44.498639
,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-30 02:09:13+00:00,CT Mirror,"As shutdown drags on, US Rep. Jahana Hayes recalls time as a SNAP recipient",Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/29/jahana-hayes-government-shutdown-lisa-hagen/,The congresswoman spoke in a livestreamed interview with the Connecticut Mirror's Washington reporter Lisa Hagen on Wednesday evening.,"Over the course of a conversation about the suspension of the SNAP food assistance program, U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes looked back Wednesday night to her times as a teacher of children experiencing hunger and as a struggling mother whose path to college and career was unconventional.
“You know, when my kids were little, I was on SNAP. I was on food stamps,” Hayes said. “It was the difference between me putting my kids to bed hungry, and not. When I was a student going to school, working two jobs, I was still qualified for the program. So I know that there are people out there doing everything that they can and still just can’t get by trying to provide for their children.”
Hayes spoke in a livestreamed video interview with the Connecticut Mirror’s Washington reporter Lisa Hagen in a studio at Connecticut Public in Hartford, the latest in a series of in-person interviews with top elected officials.
The conversation focused on the federal government shutdown that will enter its second month on Saturday, the same day the administration of President Donald J. Trump will suspend SNAP, the food program that helps feed 42 million Americans every month, including 366,000 in Connecticut.
Hayes had news to share during the interview. A federal judge in Boston will hear arguments Thursday in the lawsuit filed Tuesday on behalf of Connecticut and two dozen other states. The complaint alleged that the suspension of SNAP is unnecessary and violates congressional directives. The states are seeking an injunction blocking the suspension.
“If that happens, the 25 states who are involved will see relief if the judge agrees that those funds should be released,” Hayes said.
[RELATED: CT, other states sue Trump administration over SNAP suspension]
Hayes, 52, is a Democrat, a cop’s wife, and a former Waterbury school teacher who represents the 5th Congressional District of western Connecticut. She won her first term in 2018, two years after her selection as the national teacher of the year gave her a national profile and an unexpected entree to congressional politics.
She was one of two women of color elected to Congress from Connecticut and Massachusetts that year. They were the first elected from New England.
Hayes recalled her arrival in Washington in January 2019. It came during a previous federal government shutdown, one at the mid-point of Donald J. Trump’s first term in the White House.
“In the class of 2019 there were 89 of us, and it was weird, because we all had family and friends come in from around the country,” Hayes said. “And one thing that I remember is that many of the federal buildings, the museums were closed. Some of the garbage collection wasn’t being done.”
After taking the oath, she recalled hurrying to a Democratic caucus. Her class brought Democrats back as the House majority, returning Nancy Pelosi as speaker. Republicans retained control of the Senate and, of course, the White House. She recalled it as a time of urgency and purpose.
Six years later, she is the ranking Democrat on a nutrition subcommittee, and she sees the suspension of SNAP in the larger context of a fraying social safety net. To casual observers, Hayes said, the threat to SNAP is new and unexpected. But not to Hayes.
“Attacks on SNAP have been literally a part of every legislative package that we’ve had to vote on,” she said. “SNAP was at the center with the farm bill, other budgets. It’s a program that, every time we have to negotiate, that’s something that my Republican colleagues want to cut.”
Hayes complained that the House Republican majority is trying to dictate the terms of a continuing resolution that would temporarily fund the government in the absence of a budget. House Speaker Mike Johnson has not called a session since Sept. 19, and the GOP’s negotiating stance is “take it or leave it,” she said.
“I think the challenge is, if it were just SNAP, this would be a really easy conversation,” she said.
Republicans hold a majority in both chambers, but they lack the votes to pass the measure in the Senate without at least some Democratic support.
Democrats are holding out for an extension of tax credits passed during the COVID pandemic, first in the American Rescue Plan Act and then in the bipartisan infrastructure law. The credits, which subsidize premiums for health coverage under the Affordable Care Act, are set to expire at year’s end, dramatically driving up premiums.
Hayes said she saw Republican pleas for a vote on a “clean bill,” one without the health subsidies, as disingenuous. Given the GOP’s refusal to engage in negotiations, the Democrats do not trust that the subsidies would get a fair hearing.
“I’ve heard [Senate majority leader John] Thune say, ‘Let’s open the government and we can talk about health care subsidies. I promise you a vote.’ There’s a trust deficit here,” Hayes said.
Congress has previously authorized the spending of contingency funds to continue SNAP, but the Trump administration ignores that, she said. 
At the same time, she complained, there is news the administration is ready to buy two Gulfstream jets for use by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, demolish the East Wing of the White House for a ballroom, and deliver an aid package to a Trump ally in Argentina.
None of that helps create trust, she said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-29-193350-1024x649.png,,,2025-10-29 22:16:59.097084

Perkins Hospital Center, has made strides in easing a staffing shortage, while working to mitigate safety concerns for both staff and patients, lawmakers were told Thursday.","State health officials told lawmakers Wednesday that they are making progress toward reducing staff shortages and mitigating safety concerns for staff and patients at Maryland’s troubled forensic psychiatric facility, the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center. (Photo courtesy state of Maryland)Maryland’s troubled forensic psychiatric facility, the Clifton T. Perkins Hospital Center, has made strides in easing a staffing shortage, while working to mitigate safety concerns for both staff and patients, lawmakers were told Wednesday.
Perkins CEO Aliya Jones told the Joint Committee on Fair Practices and State Personnel Oversight that while the job vacancy rate at the Jessup facility is still the highest of the Maryland Department of Health’s 11 facilities, it has fallen from about 26% last year to 17.6% today.
She said that of the 95 positions that have been filled since January, 43 are clinical team members — which are notably understaffed and at risk due to their close contact with “individuals that are most difficult to manage.”
Problems had been reported for years at Perkins, but they came to a head last year when reporting by The Washington Post uncovered mismanagement, a hostile workplace and safety problems that led to clashes with patients, a brawl, a rape and the death of a patient. Conditions at the facility just fed the staff flight.
Staff shortages at the 289-bed facility, in turn, led to forced overtime for many workers, which could lead to safety issues and worsen personnel problems, Sen. Clarence Lam (D-Anne Arundel and Howard) said during Wednesday’s hearing.
“Part of the concern is that people are being pulled in, or there were a lot of call outs, and people were being mandatorily called in — all that was leading to cascading overtime and significant cost,” Lam said. “Its really important to have adequate staffing, and the higher need for overtime probably exacerbates that.”
Lawmakers say consistency, efficiency needed in boards licensing health professionals

Jones took over in February, following the resignation of interim CEO Dwain Shaw in January after the termination of previous CEO Scott Moran in May 2024.
“My leadership came at a critical point — the hospital was facing very significant challenges related to workforce stability, infrastructure deterioration and declining staff morale,” said Jones, citing the “explosive” news articles that detailed safety concerns and the “challenges” the facility faced.
Among the challenges Perkins faced were 60-year-old boilers that had been there since Perkins’ opening and were well past their life expectancy. They have been replaced by newly installed boilers scheduled to come online in December.
“The challenges that we have at our facility are not because the facility was neglected for the past two or three years,” Jones said. “It’s because the facility had been neglected for dozens of years.”
Union representative Denise Gilmore of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, Council 3, said that while improvements are still needed, reduction in job vacancies is good news and she concluded that things are headed in the right direction.
Committee co-chair Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery) acknowledged the deferred maintenance managers inherited, noting that the boiler replacement was 25 to 40 years overdue. The other co-chair, Sen. Katie Fry Hester (D-Howard and Montgomery), twice referred to the boilers as “antique” during the hearing.
“It’s kind of scary to think you’re bringing people to work there to see if they want to work there when we have the boiler situation that we just discussed,” Charkoudian said, after a discussion of in-person worksite visits as a recruitment strategy.
Perkins was initially denied re-accreditation in April by the Joint Commission due to “environmental and infection control issues,” Jones said, citing rust and mold in the facility. She said Perkins was able to regain its accreditation that same month after getting support from various state departments, and the facility is following up with contractors to make sure the mold is gone for good.
Jones’ effort to recruit more people to work at Perkins relies strongly on the work culture of the facility, which she hopes to make more accountable and dependable through recognition.
“It is very important to recognize and appreciate our staff who work in our very challenged work environment — and even on a good day, it’s a challenging environment in which to work,” she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Dr. Anita Everett, who oversees all 11 hospitals in the system, told lawmakers Wednesday that, “This deep change at Perkins will take a while to get there — deep changes, of course, take a minute.”
Nursing home inspection backlog progress
Lawmakers were also told Wednesday that the health department’s Office of Health Care Quality has cut the nursing home inspection backlog by 83% since December 2023, falling 172 backlogged facilities then to 26 as of Oct. 15.
Previous reports on the backlog had raised concerns about potential unsafe living conditions for seniors. Annual full surveys of nursing homes are supposed to inspect quality of care, food, facilities and staffing, said Tia Witherspoon-Udocox, executive director of the office.
The 26 remaining backlogged surveys have not been inspected since 2023 or 2024. State officials had planned to have the backlog cleared up by this December, but those plans were upset by the government shutdown. The office is currently not allowed to conduct annual surveys, but can only investigate immediate-jeopardy or high-risk complaints.
The office was able to reduce the backlog by hiring more surveyors — bringing the total to 61 health facility surveyor nurses — and lessening the time it takes to train surveyors from 12 to seven months. Inefficient and unnecessary parts of the training were cut, leaving only the most critical aspects, said Meg Sullivan, the deputy secretary for public health services.
“This is just an incredible priority for us to make sure that we are doing the surveys we need to do and doing them well, but we also are very mindful of ongoing challenges moving forward that we are consistently talking about and addressing so that we can make sure we are able to continue this progress, and don’t find ourselves stepping backwards,” Sullivan said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Clifton-T.-Perkins-Hospital.jpg,,,2025-10-29 21:56:35.609094

But, a charging decision from the Salt Lake County District Attorney’s office still hasn’t come, and Ah Loo’s widow now plans to file a lawsuit in her quest for answers. 
James McConkie, the attorney representing Laura Ah Loo, said on Wednesday that his team is seeking more details about the shooting from Salt Lake City, and a speedier decision from the district attorney’s office on whether or not it’ll be pursuing charges against the shooter.

“Thirdly,” McConkie said, “we are about to file a lawsuit, because we need to seek transparency, to find out what happened in this situation that may have contributed to a more dangerous environment for those who were protesting, exercising their constitutional rights.”
Ah loo was killed on June 14 in a chaotic scene when an armed member of the event’s “peacekeeping team” saw Arturo Gamboa, a demonstrator, openly carrying a rifle, which is permitted under Utah law. The “peacekeeper” fired three rounds, grazing Gamboa and killing Ah Loo, a bystander, according to the Salt Lake City Police. 
‘Feels like losing the sun’: Afa Ah Loo’s larger-than-life legacy

Since then, details about the event’s organization have been unclear. The national 50501 group, which organized the No Kings protests across the country disowned the Utah chapter for violating its “strict no-weapons policy,” and Salt Lake City changed its special events permitting process after discovering that the No Kings protest applicant may have submitted the permit application under an alias and didn’t disclose plans to use armed security in the June event. 
McConkie said he believes the lawsuit will help his team “find lapses that created a dangerous situation,” including the deployment of private armed security. 
“One of the reasons for that is that the police are empowered and trained to know what to do in these types and kinds of situations, and are more likely to be honored and obeyed,” McConkie said. “When a private peacekeeper draws a pistol and fires into a crowd, it’s simply unacceptable.”
The attorneys may file the lawsuit in a few weeks, first against the peacekeeper who fired the shots, whose name has not yet been released by law enforcement. And then, as more details emerge in court proceedings, McConkie’s team will decide whether or not to include the city, the Salt Lake City Police Department, or the national and local chapters of 50501 as defendants in the case, he said.



Let us know what you think...


 


In the meantime, Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said in a statement that his office expects to reach a decision soon.
“We sympathize with the pain and loss suffered by the Ah Loo family. We met with them early in the process and explained that this review would take time. We have been open and available to any reach in from their counsel from our first meeting and continue to be,” Gill said. “We are carefully working through a complex and nuanced legal analysis.”
In McConkie’s view, this case isn’t complex enough to take this long, he said. One of the reasons, McConkie said, is that the incident was recorded, showing that Gamboa didn’t raise his gun and wasn’t threatening anyone when the shooting happened.
“If the police had handled that situation instead of a safety officer or private guard, we believe they would have been trained to have gone up to the person carrying the weapon,” McConkie said. “He has a right to do it in the state of Utah, to open-carry a weapon.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The Montana Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics and Confluence Public Health Alliance are the latest groups asking Gov. Greg Gianforte to use state money to pay $14 million in SNAP benefits, for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
In a letter Wednesday, Dr. Atty Moriarty, of the American Academy of Pediatrics, and Lisa Dworak, with Confluence, urged Gianforte to take “immediate steps” to ensure financial support for food for families during the federal shutdown.
Their request follows a separate letter earlier this week from more than 50 organizations including United Way programs and food banks urging action in the face of a cutoff of federal SNAP benefits.
The federal government directed states to stop making the payments in November. In September, SNAP payments went to 77,679 Montanans, with an average payment of $173.
Food banks and other social services organizations are bracing for an increase in demand as a result, and the professional associations are raising concerns about the health of Montanans and ability of children to learn in school.
But Gianforte said the state will not fund a federal program without the promise of federal reimbursement.
“While the governor believes these benefits are vital for vulnerable Montanans, he has been clear that the state cannot fund this federal program, which is funded by federal dollars, without promises for reimbursement,” said Gianforte spokesperson Kaitlin Price in an email. “Gov. Gianforte continues to urge Senate Democrats to do their job and pass a continuing resolution instead of holding taxpayer dollars hostage that fund these critical programs.”
State lawmakers, however, said they already planned for exactly this situation, a reduction or rescission of federal funds, the state has the money to cover it, and the governor has the authority to act, regardless of gridlock in Washington, D.C.
Rep. Mary Caferro, a consistent advocate for food security, said federal solutions exist, but the debate around them doesn’t matter. That’s because the state itself has solutions, she said.
“The legislature set up some really sensible laws to avert a crisis like this,” said Caferro, a Democrat from Helena. “And the governor needs to pay attention to those laws and do something. We have the tools right here.”
She and others said the legislature ensured that one of the purposes of a state account, the debt and liability free account, is to replace dollars the federal government removes.
She and others said that account has $268 million, and SNAP would need $15 million of it for November.
“It’s a drop in the bucket,” Caferro said.
Rep. James Reavis, a Democrat from Billings who raised questions about SNAP at a recent legislative budget update, agreed. He said he believes the federal government must repay Montana.
“But we do have to contend with the possible reality that those payments would not be honored,” Reavis said.
In the meantime, though, he said Montana has a pot of money designed to help, the state can afford it, but it can’t afford to wait.
He said roughly $43 million of the $268 million in the debt and liability free account is available.
“It really needs to be done as soon as possible,” Reavis said, citing technical issues, such as ones related to vendors, that would need to be ironed out.
 Montana Food Bank Network, partners, friends

Tuesday, the Montana Food Bank Network was meeting with its partners to talk about demand in a time CEO Gayle Carlson described as “very unprecedented.”
The letter led by the Montana Food Bank Network said the loss will affect families and the economy.
“A disruption in SNAP benefits would have a devastating impact not only on Montana families, but also on retailers and producers across the state — putting at risk more than $14 million that directly supports our local economies,” the letter said.
A survey a couple of weeks ago showed roughly half of the Network’s partners had seen an increase in demand, and half had not, based on the ones that responded, Carlson said.
But the situation is compounding.
With the federal shutdown underway, federal employees are missing paychecks, and SNAP payments will stop as of Saturday, Nov. 1, for an impact that could be “pretty traumatic,” Carlson said.
She said local food banks aren’t designed to provide all the support that may be needed.
“They’re going to lean on their food banks for more demand,” Carlson said. “That’s going to be a challenge for us.”
 Pediatrics association, Confluence

The letter from Moriarty and Dworak to Gianforte and Department of Public Health and Human Services Director Charlie Brereton pointed to a different way the state of Montana could help.
Citing a report from the Legislative Fiscal Division, they said Montana ended the 2025 fiscal year with $769 million, much more than expected, and the governor and head of DPHHS could authorize “a small fraction.”
“Our members hear directly from Montanans worried about being unable to feed themselves and their families without November SNAP benefits,” the letter said. “Seniors have reached out to public health departments for advice and assistance, and parents have called pediatricians worried about how to put dinner on the table.
“We are concerned about the health of our fellow Montanans if food aid lapses.”
 Political finger pointing

Western Native Voice’s Keaton Sunchild, based in Washington, D.C., earlier told the Daily Montanan that SNAP benefits had been used as a negotiating tactic by the White House and Senate leadership to try to force support for a continuing resolution.
Republicans in the Senate have tried to garner enough votes for such a measure, but Democrats have said they won’t budge unless there’s a plan to continue the enhanced tax credits in the Affordable Care Act too.
The federal government shut down on Oct. 1.
In the U.S. Senate, the parties have been at loggerheads since as pressures mount from labor leaders to reopen the government and many Americans sit on the brink of skyrocketing health care premiums.
While social services providers grapple with the coming SNAP fallout, the finger pointing has trickled down to the state level.
Through a spokesperson, Gianforte has repeatedly blamed Senate Democrats.
However, the governor has not addressed whether he has asked the Trump administration to pledge to reimburse Montana if it does spend money on SNAP benefits or if he has advocated the administration release its own contingency funds for SNAP.
In the meantime, the Montana Democratic Party launched a food drive to help, but used the announcement to credit itself with “leading” in the crisis and blaming Republicans in Washington, D.C.
“One of the best things about living in Montana is that Montanans show up for each other,” said Justin Ailport, interim executive director of the Montana Democratic Party, in a statement.
“Senator (Steve) Daines, Senator (Tim) Sheehy, Congressman (Ryan) Zinke, and Congressman (Troy) Downing seem to have forgotten that core value, while they’re selling out Montanans left and right to score points in Washington.
In a statement, Sheehy blamed Democrats for “putting critical resources Montanans rely on at risk.”
“The only reason SNAP is in jeopardy is because Chuck Schumer and Senate Democrats shut down the government and have now voted against a nonpartisan government funding bill thirteen times in a row,” Sheehy said, blaming Democrats for “choosing to rob Americans of a functioning government.”
In a social media post Tuesday, Daines also blamed Senate Democrats for the shutdown and imminent loss of SNAP benefits.
Spokespeople for U.S. Reps. Zinke and Downing could not be reached late Wednesday.
Rep. Downing’s website about resources during the shutdown still said SNAP benefits were among services that would continue, albeit with potential disruptions in a “prolonged shutdown.”

The Republican majority on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee voted 10-9 for a resolution to bringing the General Services Administration one step closer to making the Reagan building the new home for about 6,000 FBI employees.
The move was quickly condemned by Maryland’s two senators, who said the law still requires that the new headquarters be in Greenbelt, after a competititino to find a new home for the agency.
This decision reverses what the agency chose in 2023 to relocate employees from the aging FBI headquarters in the J. Edgar Hoover Building to a site in Prince George’s County near the Greenbelt Metrorail station. Prior to that decision, more than a decade of studies and competition between Maryland and Virginia took place to bring the FBI to their respective jurisdictions.
Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), who is a member of the committee, said the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022 required the GSA to select one of three sites – two in Prince George’s County and one in Springfield, Virginia.
“The Reagan Building and DC were not eligible sites under the law,” said Alsobrooks served as Prince George’s County executive from 2018 until her election to the Senet. “The [Trump] administration’s decision to abandon years of planning and process is a clear violation of that law.
“The new site of the FBI headquarters should not be one based on politics,” she said before Wednesday’s vote. “The law established a clear path. Congress provided funding and oversight and GSA made its selection. That selection remains the only legitimate choice.”
Both Alsobrooks and Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) argued that the Reagan building’s location and design “are inconsistent with federal security standards,” that are required for the FBI. Among other security shortcomings, they pointed to public access to a parking garage for other tenants in the Reagan building.
Democrats on the committee Wednesday tried to add language to the resolution that would have prohibited spending on a new headquarters “until the Federal Bureau of Investigation and General Services Administration complete an in-depth assessment and determine that the Ronald Reagan Building is capable of meeting the Interagency Security Committee’s level 5 requirements and provide that assessment to Congress.”
The Republican majority rejected that language.
“In taking this unprecedented step to overrule the Committee’s minority in this decision, Republicans are undermining the mission and safety of the men and women of the FBI and also setting a dangerous precedent for future Committee decisions,” Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said in a statement. “They have become rubber stamps for a lawless president. They should be ashamed.”
According to a GSA prospectus on the move, the estimated project cost for design, construction, management and inspection would be nearly $843.7 million. With an additional $555 million from the FBI that would include pre-construction and “fit-out requirements,” it would raise the amount to nearly $1.4 billion.
The GSA states in document a “30-year, present value cost analysis” that the total for refurbishing Reagan building would be $1.6 billion; new construction for a headquarters would cost $2.4 billion.
“The current dispersion and fragmentation of headquarters functions across multiple locations within the National Capital Region has created challenges to effective collaboration. Dispersion diverts time and resources, hampers coordination, and decreases operational flexibility,” the prospectus said.
“By collocating personnel in a modern headquarters solution, FBI’s workforce will have the space and technology needed to support its mission of protecting the American people and upholding the Constitution.”
 
Sen. Shelly Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), chair of the public works committee, said before the vote that the plan to abandon Greenbelt in favor of the Reagan building “addresses the needs and mission of the FBI and utilizes an existing federal building with a reasonable investment and renovation, instead of significant expense and time waiting for new construction.”
“I believe the GSA’s plan is a responsible and efficient way to address this year’s long problem,” Moore Capito said.

Michelle Lujan Grisham announces $30 million in emergency funding to compensate for lost SNAP food benefits for the first 10 days in November.,"New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, state officials, lawmakers, food bank leaders and farmers held a news conference on Oct. 29, 2025 at John Brooks Supermarket in Albuquerque. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)The State of New Mexico will provide $30 million starting Nov. 1 in an emergency response to counter the pending stop of federal food assistance for the first 10 days of the month, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced on Wednesday.
The state plan follows the United States Department of Agriculture’s recent announcement that it would stop funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program at the end of October due to the ongoing federal shutdown. The agency then rebuffed requests from members of Congress—including New Mexico’s delegation—to use contingency funds to guarantee no pause in SNAP benefits. 
The money comes from state emergency funds replenished during the Oct. 1 special session when lawmakers added $30 million to the state’s contingency fund, which the governor can spend down without needing legislative approval for disaster declarations. In this case, the governor is issuing 40 executive orders authorizing $750,000 each—the maximum allowed under state law—to provide $30 million that the state’s Health Care Authority will distribute onto existing EBT cards for SNAP-eligible New Mexicans starting on Nov. 1. 
The state has the highest SNAP participation in the U.S.: 460,000 New Mexico residents, or 21% of the population, and typically receives from the federal government—the state says—$80 to $90 million monthly in SNAP benefits.
In announcing the emergency funding during a news conference at John Brooks Supermarket in Albuquerque alongside state officials, lawmakers, food bank leaders and farmers, Lujan Grisham credited the state Legislature during a recent special legislative session for setting aside funds to compensate for federal shortfall.

“They came to work,” she said, “the opposite of a shutdown. They’re doing their job every single day, and Republicans in Congress should do their damn job in the same way that our legislators, bipartisan, are standing up for New Mexicans.”
NM House Speaker Javier Martínez (D-Albuquerque) called the denial of SNAP disbursements a “manufactured crisis” by the Trump Administration during the news conference. 
“Trump has the ability to fund SNAP through money that’s already been appropriated, they’re choosing not to,” Martínez said. “What they’re telling the American people and what they’re telling New Mexicans is that they have to choose between their health care or putting food on the table.”

Members of New Mexico’s all-Democratic congressional delegation this week introduced legislation that would require USDA to continue funding SNAP.
The governor said state officials are evaluating options for addressing needs after Nov. 10 and said another special legislative session is one of the options. She also acknowledged the possibility that the USDA could reverse its position and release funding.
The funding is intended to act as a “bridge,” HCA Secretary Kari Armijo said during the news conference, to cover approximately 30% of residents’ benefit for November; the elderly and disabled recipients will receive at least $100. Armijo said the agency “will be sending a lot of messages out to our customers in the next couple of days, making sure that they understand what they’ll see on those EBT cards.”
Armijo told Source NM after the news conference that EBT cards will work the same way as they have.
“When people swipe their SNAP card, it draws against an account, typically that’s the federal account, but they’re going to draw against the state’s account” for the first 10 days in November.
Armijo said the state is setting aside a small portion of the $30 million in funds for people with the greatest need — but that other SNAP applications will likely be processed in December or after the reopening of the federal government.

The state will also continue to accept SNAP applications, and partner with food banks, schools and other organizations, a news release from the governor’s office said. 
“We have all worked together with our Legislature, with the governor’s office, for years, to build this incredible system of support for New Mexicans,” The Food Depot Executive Director Jill Dixon, who also serves as president of the New Mexico Association of Food Banks, said during the news conference. “And gosh, my heart is racing. This is the best day I’ve had in weeks. New Mexicans rise together. We take care of each other. We believe in community and reaching out to one another when times are really hard. I’ve seen that again and again in 13 years of food banking, but I have never seen a day like today.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/John-Brooks-Front-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-29 20:16:52.046360

Jeff Landry says the state will provide food aid to the elderly, disabled and qualifying families with children if the federal government doesn't provide assistance in November, but other ""able-bodied"" participants  in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will have to rely on food banks if the federal government shutdown isn't resolved by Nov. 1.  (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Nearly 800,000 people who depend on federal food aid will see no interruption in those benefits for November, according to Gov. Jeff Landry. 
They include the elderly, disabled and families with children who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which the Trump administration has said will not provide benefits starting Saturday amid the ongoing federal government shutdown.
But another 53,000 “able-bodied” SNAP recipients who aren’t in one of those categories will have to lean on their local food banks as long as the shutdown persists, according to the governor. 
Landry said at a news conference Wednesday his health department will find the money to cover $147 million in benefits next month for the elderly, disabled and children. These recipients typically get their SNAP disbursements on the first few days of the month.
As for other recipients, the governor said he would provide more details Thursday on a plan to ensure food banks are able to meet their needs. 
“We’ve been talking to the food banks over the last week about what it will take to bulk up supplies, to charge up the supply chain of getting more food to the food banks to prepare for families. They’re in that process,” Louisiana Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein told reporters after the governor’s news conference.

The governor’s plans do not mesh with earlier statements from Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, who had indicated benefits would be provided to all Louisiana SNAP recipients.  
Henry told reporters earlier in the day that while the elderly, children and disabled would get food assistance first, other SNAP participants would get theirs through the remainder of the month. He did acknowledge that Landry has final say in how the state spends the money. 
Henry and House Speaker Phillip DeVillier, R-Eunice, stood at the governor’s side at the news conference where he laid out his plans for SNAP benefits disbursement.  
Louisiana Republicans move election dates with hopes of redistricting for 2026 midterms

Henry and state lawmakers had just concluded a one-week special session Thursday to move back 2026 congressional primary election dates. Before adjourning, they approved a resolution to support Landry’s use of a reserve revenue fund for SNAP benefits if the impasse in Washington, D.C., extends into December. Henry said the legislature’s action wasn’t necessary for the governor to use the Revenue Stabilization Trust Fund, which has a balance of about $2 billion.
The legislative resolution faced no opposition as it went through the approval process until Wednesday, when Sen. Jay Morris, R-West Monroe, voted against it. Morris told senators that while he did not take issue with their support for the measure, he feels there is a “gun being pointed to our head by the federal government.”
“This is not our program,” Morris said before the vote. “If you step back and look at it from a distance, it’s ridiculous that we are being forced to bail out the largest source of wealth in the world … the United States government. I think it sets a bad precedent.”
While Morris kept his arguments party neutral, Sen. Valarie Hodges, R-Denham Springs, laid blame for the government shutdown at the feet of U.S. Senator Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. The New York Democrat is willing to let veterans and children go hungry rather than compromise, she said. Her comments were similar to those later in the day from the governor, who referenced the “Schumer Shutdown” and said he would be responsible for any problems Louisiana had in dispersing its food benefits.
Congressional Democrats say they will not vote to reopen the government unless Republicans agree to extend subsidies for health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act, which expire at the end of the year.  
In response to Hodges’ remarks, Henry provided a rundown of the number of SNAP recipients in the districts of Democratic and Republican senators. All fell in the 20,000 range. 
“If you’re trying to put Ds and Rs on this, it ain’t gonna work,” Henry said.  
Both chambers also approved nonbinding resolutions that urge Congress to end the federal government shutdown and refund the money Louisiana spends on SNAP benefits.
A leaked memo from the U.S. Department of Agriculture indicates states that step in to cover federal food assistance will not be reimbursed.
Landry was asked if he thinks the federal government will eventually reimburse Louisiana for providing a bridge while SNAP benefits are suspended. The governor said he had spoken recently to U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, both of Louisiana, who he said agreed that the state’s costs should be covered.
“The question is, right now, we can’t get Democrats in the Senate to agree on anything,” Landry said.

The three finalists do not include the administrator who has been running the university on an interim basis in recent months. 
An LSU presidential search committee announced Wednesday it’s chosen McNeese State President Wade Rousse, University of Alabama Provost James Dalton and former University of Arizona President Robert Robbins as finalists for the position. 
The three candidates will be invited for campus visits Thursday, Friday and Monday, when they’ll meet in public with faculty, staff and students. Private meetings with student representatives, campus leaders and athletics administrators are also planned. 
Robbins’ campus visit will take place Thursday, with Dalton planned for Friday and Rousse on Monday. 
The LSU Board of Supervisors will meet Tuesday to select a president from the three finalists.

It was considered a surprise the search committee did not name interim President Matt Lee one of the finalists. LSU Board Chairman Scott Ballard praised Lee in an interview after Wednesday’s meeting. 
“I can’t tell you how much I think Matt Lee is deserving of everything good that happens to him,” Ballard said. “You know, the votes were not there for him. It’s hard to be the interim and going into the presidency.” 
LSU Faculty Senate President Dan Tirone said Lee was favored by the faculty. Of the remaining candidates, Tirone said he believes the faculty would favor Dalton or Robbins for their experience running major research institutions. 
Rousse is considered to be the frontrunner for the position, thanks to the backing of LSU Board Vice Chairman Lee Mallett, a major political donor to Gov. Jeff Landry. Members of the board serve at the pleasure of the governor, who also selects its chair. 
During interviews, Mallett asked pointed questions to all five candidates, highlighting their weaknesses and allowing them an opportunity to respond. 
In addition to Lee, the search committee also eliminated Tulane Vice President for Research Giovanni Piedimonte, who was previously a finalist for senior leadership positions at two other universities and was also eliminated from their pools. 
Each candidate was asked about their strategies to place LSU among the nation’s top research universities, as well as their plans for student and faculty retention. 
James Dalton
Dalton was added to the pool of candidates Wednesday. He had traveled to Louisiana and was included in the interviews, though some search committee members seemed unaware he had joined the field of semifinalists. 
Dalton told the committee he had a “delay” in applying for the LSU position. 
His background is in pharmacy and developing prescription drugs. He has been provost at Alabama since 2020 and previously worked at Michigan, Ohio State and the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. 
Dalton said LSU should become a student-centric university, with smaller class sizes. One of his priorities would be to improve LSU’s retention rate for students after two years. 
As an out-of-state candidate, Dalton said his first priority as president would be to get to know all 64 Louisiana parishes. He advocated for aligning the university’s priorities with those of Landry and the legislature. 
Landry’s interest in LSU has been controversial, including calling for the firing of professors who have criticized him and advocating for the university to erect a statue of divisive conservative political commentator Charlie Kirk, who was shot and killed while speaking at a Utah university campus in September. 
Robert Robbins
Robbins, a physician, left his leadership role at the University of Arizona in spring 2024 amid a significant budget crisis. A miscalculation of the amount of cash the school had on hand led to a $177 million deficit, from which it finally emerged this fall. 
Robbins was criticized for accepting a $40,000 bonus after leaving office, despite being in charge while the university’s fiscal problems resulted in hundreds of layoffs. 
Mallet asked Robbins about the fiscal mismanagement, and Robbins said there was no fraud or risk of insolvency at the university. A hiring freeze was implemented and other measures were taken to reduce costs to address the error, he said. 
Tirone, LSU’s Faculty Senate president, said he called colleagues at the University of Arizona and confirmed Robbins’ version of events. 
Robbins has several big names endorsing him for the position, including former Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey and Mark Emmert, a former LSU chancellor and NCAA president. 
Wade Rousse
Before becoming president, Rousse served in several administrative positions at McNeese State University since 2019. 
Rousse touted his experience turning around McNeese’s enrollment and finances. His background is in economics, having attained a Ph.D. in the field from the University of Illinois Chicago. 
Students and faculty who spoke at the search committee meeting noted Rousse’s lack of experience in research and leadership, as president of McNeese, a much smaller, non-research regional university for just over a year. 
His critics also noted his perceived connections to the governor and that he lacks several of the key qualifications the search committee established for presidential applicants. Unlike LSU, McNeese does not hold a top research designation, and Rousse did not ascend to his administrative rank though the traditional academic promotion path. He also hasn’t published a significant amount of research.. 
Rousse addressed these concerns, defending his non-traditional background but assuring faculty they would have his full support. 
When asked about his strategy to propel LSU to the top 50 public research universities in the country, Rousse questioned whether it was truly a priority for the university. He said he would meet with faculty everyday for 30 days after taking office to determine how important it is to them. 
Rousse added he wanted to be given four or five key goals from the Board of Supervisors. If attaining top-research status was among them, he would put together a team to promote research. 
He also said it is necessary to increase faculty and postdoctoral research pay to improve recruitment. 
While Rousse said he would encourage philanthropic giving, he believes pursuing corporate partnerships will be key to funding the university. 
“We’re not going to allow them to skew the purity of the research,” Rousse said. “That is not negotiable, but the idea that we need them to be a part of our curriculum, our research agenda, and truly create partnerships, true partnerships that we can maybe monetize together moving forward, I don’t think it’s negative.”

(Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota State Auditor’s office has found problems with the bookkeeping at one of the state’s two-year colleges. 
Dakota College at Bottineau failed to reconcile monthly bank transactions with the school’s financial ledger, according to the State Auditor’s Office that looked at four months of receipts as part of a biennial audit.
The office concluded that for those four months between July 2022 to June 2024, the college had conducted transactions and held banking balances that lacked proper documentation, according to an Auditor’s Office news release on Wednesday.
The amount of unreconciled transactions ranged between about $75,000 to nearly $363,000 for each of those four months and led to a difference of hundreds of thousands of dollars between the college’s financial records and its bank balances, the report showed.
“We look at this as Accounting 101,” said State Auditor Josh Gallion in an interview Wednesday. 
Gallion said his office was not able to determine whether differences between the college’s financial records and bank balances were the result of accounting errors or missing cash.
“Do we think there is missing money? And my answer is, ‘I don’t know,’” Gallion said. “Without those proper reconciliations being done, transactions properly documented … it makes it very difficult to try to determine: are those transactions appropriate?”
He added there are no punitive measures associated with the results of the audit.
The report recommended that Dakota College at Bottineau perform monthly bank reconciliations. It also recommended that the reconciliations are “properly documented,” reviewed and approved.
Minot State University President Steve Shirley (Provided by North Dakota University System)
In a statement, Dakota College at Bottineau said it agreed with the audit recommendations and understands the importance of bank reconciliations.
“DCB (Dakota College at Bottineau) has had significant turnover in Business Office personnel, leading to this issue,” the college said. “Going forward, DCB will be contracting with Minot State for assistance with Business Office functions, including bank reconciliations.”
Minot State University President Steven Shirley oversees the Bottineau campus., He said the college values the work of the State Auditor’s Office. He also committed to “rectifying these bank reconciliation issues,” in accordance with the audit, according to a statement.
“This is key in making sure you are properly recording the money that is coming in and the money that is going out so that we can provide the public that assurance that we are being good stewards of the people’s money,” Gallion said. 
He said his office will audit the college again in two years.
“That gives the campus time to implement those corrective actions and hopefully they can demonstrate that they can start doing this and reconciling down to a zero discrepancy amount, rather than these large swings that you are seeing,” Gallion said.

“Iron Mike,” as Tyson was known in his early career, has also fought personal battles with addiction and served three years of a six-year prison sentence after he was convicted of rape in 1992. Asked what cannabis has done to help him, Tyson said it changed his “whole life” by helping him end his cocaine and alcohol use.
“I’m looking at me as if I’m the product of cannabis,” he said. “I was using everything. I was using acid and cocaine, I was using alcohol, whatever I could take.” 
Legalizing recreational weed has been on Gov. Josh Shapiro’s wish list since the start of his term in 2023. 
In this year’s budget address, Shapiro again urged lawmakers to pass legislation that would legalize and tax recreational cannabis. He noted Pennsylvanians who want buds, vapes or edibles can simply cross the border into one of the commonwealth’s four neighboring states where it’s available without a prescription or breaking the law.
That’s money leaving the commonwealth that Pennsylvania could use to balance its budget, Shapiro said. His office estimated legal recreational cannabis could generate more than $500 million in new tax revenue in its first year.
A spokesperson for Shapiro said he met with Tyson, but didn’t offer details of their conversation. Tyson also met with Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland), her spokesperson said, also declining to provide specifics.
“All of them was very delightful, you know, but we’ll see what happens,” Tyson said, adding he was ready to take the issue “to the polls.”
Legalizing cannabis for recreational use is, in fact, the domain of the state legislature, not voters. And the General Assembly has considered the issue several times this year, including a proposal to put the state Liquor Control Board in charge of selling cannabis. 
House Bill 1200 was voted down in the Senate Law and Justice Committee earlier this year. But last week, the committee passed legislation sponsored by its chairperson Sen. Dan Laughlin (R-Erie) that would establish a state Cannabis Control Board.
Laughlin, who opposed the state store proposal because it would cut out small businesses, said the control board would not be tasked with regulating recreational marijuana.
“This bill is not about legalizing adult-use cannabis – it’s about cleaning up the system we already have in place, giving our commonwealth the structure and expertise to manage what’s already occurring within our borders,” Laughlin said in a statement.
The bill also includes language to create uniform safety standards for untested and potentially harmful intoxicating hemp products, which have become widely available since the passage of the 2018 federal farm bill. That law made the cultivation of industrial hemp legal.
Chemical compounds similar to THC, the main active component of cannabis, can also be produced from industrial hemp. They’re sold in gas stations and vape shops across the commonwealth under the name Delta 8 or labeled as THC with little or no regulation.
Tyson’s company also sells Delta 8 products alongside recreational cannabis. Tyson’s business partner Ryan Burke said rather than contradicting Tyson 2.0’s goal of safety and accountability, their company has shown such products can be produced and sold responsibly.
“When states don’t have recreational cannabis policy in place, a lot of those consumers go and … buy those products that, again, fall into that loophole industry,” Burke said, noting that the lack of testing and age controls on who can buy them has given the hemp industry a bad reputation.
“The farm bill and the hemp industry as a whole needs to also be looked at when it comes to further regulation, both on a state and federal level,” Burke said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_5646-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-29 19:16:52.139809

Legal questions loom over 20,000 acres of prime habitat for mule deer, pronghorn and sage grouse successfully nominated for drilling leases by Casper-based Kirkwood Oil and Gas.
The post Can BLM ignore land-use plans and lease off-limits ‘Golden Triangle’ habitat for drilling? appeared first on WyoFile .","In December, after an extraordinarily controversial planning process, the Biden administration’s Bureau of Land Management signed off on a final resource management plan that’s now governing 3.6 million acres of southwestern Wyoming. 
The Rock Springs-area plan sought to balance the needs of development and wildlife, though unhappy Wyoming leaders maintained it tilted too far toward conservation at the expense of industrial activities.
Over 280,000 acres of the so-called Golden Triangle, for example — home to the densest population of sage grouse left on Earth — was designated as an “area of critical environmental concern,” excluded from surface-disturbing activities and expressly closed to mineral leasing. 
Ten months later, the BLM is proposing to put 14 parcels encompassing 19,839 acres of the closed area up for auction at a June 2026 oil and gas lease sale, according to a Rocky Mountain Wild analysis.

Although it’s in the process of being revised by the Trump administration’s BLM, the Rock Springs Resource Management Plan that was approved in December 2024 remains “active” and in effect, employees with the agency told WyoFile in the spring. The agency’s proposal to offer oil and gas leases in violation of the current land-use plan has Bureau of Land Management watchdogs scratching their heads.
“If you’re nominating parcels that have been closed under a valid and existing RMP, that would seem to be illegal,” said Matt Gaffney, an attorney who directs legal and government affairs for the Wyoming Outdoor Council.
The illegality is spelled out in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, the law governing the administration of BLM lands, Gaffney said. Every BLM field office — in this case, Rock Springs — has a resource management plan that guides decision-making. If a lessee or permittee is found to be in violation of that plan, they’re issued an order of noncompliance and can be subject to civil penalties. 
If the BLM violates its own land-use plan, he said, the remedy would be suing to stop the action in federal district court or filing an appeal with the Interior Board of Land Appeals.
The nearly 20,000 Golden Triangle acres proposed for inclusion in BLM’s June 2026 oil and gas lease sale were nominated in 2021 by Kirkwood Oil and Gas, according to Steve Degenfelder, a landman for the Casper-based outfit.

In 2019, under the previous resource management plan, BLM leased 23,626 acres of the Golden Triangle, some of which went to Kirkwood. An “emergency letter” from Wyoming Outdoor Council and Audubon Rockies asking Gov. Mark Gordon to intervene failed to halt the sale at the time. 
Six years later, Degenfelder says Kirkwood needs the additional acres to make a Golden Triangle drilling operation viable. Pulling back the leases from the auction could jeopardize “many billions of dollars” in drilling revenue, he said. 
“This is the conundrum the federal government and environmental groups need to realize,” Degenfelder told WyoFile. “The resource, if it’s there as we envision, it’s a great deal of tax revenue and revenue to the state of Wyoming and to the federal government. It’s not going to be developed if there’s big holes in the play.” 
If the leases do go to auction, wildlife stipulations will likely be affixed, though it remains unclear what exactly.
“I don’t know what the stipulations are going to be with respect to those lands within the no-leasing area,” Degenfelder said.

A stipulation instructing drillers to coordinate with Wyoming wildlife managers would likely be attached to parcels that intersect with a migration path used by mule deer traveling from the Red Desert to Hoback — the state’s first designated migration corridor. 
There’d also likely be sage grouse stipulations in the area, which is designated a “priority habitat management area with limited exceptions.”  Sprawling between Farson and the Wind River Range’s remote western slope, the 367,000-acre Golden Triangle region is considered the best of the best sagebrush-steppe habitat remaining and home to “the highest [sage] grouse density areas on Earth,” according to biologists. 
Meanwhile, migrating pronghorn that use a corridor that’s been “identified” but not yet “designated” would go without the same protective stipulation unless Wyoming completes its process in advance of the lease sale.

Degenfelder is optimistic that horizontal drilling and other techniques can spare the Golden Triangle’s world-class wildlife resources from population declines and abandonment documented in other Green River Basin gas fields, like the Pinedale Anticline. 
“I really do feel like avoidance of surface disturbance and disturbance to wildlife can be achieved with new technology,” he said. 
But some Wyoming conservation groups are maintaining that stipulations and technology aren’t enough and that the leases should never have been offered in the first place.
“It’s deeply troubling that BLM is trying to lease parcels that are closed to protect intact wildlife habitat in the Golden Triangle,” said Julia Stuble, Wyoming state director for The Wilderness Society. “The agency has to quickly remove these leases from offer and clean up whatever internal review is not working in allowing these parcels to even get through to this stage. We don’t want to see this happen again.”

It’s unclear why the parcels were offered. BLM officials with the state headquarters office in Cheyenne were unreachable for an interview. With the federal government shut down, the agency is only responding to “urgent” media inquiries related to visitor access, safety and essential operations, according to a U.S. Department of Interior spokeswoman.
The BLM is taking feedback on its June 2026 oil and gas lease sale until Nov. 17. Public comments can be submitted online. 
Mary Jo Rugwell, a retired BLM-Wyoming state director, said that she understands frustrations with the current Rock Springs Resource Management Plan. Calling it “problematic” would be “understating it,” she said, but that doesn’t excuse ignoring the governing document for the area. 
“There’s the process that you have to follow,” Rugwell said. “The problem is that now processes are not being followed in a lot of instances. It’s a very different time right now.”
Other former federal employees are urging swift action to eliminate the Golden Triangle oil and gas leases from the agency’s June 2026 auction. 
“You cannot include any lease sale lands that are not available for leasing, that is not open to interpretation under any law,” said Nada Culver, the former BLM deputy director who signed the Rock Springs plan in December. 
Whatever the BLM’s rationale is for proposing the leases, there’s “no excuse,” Culver said. 
“The important thing is they need to fix it immediately,” she said.

That’s one of the sobering findings in a new survey of caregivers released by AARP this week. 
One-third of caregivers in the state report living in a household with income under $50,000, according to the report. But among all income levels, many have stopped saving or used up their savings, left bills unpaid, borrowed money and taken on more debt, and put off retirement. Nearly one in five family caregivers reported being unable to afford basic expenses. 
And one-third find it difficult to get affordable local services, like meals delivered, in-home health care or transportation. Over half work while also caregiving. 
Most family caregivers nationally go unpaid. Still, Washington lags the national average in paid caregivers, at 14%, compared to 18% across the country.
About 22% of Washington adults care for a family member, just below the national average of 24%. Mississippi leads the country at 34%. Almost all take care of a parent, but about a third also care for a child with complex medical needs. 
“We’re talking about 1.3 million Washingtonians who are family caregivers, that’s a pretty large number, and it only indicates how large the challenges are around caregiving,” said Marguerite Ro, the state director for AARP Washington. “So, frankly, we’re not prepared at a state, county, city level for meeting the challenges with an aging population.”
And Washington expects to see a dramatic increase in the age 65 and older population over the next 25 years. In 2020, about 16% of the state’s population was at least 65. That’s projected to rise to 23% by 2050, with the fastest growth expected this decade as Baby Boomers age, according to state projections.
The growth in Washingtonians aged 85 and over is forecast to be even more steep, nearly quadrupling from 2020 to 2050 with 16,200 people aging into this bracket every year from 2035 to 2050, according to the state.
The AARP’s survey of 132 caregivers in Washington has an 11% margin of error. The national organization released similar reports for states across the country.
On average, these caregivers in Washington are 52 years old and caring for someone who is 67.
Most help with daily tasks, like grocery shopping, preparing meals and transportation. One in five reported spending at least 40 hours per week providing care.
Only about a quarter of those surveyed reported that a health care provider had asked them if their family member needs more care, and only one in ten have been asked about care needed for themselves. Most receive paid or unpaid help, but still nearly 40% are going it alone.
Nearly two in 10 caregivers reported experiencing seven or more days of poor physical health per month. Over one-third experience high emotional stress while caregiving. One in six find it difficult to take care of their own health. 
“Despite the fact that we do have a lot of tools and resources, we don’t have enough out there to help people along that journey,” Ro said.
Next week, voters across Washington will decide whether to invest tax dollars collected for the state’s new long-term care program, known as WA Cares, in the stock market. AARP supports Senate Joint Resolution 8201, which also has Gov. Bob Ferguson’s backing.

WA Cares is set to launch next July to help residents afford long-term care. 
Ro hopes this will relieve pressure on unpaid family caregivers. 
“It was not meant as the solution, but it is a critical first step,” she said.

(Photo courtesy of USDA)U.S. soybean farmers and lawmakers said the Chinese purchase of several shiploads of U.S. soybeans indicated a positive step in trade negotiations between the two counties. 
Reuters reported Wednesday that COFCO, a Chinese state-owned food processing company, purchased about 180,000 metric tons of soybeans from the U.S. 
The reported purchase, which Reuters attributed to “two trade sources” is the first purchase China has made since harvest season began on the latest U.S. soybean crop.
The country has also bought soybeans from Argentina and continues to purchase from Brazil, leaving soybean farmers and farm industry groups concerned they have lost a key international market. 
The purchase comes toward the end of harvest season for many farmers, and also a day before President Donald Trump is slated to work out a trade deal with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The trade deal is expected to include agreements on soybeans and other agricultural exports. 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins posted on social media Wednesday about the purchase and said it showed “strong dealmaking” on the part of the president and “a positive step forward for our farmers.” 
“This purchase, coming directly ahead of the Trump-Xi talks, shows that America means business and that we will restore balance, give U.S. producers the opportunities they’ve earned, and send a message that when America leads in agriculture, the world listens,” Rollins wrote. 
Rollins also mentioned the purchase while speaking on a Fox Business segment Wednesday.
The estimated 180,000-metric-ton purchase is a small percentage of the nearly 27 million metric tons of soybeans the U.S. exported to China in 2024, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. 
U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley has also called for a trade deal with China that will benefit farmers. Grassley said in a statement Wednesday he hopes for a “successful” meeting between Trump and Xi.
“China thinks it can move the needle at the last minute, but these small purchases are not nearly enough to address the serious threats facing the ag economy,” Grassley said. “While this may be a positive sign, it’s critical that the Chinese market more fully reopens to American soybean growers soon.”
Congressional delegates from Iowa and Wisconsin urged, in a letter this week, the president to prioritize a soybean deal in his talks with the Chinese leader. 
U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn, R-Iowa, who led the letter, said Wednesday the purchase from China was a “an important first step and a clear signal of momentum” for Trump’s negotiations. 
“I’ve led the charge for our farmers and rural communities: end China’s trade war, restore market access, and expand ag exports,” Nunn said in a statement. “President Trump has proven time and again he has the tools to deliver. I look forward to reviewing the deal.”
U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall, a Republican from Kansas, wrote on social media that the purchase was a “big win” for farmers. 
Nebraska Republican U.S. Sen. Deb Fischer also posted on social media and said the deal showed “agricultural trade could ease tensions between Washington and Beijing, while also leveling the playing field and directly assisting hardworking American ag producers.”
The American Soybean Association did not respond to a request for comment Wednesday. 
Ohio Soybean Association President Rusty Goebel said on the social media platform X that farmers were “encouraged” by the “positive trade news” and said the association looks forward to additional deals and purchases. 
A representative from the Iowa Soybean Association declined to comment and said news of the purchase had not been “adequately substantiated.” 
COFCO, the Chinese company that reportedly purchased the soybeans, did not respond to a request for comment or confirmation.

The closure comes as hospitals across Vermont face serious solvency risks.

Rutland Regional Medical Center will close its five inpatient pediatric beds, the hospital announced Wednesday. The change is due to a drop in the number of children who need overnight stays, according to hospital CEO Judi Fox, but it comes as hospitals across Vermont are under financial strain.
Fox said most pediatric patients receive adequate care through the emergency room, outpatient visits or shorter inpatient stays. The hospital’s five pediatric beds are unoccupied about half of the time. Nearly two-thirds of the hospital’s pediatric patients go home the same day, according to a hospital press release.

“Maintaining specialized inpatient services that are rarely used is not an efficient use of staff or resources,” the release stated.
The means that any pediatric patient needing overnight treatment will need to be transferred to the Golisano Children’s Hospital at University of Vermont Health in Burlington or Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, in Lebanon, New Hampshire. (Fox said patient transfer agreements are still in the works for the latter.) 
The Rutland hospital will continue its pediatric outpatient and surgical services for same-day and short-stay care, she said. Some young adult patients needing inpatient care may be able to stay in adult inpatient units, according to the release. 
The hospital will also set aside rooms for pediatric patients who come into the emergency department and need longer observation. Already, about 10% of the patients seen in the emergency room are pediatric cases, Fox said. “They are already caring and experienced with this patient population,” she said.  
Fox estimated that the closure will save the hospital nearly $3.1 million a year, though she stressed that the shift “was not made just because of a financial decision.” She added that it is challenging to recruit and retain staff and maintain their competencies with such a low volume.  
“This change allows us to continue offering excellent pediatric care while demonstrating our commitment to affordability, expanding access, and delivering high-quality care,” Fox said in the release. “It reflects our response to the evolving needs of patients today, as we move toward fewer hospital stays and more outpatient and community-based care options.” 
The Rutland hospital will also maintain its gynecological, obstetric and newborn care, Fox added. The shift in care does not require the hospital to make any layoffs, though it may require the pediatric nurses and staff to apply to be reassigned. Fox hopes that this change can help offset some of the hospital’s reliance on travelers. 
The change is expected to go into effect Dec. 21, though Fox said it may take longer to implement the formal review process before closure.
After UVM Medical Center, Rutland Regional Medical Center is the largest community hospital in Vermont in terms of patient services. For 2026, the state’s main health care regulator, the Green Mountain Care Board, approved a $336.6 million net patient revenue for the hospital. 
The closure of overnight pediatric beds in Rutland fits into a dire bigger picture for the state’s small, rural hospitals that care board chair Owen Foster painted for legislators earlier this October. Many hospitals in the state have extremely limited cash on hand and slim reserves. Vermonters should expect that hospitals will start cutting services, just like Copley Hospital announced in June it would do with its birthing center, Foster said.
Comparatively, Rutland Regional Medical Center offered a picture of relative financial health, against the state’s most strained hospitals. For instance, in 2024 it had some of the most cash on hand of the state’s hospitals, with 244 days of reserves — UVM Medical Center, for comparison, had 136 days, while Springfield Hospital’s dipped down to 42.9 days’ worth, according to Foster’s presentation. For 2026, Rutland projects to have 154 days’ cash on hand. Anything that falls into the 202-275 range is ranked as “very strong,” in the S&P Global ratings for nonprofit hospitals, while 110-160 is still “adequate.”

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-29 22:29:25+00:00,Mississippi Today,Medical examiner could not determine Jimmie ‘Jay’ Lee’s cause or manner of death,Molly Minta,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/29/medical-examiner-could-not-determine-jimmie-jay-lees-cause-or-manner-of-death/,The medical examiner could not determine a cause of death for Jimmie “Jay” Lee because all that was left were skeletal remains.,"The medical examiner could not determine a cause or manner of death for Jimmie “Jay” Lee, the University of Mississippi student whose disappearance and death sparked a movement in Oxford’s LGBTQ+ community. 
Missing for more than two years, Lee’s remains were found earlier this year in a wooded gully in rural Carroll County – about an hour and a half south of Oxford – where people have been known to illegally dump trash. 
But the cause of death could not be determined in part because of the decomposition of Lee’s body, said Carroll County Coroner Mark Stiles who responded to the scene. The remains were skeletal, with no soft tissue. 
“It’s kind of hard for us as coroners when we go to a scene like a homicide or a suicide or a natural death,” he said. “We’ve got the body there, and we’ve got first-hand accounts of usually witnesses. But in this case, we didn’t have anything. It was just the remains that were found.” 
Cause of death refers to how someone died, such as a gunshot, stabbing or strangulation, while manner of death is how medical examiners classify whether a person died from a suicide, homicide or natural death. 
An “undetermined” finding does not mean the autopsy has ruled out homicide as a potential manner of Lee’s death, Stiles noted. 
“The autopsy is going to be kind of vague just from what they had to work with,” he said. “It was just some bones.” 
The discovery of Lee’s remains, aided in part by a necklace with Lee’s name on it, came after a deadlocked jury led a Lafayette County Circuit Court judge to declare a mistrial in the state’s case against Shelton Timothy Herrington Jr., a fellow Ole Miss student who was arrested and charged with capital murder a few weeks after Lee went missing in the summer of 2022. 
One of the 12 jurors refused to convict Herrington due to the lack of Lee’s body during the first trial. The prosecution had built a circumstantial case against Herrington, arguing he was the last person to see Lee alive based on cellphone data. 
Herrington is set for trial again in early December in Lafayette County, with jurors to be drawn from Madison County – a similar setup to last year when jurors were drawn from Forest County. 
The judge, Kelly Luther, has taken several steps to insulate the case from intense media attention. Earlier this week, he granted an oral motion from Herrington’s defense attorney, Aafram Sellers, to file pre-trial motions under seal. Sellers did not respond to an inquiry from Mississippi Today.
“The Court has conducted a balancing test to weigh the competing interests of the public’s right of access and the Defendant’s request to seal certain pre-trial motions,” Luther wrote in the Oct. 27 order. “The circumstances do not warrant sealing the entire file; however, the Court finds no less restrictive alternative to protect the integrity of this matter.”
Last year, Luther denied a joint motion from the prosecution and Herrington’s defense to seal the entirety of the filings in the case that legal experts had called “highly unusual.” Instead, Luther said he would consider sealing some filings containing evidence that could prejudice a jury if requested to do so by the defense. 
In other filings this week, Sellers asked Luther to exclude the photographs of the crime scene and Lee’s autopsy as well as expert testimony the state plans to submit from a clinical social worker who has researched behavior in the LGBTQ+ community.
The prosecution’s theory of the case last year was that Herrington killed Lee to preserve their secret sexual relationship. 
“Relevance requires more than tangential connection to broad social categories,” Sellers wrote in an Oct. 28 motion. “It demands a meaningful relationship between the expert’s opinion and the specific facts in dispute.”
Herrington’s case is still considered an open investigation, Stiles said. But he noted the autopsy report from the state medical examiner’s office could be changed pending the outcome of Herrington’s trial. 
“If the boy was found guilty or if he has a change of heart and admits to everything, then they could change it,” Stiles said. 
When Stiles responded to the scene the night that Lee’s remains were found off a dirt road, he said investigators laid the skeleton on a tarp, the bones arranged anatomically. Several were missing, likely due to animals. 
“You could see that some of the hands, the appendages were missing, the phalanges and the toes were missing, the smaller bones like that,” he said. 
Stiles then photographed the remains and collected them to be sent to the state Crime Lab in Jackson for analysis. He was not involved in the autopsy, but Stiles said medical examiners can take certain steps to form a conclusion in the absence of soft tissue. 
The skeletal remains can be x-rayed, which could help determine if broken bones were due to gunshot wounds. Stiles said the autopsy report ruled out blunt or sharp force trauma or firearm injuries as the cause of death. 
Other DNA that can point to a perpetrator can be collected, but Stiles said the only DNA on the autopsy report was for the identification of Lee’s body. 
In the case of strangulations – a theory the prosecution had offered for Lee’s death – sometimes a neck bone can be broken. Stiles said that was not the case with Lee’s remains. 
“You can strangle someone, and it still not be broken,” he said. 
The heat, humidity and water in Mississippi means bodies can decompose faster here than in other places. In Carroll County, Stiles said water running down the hills causes erosion to the point that people have for decades been known to throw objects like washing machines into ditches and gullies to form a blockade.
“In the desert, (a body) would dehydrate and be mummified,” Stiles said. 
Because the county is so rural, Stiles said it’s common for bodies to be found years after a death, in advanced stages of decomposition. He began serving as the county coroner in 2016, and his first case was that of a missing person who was found as skeletal remains.

While GM, one of the Detroit Three automakers, did not respond to a request for comment, the News reported that 1,200 workers at the Factory Zero Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center would be left without a job, with cuts based on seniority. 
Jesse Lee, senior advisor for Climate Power, a strategic communications organization focused on promoting progress on climate issues, laid the blame at President Donald Trump’s feet, with his administration working to eliminate federal support for electric vehicles. 
“Trump’s full-scale assault on clean energy manufacturing is serving Americans with pink slips and skyrocketing energy bills, while giving China a competitive edge in the automotive industry,” Lee said, arguing that Republicans will answer for their support of Trump’s anti-electric vehicle policies in the 2026 midterm election. 
Earlier this month, GM canceled plans for a $55 million hydrogen fuel cell factory in Detroit, which was set to create 140 new jobs. Crain’s Detroit Business reported that the decision was based on a lack of hydrogen infrastructure and longer-than-expected transition to electric vehicles, alongside the Department of Energy’s plans to eliminate funding awards supporting 223 unspecified projects.

Pictured are children at the Downtown Children’s Center in St. Louis. (Photo by Rebecca Rivas/Missouri Independent)Two Iowa Head Start child care programs are expected to face funding lapses and could have to reduce services if the federal government shutdown continues into November, advocates say.
Nov. 1 is a pivotal deadline for several federally funded programs as the federal government shutdown continues. On the top of many people’s minds is the end of federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps, which provides food benefits for more than 270,000 in Iowa each month.
Another program facing funding shortages as the government shutdown continues is Head Start, a program under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that serves roughly 750,000 children throughout the country from infancy through preschool. The programs provide child care and early learning services, in addition to free meals, health screenings and parental support services for participating families. According to the National Head Start Association, nearly 65,000 children in Head Start programs will be at risk of losing access to their classrooms beginning Nov. 1 because of lapsed funding.
However, not all Head Start programs will be impacted by the shutdown. Head Start programs are funded through an annual allocation at various times throughout the year — for example, some programs have already seen lapsed funding that was due Oct. 1 because of the shutdown.
Lori Ferris, executive director of the Iowa Head Start Association, said in Iowa, two Head Start programs — the South Central Iowa Community Action Program and Community Action of Eastern Iowa — have Nov. 1 funding renewal dates. Ferris said if the shutdown continues after Friday, Community Action of Eastern Iowa will have to close down five Head Start centers, impacting 139 students and 45 staff members.
The South Central Iowa Community Action Program has funding available to keep all locations operating as normal through Nov. 14, Ferris said, but programs could be impacted if the shutdown continues past that date.
While data from the National Head Start Association found 623 child care slots and 162 staff could be impacted by the shutdown in total, Ferris said these numbers reflect the total number of participants in the two programs set to receive federal funding in November.
“In Iowa, we’re very invested in our children and families and resilient, and really work hard at trying to figure out a way to make things work when we’re faced with challenges,” Ferris said. “So we’re fortunate in that the leadership at those programs (have) collaborated with their community partners and come up with some solutions so all the children would not be impacted.”
The state Department of Health and Human Services has also contacted affected Head Start organizations to gather more information about impacted communities and ways to connect those families with child care or other services, Ferris said. The state department did not respond to a request for comment.
If the shutdown were to continue into December, more Head Start programs would see their funding run out. Ferris said in Iowa, four Head Start programs would be affected if the government shutdown continues into December.
Ferris said the lost funding puts many Iowa families and staff in difficult positions, not just because it removes their child’s access to early education, but because Head Start allows many parents “to work, go to school, be a member of the military or participate in job training.”
The loss of SNAP dollars will also strain many families participating in Head Start programs, she said.
“Food insecurity is also a challenge for many of our families,” Ferris said. “So when their kids aren’t able to come to Head Start, where we feed them two nutritional meals and a snack every single day, now they’re faced with not only not having SNAP, but then having to make sure that their children are fed throughout the day when they’re not at Head Start. And many are not able to go to work (without a child care provider).”
The Iowa Department of Health and Human Services said earlier in October the federal Food and Nutrition Services department instructed states not to issue November SNAP benefits. Food banks, pantries and other charitable organizations are preparing for a major surge in Iowans seeking food assistance as SNAP benefits are not issued.
Paige Chickering, the Iowa state manager for the Save the Children Action Network (SCAN), led petitions being dropped off at U.S. Sens. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst’s offices Wednesday, calling for the GOP senators to support ending the shutdown and to “take action to protect Head Start.” The petition contained the signatures of 261 Iowans who “represent the voices of concerned constituents who believe that no child should lose access to Head Start because of political gridlock,” according to the letter.
Chickering said in an interview the efforts in Iowa are part of a national Head Start day of action, calling for Ernst and Grassley to “work with their partners in Congress to reopen the government, or to find emergency funding streams for these Head Start programs until the government can be reopened” in the event that a compromise is not reached by Nov. 1.
There have also been calls to extend emergency funding to SNAP, with U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks introducing legislation last week to allow the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture to access emergency funds to maintain the food assistance program’s operations during the shutdown.
Chickering said there were six Head Start programs nationally that had funding expire Oct. 1. There was some reserve funding or other government support available to keep these programs functioning in October, but Chickering said there are many more programs potentially affected beginning in November. However, because Head Start is a “bipartisanly supported program that had such a good reputation in Congress,” she said advocates are  Congress could take action to provide funding for these programs if the shutdown continues.
Chickering called for concerned Iowans to reach out to their federal officials to talk about the impacts of the shutdown on their communities.
“This is a critical time to be contacting our congressional representatives, encouraging them to work together to reopen the government or to provide emergency funding until an agreement can be made to reopen the government, and provide sustained and lasting funding to these critical programs and services,” she said.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/child-care2-1536x1024-1.jpg,,,2025-10-29 19:02:35.999588

Getty Images/10'000 HoursA Georgia elementary school teacher let go during a fiscal crisis in her district is suing to get her job back.
Ashley White, who was the only art teacher at Hillcrest Elementary School in Dublin, said the district violated the law when the director of human resources abruptly asked White to resign on Oct. 6, citing an inability to fulfill the district’s employment contracts.
When White reported to work Oct. 9, administrators told her to collect her belongings and turn in her keys, and on Oct. 14, the school board adopted a deficit reduction plan that reflected her dismissal effective the week before, according to her lawyers.
The state Department of Education has put Dublin City Schools, a charter system, on a financial improvement plan as million dollar budget shortfalls have come to light. According to reporting from the Courier Herald, the district’s books were in the red every month during the last school year, with the deficit growing as large as $7 million in December 2024, and as of August, the district owed nearly $5 million to the state health plan after not paying employer contributions for 12 months.
In response to the situation, state Superintendent Richard Woods is calling for what he says are sweeping new financial reforms when the state Legislature meets in January, including new financial training and reporting requirements for districts.
The Professional Association of Georgia Educators filed a breach of contract lawsuit against Dublin City Schools and the Dublin City Board of Education on White’s behalf in the Laurens County Superior Court last week.
The district and Dublin City Board of Education members did not respond to requests for comment on White’s case. According to press releases, the board’s deficit reduction plan includes cutting 10 school days, a temporary waiver of board member salaries and travel compensation as well as staffing adjustments across all schools and departments in the district.
But White’s lawyers argue that the district had no right to fire her because they say the portion of the state law that allowed for her to be let go does not apply to charter districts like Dublin City Schools.
State code allows schools to terminate contracts for reasons including “to reduce staff due to loss of students or cancellation of programs and due to no fault or performance issue,” according to state code.
“However, the Dublin City School District is a charter system, which means that it has a general waiver exempting it from many education statutes, including the Fair Dismissal Act,” said Ellen Schoolar, an attorney representing White. “Ms. White contends that because the Dublin City School District is a charter system, and because the district’s charter does not expressly allow the board to implement local rules or policies embracing the Fair Dismissal Act, the board cannot use the Fair Dismissal Act as authority to terminate her contract.”
Schoolar said the decision in the case could have ramifications for other Dublin City Schools employees who are set to be terminated before their contracts run out.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha informed lawmakers in May 2024 that his newly formed cold case unit had “effectively solved” two unsolved homicides and had expected to share the findings of its investigations within six weeks.
Six weeks turned into a year and a half. But on Wednesday, Neronha finally delivered results and closure — but no arrests — for the families of Debra Stone and Cynthia McKenna.
“These cases are not related, other than in the sense that the finality that all of us in law enforcement hope to bring to victims that have been long delayed,” Neronha told a dozen reporters gathered at a conference room at his South Main Street office in Providence  Wednesday morning. “We are delivering that finality today.”
The two cases, both involving the deaths of white women, are the first to be cleared from the more than 150 unsolved homicides the four-person unit has reviewed since 2023. Funding was included in the state’s fiscal 2024 budget and has since been supplemented by a federal grant and has since been supplemented by a $500,000 federal grant. Until the unit formed, the state lacked coordination between prosecutors, and law enforcement agencies in investigating unsolved homicides and missing person cases.
The body of Stone, 24, was found by a group of youths boating in the Narrow River in Narragansett on Sept. 2, 1984. She was wrapped in a floral sleeping bag, tied with rope, and anchored with a cement cinderblock. The state medical examiner determined that the cause of death was asphyxiation by strangulation.
McKenna, 49, was found dead by a family member inside her North Providence apartment on Feb. 21, 2007. The state medical examiner said the cause of death was asphyxiation due to blocked airways. She was found in her bed tightly tucked under bed linens with two pillows over her face. Police said she had been gagged with a sock in her mouth and had tissues in her nostrils.
The two women died 23 years apart, but there are some similarities between their homicide cases. Local police quickly identified a prime suspect in both killings — each a man with the first name Robert — only for their investigations to stall. In McKenna’s case, it was due to limited DNA technology. For Stone’s, it was because of questions about an informant’s credibility following a failed polygraph test.

Assistant Attorney General Jim Baum, who leads the cold case unit, told a crowd of reporters that time ultimately proved key to solving the cases. Over the past two years, the unit reinterviewed numerous witnesses and, in McKenna’s case, secured confirmable DNA evidence to confirm police were indeed on the right track during their initial investigations.
“We conclude that Robert Geremia murdered Debra Stone on Aug. 29, 1984. We concluded that Robert Corry killed Cynthia McKennaon or about Feb. 19, 2007,” he said.
Geremia, who was known to be involved with drug distribution in New York City and had potential mob ties, died of natural causes in 1995. He was 43.
Corry, a former U.S. Marine who served in the Persian Gulf War, died in 2014 at the age of 52.
A daughter’s unending grief 
Jaclyn McKenna wiped her eyes as Baum reviewed details of her mother’s death. But she told reporters she’s glad to know there’s finally some accountability — even if her mother’s killer is now dead.
“For 18 years, eight months and nine days, I have mourned my mother, Cindy,” Jaclyn McKenna told reporters after an hourlong presentation. “And although my journey for justice may have wavered, it never stopped.”
Jaclyn prefers to remember her mom as the person who always packed her a brown bag lunch, took her shopping and out for birthday ice creams at Friendly’s and feeding ducks at the park. 
McKenna’s case had been included as Five of Clubs in a deck of Rhode Island cold case playing cards published in December 2018.
Investigators in 2007 had quickly zeroed in on Corry, who had a “very confrontational” relationship with McKenna, according to the cold case unit’s report. McKenna had filed domestic violence charges against Corry in 2005, but they were dismissed after McKenna failed to appear in court.
Police could never determine Corry’s exact whereabouts around the time of McKenna’s death. 
Another lead surfaced after investigators intercepted letters Corry wrote in late 2007 confessing to the murder to an inmate at the Adult Correctional Institution in Cranston. A handwriting analysis only showed the letter was a “probable” match to Corry, according to the report.
Police tried to obtain a DNA match from an envelope used to mail one of the letters, but Corry’s profile was not in the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) database. Rhode Island began putting DNA samples into CODIS around 2004 and the database has grown more and more robust over time. The number of DNA profiles in CODIS from people convicted of any felony or crime of violence in Rhode Island grew from 7,800 in 2008 to now over 27,000.
In April 2024, cold case investigators obtained the DNA of a male member of Corry’s family from a bottle discarded in the trash. It was used to produce a Y-STR profile, which focuses on the DNA of the Y chromosome. A man and his brothers will have the same Y-STR profile as their biological sons, their father and their father’s father. In July 2024, the Rhode Island Department of Health determined that the Y-STR profile of the envelope was consistent with the profile of Corry’s relative.
Though grateful to state investigators, Jaclyn said her heart is “far from mended.”
“The truth does not magically bring her back,” she said. “I will forever grieve her loss. Her life mattered and always will.”

‘I’ve been waiting for you’
Stone was last seen by witnesses the night of Aug. 28, 1984, when she had gone to a Johnston apartment complex to see Geremia.
Narragansett police say Geremia confirmed Stone had stopped by his apartment asking to barter a stolen watch for drugs, which he claimed not to have. He said he drove her back to her apartment in Cranston. Other witnesses interviewed then claimed to have seen Stone alive as of Aug. 30, 1984.
“Because of these supposed later sightings of Debra—and because investigators were able to corroborate Geremia’s statements that (1) Debra took a cab to his apartment and (2) she had a stolen watch with her — they did not consider Geremia to be a suspect at the time,” a report released by the cold case unit Wednesday states.
That changed in 1986 when an informant told police he had helped move Stone’s body out of Geremia’s apartment and dumped it into the Narrow River. The informant had also corroborated evidence that was not disclosed to the public.
Baum called the informant “a credible witness.” But police at the time did not consider him one, ultimately ending their relationship with him after failing a polygraph exam — even as he agreed to do another.
“We could not find a reason why we stopped using that major informant,” Baum said. “So there was no activity.”
The Narragansett Police department reopened the case in 2019, eventually teaming up with the AG’s new cold case unit after its formation in 2023. In 2024, Baum said they managed to track down the informant who remained cooperative.
“The first thing he said to us when he went to his door was, ‘I’ve been waiting for you,’” Baum said.
And despite the passage of time, Baum said the informant’s statements, along with separate ones made by his then-girlfriend, remained consistent and thus provided sufficient evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that Geremia murdered Stone.
Stone’s family was not present for Wednesday’s press conference, but Neronha said they were aware of the unit’s findings.
Narragansett Police Detective James Wass, thanked the AG’s office for finally bringing a sense of closure.
“Forty-one years is a long time to wait for answers,” Wass said.

Aspirational timelines
Neronha admitted he acted prematurely when he went public about being close to solving the two cases from his testimony before the Senate Finance Committee on May 8, 2024. State House. He said he has had minimal involvement with the cold case unit, but had wanted to push the team to make progress.
“A lot of the timelines I am trying to establish are aspirational,” he told Rhode Island Current after the press conference.
The reality of solving cold cases requires a lot of leg work in tracking down past witnesses for new interviews and waiting for labs to confirm forensic tests, Neronha said.
Since its establishment, the cold case unit has identified more than 150 cases. The team is actively investigating 21 homicides. The unit is awaiting forensic genealogy results on three cases, Baum told reporters.
Most cases, Buam said, involve women. He declined to state other demographics.
“Cold cases [unit] does not discriminate,” Baum told reporters.

(Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources)Kentucky wildlife management officials say a wild deer in Pulaski County has tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD), a fatal neurological disease that impacts deer, elk and other cervids. 
A Wednesday release from the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources states two independent types of test from a 2.5-year-old white-tailed deer confirmed it had CWD, marking the second case of the disease found in a wild deer in Kentucky. CWD is a fatal prion disorder similar to mad cow disease that much is still unknown about. The deer was harvested by a hunter during deer season.
The first case of CWD was detected in a wild deer in Ballard County in 2023, and state officials found nine total cases of the disease at a Breckinridge County farm that was raising the deer behind a fence. More than 100 deer in total at the Breckinridge County farm were killed this summer in part to prevent further spread of the disease. 
Ben Robinson, the wildlife division director for the department, in a statement said the routine and regular collection of samples has been a “key component in monitoring the health of our deer and elk herds.” The department states the agency has tested more than 70,000 deer and elk across the state for the disease. 
“While this detection of CWD is not in close proximity to the other detections, we will work with hunters and partners to try to contain it,” Robinson said. 
The department plans to schedule a public meeting in November in Pulaski County to discuss CWD and consider “suggested actions” at a December meeting of the Kentucky Fish and Wildlife Commission, the board that oversees the department. 
The commission has previously implemented “surveillance zones” across counties around where detections have been found in an effort to block the spread of CWD.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Deer-buck-in-field-1024x670.jpg,,,2025-10-29 18:16:50.561175

(Photo by Shannon Heckt/Virginia Mercury)After three days of partisan wrangling in a surprise special session, the Virginia House of Delegates on Wednesday approved a proposed constitutional amendment that would give lawmakers limited power to redraw the state’s congressional districts mid-decade — a move Democrats say is needed to protect the commonwealth if other states manipulate their maps for partisan gain.
The measure, House Joint Resolution 6007, sponsored by Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, passed 51-42 along party lines after a tense floor debate that laid bare deep divisions over both timing and intent. 
Willett said on the House floor that his proposal would create “a narrow exception” allowing the General Assembly to modify congressional lines “if another U.S. state withdraws its congressional districts mid-decade for reasons other than completing the decennial redistricting or complying with a court order.”
He emphasized the amendment would expire in 2030, leave the state’s independent redistricting commission intact, and give final authority to voters through a statewide referendum.
“This resolution is temporary,” Willett said. “Most importantly, it allows the voters of Virginia to decide whether there is redistricting or not. Our hand has been forced … because of events in the country, unprecedented events.”
 GOP decries “power grab”

Republicans argued the measure ignored the two-thirds of Virginians who voted to create an independent redistricting commission in 2020.
“This resolution is nothing more than a partisan power grab by the majority party to overturn the will of Virginia voters,” said Del. Chris Obenshain, R-Montgomery. “As we approach Halloween, it is a frightening attempt to resurrect a Frankenstein’s monster of gerrymandering in our commonwealth.”
Del. Tim Griffin, R-Bedford, accused Democrats of hypocrisy. 
“We didn’t see the language of this until yesterday,” he said. “Somebody said, well, we don’t change the constitution lightly. Bro, you guys have four constitutional amendments right now that we’re considering. You do it lightly.”
Republicans also warned the amendment comes in the middle of an active election season, when early voting is well underway. 
“Now one million Virginians have already voted in this election,” said Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington. “Are you still going to support this six days from now if the results don’t go your way?”
The proposed amendment wouldn’t affect this year’s election, as constitutional referendums must be approved by two successive General Assemblies before going before the voters for final ratification. 
Speaker Scott defends process, blasts Trump
House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, dismissed GOP complaints about secrecy.
“I don’t think it was a secret. We just had a public vote,” Scott told reporters after the session. “We followed the rules the House has had for 250 years. We got it done.”
Scott praised Willett’s leadership and said Democrats acted responsibly in response to redistricting turmoil in Republican-run states. 
“Virginia cannot afford to sit on the sidelines while Donald Trump tramples on our Constitution,” he said. “Not one of them said his name today. They are terrified of him. We had to give voters the option to make a change if they so wanted.”
 Committee debate sets the tone

Earlier in the day, the Democratic-controlled House Privileges and Elections Committee advanced the amendment on a 12-9 party-line vote after an emotional hearing.
Chair Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, said the measure responds to “extraordinary circumstances” threatening federal democracy and the Voting Rights Act. 
“Five years may sound like a short amount of time, but not when your democracy is directly under attack,” she said. “As the times have changed, the voters deserve to have their say.”
Republicans on the committee countered that voters already had their say in the 2020 referendum.
“I represent no one from Texas, no one from California,” said Del. Mike Cherry, R-Colonial Heights. “Tying our Constitution to any other state isn’t responsible, and it should stay unprecedented.”
Del. Phillip Scott, R-Spotsylvania, said Virginia’s existing congressional map “reflects how Virginians vote” and should not be changed. “Virginia should be a beacon of what is right,” he said.
 A public divided

Public witnesses were sharply divided.
Tram Nguyen, executive director of New Virginia Majority, urged lawmakers to advance the amendment so voters could decide. 
“Virginia is not a ballot-initiative state,” she said. “We rely on you to give us an opportunity to weigh in. Taking the first step today gives voters a way to participate directly in our democracy, and it’s critically needed at this time.”
Jamie Lockhart of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Virginia said Trump-aligned Republicans in other states were “attempting an unprecedented power grab to steal congressional seats, rig the 2026 midterm election, and silence voters.” 
Opponents argued that Democrats were undoing the bipartisan redistricting reforms Virginia voters overwhelmingly supported.
Michael Huffman, executive director of the Virginia Assembly of Independent Baptists, said the amendment “threatens to undermine the concerns of local constituents and the broader implications of fair representation.” 
He added, “We need to stop talking about Trump, stop talking about other states, and uphold an amendment that was overwhelmingly voted for by 66% of Virginians just five years ago.”
Spotsylvania Commonwealth’s Attorney Ryan Mehaffey called the proposal “an obvious partisan effort to seize power.” He said, “If the Constitution is capable of being temporarily bent to the whims of partisan politics, what use is it? This effort severely weakens the integrity of our system of governance.”
 GOP lawsuit challenges session

On Tuesday, a group of Republican legislators and a citizen commissioner of the Virginia Redistricting Commission filed suit in Tazewell County Circuit Court, arguing the Democrats’ effort to amend the Constitution during an ongoing election violates state law and the separation of powers.
The plaintiffs — including Sens. Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, and Bill Stanley, R-Franklin; House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott; and Commissioner Virginia Trost-Thornton — are suing the clerks of the House, Senate, and Tazewell Circuit Court.
Their complaint targets House Speaker Scott’s Oct. 23 letter reconvening the May 2024 special session, initially called for budget purposes, to consider the redistricting amendment. The suit argues that only the governor can call a special session and that such sessions must be confined to declared topics — in this case, fiscal matters.
The plaintiffs are asking for a declaratory judgment voiding House Joint Resolution 6006, the procedural step Democrats used Monday to expand the session’s scope, and for an injunction preventing clerks from certifying or posting the amendment.
Speaking at the Capitol, Kilgore said the lawsuit is about “defending Virginia’s Constitution and ensuring elections remain fair.” He cited Virginia Code § 30-13, which requires 90 days’ public notice before a constitutional amendment appears on a ballot.
“There’s clearly a violation,” he said. “A clerk has no way of posting the 90 days for a constitutional amendment at the courthouse steps. It’s just not possible under this rushed process.” He noted that more than a million Virginians have already voted. 
Kilgore warned that Democrats’ proposal could shift representation toward Northern Virginia. 
 “Extraordinary circumstances”

In closing remarks during the committee meeting, Willett said the proposal was about safeguarding democracy, not seizing power. 
“We don’t amend the Constitution lightly,” he said. “We only do that in the most extraordinary circumstances, and I think those are before us today. There is no disenfranchisement here — in fact, there’s enfranchisement, because we’re letting the voters of Virginia have a voice.”
The measure now heads to the Senate, where Democrats hold a slim majority and where debate has already grown heated. If approved this year and again in early 2026 by the next General Assembly, the proposed amendment would appear on a future statewide ballot for voter approval.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, could be cut off Saturday for over 680,000 Oklahomans if the federal government shutdown doesn’t end. While officials don’t yet know how great the impact of losing SNAP could be on food banks, Gov. Kevin Stitt said the state won’t be using the state’s around $1 billion in savings yet. 
The Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma, which serves 53 counties in central and western Oklahoma, is aiming to double its efforts should SNAP be cut off. This will cost $5.5 million per month, but it won’t be enough, officials said. 
“Our food charity system … provides one meal for every nine meals that SNAP provides,” said Stacy Dykstra, CEO of the Regional Food Bank of Oklahoma. “I just want to make sure that we’re really clear about that. What we are doing as food banks, we are being so deliberate and intentional to find every food resource we can find and to deploy it the most effective and efficient way we can in partnership with our amazing partner network.” 
The regional food bank has already seen a 37% spike in people asking for food assistance for the first time.

The best way to help is to donate money to food banks, Dykstra said. Food banks are also always in need of volunteers and donations, she said. The most needed donations are canned goods, including meats, soups, fruits and vegetables. 
Stitt on Wednesday asked Oklahomans to step up to help their neighbors, to shop at their local grocery stores who will also feel the financial pinch, and to call on Congress to reopen the federal government.
“At the end of the day, big picture, the federal government needs to quit fighting,” he said. “They need to solve this problem. They need to fund this clean (continuing resolution), and stop throwing politics into it and trying to throw other policy items into this.”
The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 because Congress has failed to find a bipartisan path forward on a stopgap spending bill by the start of the federal fiscal year. A Republican proposal seeks to temporarily keep the government open through Nov. 21. Democrats back a separate plan to permanently restore health subsidies for those who buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace.
If the shutdown continues, other federal programs in Oklahoma, like child care, will soon be at risk, Stitt said. 
“If it continues into Dec. 1, it will be a minimum of $350 million that we are shorted in the state of Oklahoma for some of these programs,” he said. 
Stitt said using the state’s nearly $1 billion “rainy day fund” isn’t an option to fund SNAP at this point because the federal government hasn’t guaranteed the state will be reimbursed. If the state were to use the fund, there’s limits to how it’s used, Stitt said.

The fund can only be used in the case of revenue failure, which is not the case here because it’s a “federal government problem,” Stitt said, and there is a withdrawal limit of $300 million that requires the permission of two-thirds of the Legislature which would require a special session. Further complicating the issue, Oklahoma does not have access to the cards SNAP beneficiaries use to add funds to them, Stitt said. 
“If things continue, Jeffrey Cartmell, who runs (the Department of Human Services), is looking at all that,” he said. “We’re talking to the vendor that monitors those cards to see if we need to do something in the month of December later on, what does that look like? How quickly can we get that going?”
Oklahoma’s House and Senate minority leaders, Sen. Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City, and Rep. Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, said the governor needs to be doing more to help Oklahomans now and said lawmakers should convene for a special session. 
“Governors across this country have managed to set up funding for food banks and EBT cards for their citizens—our Governor could do the same,” Munson said in a statement. “Standing in front of an organization doing the work and asking for assistance while providing no real solutions is offensive. There are solutions that we can enact if we come together.”
Kirt said the solutions Stitt offered are “inadequate.”

“We cannot allow children to starve or be traumatized trying to find their next meal,” Kirt said in a statement. “The federal government must find a solution and end the worry and confusion of the many Oklahoma families who rely on SNAP for their groceries. We cannot expect charity to fill this huge public safety gap.”
Cartmell, director of Oklahoma Department of Human Services which administers SNAP, said state leaders are working with tribal governments to discuss ways to work together and shift SNAP recipients to tribal food assistance programs that have not yet been affected by the shutdown. 
Cartmell said officials were meeting with 12 tribal nations to expedite the transition process. Oklahomans cannot be recipients of both SNAP and the tribal food assistance program. 
Pastor Cody Anderson said churches across Oklahoma have worked to connect ahead of this looming food crisis. 
He encouraged faith leaders and churches to respond and provide resources to their communities beyond this current crisis. 
“If 5,000 churches respond to this today and they began to put together 50 boxes of emergency food, and they do that twice a month … that’s almost a half a million people that are served in our communities, in our areas, and it helps relieve the pressure off the incredible job that the food banks do,” Anderson said.

Deena Bishop, commissioner of the Alaska Department of Education and Early Development, said most displaced students have enrolled in Bethel or Anchorage schools. She estimates 100 students have enrolled in Bethel, remaining in the regional hub of Western Alaska and the Lower Kuskokwim School District. State officials estimate 140 students have enrolled in the Anchorage School District so far, according to an update on Sunday. 
Students have also enrolled in other schools across the state, but in smaller numbers, depending on where families have relocated after the storm, Bishop said. Those include the Nenana and Fairbanks areas, the Kenai Peninsula, Matanuska-Susitna Valley Borough, and other rural areas, as well as boarding schools.  
“All the support from the state, including from the Department of Education, has been in support of what the family would like to do,” Bishop said. 
For those in Anchorage, she said the Anchorage School District is coordinating with state, tribal and non-profit partners to provide services to students and families — including transportation from emergency shelters to schools, health services, meals, and English translation services for predominantly Yup’ik families.

The Anchorage School District said it is trying to keep displaced students together. It has enrolled a number of students in the Yup’ik immersion program at College Gate Elementary, which provides bilingual classes and cultural activities, as well as the Alaska Native Charter School, Lake Otis Elementary, A.J. Wendler Middle School, Bettye Davis East Anchorage High School and King Tech High School. 
Bishop said teachers and school communities are welcoming students, and “doing an excellent job in just a devastating situation.”
Anchorage Superintendent Jharrett Bryantt was not available for an interview, but echoed the district’s commitment in an update to the school board on Oct. 21. “There was one common trend, which is that our teachers, our principals and our community members are standing with Western Alaska, and they were there to greet the students and make them feel as welcome as possible during this difficult time,” he said.
Many students left their villages in the mass evacuation in the days after the storm devastation, with just one bag they could carry. Bryantt acknowledged the culture shock and trauma of the displacement as families relocate and resettle. Evacuees face challenges like finding housing and replacing clothing and personal belongings. Some are reuniting with family, neighbors and pets.
“We’re not just here to teach them. We need to address the whole child, and in this moment, as strong as these students are, they’re going through trauma and it’s going to take a lot of work,” he said. “But we’re going to put that in, because these kids are worth it, and they deserve a wonderful education that we want to offer them, in ASD, for as long as they’d like to be here.”
Lower Kuskokwim School District Superintendent Andrew “Hannibal” Anderson said the re-enrollment of their students into other schools in Bethel and Anchorage is going well, and added the districts are working with families through the ongoing logistics of replacing documentation and finding long term housing. Particularly in Anchorage, he said there’s an effort to keep Lower Kuskokwim students and classes together. 
“So Anchorage [School District] has really very much been the key in helping our students find places and to find opportunities for more of our students to be together rather than randomly spread throughout the Anchorage community,” he said.
Anderson said some teachers and paraprofessionals who evacuated from the west coast region have even begun working for ASD, but the majority have stayed in their district and communities where they’re working out new positions.
He said as the students flow to different parts of the state, the district is working  to reassign the teachers who stay. That involves considering their certifications and any vacant positions that already exist in the district, as well as new positions that have emerged as displaced students enroll.
“The primary effort is to support as well as we can the already existing relationships between students and teachers, and then see what we can do with that as time moves forward,” Anderson said.
Rural schools at center of Typhoon recovery
The Lower Kuskokwim School District encompasses most of the region hardest hit by ex-Typhoon Halong. Many of its 22 village schools served as emergency shelters in the days after the storm, and are now centers for the recovery and relief efforts. The region is accessible only by boat and plane.

Some 400 people sheltered in the school in Kwigillingok, and more than 500 people in Kipnuk, two of the hardest-hit communities in the first days after the storm, before mass evacuations began.
Anderson commended the schools and staff on the frontlines of the disaster for “receiving so many of the community members into the shelters and there and taking care of them, providing all they could for the needs of large numbers of people.”

And now he said many school staff are involved in the relief efforts, as schools have utilities and space to serve as central community sites and house emergency crews responding to storm damage. Anderson said schools are often the largest and most stable facilities in their communities, so it is a “great contribution” to the recovery effort. 
Some schools in the region are still grappling with power outages, including Kipnuk, Kwigillingok, Kotlik, Nightmute and Akiak. Akiak has been without power since a power plant failure in mid September. Others that suffered less storm damage are up and running, Anderson said. “Far and away, most of the schools in the district are functioning,” he said.
Disaster funding for rural schools 
Bishop said disaster relief is the state’s immediate priority. But as students and families find more permanent housing and get settled into schools, she said DEED is applying to federal grants so that the state can fund districts’ extra costs. 
She said school districts are taking care of students and making sure they don’t have to wait for services, so now the state will work with districts to figure out financial support that adheres to statute. 
She said “it was definitely the message of the governor that either receiving schools, as well as the Lower Kuskokwim schools, should be compensated, and we are to work on figuring that out.”
She said districts will also qualify for disaster relief from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, under the federal disaster declaration. “Each of the schools affected could get upwards of a $250,000 grant,” she said.
Bishop said the long term impacts remain to be seen, and the ultimate goal is to get residents back to their communities. “We don’t want anyone to get lost in a big city, and we don’t want anyone to get lost anywhere. We want to be able to work with the state and those other divisions to restore those communities, to create healthy communities again, where they can live and work and go to school together,” she said. 
State officials estimate more than 1,500 people are displaced by the storm disaster. The state has received 1,104 applications for state individual assistance, according to a statement from the Alaska Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management on Tuesday. Applications are open on the state’s website, through Dec. 9. Individual assistance is also available from FEMA and from the American Red Cross.

Answering questions in front of the Kentucky Industry Conference held in Lexington this week, top Republican candidates — former Attorney General Daniel Cameron, U.S. Rep. Andy Barr and businessman Nate Morris — reiterated their support for President Donald Trump’s agenda. Former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath, the only Democratic candidate to address the forum, offered a different view and said “what we’re seeing from this administration right now is dangerous and not normal.” 
The candidates are hoping to succeed longtime Republican U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell after he announced he would not seek reelection earlier this year. Tuesday’s forum was held at the end of the Kentucky Industry Conference in Lexington. The candidates each appeared on stage for a few minutes to answer questions from a moderator. There were no questions from the audience, but the topics largely focused on the economy and federal trade policies. 
McGrath eagerly answered a question about Trump’s tariff policies during her few minutes with the crowd, and repeatedly criticized the president for imposing tariffs on imports from several countries, including American allies. The U.S. Senate voted in favor of a resolution to repeal Trump’s tariffs on Brazil Tuesday and was expected to take up a similar measure on tariffs for Canada. 
“Folks, I’m not going to mince words. This is stupid policy,” McGrath said. “Now, I’m not completely opposed to tariffs if they’re targeted. That makes sense in many ways. But what we’re seeing happening right now is a chaotic mess.”

The Republican candidates were supportive of Trump’s tariffs and trade policies when they took to the conference stage. Cameron pointed to a recent $2.5 billion investment by Apple to expand glass manufacturing in Kentucky with Corning.
“That’s because of President Trump’s economic agenda,” Cameron said. “And I think we need to admit that there are successes that we are seeing, and what President Trump is trying to do right now is restore some balance when it comes to those trade agreements.”
Asked about Trump’s trade policies, Barr said he supports the president’s positions because “I believe in free trade.” Barr added that he recognizes there is some “turbulence in the short term,” but said he backs policies that decrease national dependence on foreign sources and builds up a domestic manufacturing base. 
“Think of it in terms of opening up export markets in the long run,” Barr said. “That’s good for American manufacturing.”

Morris pointed to Kentucky repeatedly voting for Trump in presidential elections since 2016 as a sign that voters in the state back the president’s agenda, including tariff and trade policies. 
“It’s shameful that President Trump carried Kentucky by 30 points, and we’ve got a delegation that doesn’t support him, and he needs a delegation that supports his agenda. Because that’s what Kentucky voted for,” Morris said. “And people can go back and forth, this or that, but the bottom line is, that’s what the people wanted. That’s what the people voted for, and we need a senator who’s going to go and stand with President Trump, especially on these issues.” 
Both of Kentucky’s senators, McConnell and U.S. Sen. Rand Paul, voted with a handful of Republicans to repeal the Brazil tariffs this week. Paul and another Republican in Kentucky’s congressional delegation, U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie, have drawn ire from the president for voting against some of his policies, including the GOP megabill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Trump has gone so far as to endorse a Republican challenger, Ed Gallrein, against Massie in the 4th Congressional District primary in May.

Asked by reporters about the Trump-backed primary challenge to Massie, Morris said he is focused on his campaign for U.S. Senate. “We haven’t endorsed anyone in any race, but I’m standing with the president. I’m with the president,” he said. 
Cameron offered a similar comment ahead of the forum and also pushed back against a rumor before Gallrein’s announcement that Cameron would run against Massie and drop out of the U.S. Senate race as “an absurd notion.” He also highlighted recent polling from his campaign and Barr’s campaign that shows Cameron in the lead in the U.S. Senate primary. 
“I think at the end of the day, I’ve got to be focused on what am I going to do as a United States senator to reflect the values of folks all across our 120 counties,” Cameron said. 
Meanwhile, McGrath again echoed her opposition to Trump while taking reporters’ questions before the forum. She launched her 2026 bid for U.S. Senate in early October, after previously losing the 2020 election to McConnell. 
“I don’t know a whole lot of people who are happy with the way things are going in our country at the federal level right now,” she said. “There’s a lot of chaos, and what you’re seeing at the federal level is dangerous and not normal. And I think a lot of people get that, and so they’re hungry for someone to step up and just tell the truth. And that’s what I’m doing right now in running for this seat.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/capitolsunsetsept302025-1024x769.jpg,,,2025-10-29 17:58:29.795799

An Article V convention has never been called in the nation’s history but Senate Majority Leader Cindy Creem of Newton and House Assistant Majority Leader Alice Hanlon Peisch of Wellesley say the rescission resolution should be approved to secure current constitutional rights by preventing a convention.
The Constitution allows states to propose amendments if two-thirds (34) of state legislatures call for it, and the offices of the two state legislators said Wednesday that a convention “could open the entire Constitution to unpredictable changes, as there are no clear guidelines or limitations on what delegates could propose.”
Creem and Peisch cited concerns that the Republican-controlled Congress and the Trump administration could use prior Massachusetts resolutions to support a push for a convention. The rescission resolution itself cites prior and technically still applicable state applications for a convention in 1977, 1974, 1971, 1964, 1941 and 1931.
“Calls for an Article V constitutional convention open the door to rewriting the very principles that have guided our democracy since its inception,” Creem said.
Aides cited media coverage about the potential for a convention, and Peisch offered her concern to reporters at the State House on Wednesday.
“The one that we’re most concerned about, for example, is one that would call an Article V convention for the purposes of banning abortion — clearly, not something that the residents of Massachusetts are currently interested in,” Peisch said. “There is a movement in the country — some in Massachusetts, not many — but there is a movement in the country to utilize the resolutions that states have passed over the years and neglected to rescind to meet the threshold number.”
Aides to Creem said Massachusetts could be the “pivotal” 17th state to rescind previous calls for a convention but acknowledged the count is fluid as states rescind prior resolutions and enact new ones.
The lawmakers said Connecticut and Washington this year rescinded prior resolutions calling for an Article V convention, following New York (2024), Illinois (2022), New Jersey (2021) and Colorado (2021).
The rescission resolutions (HD 5295 / SD 3332) will get a public hearing. It appears they will be sent to the Committee on Veterans and Federal Affairs, which is co-chaired by Sen. John Velis and Rep. Joseph McGonagle.
“It’ll get to us,” House Speaker Ron Mariano said Wednesday about the resolution. “It’ll get to us.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/US-Capitol.png?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-29 17:58:29.795799

Elissa Slotkin speaks to a crowd at the Brookings Institution’s 2025 Knight Forum on Geopolitics. Oct. 29. | ScreenshotU.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin sounded an alarm bell, characterizing President Donald Trump’s actions as “following the same playbook as almost every authoritarian in history,” in a speech the Democrat from Holly gave at the Brookings Institution’s 2025 Knight Forum on Geopolitics on Wednesday. 
Slotkin, herself a CIA officer and former Pentagon official, laid out how Trump had garnered so much power — running on a legitimate concern of cost of living, surrounding himself with those loyal to him, and accumulating influence. 
She also laid out how in other authoritarian governments, there comes a “tipping point” where the person in power realizes they have to stay in power somehow to prevent that very power from being used against them. In this case, that could happen in two ways, Slotkin said. 
The first would be a scenario where Trump invokes the Insurrection Act and tries to impose martial law, either cancelling elections or surrounding polling places with military. The second, she continued, would be labeling opposition groups as terrorists or criminals, undermining the competitive nature of an election. 
“There’s more than one way to lose our democracy,” she said. “I’m popping a flare today because we’re in danger of that happening here at home.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
But Slotkin also found hope in the “internal barometer for things that sound and smell authoritarian” that she said Americans have. 
“Here’s what Trump hasn’t planned for: the will of the American people,” she said. “I’ve seen this in Michigan, where even ardent Trump supporters don’t like what they’re seeing.”
Much of Slotkin’s criticism centered on Trump’s recent strikes on 14 ships in the Caribbean in which 57 people have been killed, allegedly part of cartels and carrying drugs to the United States.
Slotkin was clear that the alleged premise of the strikes was not something she inherently opposed — but that she did strongly oppose the fact that Trump, when pressed by the Senate Armed Services Committee, would not give the names of those groups being targeted. 
“I’m actually sympathetic to going after these types of groups, given what drugs do to Michiganders every day,” she said. “But here’s what’s different about the strikes and what’s precedent-setting: the President and Secretary Hegseth are refusing to tell the American people who we are fighting.”
That lack of clarity on foreign targets led Slotkin to believe that the same kind of force — including lethal force — could be used against Americans who he deems enemies, especially as the National Guard has been deployed in cities such as Chicago. That idea, she said, “should chill every American to the bone.”

Slotkin also referenced a policy enacted by the White House in late September, which she had previously criticized on the Senate floor, that gives the president and the Attorney General broad authority to investigate any person or group that they consider to be involved in domestic terrorism or political violence. 
“It seems clear from his own order that Trump plans to see how far he can stretch the law before someone tells him no,” she said. “And if the administration won’t publicly name drug cartels in the Caribbean, you can bet that they’re not going to tell you the name of this new list of domestic terrorist organizations, only this time the secret lists are not made up of drug traffickers and international waters, it’ll be Americans on American streets and in American homes.”
“I never thought I’d have to lay this out about my own government,” she said. “The idea that intelligence officers could be asked to target Americans turns my stomach.” 
Slotkin also told the crowd that she is introducing legislation to give Congress the ability to immediately end a military deployment in an American city, the No Troops In Our Streets Act.

(AP) — Three monkeys were still on the loose Wednesday in Mississippi after a truck carrying the research animals overturned, but it remained unclear who owns the monkeys, who was transporting them and where they were being taken.
The monkey mystery has left a host of unanswered questions for authorities.
Officials said at midday Tuesday that all but one of the escaped Rhesus monkeys had been killed. But the Jasper County Sheriff’s Department later said officials from Tulane University got into the trailer Tuesday evening and determined three monkeys had escaped.
Sheriff Randy Johnson said Tulane officials reported the monkeys were not infectious, despite initial reports from the truck’s occupants warning that the monkeys were dangerous and harboring various diseases. But Johnson said in a statement that the monkeys still needed to be “neutralized” because of their aggressive nature.
The truck was carrying Rhesus monkeys, which typically weigh about 16 pounds (8 kilograms) and are among the most medically studied animals on the planet. The 21 monkeys on board had recently received checkups confirming that they were pathogen-free, Tulane said in a statement Wednesday. The university said it wasn’t transporting the monkeys and didn’t own them, but sent a team of animal experts to help with their care.
The monkeys were being housed at the Tulane University National Biomedical Research Center, which routinely provides primates to scientific research organizations, according to the New Orleans school. The research center is about 40 miles (65 kilometers) north of New Orleans in Covington, Louisiana.
Video from Tuesday shows monkeys crawling through tall grass on the side of Interstate 59 just north of Heidelberg, Mississippi, with wooden crates labeled “live animals” crumpled and strewn about.
The truck was no longer at the scene Wednesday, but people wearing white coats, gloves and hair nets were searching the area along with law officers.
University officials will be in the area looking for the missing monkeys, the sheriff said. All other monkeys were being transported back to Louisiana.
Dr. James Watson, Mississippi’s state veterinarian, verified that the animals had the proper documents and “certificate of veterinary inspection” for legal transport across state lines, he said in an email to The Associated Press. The state’s Board of Animal Health wasn’t involved in the response to the crash, and additional information would need to come from Tulane’s primate center, he said.
If anyone sees monkeys, they should call the authorities and shouldn’t approach the animals, the sheriff’s office warned.
The Mississippi Highway Patrol said Wednesday that it was investigating the cause of the crash, which occurred about 100 miles (160 kilometers) from the state capital, Jackson.

The Iowa Department of Natural Resources highlighted its frequent bat surveys and actions to protect their habitat during an international celebration, known as Bat Week, to spread awareness about bats. 
While bats are often associated with the spooky season, Bat Week is all about promoting the year-round benefits, like pollination, insect control and seed dispersal, that the flying mammals provide to the ecosystem. 
Bats are also known to eat crop pests, like corn rootworm and corn earworm. One study estimated that bats save corn farmers an estimated $1 billion annually because of their helpful eating habits.

DNR’s batty projects 
In 2015, DNR partnered with Iowa State University to create a volunteer wildlife monitoring program to help track trends in bat populations in the state. 
Iowa citizen scientists can sign up for the project and drive slowly along a predetermined route with a special microphone mounted to their car. The microphone picks up and records echolocation calls of bats and researchers can analyze these recordings to determine the species of bat. 
The acoustic monitoring surveys have allowed DNR to gauge the distribution of bats in the state, and monitor the decline of certain species that are most hard-hit by white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease.
The data show the tri-colored bat and the myotis, or northern long-eared bat, populations have declined in eastern Iowa because of the deadly disease, which hits bats during hibernation. 
Despite being the “most imperiled” species of bat in Iowa, the data show the myotis is present in all Iowa regions. The big brown species of bat, followed by the eastern red species, are most common throughout the state. 
The Indiana bat is the other endangered species that calls Iowa home, though white-nose syndrome and loss of habitat have contributed to its population decline, according to ISU. Little brown bats, big brown bats, and tri-colored bats are also susceptible to white-nose syndrome. These bats tend to hibernate in cool, dark areas like caves or abandoned mines where the fungus thrives. 
Iowa’s additional bat species include the silverhaired bat, evening bat and hoary bat.

In addition to monitoring bat populations, DNR has worked to restore bat habitat via private forest restoration, and the department incorporates bat-friendly practices to its forest stewardship plans. 
According to DNR, bats thrive in forests that have a mostly open “mid-story,” trees with loose or clumpy bark, dead trees and lots of insects to eat. 
Forest restoration includes removing invasive species like Japanese honeysuckle and European buckthorn which can crowd the mid story of a forest. Staff also use prescribed burning and certain forest thinning techniques to restore the habitat for bats. In all forest management plans, DNR includes a recommended percent of dead trees that should be left standing to provide habitat for bats. 
From 2022 to 2024, DNR restored over 800 acres of both public and private forest using these methods and federal dollars earmarked for habitat restoration for endangered bat species. 
What you can do to help bats
Similar management practices can be employed on private forest land, or on residential properties to help protect bat habitat. 
DNR considers trees like shagbark hickory, shellbark hickory, white oak and American elm to be “bat friendly” trees since bats can make a home under the shaggy barks. Planting these trees or refraining from chopping them down can give the nocturnal critters a safe place to rest during the day.
Property owners can also work to remove invasive species that clog up the bat-friendly forest, and leave some dead trees standing when it’s safe to do so. 
Iowans can also stay out of mines and caves during the winter months, when bats might be using them for hibernation.  
Finally, adding a bat box to a property gives bats a home, and might keep them from trying to roost in an attic. Big brown bats are most likely to try to roost in human structures, according to DNR. Iowa State University has several resources for safely removing bats from a home and on building a bat box.

A Pride Center program that has for years provided services to LGBTQ+ people affected by violence is continuing at a partner organization.
Since the Pride Center of Vermont paused operations earlier this month, its SafeSpace Anti-Violence Program has been housed at the Vermont Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence, a statewide nonprofit that has been operating since 1986, according to a press release last week.
The program has played a crucial role in helping the LGBTQ+ community access essential resources — such as advocacy, education and community support when they experience violence, threats or intimidation. That is urgent as threats against the community continue to escalate, program director Em Russo said.

“The survivors we support rely on our advocates to offer an affirming space where their identities are not only validated, but celebrated,” she said in the Oct. 20 Vermont Network release.
The transition is designed to ensure uninterrupted support and advocacy for LBGTQ+ survivors of violence, said Connor Daley, a member of the Pride Center’s board of directors, this week.
The Pride Center has also partnered with Vermont Network’s Steps to End Domestic Violence to keep its free and confidential support hotline running 24/7. 
SafeSpace advocates can still be reached through the hotline at 802-863-0003.
Operating since 1999 and one of the state’s largest organizations supporting the LGBTQ+ community, the Pride Center of Vermont continues to review its finances and look for solutions to bridge a $350,000 funding shortfall. 
Much of the gap was caused by the unpredictability of a reimbursement-based state funding model and a prior deficit. But the main issue was “structural rather than situational,” the board of directors announced in an update last week.
The board is working with community partners on reforms and plans to launch opportunities for community involvement in the coming weeks.

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Supporters of an effort to open the state’s primary voting system on Wednesday began gathering signatures.
They have until Jan. 28 to collect 172,993 signatures to get State Question 836 on the ballot.
Supporters are aiming to get the measure on the November 2026 ballot, said A.J. Griffin, a former Republican state senator who is volunteering.
If approved by voters, all candidates for an office would appear on a single primary ballot. Every voter, regardless of party registration, could participate.
The top two finishers, regardless of partisan affiliation, would advance to the general election.
“Today’s launch was the next step in a year-long process to fix our election system in Oklahoma,” said Margaret Kobos, founder of Oklahoma United, a local nonprofit which helped initiate the ballot measure. “Oklahomans are ready for an open primary system where every voter matters and has a voice.”
Critics have said the measure forces political parties to unwillingly associate with political candidates in violation of the First Amendment.
Oklahoma law allows recognized political parties the option to open their primaries to independent voters.
Currently, Democrats have opened their primaries to independent voters, but Republicans and Libertarians have not.
“I really feel like our process isn’t fair to all voters,” Griffin said. “It limits voter participation.”
Oklahoma is 50th in voter turnout, Griffin said.
She said the measure would give everyone access, which is important because some races are decided in closed primaries or runoff primaries and do not involve a general election.
“The general elections across the state of Oklahoma are almost inconsequential in most elections,” she said. 
If approved, candidates would have to face all the voters, she said.
Those currently registered as independents are currently blocked from most elections, Griffin said.
She said the effort will be run by volunteers but will have paid petition circulators. The vast majority of funding raised to support the initiative petition is coming from Oklahoma, Griffin said.
A new law, created by Senate Bill 1027, which puts additional restrictions on the initiative petition process, does not apply to State Question 836 following a ruling by the Oklahoma Supreme Court, Griffin said.
Critics of the measure filed an unsuccessful challenge to stop it in the Oklahoma Supreme Court.

(Courtesy New Mexico Environment Department)New Mexico environment officials told lawmakers Wednesday that efforts are underway to clean up pollution from a handful of uranium mining and petroleum sites, but said it will take more funding and decades to address the full scope of the problem.
Earlier this year, the legislature earmarked $20 million in one-time funds to clean up abandoned contaminated sites that did not otherwise qualify for state or federal funds.
Cleanup money for uranium mines and other contaminated sites in budget, for now

During a presentation to legislators meeting in Artesia for the interim Water and Natural Resources Committee, state environment department officials said they’re on track to clean up three former uranium mines, along with petroleum pollution from both the Tucumcari Truck Terminal and the former Aerex Refinery in San Juan County.
However, one-time funds won’t address the whole problem, according to NMED Water Protection Division Deputy Director Kelsey Rader. In all, the environment department has identified 348 industrial sites with “suspected or known contamination” that pose risk to environmental and human health and have no responsible party for their cleanup. An “unknown number” of former dry cleaning sites that could pose further risks to groundwater also exist. 
She said the conservative estimate to clean up sites is over $100 million.
“Really, that $100 million is going to go first to remediation to those sites that are ready to go, that are shovel-ready, that are project ready,” Rader said. “We can’t rule out, though, that there is going to be a chunk of that funding that is going to be spent, trying to figure out what the extent of some of the contamination is across the state.”
As for the one-year funds, NMED will use $2 million for the legal activity to investigate if any responsible parties exist to shoulder the cost. For the actual remediation, NMED said the state will use $6 million to truck out contaminated soil in spring 2026 from the two sites with petroleum pollution.
The remaining $12 million will be split between the clean up of three uranium mines near Grants: the Schmitt Decline Mine, Red Bluff No. 1 Mine and Moe No. 4 Mine. 
Rep. Rod Montoya (R-Farmington) asked why the federal government isn’t paying for remediating the state’s uranium mines from decades past, noting that federal requests for nuclear power and weapons drove most mining in New Mexico through the 1990s. 
NMED’s uranium mine reclamation coordinator Miori Harms said the federal Environmental Protection Agency has jurisdiction to clean them up, “but they lack the capacity so, in their prioritization, all of these neglected smaller mines fall off the radar. They focus their energy on the bigger issues, like the mills.” Harms noted the state only recently gained authority to clean up uranium mines itself.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-29-at-2.33.53 PM.png,,,2025-10-29 17:16:31.952641

Jeremy Dean, a Springfield Democrat, speaks in February in the Missouri House (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).The Missouri House Ethics Committee on Wednesday wrapped up an investigation into an obscene text message sent from one lawmaker to another during September’s legislative special session.
State Rep. Lane Roberts, a Republican from Joplin and chairman of the ethics committee, said after the panel adjourned that he does not plan any more hearings into the matter or a second complaint that was also on the Wednesday agenda.
During the nearly five-hour hearing, state Reps. Cecelie Wiliams, a Republican from Dittmer, and Jeremy Dean, a Democrat from Springfield, testified about the Sept. 4 text.
The text was sent while the General Assembly was meeting in a special session called by Gov. Mike Kehoe to revise Missouri’s congressional district boundaries and pass a ballot measure asking voters to change how majorities are calculated for constitutional amendments approved by initiative petition. 
Dean was participating in a Democratic sit-in in the House chamber when he sent the text to Williams, who was in a hearing of the House Local Government, Elections and Pensions Committee.
President Donald Trump pressured Kehoe and Missouri Republicans to change the district boundaries to make it likely a Republican could win the 5th District seat held by U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Kansas City Democrat.
In the text, Dean included a description of an oral sex act with the president and questioned how Republicans could talk while engaged in it. 
The text message became public when a screenshot of it was shared on social media by former Republican state Rep. Adam Schwadron.
State Rep. Lane Roberts, upper left, opens a hearing Wednesday of the Missouri House Ethics Committee. The committee is considering two complaints against House members stemming from actions during a recent legislative special session. Also shown are Bryan Scheiderer, Missouri House general counsel, and state Rep. Jaclyn Zimmerman, a Democrat from Manchester (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent).
Neither Dean nor Williams would comment Wednesday when approached after testifying to the committee. Hearings of the ethics committee are closed and Roberts did not say what, if any, punishment the panel’s report will recommend.
“The information will go to Rep. Dean, and then he has a period of time to determine whether or not he will object to the findings,” Roberts said in an interview after the committee adjourned.
Under the committee’s rules, it must publish a report within 45 days of concluding its investigation. The committee can dismiss the complaint if it determines it is not well founded or seek punishment ranging from a letter of reproval to a recommendation that a member be expelled from the House.
Whether there will be another hearing to complete the report, Roberts said, “depends on whether or not Rep. Dean agrees with or objects to the findings.”
The second complaint, Roberts said, will be referred to the Missouri Ethics Commission because “they’re more set up for the nature of that complaint.”
He said he couldn’t disclose any details or the name of the person who is the subject of the complaint.
At the start of Wednesday’s hearing Roberts told the other nine members of the committee that its review of the complaints will be impartial.
“Whatever decisions this committee renders will be based on the evidence, conscience and a strict, scrupulous appeal to the rule,” Roberts said. “It will not be based on some concern about threats of retaliation. It’s important to make that very clear.
“I have faith that we will make a conscionable decision.”
When the complaint against Dean was filed, House Minority Leader Ashley Aune of Kansas City said Democrats would be watching to see whether Republicans would try to make an example of him. She said she had warned House Speaker Jon Patterson that “my caucus has receipts, too.”
Aune stripped Dean of his committee assignments after the text became public.
On Wednesday, Aune declined to say whether Democrats had fulfilled that threat with a complaint, citing the confidentiality of ethics committee deliberations.
The 10-member committee is the only one in the House that split evenly between Republicans and Democrats; all other committees match the partisan ratio of the House, where there are 107 Republicans, 52 Democrats and four vacancies.
Earlier this year, the committee issued a letter of reproval to state Rep. Justin Sparks, a Republican from Wildwood, over his involvement in an appropriation related to his employment with the National Law Enforcement Foundation. The committee reported it found “no support for the claims made in the complaint,” but found Sparks took “one to three votes with an apparent conflict of interest.”

In 2016, Jamie Raskin was elected to Congress from  Maryland just as Donald Trump was first elected president. Raskin, a former constitutional law professor, and Trump, a real estate developer who flouts rules and shatters norms, have been locked in a struggle ever since.
When Congress impeached Trump in 2021 for inciting an insurrection, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi tapped Raskin to be the lead impeachment manager, essentially Trump’s chief prosecutor. He subsequently served on the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. 
Raskin is now the Ranking Member of the powerful House Judiciary Committee and has been a vocal adversary of the Trump administration. In the past few weeks, he has accused U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Krisi Noem of “unlawfully detaining U.S. citizens,” demanded that Trump explain “a blatantly illegal and unconstitutional effort to steal $230 million from the American people” and denounced “military-style tactics” in Chicago. 
Jamie Raskin represents Maryland’s 8th Congressional District, which borders Washington, D.C. He has authored several books, including the bestseller “Unthinkable: Trauma, Truth and the Trials of American Democracy,” a searing exploration of the death of his son and the struggle to defend democracy under Trump. 
I spoke with Rep. Raskin on Tuesday as the government shutdown approached the one month mark. 

This transcript has been edited for length and clarity. 
David Goodman  
American democracy and the Constitution are undergoing a stress test right now. How do you think they’re holding up?
Rep. Jamie Raskin  
I think that the people are holding up better and better, and the people are very much leading the movement against authoritarianism. The No Kings rallies were an astonishment. Speaking as a political person and as an old-school organizer from my college days, to put 7 million people in the streets is quite a stunning accomplishment, the largest protest in American history. So that’s powerful. In civil society, more and more people are standing up. The colleges and universities that take a stand are the ones that have become popular, and the ones that cave in are the ones who look awful. It’s the same thing with the law firms. The ones who’ve caved in like Paul Weiss look like capitulationists to authoritarians. 
Here’s what’s going on in the courts: there have been more than 400 cases brought against this reign of lawlessness and terror and we have won between 85 and 90% of the cases in district court, and similarly impressive numbers in the appeals courts. Some of the most moving opinions have been by Republican appointees rejecting unlawful deployment of the National Guard, rejecting the attempt to strip birthright citizenship from people born in the United States. Our problem has just been one court in the land, and unfortunately, it’s the highest court in the land. It’s the Roberts Court. And when they’ve been able to get things into their so-called shadow docket, the emergency docket, then the numbers reverse, and we’ve been losing overwhelmingly there. We haven’t lost completely. There have been some things we’ve been able to hang on to, but they slice the baloney extremely fine up at the Roberts Court. It is a MAGA-dominated court, and that’s been our major problem. 
So the bottom line is, we’re just in the fight of our lives and it’s a struggle every single day. But the more you get out to large numbers of people, the more we’re winning. A great example of that is the Jimmy Kimmel episode, where millions and millions of people registered their protest in a massive public outcry against the president purporting to get to appoint national comedians or veto national comedians. That’s not the role of the President of the United States under the first amendment. We have the right to make fun of every politician without getting kicked off of the air. And I think that was asserted very strongly by the people, and ultimately by ABC and Disney, and certainly by Kimmel, who’s only gotten more popular and funnier ever since this happened.
David Goodman  
One of the under-reported elements of that Kimmel affair was the role that a boycott played. Following Kimmel’s suspension in September, some 3 million people cancelled their Disney+ subscriptions,  Disney-owned Hulu lost 4 million subscribers, and Disney lost over $6 billion in valuation within a week. 
This made it into Jimmy Kimmel’s first monologue on his return when he joked that the network asked him to explain to people how to resubscribe to Disney+. The mayor of Chicago has spoken of the need for a national strike. Will Democrats, who are under attack in their cities, begin to use economic power as one of the ways they respond?
Rep. Jamie Raskin  
This has always been a part of democratic movement politics in American history. Dr. King was critically boosted by the Montgomery bus boycott and went down to Montgomery because this had begun. That was the central mechanism for turning things around in Montgomery and making the small businesses and the big businesses in Alabama feel the weight of the consumer purchasing power of the African American community and its allies. We saw with the grape boycott, the lettuce boycott, all of these things have been critical mechanisms of political protest and change. 
David Goodman  
And there was Gandhi’s Salt March and the Boston Tea Party. These economic actions have always been a cornerstone of effective resistance. 
Rep. Jamie Raskin  
That’s absolutely right. More and more the pro-democracy, pro-freedom forces in the country are feeling the power and flexing the muscle and the muscle memory of what a consumer boycott is. 
David Goodman  
Of the many shocking images that flash across our screens right now, the most disturbing is the sight of US troops in American cities and masked federal agents randomly abducting and assaulting people with seemingly no accountability. You and Representative Jayapal recently wrote a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem demanding, “Why do you continue unlawfully detaining U.S. citizens?” Has anything worked to restrain ICE or to slow down this military assault? 
Rep. Jamie Raskin  
Everything works to a certain extent, which is why no good act in this process is wasted. People need to speak out. I just finished Alexei Navalny’s book called “Patriot.” He wrote it from one of Putin’s filthy prisons after Navalny made the breathtaking decision to go back to Russia, knowing exactly what he would face there. Navalny said the critical thing is that you’ve got to do the thing that the regime fears the most, which is you’ve got to tell the truth at every turn. That’s why if they are apprehending and detaining and deporting in some cases US citizens, we need to document that. We need to protest it. We need to assert the absolute legal illegitimacy of it. 
That’s true of everything that goes on every day, whether we’re talking about the bulldozing of the White House in violation of all kinds of laws, including a law criminalizing the destruction of federal property, to stripping people of birthright citizenship, to the recent news that Donald Trump is seeking to get a check written by Todd Blanche, the Deputy Attorney General and his former private defense lawyer, for $230 million to him because of how much pain and suffering was inflicted on him when there was a judicial search warrant executed at Mar-a-Lago and when there was an investigation into Putin’s interference in the 2016 presidential election in America. He might not like the fact that there was a judicial search warrant leveled against him, but if everybody got $230 million when that happened, that would be hundreds of thousands of people across the country who have search warrants executed against their homes and offices every year. And no, you don’t get to walk off with a quarter billion dollars because of that. 
We need to be speaking out about every single episode of criminality, every single high crime and misdemeanor, every single violation of the Constitution.
David Goodman  
Today, we learned there were another three strikes on four boats in the eastern Pacific, this time killing 14 people in just one day, bringing the running total to around 60 people who’ve been killed in what Senator Rand Paul has called “extrajudicial killings.” What is going on here and what can be done to reassert the law?
Rep. Jamie Raskin  
Well I will tell you one thing it’s not: it’s not a war, because a war has not been declared by Congress, so he’s acting outside of the Constitution. Nor is it a criminal investigation or police action that’s at all cognizable by the US Constitution, because the President has appointed himself in this scenario the police, the prosecutor, the judge, the jury and the executioner all in one swift moment. So if it’s not a war, and if it’s not a legitimate police investigative prosecution, what is it? Well, it is indeed an extrajudicial, extra-constitutional military police action. He’s sending warships and aircraft carriers from Europe into the Caribbean Sea in order to conduct these strikes on people without any proof or evidence or showing that these people are at war with the United States or even that they’re drug dealers. And being a drug dealer doesn’t subject you to instantaneous capital punishment outside of due process anyway. 
This is why I’ve come to believe that “due process” are the two most beautiful words in the Constitution. Because it’s what separates everybody’s rights and freedoms from arbitrary state power. If they can do this to people who we suspect are foreigners, why can’t they do that in America to ships off our coast, or ships in the Great Lakes or on a river someplace? They’re asserting this completely lawless power to do it. 
One of my Republican colleagues said to me when we were debating this one day, “You’re not for due process for guilty people, are you?” And I’m like, “Yeah, that’s the whole point. We don’t know that they’re guilty people until they’ve had due process.”
David Goodman  
Trump is a master of distraction, waving shiny keys over here so you don’t look over there. What do you worry that we’re not paying enough attention to right now?
Rep. Jamie Raskin  
You just raised one of those, which is this casual licensing of the idea that Trump can just go around the world blowing up ships when he wants to. People are rightfully outraged and infuriated by the deployment of National Guard troops and other military troops into our cities, and also the use of ICE in a completely unrecognizable way. These are people who are in masks, driving unmarked cars, conducting warrantless arrests, and nobody knows what the hell is going on. People are furious all over the country when they see what they’re doing in our communities. Whoever heard of Army troops or Navy sailors or Air Force people in masks? It doesn’t make any sense, and yet they’ve created this monstrous ICE force which they’re trying to define as somehow outside of the rule of law, and we can’t tolerate that. We have a constitution that applies to every part of the US government. You cannot create parts of the government that are extralegal or lawless. 
A lot of the Declaration of Independence was about the king keeping standing armies in people’s communities without legislative consent, swarming officers into communities to intimidate people, quartering large bodies of armed troops among the people, cutting off trade with other parts of the world unilaterally without the consent of the legislatures, imposing taxes and tariffs on people without their consent. This stuff goes back to the beginning. Our Posse Comitatus Act says that you can’t use the army for ordinary law enforcement purposes.
David Goodman  
So many of the decisions at the lower court levels go to die at the Supreme Court, especially in the shadow dockets. President Biden resisted talk of reforming or expanding the court. Do you think this makes a case for reforming the court in some fashion, whether it’s expanding it or something else?
Rep. Jamie Raskin  
The court has been deformed. It has been packed and stacked and sliced and diced and gerrymandered by the MAGA Federalist Society project. Take my constituent, Merrick Garland, who became Attorney General under President Biden. He was nominated to the Supreme Court by Barack Obama in February 2016 in the last year of Obama’s term, after the death of Justice Scalia. Then Sen. Mitch McConnell said, “No, 11 months is too close to the next election. We’re going to let the people decide,” completely avoiding the fact that the people had decided by giving Barack Obama one of those genuine, bonafide four year terms in office, where even in the last year he had the right to nominate judges and justices. They just pocket vetoed his nomination. He never even had a hearing. Then when Ruth Bader Ginsburg died in September 2020, that was just a couple months before the election. And everybody said (to Sen. McConnell), “Well, you didn’t allow Obama to get his nominee heard, you’re not going to hear the Trump nominee, are you?” And he just laughed and said, “Oh, that was a rule for Democratic presidents. That’s not for us.” And then within a seven or eight week period, they just railroaded and barreled through Amy Coney Barrett. 
There’s illegitimacy in terms of the composition of the court. There’s clearly illegitimacy in terms of the jurisprudence of the court, just fabricating doctrines out of whole cloth, like the president is immune from prosecution for felony crimes committed within the core functions of his office. We went for more than two centuries without discovering that the President was actually immune from prosecution for felony crimes he committed under the auspices of his office? I don’t think so. 
David Goodman  
Is this a roundabout way of saying that you would support reform of the court in some fashion?
Rep. Jamie Raskin  
We need dramatic reform of the Supreme Court. … We obviously can talk about changing the composition and the numerical composition of the Supreme Court. That’s not fixed by the Constitution, that’s set by statute. There have been nine or 10 different changes in our history to the numbers of people on the court. One of the things I’ve always thought is that it’s ridiculous that we have 13 federal circuits and just nine justices, which means that at any one time at least four circuits are going to be left out. Because there’s no geographic distribution requirement at all, certain places like New York City are radically disproportionately over represented. We have five justices from New York City on the court right now, which is basically one for each borough. I love visiting New York just like the next person, but I don’t think that we need five justices of whatever ideological stripe coming from New York City. If we wanted to revisit this, we can move to a 13 member court where each federal circuit is guaranteed at least one representative, which is actually the way the Federal Reserve Board does it, that there is a geographic representation requirement.
David Goodman  
There has been a lot of criticism of the Democratic Party, most notably by Sen. Bernie Sanders, who said after the November 2024 election, “It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.”
What do you believe Democrats need to do to win back those who feel that they’ve been abandoned or feel that the party is not speaking for them?
Rep. Jamie Raskin  
I certainly believe that we need to reinvigorate the right to organize a union, which has been just ripped to shreds in so many different ways through different kinds of retaliation by employers that does not get remotely sufficient redress by the National Labor Relations Board or in court. I believe in the creation of universal rights, including the right to organize and the right to collective bargaining. But the central one today we need to work on is the right to health care. That should be in America as it is in Canada or in most of the advanced industrial countries. That should be a universal right and entitlement that’s attendant to citizenship in the country. We’re in the richest society that’s ever existed at our richest moment that we’ve ever had and we can afford health insurance for our people, so we’re not constantly fighting these rear guard actions to try to defend Medicaid, ACA, tax credits and so on. The Republicans want to turn the clock back and throw millions of people off of the health care they have now, which in many cases is itself meager and inadequate, but it’s something. 
I don’t think it’s in very good form for Bernie to be attacking the Democratic Party if he’s not willing to become a Democrat and join the Democratic party with all of its virtues and all of its flaws and struggle for it. I’m willing to stay in the Democratic Party and fight for a strong, true blue progressive program and not just attack the party from the outside.
David Goodman  
Finally, we’ve been talking about the trials of the country as it’s enduring this stress test. You have your own experience confronting personal trials. What gives you hope and what enables you to persevere through these challenges?
Rep. Jamie Raskin  
Well, I appreciate that, David. When I was growing up, my dad used to say to us, “When everything looks hopeless, you are the hope.” So I grew up with that sense of hope, and I suppose guilt and responsibility that all of us have to be fighting hard every single day. No matter how tough we might think something we’re going through is, there are almost undoubtedly people who are going through something even tougher. All of us can do something to help people right now who are facing the loss of their nutrition and food benefits in the SNAP program. All of us can do something to help people who are facing the loss of their health insurance because of the Republicans or the loss of Medicaid coverage. 
Solidarity will be the watch word to get us through this nightmare. We can make it fun and we can make it exciting and we can make it uplifting and inspiring as the No Kings rallies have done. We have great comedians and artists and musicians, leaders, activists, organizers, commentators, writers, critics, poets. This is the culture of America. This is who we are. If you read the Constitution and its subsequent amendments, the whole trajectory of our development has been towards greater inclusion and greater democracy. The 13th amendment abolished slavery. The 14th amendment gave us equal protection and due process. The 15th amendment banned race discrimination in voting. The 17th amendment gave us direct election of US senators. The 19th Amendment doubled the franchise with women. The 23rd amendment said people in DC could participate in presidential elections. The 24th amendment banned poll taxes. The 26th amendment lowered the voting age. Of the 17 amendments we’ve had since the original Bill of Rights, the vast majority are about expanding and deepening democracy. There’s great hope in that. In some sense, what we’re living through with this Trump nightmare is just a reaction against that, a rebellion against the country we’ve become and the country that we are becoming. 
People are defending democracy and freedom every day. Democracy is always a project. It’s something in motion. Tocqueville saw that in “Democracy in America.” He said democracy and voting rights in the country are either shrinking or they’re expanding. We’ve just got to get back on the expansionary growth track. 
One thing I agree with Trump with is statehood. But I’m not talking about Greenland and Canada and Panama, which have not asked for statehood. I’m talking about Washington, DC, the only national capital on planet Earth not represented in its own legislature. I’m talking about 3.5 million people in Puerto Rico who don’t even get to vote for president and just tasted the bitter price of colonial subjection when they were cheated out of hundreds of millions of dollars in Hurricane Maria funding and Trump threw some paper towels at them. 
We need a universal constitutional amendment giving everybody the right to vote. It’s 2025, how about we start electing the president the way we elect mayors and representatives and senators and governors? Whoever gets the most votes, wins, instead of this totally accident-prone electoral college system which is completely undemocratic and unrepresentative. It’s given us five popular vote losers in our history, twice in this century alone, in 2000 and 2016. 
We need to really be moving democracy forward and strengthening democracy at the national level, at the state level, the county, the municipal level, strengthening democracy in the workplace and empowering our people. The alternative with Trump is we’re going to lapse into some other form of government, whether it’s monarchy or authoritarian dictatorship or plutocracy or theocracy — all those ingredients are there. We’ve got to fight for strong democracy in this century.

(Photo via U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission)One of two nuclear reactors at the Susquehanna Steam Electric Station in Luzerne County shut down automatically Tuesday night at the same time firefighters were dispatched to the plant, its owner Talen Energy reported to federal regulators.
A spokesperson for the company said an incident occurred when workers were filling a hydrogen tank and a cloud of the flammable gas unexpectedly ignited, triggering the shutdown. Hydrogen is normally vented when the tank is filled to ensure proper storage, Talen’s director of communications Taryne Williams said in a statement.
“Out of an abundance of caution, plant personnel contacted EMS. First responders were dispatched, but no emergency actions were necessary as there was no remaining fire and no injuries,” Williams said.
“The plant responded as designed and as part of its built-in safety mechanisms, Susquehanna Unit 2 went offline without incident,” Williams added. “It is currently stable, and operators are in the process of returning the unit to service. The station remains in a safe condition and there are no injuries or risk to employees or the public.”
Video captured by a firefighter driving near the plant at the time of the shutdown and posted on Facebook shows a prolonged bright flash that illuminated a cloud of smoke or vapor above the ground.
According to Talen’s report to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the plant’s Unit 2 reactor was operating at 100% power around 7 p.m. when it shut down in a safety procedure known as a SCRAM. The NRC defines a SCRAM as the sudden shut down of a reactor by the rapid insertion of control rods that halt the nuclear reaction. Talen said all systems performed as expected.

SCRAM events occur when a nuclear power plant’s control systems sense conditions outside of normal parameters. It triggers an automatic process to stop the reactor and other systems to safely shut down the plant, Dave Lochbaum, former director of the Nuclear Safety Project for the Union of Concerned Scientists, said.
Lochbaum, who worked as a consultant at the Susquehanna plant, said it’s not unusual for the cause of a SCRAM to be unknown immediately after the event. Talen has 60 days to investigate and report its findings to the NRC along with steps taken to correct the issue.
“The owner wants to make sure that they fix the problem too. They’re trying to make money,” he said.
The Unit 2 reactor may resume operation before the follow-up report is submitted, Lochbaum said, but the NRC has inspectors assigned to the plant who will verify that it is safe to restart. 
The Susquehanna Steam Electric Station reactors have had eight SCRAM events since 2020, according to the NRC, which has recorded 29 SCRAM shutdowns at nuclear plants across the country so far this year.
“The local fire department responded to the site with lights and sirens active which caused heightened public concern on social media. An event of potential public interest notification was made to the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA),” the report said.
Talen said in the report filed Tuesday night that it was investigating the event.
“The NRC is satisfied the plant responded appropriately to the situation, and the plant and community remain safe,” the agency said in a statement.
PEMA did not immediately respond to inquiries by the Capital-Star.
The 2,400 megawatt nuclear power plant in Salem Township is one of several Pennsylvania power plants that have attracted interest from data center operators.
Amazon Web Services announced in March that it had purchased a 1,200 acre site adjacent to the plant from Houston-based Talen. The company expects to build out the site with data centers. In June, Talen and Amazon entered a power purchase agreement in which the plant would supply more than 1,900 megawatts of electricity to power the data centers.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/6517604381_4d6d55d5be_h-1024x664.jpg,,,2025-10-29 17:02:39.295831

On Tuesday, the federal Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling vacating and overturning a previous decision from U.S. District Judge David Faber in 2022, remanding the case back to Faber’s court once again.
In the decision, Senior Circuit Judge Barbara Keenan wrote that the court believes Faber “misconstrued” the reach of existing public nuisance laws and the roles of the drug distributors named in the case. 
Faber’s 2022 ruling found that the distributors — AmeriSource Bergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson — could not be held liable for the ongoing drug and overdose epidemic that has drastically harmed both Huntington and Cabell County for more than 20 years under state public nuisance laws.
In Tuesday’s decision, Keenan said that the appeals court disagrees with Faber’s ruling and several arguments made by the distributors that contributed to that ruling being reached.
“Upon review, we disagree with the district court’s analysis. Initially, we hold that under West Virginia common law, the conditions resulting from the over-distribution of opioids can constitute a public nuisance,” Keenan wrote. “We also hold that in assessing the local governments’ claim, the district court misconstrued the distributors’ duties under the [Controlled Substances Act]. This error materially affected the court’s analysis of the distributors’ conduct.”
The ongoing litigation started years ago, when Huntington and Cabell County opted out of a statewide lawsuit against opioid distributors in order to bring their own legal action in hopes of earning more money for remediation efforts. The arguments made in their case against the distributors, however, are nearly identical to those that were made on behalf of the state in its litigation. 
The state’s case proved successful. 
The localities have argued that the excessive distribution of opioids in their communities caused significant harm, spurring what is now a decades-long and still ongoing drug epidemic. According to the state Office of Drug Control Policy, at least 876 individuals in Cabell County died from overdoses involving opioids between 2015 and 2021, the highest fatal overdose rate for opioids in the state over that time.
Distributors named in the ongoing litigation allege, as they have in opioid cases across the country, that public nuisance laws do not apply when legal products are being distributed.
Cabell County and Huntington are seeking about $2.5 billion from the companies to support recovery efforts in their communities and implement a plan to decrease the impact of the crisis.
The ruling overturning Faber’s decision was based largely on how state code applied public nuisance laws. Last March, the Fourth Circuit asked the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals to decide whether state law recognizes conditions caused by prescription drug sales to be a public nuisance, and if so, what the elements are of such claims.
In May, the state’s highest court declined to answer that question due to “disputed factual findings and related legal conclusions resting on those factual findings.” That left the federal court to decide the question itself, leading to Tuesday’s ruling.
Keenan wrote that state law “broadly” defines what constitutes a public nuisance. Per West Virginia common law — which is law created through previous legal decisions instead of through bills enacted by the Legislature — public nuisance is defined as “an act or condition that unlawfully operates to hurt or inconvenience an indefinite number of persons.”
The overprescription of opioids, Keenan continued, clearly constitutes an “act or condition” that imposes harm on the general public. As such, the case should be interpreted through that lens — as numerous other cases in West Virginia have been, both regarding opioid distribution and other nuisances.
In a statement Tuesday, the National Prescription Opiate Litigation Plaintiffs’ Executive Committee co-leads said they were “thankful for another opportunity to seek civil justice” for the harms caused by AmeriSource Bergen, Cardinal Health and McKesson.
“[T]he Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals confirmed that the devastation caused by the opioid epidemic can be addressed through the law of public nuisance, affirming our clients’ rights to hold those responsible to account for their role in flooding communities in West Virginia with opioids,” they wrote. “… There is still much work to be done, and we look forward to our return to the trial court for further proceedings.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Gov. Ron DeSantis doesn’t think Florida Democrats should tell him about their fears of low-income Floridians losing access to food benefits.
Instead, DeSantis wants them to write their concerns to Chuck Schumer, the U.S. Senate Democratic Leader from New York.
“Did those Democrats write a letter to Chuck Schumer asking him to stop filibustering the spending?” DeSantis asked brusquely at a Tampa press conference on Wednesday.
“Come on.”
He was responding to a reporter’s request for comment on a letter penned Tuesday by the Florida Legislature’s Democratic delegation imploring he use his emergency powers to ensure that three million Floridians who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — a federal food assistance program — don’t go hungry.
The Democrats were hoping the governor would declare a state of emergency, dip into Florida’s rainy day fund, and pay for, then distribute, food to various pantries statewide. This comes as the federal government nears a month of being shutdown, meaning SNAP benefits will likely expire on Nov. 1.
The Phoenix previously reported that SNAP provides nutritional support for low-income seniors, people with disabilities living on fixed incomes, and other individuals and families with low incomes. Florida has the fourth largest SNAP enrollment nationwide with 2.94 million relying on the assistance for their food security, behind California, Texas, and New York.
Nationwide, 41.7 million people rely on SNAP benefits.
DeSantis, who dodged whether he’d use emergency powers, pinned the blame on Schumer for leading Senate Democrats on Tuesday in voting for the 13th time to block a House-passed bill to reopen the federal government, the Hill reported.
In order to reopen the government, Schumer said Republicans need to negotiate the enhanced premium tax credits that help offset the costs of health insurance policies on the federal health exchange.

Battin federal courthouse in Billings, Montana (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan). In a federal courtroom in Billings on Tuesday, U.S. attorneys charged Murrell D. Deela, a Bureau of Indian Affairs law enforcement officer, with sexual assault of a 15-year-old Northern Cheyenne girl.
Deela has denied the charges.
But the charges against him are a part of a two-year history of Deela’s troubled career in law enforcement while on the Northern Cheyenne reservation, which has included shooting a man, allegedly breaking the bones of a teenager’s face, a payout from the federal government for hundreds of thousands of dollars, and an alleged arson attempt to cover the evidence of sexual assault committed by the former military sniper.
Meanwhile, tribal leaders had already banned Deela from the reservation after repeated problems with the officer. It appears that leadership within the BIA transferred Deela out of state after the issues arose on the Northern Cheyenne reservation. BIA officials have not responded to repeated requests for comment about this case from the Daily Montanan. It is also unclear if Deela is still employed by the BIA.
It’s not the first time a BIA officer recently sexually assaulted a Northern Cheyenne tribal member. In a case that concluded at the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals several months ago, judges there said the federal government was responsible for the actions of former BIA officer Dana Bullcoming who had raped an intoxicated woman while on duty, telling her that she would lose custody of her children if she didn’t have sex with him.
  New charges 

Earlier this summer, attorneys for two juvenile Northern Cheyenne girls brought separate civil suits against Deela — one alleging excessive force for punching a girl in custody so hard that it broke her orbital bone. The other charged that Deela had violated another Cheyenne girl’s civil rights when Deela allegedly sexually abused her on Aug. 7, 2024.
That incident served as the basis for the FBI investigation that culminated in charges being filed on Oct. 20 against Deela and his subsequent arrest and appearance in federal in court in Billings on Tuesday.
Charging documents, which were unsealed earlier this week, allege that at around 11:15 p.m. on Aug. 7, 2024, Deela was called to the Cheyenne Depot gas station in Lame Deer for the report of an intoxicated female. When he and another officer arrived, a girl matching the description given by police dispatchers ran, and they managed to stop her, bringing her back to Deela’s squad car.
“(She) was crying hysterically and slurring her words,” the charging documents state. A preliminary breath test revealed a 0.215% breath-alcohol content.
Deela reported to dispatchers and the other officer that he would take the girl back to her grandmother’s house, about a mile away. A short time later, he radioed that she was back at the residence.
However, investigators believe that he took the victim beyond the house and to the People’s Park, where he committed sexual assault, according to the court documents.
The next day, the victim made a report of the sexual assault to federal authorities, and she turned over the clothing she was wearing to the FBI crime lab.
On Aug. 9, the BIA chief and a FBI special agent reviewed the video of the patrol, which included the victim getting out of the car and going to her grandmother’s house. However, Deela said that he was unable to download the entire video because of technical problems with the video system. The chief told Deela to bring his patrol car back on Aug. 11 so that an employee with proper training and knowledge could download all the video.
On Aug. 11, at around 2:15 a.m., Deela radioed into dispatchers that his patrol car was on fire outside his house, according to court documents.
“Officer Deela’s patrol vehicle was severely burned from the front dashboard of the vehicle through the rear of the vehicle. The Watchguard system was severely burned during the fire,” the court documents stated of the video recording unit. “An ATF certified fire investigator determined the fire which burned Officer Deela’s patrol vehicle was an incendiary fire, i.e., a fire intentionally ignited under circumstances where it should not be.”
Though the Watchguard video unit was severely damaged by the fire, technicians with the manufacturer, Motorola, were able to recover some video files from the unit.
The video obtained by the company and recounted in court files said that at 11:26 p.m., Deela parked his vehicle in People’s Park facing the bleachers, turned off the headlights, where he took the intoxicated teenager out of the vehicle and away from the camera. At 11:42 p.m., they returned to the vehicle where they arrived at the victim’s grandmother’s house about five minutes later.
“Based on the conversation of the (victim), she was led to believe she could avoid going to jail by engaging in in a sexual act with Officer Deela,” the court documents state.
The court documents then reference the violation of federal law, which include sexual contact, penetration and oral sex.
Deela denied the entire account of the sexual assault, stating repeatedly that he had only taken the victim directly to her grandmother’s house. He also consented to a DNA sample.
Earlier this year, the FBI crime lab confirmed that there were two semen stains on the victim’s pants.
“The FBI laboratory conclude the male DNA results found in semen stain one was 96 octillion times more likely if Officer Deela was a contributor than if an unknown and unrelated person was a contributor,” the court documents state. “The FBI Laboratory concluded that the male DNA results found in semen stain two was 99,000 times more like if Officer Deela was a contributor than if an unknown and unrelated person was the contributor.”
  A longer past 

But Deela’s legal troubles don’t stop with the case filed this week.
He also faces two related civil cases centering on police brutality, including a civil suit by the same victim in the sexual assault. Attorneys John Heenan and Timothy Bechtold, both of whom successfully litigated the Bullcoming case, have sued on the victims’ behalf.
However, even before that, the federal government paid out $800,000 to the estate of another Northern Cheyenne man who had been beaten with a baton, pepper sprayed, tased and then eventually shot twice by Deela. Authorities settled the case involving Deela in March 2025, before it went to trial.
Deela’s actions on the reservation became so difficult that the Northern Cheyenne Tribal Council issued a proclamation in September 2024 banning him from being on the reservation.
In addition to case of the sexual assault, Deela was also involved in a case of assaulting a different Northern Cheyenne teenager. In that lawsuit, attorneys claim that Deela assaulted the girl badly enough to break her orbital bone in her face after punching her.
According to a lawsuit filed in federal court, Deela punched the minor on July 5, 2024, after a powwow, when her friend fled from Deela. According to the court documents, Deela was chasing the young woman’s friend, but had apprehended her.
After shoving her against a car several times, Deela accused her of being drunk, according to the documents.
Sometime after that, the young woman tangled up with Deela, at one point going to the ground. They scuffled and Deela hit her in the left eye with his right fist. Deela apparently suffered from hand injuries after punching her in the face, according to court documents.
  The death of Arlin Bordeaux 

Even before August 2024, Deela’s conduct had already become the subject of a lawsuit where the federal government settled a wrongful death lawsuit in which the officer had been accused of using excessive force, including shooting a Northern Cheyenne man in the back for what started off as a “low misdemeanor.”
Though the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office had cleared Deela in an internal investigation, the U.S. government still paid out $800,000 to Bordeaux’s estate after an expert witness and former Seattle Police Lt. David T. Sweeney submitted an investigation into the shooting of Bordeaux.
The report as well as court documents raise the issue of how much force was necessary to subdue Bordeaux, as well as calling into question how a report of trespassing wound up with Bordeaux being beaten with a police baton, pepper sprayed, tased and then shot twice.
Originally, Bordeaux was reported wandering in a yard by a property owner on Dec. 2, 2021 in Lame Deer.
Two officers, including Deela, who arrived second on the scene, had tried chasing Bordeaux and subduing him for what appeared to be trespassing. Later testing revealed that Bordeaux had methamphetamine in his system.
Bordeaux had evaded BIA Officer Fredric Gygi multiple times before Deela arrived. Gygi had tased Bordeaux twice, used the direct contact mode of the stun gun, as well as deploying pepper spray twice and striking Bordeaux four times with his police-issued baton.
Deela reported that after Bordeaux had been tased and brought to the ground, he saw Bordeaux reach for Gygi’s taser, warned him, then shot him twice, striking Bordeaux in the back with a 9-mm Glock.
An investigatory report, prepared by Sweeney, points out that the incident began with “low-level misdemeanor crimes” but escalated when officers chased Bordeaux, deploying three different forms of restraint on him.
That report, used as part of the court case against the federal government, shows Bordeaux had not attempted to hurt or assault Gygi.
“In my opinion, using a taser was not reasonable for the threat level being displayed by Mr. Bordeaux,” the report said. “It was not necessary to apply the taser…. The subject kept walking but was not exhibiting any physical or mechanical defiance to the officer’s control or toward the officer. Point of fact, Officer Gygi never even attempted any form of control or deescalation prior to the use of force.”
The report also mentioned that during the scuffle when Gygi had Bordeaux on the ground, the officer gave conflicting and contradictory commands, which could have led to confusion. The report and the material from the crime scene show that Bordeaux was crawling away from the officers when he was shot by Deela.
“Two times (Gygi) tased a passive-restraint individual that posed no active threat toward him and he got kicked. Now, he apparently believed that more force was warranted,” the report said.
However, the report by Sweeney also shows that the taser had already been deployed twice on Bordeaux, meaning it could no longer be used as a threat to the officers except as a stun gun with direct contact.
“There was no way for him to use the (taser) to incapacitate the officers,” the report said. “No BIA investigator ever asked either officer if Bordeeaux was still a threat to incapacitate with an empty taser in his hand.”
The 82-page report, which includes taser logs, shows that Deela also fired the fatal shots that killed Bordeaux.
“I find this use of force unreasonable ,” Sweeney said. “He was on his knees with the taser in his left hand. He was not even upright on his knees. His torso was low enough to the ground so that Deela shot him in the back…None of these crimes would justify the officer’s use of lethal force.”
The former police lieutenant and expert on the use of tasers also said that Bordeaux was not a threat on the ground with the empty taser.
“To use lethal force by shooting a kneeling man who is not an immediate threat to cause death or serious physical injury in the back is not reasonable,” Sweeney’s report said. “There was no evidence present that at the time he was shot in the back, Mr. Bordeaux was attempting to evade arrest by flight.”
Sweeney’s report also outlines a law enforcement concept of equal, proportional force, which would have been construed as reasonable. In a concluding section on the use of force, Sweeney outlines 11 reasons why Deela shooting Bordeaux twice should not be consider “justified use of lethal force.”
  Deela’s background 

According to deposition transcripts, Deela had been hired by the BIA in November 2020. But before that, he told attorneys that he had been involved in combat appointments with the military, including service in Afghanistan.
Deela said that he was a sniper team leader for the U.S. Army as well as a trained sniper, and a machine gunner for the U.S. Marines.
He told attorneys during questioning about Bordeaux’s death that he had deployed his weapon as a member of the U.S. Armed Forces in more than 10 “firefights.”
When he was interviewed in May 2024 about the death of Bordeaux, he said that he was involved in one other officer-involved shooting during his tenure at the BIA.
Deela also said between the time he was hired by the BIA in November 2020 until May 2024, he had deployed his taser more than 50 times. And of those times, Deela told investigators that during at least 21 of those taser deployments, he used the weapon more than once.
Deela’s deposition in the Bordeaux case took place two months to the date before the incident involving the alleged sexual assault.
Just days after that, the Tribal Council of the Northern Cheyenne adopted Resolution No. 141 for 2024, which said that it learned about the allegations against Deela.
“The council has grave concerns about the safety of individuals within the reservation if Officer Deela continues to work on the reservation while Office of Justice Services investigates his alleged misconduct,” the resolution reads in part, as justification for banishing him.
Tribal members asked for his immediate transfer, and requested the BIA issue a final report to the council by the end of that month. It’s unclear whether the BIA complied with the report request, but it appears that Deela was barred from the reservation and transferred.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/James-F.-Battin-Courthouse-Billings-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-29 17:02:39.295831

(Photo courtesy of West Virginia Office of Gov. Patrick Morrisey)Dr. Patrick Lee Miller will serve as the first director of the Washington Center for Civics, Culture and Statesmanship at West Virginia University, a new academic center mandated by Republican lawmakers for the Morgantown campus.
The bill, passed earlier this year, gave Gov. Patrick Morrisey the job of naming the center’s first director, which he announced publicly at the state Capitol in Charleston, West Virginia Wednesday.
“We said we wanted to teach students how to think, not what to think, and we wanted to ensure that the values that made America great are taught with honesty and pride,” Morrisey said.
“Dr. Miller and the Washington Center are going to push back on the woke ideology that has infected our schools and help return higher education to its true purpose,” he added.
House Bill 3297 mandated that WVU operate the “Washington Center for Civics, Culture and Statesmanship” focused on teaching constitutional studies and “great debates of Western civilization.” It will also present the “fact-based instruction on America’s founding,” according to the governor’s office.
Miller is tasked with overseeing the Washington Center, including managing and recruiting staff, overseeing its curriculum and the program’s budget. 
“We should revere this civilization. In my view, it is the greatest,” Miller said at the news conference. “I believe in order to understand this crisis, students must understand how we got here.”
Miller previously worked at Duquesne University, where he has been an associate professor of philosophy since 2012. He holds a Ph.D. in Philosophy from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
“My vision is to train students in the Western tradition, starting with ancient Greece and Rome, through the framing of the U.S. Constitution, and up to the present crisis,” he said.
Miller’s published books include “Truth, Trump, Tyranny: Plato and the Sophists in an Era of ‘Alternative Facts’” and “Becoming God: Pure Reason in Early Greek Philosophy.”
During the news conference, Miller spoke several times about a crisis in the country, but did not define its nature. 
“The crisis has many components, but I think the eruption recently of political violence in this country is a sign that there is a crisis,” Miller said in response to a question from Ogden Newspaper reporter Steven Allen Adams. “To talk about its precise nature and its causes, this is not the time for that.”
Lawmakers gave WVU $1.5 million in the state budget for the university to build the Washington Center program, including hiring Miller and faculty. The legislation required the university to have five additional faculty at the center.
The Washington Center can use existing faculty and courses to accomplish the bill’s requirements of civics instruction. 
“I’m so pleased that WVU now gets a chance to host this Washington Center and he’ll have a chance to engage in debate,” WVU President Michael Benson said. “We hope to attract wonderful scholars and faculty.”

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Business owner and political action committee co-founder Denise Powell once again led fundraising in the crowded Democratic field for Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District.
Combined, the six Democrats running brought in $1.03 million this quarter, hinting at how expensive the primary election will be, and the general to follow.
The race to represent the Omaha-based 2nd District is typically competitive. But with U.S. Rep. Don Bacon retiring, Democrats feel optimistic about picking up a win in the midterms, when the political party out of power typically gains ground. The open-seat race plays a major role in national Democrats’ hopes of regaining control of the U.S. House of Representatives.
Six candidates are vying to be the Democratic candidate for an open seat in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District. Top row, from left: Denise Powell, Crystal Rhoades and John Cavanaugh. Bottom row, from left: Kishla Askins, James Leuschen and Evangelos Argyrakis. (Candidate photos courtesy of respective campaigns | U.S. Capitol photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)
Powell, State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades, Navy veteran Kishla Askins, former congressional staffer James Leuschen and Evangelos Argyrakis are vying to be the Democratic nominee.
Among the best-known local candidates, Powell raised $311,490 in the most recent quarter, Cavanaugh raised $200,164, and Rhoades raised $50,710. Most of the trio’s donations come from Nebraska, according to federal campaign finance reports.  
Among the race’s relatively fresh faces, Askins raised $250,865 and Lesuschen raised $219,369.  Most of Lesuschen and Askins’ donations came from out of state. Both also donated to their own campaigns. Lesuschen donated $7,000, and Askins donated $14,000, forms indicate. 
Argyrakis didn’t file campaign fundraising tallies for his Democratic bid. Federal law requires congressional candidates to file campaign finance paperwork quarterly with the Federal Election Commission unless the campaign has not yet raised or spent $5,000. 
Multiple campaigns noted that some of Powell’s donations are reserved for the general election and can’t be spent during the primary. A preliminary review showed Powell had raised $620,204 for the primary and $121,025 for the general election. 
Powell, as expected, listed the most cash on hand with $481,169. Lesuschen had $211,055, Cavanaugh had $276,120, Askins had $171,394, and Rhoades had $23,112. 
The Powell campaign pointed to her fundraising lead as an indicator of her viability and ability to win. Powell spokesperson Meg Mandy said she is the only candidate with the “resources to communicate effectively” and “win both the primary and the general election.”
“I feel very fortunate to have the support of so many hardworking Nebraskans who are central to this movement to win Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District,” Powell said.

Competing campaigns have said Powell, compared to the best-known candidates, will need to spend more money to boost her name ID. She is competing with elected officials in Cavanaugh and Rhoades who have been on local ballots for years.
At least one campaign poll and one publicly released poll indicated Cavanaugh and Rhoades ahead of the others, with Powell leading the next group. 
Rhoades, a former Nebraska Public Service Commissioner, is banking on years of service and working on political campaigns as a base for her to build on. She has said she focused first on voter engagement and door-knocking over fundraising.
“I’m confident I’ll have everything I need to be successful,” Rhoades said. 
Cavanaugh, a state senator from central Omaha, pointed to his “broad support from labor unions.” He benefits from a well-known name in local politics, partly from his father’s service in Congress. His sister, State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh, serves in the Legislature with him. 
“We’re building a coalition that won’t just win the primary but will finally flip this seat blue and help us take back power from Trump,” Cavanaugh said.
Askins said she is proud that her campaign is “fueled by people who chipped in what they could because they believe in something bigger than politics.” Leuschen said he was humbled by early support. 
Powell, at $170,433, has outspent the other Democratic campaigns combined roughly 1.35 to 1.  Askins had spent $79,470, Rhoades spent $27,598. Cavanaugh spent $10,838. And Leuschen, the most recent entrant, had spent $8,314. 
The Powell campaign used some of the money for payroll, general strategy, digital and finance consulting. Cavanaugh paid for digital advertising and campaign consulting. Rhoades paid for printing and compliance consulting. Askins paid for digital consulting and texting. Leushcen paid for photography services and credit card processing. 
 The winner of the May 12 Democratic primary will face the winner of a GOP primary featuring Omaha City Council Member Brinker Harding and former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha.

Brett Lindstrom.  (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Omaha City Councilman Brinker Harding leads Republican and overall fundraising in the latest quarter of the race to represent Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District in the U.S. House. 
The two-man GOP primary between Harding and former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha will decide which candidate tries to hold the Omaha-based seat that retiring GOP U.S. Rep. Don Bacon won five times. 
Harding raised $561,527 in the third quarter, which ended in September. Lindstrom brought in $286,958. Lindstrom’s leadership PAC, Cornhusker Conservatives PAC, raised another $123,980 — though such PACs are typically used to support other campaigns. 
Harding said his “patriotic and optimistic message of making America’s next 250 years more like its Heartland is resonating.” Harding has a cash on hand advantage of $437,830 compared to Lindstrom’s $276,120. 
Harding has spent the most, $123,697, much of it on event sponsorships, campaign apparel, fundraising, social media and campaign consulting. Lindstrom spent $10,838 in the third quarter, mainly on campaign consulting.  
The spending hints at the race’s current dynamic. Harding is working on branding himself to GOP voters who might not know his city work, posting videos of himself reacting to national and local political developments on social media.

Lindstrom has leaned into name ID groundwork he laid as a candidate for governor in 2022 and as a two-term state lawmaker in suburban Omaha, Lindstrom has attended local GOP events across the district. 
Andy Finzer, Lindstrom’s campaign manager, said the campaign feels confident that Lindstrom will win the primary.

“While others talk about cutting taxes, reducing government and delivering results for Nebraska families, Brett has actually done it,” Finzer said. 
The 2nd District is the state’s most politically divided and diverse, with all of urban Douglas and rural Saunders Counties and a slice of suburban western Sarpy County. Political observers view the seat as a possible Democratic pickup in next year’s midterms, but national and local Republican operatives see a path to victory.
A crowded field of Democrats is competing to represent the party in November 2026. The list includes State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades and business owner Denise Powell, as well as Navy veteran Kishla Askins, former congressional staffer James Leuschen and Evangelos Argyrakis. 
The GOP primary is May 12.

With federal food assistance for 170,000 Mainers paused by the Trump administration amid the government shutdown, Gov. Janet Mills announced Wednesday that her administration is releasing $1.25 million to bolster food banks, Meals on Wheels, and other anti-hunger programs across the state.
The emergency funds — $1 million from the governor’s contingency account and $250,000 from the John T. Gorman Foundation — will be distributed through Good Shepherd Food Bank and Maine’s network of Area Agencies on Aging to support families, older adults, children, veterans, and people with disabilities who may lose Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits starting Saturday.
“When the federal government fails, Maine will not. When challenges arise, Maine people step up,” Mills said in a statement.
USDA won’t shuffle funds to extend SNAP during shutdown, in about-face from earlier plan

“One of the things I love about Maine is that we take care of each other, which is more important now than ever,” she added, encouraging residents to “donate to your local food bank, check on your neighbors, and support your community in the face of significant hardship caused by this needless federal shutdown.”
Maine’s plan seems similar to other states that have dipped into reserves or asked state legislatures to allocate additional funds to support food pantries. 
According to the announcement, $650,000 in funding will go to Good Shepherd Food Bank to support food pantries and anti-hunger initiatives throughout Maine and $600,000 will be provided to organizations that support older adults to bolster funding for meals in community dining locations, those to grab and go, and others delivered through Meals on Wheels.
Mills also directed the Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry to commit an additional $10,000 to the Hunters for the Hungry program, which pays the processing costs for donated bear, deer, and moose meat.
“It’s critical that we do everything we can to lessen the blow for these families and support the frontline organizations who will be working to meet an unprecedented level of demand until these benefits are restored,” said John T. Gorman Foundation President and CEO Nicole Witherbee. “For the sake of our neighbors, I hope that’s soon.”
Good Shepherd Food Bank President Heather Paquette said the funding will help meet the surge in need they are expecting as SNAP benefits lapse.
“These funds will help us provide food and other resources for the nearly 600 food pantries and other organizations that we work with,” Paquette said. “Our partners on the front lines are facing an overwhelming need for food right now and these funds will go to work immediately to help ensure everyone in Maine has access to the food they need to feed themselves and their families during this uncertain time.”
Megan Walton, board chair of AgeWise Maine, said the funds allocated to her agency will directly support efforts to prevent hunger among vulnerable older Mainers.

(Screenshot of Torrance County Commission meeting)Two days before a contract between Torrance County and the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency is set to expire, county officials have yet to receive an amended contract extending the use of the county facility to house ICE detainees. 
Torrance County Manager Jordan Barela told commissioners during a 10-minute meeting Wednesday in Estancia that the ongoing government shutdown might be behind the delay, and said it’s unclear what will happen if the county does not receive a contract extension by Saturday. 
Torrance County’s facility is one of three New Mexico detention centers housing hundreds of detainees for ICE, and its commission has faced renewed calls to cancel the agreement amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push. 
According to the latest estimates from DetentionReports.com, which collects and analyzes ICE data, Torrance currently has an average daily population of about 551 ICE detainees, an increase of about 150 detainees since Trump’s second term began. 
Immigrant advocates: NM ICE detention ban should have been on special session agenda

In recent years, Torrance County and ICE have renewed the contract with repeated months-long contract extensions, most recently with a six-month extension enacted in April that expires Friday. 
While ICE has not yet provided a new contract, “There have been some discussions back and forth,” Barela told commissioners Wednesday. “It’s my understanding that they are currently working on a 30-day contract amendment. I don’t know to what degree that the government shutdown has any implications with that.”
The commission approved delegating authority to Barela to approve an extension if he receives an amended contract from ICE in the next two days.
If ICE takes until Nov. 1 or later to provide an amended contract, Barela will have to take the matter back to the commission. In the meantime, “I imagine if there’s a lapse in the contract term, that revenue would not be coming into the county and could not be distributed to Core Civic [which operates the jail] for providing the services,” he said. 
The brief meeting did not allow for public comment, though about a dozen members of immigration advocacy groups tuned in to the livestream, including some whose profile pictures were quotes from current or former Torrance County ICE detainees alleging mistreatment.
NM advisers to US Civil Rights Commission call for closure of ICE detention facilities

The groups have cited poor conditions at Torrance, including whistleblower accounts from former jail staff and violations from the Office of the Inspector General. They are calling on the commission to cease its contract, and also on state lawmakers to pass legislation that would ban local governments from contracting with ICE.
Commissioners have pointed to the jobs that could be lost in the rural county without the funding from ICE to house detainees. Barela recently testified before a local Civil Rights commission that the detention center employs approximately 93 Torrance County residents, paying them “millions of dollars a year” in salaries and benefits in an “economically depressed area with few substitute sectors of the economy.”
Shortly before Wednesday’s vote, Torrance County Commissioner Linda Jaramillo asked Barela whether detainees would still receive services if the contract lapses. 
“I have had discussions with the facility,” he said. “I can’t definitively speak for them, though they do think that for at least a period of time, the services will continue.”
Barela’s answer did not satisfy Ian Philabaum, a program director for Innovation Law Lab, one of the groups seeking to cancel the contract. He maintains ICE detainees don’t receive the services they need now, even while the contract is in effect. 
“We appreciate her concern about people still getting the services,” he said. “But we would also like to remind the commissioner and the public of the ongoing failures of service provision, both from a due process and a human rights standpoint that occur every single day.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screen-Shot-2025-10-29-at-9.02.58-AM-1024x552.png,,,2025-10-29 16:02:59.623863

It’s easy to forget important milestones when they mark something significant that didn’t happen, but it’s a moment worth recalling – and toasting.","AS OCTOBER DRAWS to a close, baseball fans are being treated to a riveting World Series featuring some of the sport’s biggest stars. Unfortunately, none of these games are taking place at Fenway Park.  
But that doesn’t mean there’s nothing to cheer about in Boston as the 2025 baseball season nears its climax. This year marks an important anniversary for the oldest stadium in Major League Baseball, one well worth celebrating in a region that puts a premium on preserving its past.  
It was 25 years ago that Fenway Park was saved from the wrecking ball whose time, we were told, had come. It’s easy to forget important milestones when they mark something significant that didn’t happen, but it’s a moment worth recalling – and toasting. 
Like most Bostonians, I distinctly remember my first game at Fenway Park. I was seven years old in 1979 when my father and I emerged from the darkened concourse to the bright lights and green glow from the field of what John Updike indelibly termed our “lyric little bandbox of a ballpark.”  
Almost every Bostonian has a memory like that: A father, a mother, a grandparent, an uncle, a neighbor who took them to their first game, introducing them to a civic ritual that is as storied as any in this city of rituals. 
What many have forgotten now is just how close Boston came to losing its beloved ballpark. At that first game, I could never imagine that some 20 years later, I – as a first-term city councilor — would have a front-row seat for the battle to save Fenway Park, and how it would overwhelm everything else in my nascent political career. 
The plan to tear down Fenway Park was first announced by Red Sox president and CEO John Harrington on May 16, 1999. For the 14 seasons that Harrington led the team, while he would be responsible for onboarding some of the players who would go on to win the 2004 World Series, the team never once played in the championship series. 
This must have haunted him, for despite the Red Sox consistently being among the highest paying teams in baseball, he couldn’t make it to the main event. To become a championship team would require something more. To win, he believed, the team needed a new ballpark. 
“In the long run it’s just not feasible to compete in Fenway,” Harrington would explain in a business forum in 2000. 
The plan he unveiled for a new stadium would expand the current ballpark’s footprint to over 15 acres, nearly twice its current size, and increase the seating capacity by over 10,000. It was estimated at the time to cost $545 million and would require the absorption of approximately two dozen privately owned parcels, as well as the intervening streets and sidewalks. 
What wasn’t mentioned at the time was that more than half the cost of the new park was to be covered by public funds from the city and state. 
At the time, I was a candidate for the Boston city council, crisscrossing my way through a district that extended from the Boston Common to the edge of the Longwood Medical Center at the border of Brookline. 
As a long-shot to win, and with limited funding, my strategy was to knock on the doors of each and every voter in a district with 70,000 residents — not once, but three times.  
I was young — only 27 at the time. But I had learned from the best, having previously worked in the administration of the man who would go on to become Boston’s longest serving mayor, Tom Menino. I learned that voters wanted someone to roll up their sleeves and get the job done. Little did I know that Boston’s defining issue as it entered the new millennium would be the future of Fenway Park, which sat squarely in the middle of the district I sought to represent. 
When I was first asked about the proposal for the new ballpark, I was at a candidate’s forum. Maybe it was because I got the question before the others, or that I just hadn’t prepared a clever political answer with room to pivot. Maybe it was because I ran a campaign in all the ways you weren’t supposed to. Or maybe it was a quick flashback to that first game with my father. But my answer helped me earn a streak of independence that was important to many of the voters within the district. And so, I said something like: 
“That’s ridiculous. Who would want to tear down Fenway Park? It’s a national treasure and one of the defining landmarks of our city.” 
It felt good that day, and all the times that I was thanked for my stance by active residents of the neighborhood, including those from the group Save Fenway Park! and the Fenway Community Development Corporation, who had been organizing around the ballpark issue for months.  
But the list of “who would want to tear down Fenway Park” was long and powerful. It started with my former boss, Tom Menino. 
The majority of the city was behind the new stadium plan. The sports world was convinced that only with a new park could Boston recover from the drought that had left it without a World Series championship since 1918. The business community loved the idea of new jobs, corporate boxes, and renewed attention for their city. And the political community saw a legacy-making decision for the ages. This holy trinity came together in a whirlwind campaign to build Boston a world-class stadium, and woe to those who stood in its way. 
On November 8, 1999, I won my election in a close race. I was now the city councilor for District Eight, which included an extremely prominent property located at 4 Yawkey Way.  
The plan to rebuild Fenway Park was moving quickly. In this summer of 2000, the state Legislature overwhelmingly passed a bill allowing $312 million in public funds, not including another $140 million coming from the city for the development of a parking garage, a deal that was hatched in a multiple-hours meeting just days before the end of the legislative session. 
Momentum was on the side of the new park, and I was part of a fledgling group of underdogs that was trying to stop it. 
I remember during this period trying to get basic city services completed within my district. Calls from department heads suddenly were not returned, and in more than one exchange I was told by the person on the other end of the phone that they were not allowed to talk to me. Going against the grain had its costs, and I was paying for it. 
It was around this time that I visited Fenway Park, not to see a game, but to inspect the structure. John Harrington himself met me to provide the tour. Harrington was a bit of a showman. My visit came on the heels of the successful 1999 All-Star Game at Fenway, which hadn’t hosted the midsummer classic since 1961. 
Some have argued that the All-Star Game itself saved the park from demolition – spotlighting for a national audience the beauty and splendor of what was soon to no longer be. An appearance by an aging Ted Williams, enthralling every player who was there that day, was one of the greatest moments in the history of sports.  
The team’s messaging, however, was schizophrenic at best: On one hand, they were showcasing to the world a place of true majesty, while on the other, saying that it was obsolete and time for it go.  
The Boston City Council is not best described as a powerful body, but in this instance, the future of the new ballpark rested with just a handful of its members. For the city to take private land, as well as to issue bonds to pay for the parking garage, it required a two-thirds vote of the council — meaning just five votes in opposition on the 13-member body would jettison the entire plan. As the district councilor who represented the Fenway neighborhood, it fell to me to round up those votes. 
With the combination of the council’s rare moment of consequential power under the city’s strong-mayor charter, and the grassroot opposition to a new stadium within the community, there finally seemed to be some momentum for the underdogs. When it came time for the highly anticipated public hearings at the city council, there was a sense of possibility in the air, if not a festival-like atmosphere. 
I distinctly remember a man dressed in a giant hot dog costume walking into the city council chambers, with the president of the body, Jimmy Kelly, an old-school politician with no tolerance for such public antics, smashing his gavel on the rostrum, screaming “Order! Order!” 
It was around this time that I decided to take my colleagues on a tour of the Fenway neighborhood, a place that many of the councilors didn’t know beyond the area around the ballpark. We boarded a borrowed Old Town Trolley and toured the neighborhood. The visit was a high-profile media stunt and put more pressure on the impending plan by localizing the story and focusing on actual voters in front of their elected representatives. 
But before the council could deliver the death-knell to the plan, Harrington himself would reveal a bombshell of his own. 
The Red Sox were for sale. 
Just weeks after hundreds of millions of public dollars were committed by local and state government to this private sports team, Harrington announced it was “the right time” to sell. 
The sound of jaws dropping could be heard from City Hall to the State House. 
“It would be irresponsible and reckless to turn around and commit public financing to a new stadium today only to find out tomorrow the team’s being purchased by an internet multibillionaire,” said city councilor Michael Flaherty at the time. 
As various groups began to assemble their bids to become the next owners of the team, a feat that would have to clear both Major League Baseball and the Massachusetts attorney general’s office on account of the non-profit status of the team’s majority owners, the future of the park was still very much in doubt.  
What would happen next was as much a matter of faith as it was league politics — faith because the ownership team led by John Henry was the most preservationist-friendly of all the potential purchasers; politics because they had the backing of baseball commissioner Bud Selig. 
Much has been written about how the Henry group, equipped with Janet Marie Smith, a brilliant preservationist architect, did what was needed in order to restore, and ultimately “save” Fenway Park.  
This included adding the Green Monster seats, expanding the upper decks for premium seating, and using the surrounding streets for game-day operations. In a bold move that signaled a philosophic shift from the old to the new, Yawkey Way was restored to its original name of Jersey Street, an action that brought immediate rebuke from the Yawkey Foundation as well as many of its well-connected supporters.  
I have no doubt that Fenway Park would not be standing if it were not for Henry and his associates. I also have no doubt that a pivotal role in this saga was played by a lesser known group of rag-tag dreamers who had the audacity to take on a long list of power brokers to protect a treasure worth saving. 
In 2005, in commemoration of the 10th anniversary of the New England Holocaust Memorial, my father, a survivor of the Holocaust and the memorial’s founder, was invited to Fenway Park to throw out the first ceremonial pitch. Catching the ball would be Kevin Youkilis, a Jewish member of the Red Sox team, who had distinguished himself among his co-religionists by refusing to play on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, the previous year. 
Watching my father stand on the pitching mound of Fenway Park and throw out the first pitch was a vision I will never forget. Behind him you could see the newly installed Green Monster seats, a concept originally pitched by Save Fenway Park! and dismissed by the Harrington group as impossible. 
A lot had changed since that first game he and I attended some 27 years prior to that moment. For one thing, the Red Sox were world champions again – finally (and thrice more since). For another, the new Red Sox ownership had decided that Fenway Park was worth saving and invested an extraordinary amount of talent and resources in doing so.  
At that moment, I felt pride. I had found my place in Boston. Standing there basking in the verdant glow of Fenway Park’s ethereal field, nothing else seemed to matter.

Tim Walz announced Wednesday that his administration is pausing all payments for 14 Medicaid services for up to 90 days until a third-party audit is complete.
Walz’s move comes after fraud schemes in Minnesota public programs have gamed state government — and federal programs administered by Minnesota — out of hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years. Walz is seeking a third, four-year term as Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party governor, and Republicans are already hammering Walz’s record on stopping fraud.
The Department of Human Services identified 14 Medicaid service types as “high-risk” because of “vulnerabilities, evidence of fraudulent activity, or data analytics that revealed potentially suspicious patterns, claim anomalies, or outliers,” DHS Temporary Commissioner Shireen Gandhi wrote to the federal government. 
Payments for these programs will be paused for up to 90 days “in order to detect suspicious billing activity and scrutinize the use of public funds,” the governor’s office said Wednesday.
“We cannot effectively deliver programs and services if they don’t have the backing of the public’s trust. In order to restore that trust we are pumping the brakes on 14 programs that were created to help the most disadvantaged among us, yet have become the target of criminal activity,” Walz said in a statement.
Minnesota’s Medicaid autism treatment program is among the 14. Last month, federal prosecutors charged the first person in what is believed to be a wide-ranging fraud investigation. 
The now defunct Housing Stabilization Services program is also among the 14; the state moved to shut down the program in August, citing fraud, and the Justice Department has charged eight people in that probe, with one pleading guilty this month. 
The governor’s office said the state has outsourced the audit to Optum, which will analyze Medicaid billing and flag issues for the Department of Human Services to review.
(Optum is a division of Minnesota-based UnitedHealth Group. Earlier this year, The Wall Street Journal reported that the Department of Justice’s health care fraud unit is investigating the health care giant’s Medicare Advantage billing practices. Also, citing “people familiar with the matter,” Bloomberg reported in August that the Justice Department’s criminal division is “digging into UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s prescription management services as well as how it reimburses its own doctors under an ongoing probe into the firm’s operations.”) 
The billing audit means providers may have to wait longer to receive their payments, but the state will still meet federal rules requiring payments within 90 days, the governor’s office said.
The Association of Residential Resources in Minnesota, which represents 200 organizations that provide disability services, said pausing payments for the Medicaid programs could “destabilize an already fragile care network.”
“Pausing payments to legitimate providers for up to 90 days is not an accountability measure, it’s an existential threat to the care infrastructure that keeps Minnesotans with disabilities safe, housed and supported in their community,” ARRM CEO Sue Schettle said in a statement.
Among the 14 affected programs: Integrated Community Supports, Nonemergency Medical Transportation, Peer Recovery Services, Adult Rehabilitative Mental Health Services, Adult Day Services, Personal Care Assistance/Community First Services and Supports, Recuperative Care, Individualized Home Supports, Adult Companion Services, Night Supervision, Assertive Community Treatment and Intensive Residential Treatment Services.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/NN250609_0528-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-29 16:02:59.623863

“It's our obligation at this point as states to do what we can for the people we serve,” Gov. Phil Scott said after the meeting. “This is a basic benefit that many, many Vermonters rely on.”

Vermont officials voted to fund food assistance for the first half of November on Wednesday in the absence of federal funding while the shutdown continues in Washington, D.C.
At a Tuesday meeting, Gov. Phil Scott and legislative leaders on the state’s Emergency Board approved a $6 million proposal that fully funds 3SquaresVT, Vermont’s version of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, through Nov. 15. The stopgap measure will allow SNAP recipients to access half of their expected November benefits for now as usual, through Electronic Benefit Transfer, or EBT, cards.
“It’s our obligation at this point as states to do what we can for the people we serve,” Scott told reporters after the meeting. “This is a basic benefit that many, many Vermonters rely on.”
Some 65,000 people in Vermont receive SNAP benefits.
Lawmakers have worked with Scott in recent weeks to prepare a response, after the state received guidance earlier this month that the U.S. Department of Agriculture — absent a congressionally-approved funding bill — does not have sufficient funds to continue SNAP into November. 
The roughly $6.5 million in total costs for all the provisions in the plan will be drawn from the $50 million in surplus revenue that Vermont set aside in May to shore up state agencies impacted by federal cuts. This decision marks the first time that pot of money has been used.
Vermont is one of only a few states moving in recent days to temporarily step in and replace the loss of federal funds, which Scott said he was “surprised to learn.”
“I think we’re doing it right,” he said.
Virginia and Louisiana are among states who appear to be funding an alternative food assistance solution, despite the USDA having advised states that self-funded measures to continue dispensing SNAP will not be reimbursed by the federal government.
The claim that no federal funds are available has been contested, both by Vermont’s congressional delegation and by state Attorney General Charity Clark, who on Tuesday joined a multi-state lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s administration demanding the USDA release contingency funding for the program. 
Officials estimated that extending food stamp coverage for half the month will cost the state roughly $6.2 million, assuming that roughly 38,000 households across the state enroll. Technical support and outreach costs will add up to an additional $100,000, they said.
Those benefits should be available to participants “on or before Nov. 7,” according to documents provided by the Scott administration. In view of this expected delay, the state will provide the Vermont Food Bank with a supplemental one-time grant of $250,000 to assist in meeting increased need.
John Sayles, the Food Bank’s CEO, said Wednesday that the funding will go directly to the organization’s local partners, so that individual pantries can stock up on food. Just $250,000 may not be truly sufficient to meet the need if state funding doesn’t come through until Nov. 7, he said.
But nonetheless, Sayles said, “it’s something, and we’re grateful that the legislature and the Governor recognize that.”
“A good compromise”
Scott said after the meeting that he had been worried about the financial outlay while preparing his response, and had advocated caution in deciding how much of the full monthly nutritional benefit the state would front right now.
Sen. Andrew Perchlik, D/P-Washington, who serves on the Emergency Board as the head of the Senate Appropriations Committee, called Wednesday’s solution “a good compromise.”
Perchlik said he would likely support two additional weeks of full coverage if the state finds itself in the same situation in mid-November. The Emergency Board will reconvene on or before Nov. 13, should the federal shutdown continue.
Rep. Emilie Kornheiser, D-Brattleboro, who chairs the legislature’s Joint Fiscal Committee and sits on the Emergency Board, said Wednesday she and her colleagues are taking this issue “a month at a time,” at present.
Kornheiser has also been active in working to ensure that the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP, is available to Vermonters as the temperatures fall next month.
“People need to heat their homes,” Kornheiser said. “It’s getting really cold.”
Scott affirmed the importance of the heating program, calling its funding “easy” to sign off on. The Governor also said he was “confident” the state will receive federal reimbursement for the program.
LIHEAP dispersal has already been approved by the Vermont Legislature, which eases the process of providing interim support. Heating benefits will be available to Vermonters on a normal schedule “in anticipation of federal spending,” Kornheiser said. It’s a move with plenty of precedent in Montpelier, she added.
While a state-funded SNAP stopgap is much more unusual, Kornheiser emphasized the state’s lack of alternatives.
“I’m really pleased that we’re able to fully fund the program so that Vermonters can get the food that they need,” she said.
In Washington, D.C., Senate Democrats voted against a Republican bill that would have reopened the government for the 13th time yesterday, holding their line on negotiations for Affordable Care Act tax credits.
“This (shutdown) is being used as a political tool by both parties,” Scott said. “It’s unfortunate that they can’t come together and figure this out.”
In a press conference on Wednesday, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called the Trump administration’s actions in relation to SNAP “unbelievable.”
“The president is legally obligated to use this emergency fund,” Sanders said, referring to the same contingency funding Clark sued for on Tuesday. He also said that a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., which seeks to release funds for the USDA to continue operating SNAP without interruption, should “get to the (Senate) floor immediately” for a vote.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)There’s a line in the opening narration of the first “Lord of the Rings” movie that I like: “It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.”
The allure of simplicity is obvious, especially in moments of engineered chaos like this one. But to “celebrate” that simple life implies an absence of dread that at any moment it will all be snatched away. When the vast majority of people value tranquility not just for themselves but their neighbors too, it is in that general direction that the days will naturally move. A world free of pain and suffering for all is never in the offing, but a society that exalts peace and equality cannot help but gather toward that horizon, as unattainable as it is.
But that is not our world, not our nation, not our politics.
Of all the myths being peddled by the American right, the most insidious is the idea that for one to gain access to a good and simple life another must be denied that option. Their leaders cannot talk about better days except as defined by who is to be excluded — immigrants, trans people, disabled people, homeless people, poor people, academics, progressives, etc. The list grows daily.
Conservatives have found much success in that approach, here in New Hampshire and in Washington, but the strategy is as basic as basic can be. The hard truth is that nothing moves people to action quite like hatred. And so if your economic principles unpopularly favor wealth consolidation at the top over broad prosperity — the unofficial motto of the Republican Party — the stirring of hatred among the enormous voting bloc known as the have-nots will do just fine, thank you very much.
You can’t argue with the results for the political right, but there is an economic price paid by all. A simple life has never been harder.
If your own daily existence doesn’t make that fact plain enough, a new report from the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute should help with the picture:
“The typical (New Hampshire) household now earns nearly $100,000 a year, yet a family of four with this income still falls about $2,000 short of covering basic needs annually.”
“Mortgage costs have doubled since 2015 for a median-priced single-family home, from about $23,000 to over $47,000 annually.”
“Child care for two children over the course of childhood can cost families nearly $300,000.”
None of that, I’m sure, comes as a surprise — and that’s just for starters. It’s expensive to live in New Hampshire, and New Hampshire’s story is in many ways the nation’s story. Just this morning, a Bulletin reader shared this response to our recent coverage of the legislative debate over the state’s housing shortage: “What we need,” he said, “is affordable houses, not housing.” He explained that his daughter and her family have no shot at ever being able to afford “the mansions being built today.”
Underlying that comment is the fear that unites the aging, paycheck-to-paycheck parents of young adults: What will become of our sons and daughters?
The economic path I saw so clearly as a young man, even in my low-wage profession, has all but disappeared for my kids and their generation. With college debt and the high cost of everything from groceries to used cars, I don’t know how they’ll be able to swing that first apartment, never mind the first house. A simple life — the kind worth celebrating — has never been so elusive for so many.
There’s another report worth mentioning here, this one released by the Institute for Policy Studies in August. It’s titled “Executive Excess 2025” and focuses on “the 100 S&P 500 companies that pay the lowest median wages.”
“In 2024, the average ratio between CEO and median worker pay at Low-Wage 100 companies ran 632 to 1,’” writes report author Sarah Anderson, noting that the average CEO compensation was $17.2 million vs. an average median worker pay of $35,570. “… The average CEO-worker pay ratio at major U.S. corporations back in 1965? Just 25 to 1.”
Twenty-five to 1? That’s the kind of ratio that would make the current CEO of Starbucks, Brian Niccol, wake up in a cold sweat. The pay gap between that top executive and his harried baristas is an obscene 6,666 to 1 — or $95.8 million compared to $14,674. 
As much as I am convinced that designed economic inequality is at the heart of American dysfunction, I don’t mind so much that I share a country with millions of people who seem to believe that making wealthy people wealthier will lead to better economic outcomes for the rest. They can make their case and I’ll make mine, tied as it is to a flickering hope that one day something better will emerge from the dust of confrontation.
What I do mind is the guiding right-wing lie that for my kids to have a shot at a good life, that opportunity must be forcibly taken away from someone else’s kid. Everything in human experience obliterates that zero-sum perspective, and the psychic toll extracted by the lie itself is immeasurable.

(Courtesy of Rhode Island Commerce)A Providence insurance company can receive $6.8 million in redeemable state tax credits in exchange for expanding its Rhode Island operations, including hiring at least 370 full-time workers.
Rhode Island Commerce Corporation’s board of directors approved the job incentives for Motor Club Insurance Company (MCIC) at its meeting on Monday. The company is co-owned by AAA Northeast, and provides home, auto and umbrella insurance policies to AAA members.
As part of its plans to expand auto insurance sale and service operations across the region, Motor Club Insurance seeks to add at least 370 full-time employees by 2030. It will also open a new claims processing center, though a location has not been determined, according to the application to Rhode Island Commerce.
“Regarding where it can go in order to grow, MCIC is a company with choices — and we’re very glad it’s choosing Rhode Island,” Rhode Island Commerce Secretary Stefan Pryor said in a statement. “MCIC demonstrates that targeted Commerce incentives can strengthen existing employers, help to create hundreds of jobs, and expand opportunity for Rhode Islanders right here in the Ocean State.”
The redeemable tax credits through Commerce’s Qualified Jobs Incentive require that Motor Club Insurance makes good on its hiring commitment, including worker numbers and wages, and maintain the higher level of employment for 12 years — through 2037. If it does not hire or keep the workers, it will not receive the state tax credits.
Half of the new hires are slated to work in the claims processing center, while the remainder of insurance sales and service employees will work in the existing office on the Providence-Pawtucket line, or remotely. There will also be 22 new insurance writers, primarily based out of the new location, according to the application. The median annual earnings across the new positions is $77,107.
The hiring plans are expected to boost the state’s GDP by $109.2 million 2030, including direct jobs and another 236 indirect jobs created as a result of the expansion, according to analysis by Commerce’s consultant, Appleseed. The company’s expansion will generate $5.3 million in annual state tax revenues by the end of the decade, including income taxes from its new workers, as well as business and sales taxes. 
“The creation of new full-time jobs for MCIC reflects our confidence in Rhode Island’s workforce and leadership, along with our commitment to investing in the state’s future,” John Galvin, president and CEO of AAA Northeast, said in a statement. “AAA Northeast has been part of Rhode Island’s story for generations, and we look forward to creating meaningful opportunities for years to come.
The incentives do not reflect the company’s plans to build a new, secondary space to house its call center operations because no state aid was requested for the project. However, the $7.1 million investment in construction, equipment and technology is expected to produce a one-time $1.04 million bump in state GDP, with $1.7 million in economic output and nine construction jobs, according to Appleseed.

Lockhart,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/29/ct-united-fc-bridgeport-stadium/,"A campaign for Connecticut to enter the major league soccer market has gained momentum, but there’s a problem: The team doesn’t have a stadium. Yet.","Connecticut has a history of being left behind by major league sports teams, most notably the exit of the National Hockey League’s Hartford Whalers in 1997 — an injury that still stings for many local sports fans. 
Only one professional major league sports team, the WNBA’s Connecticut Sun, currently calls the state home. And its future here has recently come into question. 
But the state may not have to wait long for its next shot at a major professional sports team. In recent years, a campaign for the state to enter the major league soccer market has gained momentum, with an ownership group rallying behind the soon-to-launch Connecticut United Football Club.
The team would play in Major League Soccer’s NEXT Pro League, a developmental league for players looking to make it to the MLS. If all goes well, supporters believe, a full-fledged MLS team and a professional National Women’s Soccer League team could come later. 
There’s just one problem: The team doesn’t have a stadium to play in. Yet.
First teased in 2023 and formally announced in January 2024, CT United FC plans to play in Bridgeport. A proposed new soccer stadium, part of a larger waterfront development project that would cost upwards of $1 billion, is in the works to house the team.  
This month, the soccer effort expanded to include a potential women’s team under the WPSL Pro, a nascent second-division professional women’s soccer league.
The project is the brainchild of André Swanston, a local tech entrepreneur and millionaire with big ambitions for Connecticut’s most populated city. Soccer, he said, is a natural fit for Connecticut: When treated as a single market, the state is one of the largest areas without an MLS or NWSL team in the country. 
“We don’t have that iconic brand here in the state,” Swanston told The Connecticut Mirror in a recent interview. “So there is room for soccer to come in and be a big presence in a top 40 media market, which is kind of an unprecedented opportunity.” 
But the initiative has faced a bumpy road as players get ready to lace up their cleats and take to the field next year. Months after first announcing the team, Swanston’s Connecticut Sports Group pushed the men’s team debut back by one year, to 2026. 
When CT United FC finally begins play next year, it will do so without a stadium, which is still in the works and would be constructed on a former dog-racing track near Bridgeport’s waterfront. Efforts to secure $127 million in state funding this past legislative session ended without any financial commitment from lawmakers.
From the beginning, Swanston has said that the stadium will largely be funded through private capital, though he has declined to say on record exactly how much the project has raised to this point or how much the total endeavor will cost. 
Swanston and other proponents of the stadium project maintain that the initiative is a smart investment for Connecticut, opening up new economic opportunities and generating the sort of large-scale development that can truly transform the region’s economy. They point to the growing popularity of mixed-use developments across the nation, framing the Bridgeport initiative — which would come with a hotel, environmental rehabilitation, transit hub, and hundreds of new apartments — as spurring job growth, raising local property values, and increasing local spending and quality of life. 
As Connecticut looks to distinguish itself from its major metropolitan neighbors in New York City and Boston, supporters say a soccer team could be a powerful source of local pride that unites the state as a regional market. 
Even so, the project has not been completely embraced by state leaders, with Gov. Ned Lamont offering cautious support but refraining from any sort of public funding commitment. And the stadium project has raised questions about the financial impacts of sports-centered development and how much Bridgeport will ultimately benefit.
In recent years, other Connecticut-based teams have struggled with stadium projects. Almost 10 years ago, the Hartford Yard Goats minor league baseball team was forced to start play without a home stadium after construction issues, increased financial costs and delays pushed the opening of Dunkin’ Park back a full year, with the city stepping in to cover a significant shortfall in funding. The initial developer of the stadium later sued the city of Hartford after being terminated from the project. 
Trinity Health Stadium, home of the Hartford Athletic, a second-division soccer team that plays in the USL Championship, has also faced issues. After a $14 million renovation largely funded through taxpayer money helped cover stadium improvement costs in 2019, the team’s owners have said that they may need an additional $25 million to cover additional renovations in the future. 
As the season approaches, with play expected to start in March 2026, supporters of the Bridgeport project say their efforts are still alive and that they’re still expecting the stadium to happen.
“If you evaluate this on the merits,” Swanston said, “it should be seen very favorably.” 
Soccer is growing in national popularity
Soccer, like other professional sports, is gaining popularity in markets across the U.S. 
The current Bridgeport project would serve as the home base of a new team in the MLS NEXT Pro League, a development league aimed at supporting younger players by helping them bridge the gap from amateur into professional athlete. The League launched in 2022, billing itself as a “league of opportunity” for prospective MLS players, coaches, and staffers. MLS NEXT Pro currently has 29 teams with more in the pipeline for future seasons. 
A Major League Soccer team is Swanston’s ultimate goal. But starting with the developmental league would allow the state to enter on a less competitive level of the market, giving the region time to grow demand for a MLS team and build a network of possible staff and athletes. Launching an MLS NEXT Pro team also comes with expanded opportunities for youth development; The CT United FC effort for example, has already launched a youth academy aimed at building the next generation of young players free of charge.
So far, the team’s initial efforts have the league’s support. “It’s a game changer, it provides access to a group of players, some of whom might not have been able to do that otherwise,” former MLS Next Pro President Charles Altchek said in 2024. “It’s going to have a very positive impact on soccer in Bridgeport, Connecticut and the region.”
That effort does not end with men’s soccer. The plans also include a women’s soccer team, with the fledgling WPSL Pro — which is expected to commence play in 2027 — agreeing to back a Connecticut-based team if the stadium is completed.
If both come to fruition, that could make Connecticut a crucial market in soccer’s continued U.S. development and expansion. “Connecticut is like the highest soccer viewing market in America without a men’s or women’s MLS or NWSL or affiliated team,” Swanston said. 
Creating local teams would allow the state to operate as a powerful viewership market, he said, while also drawing some out-of-state engagement from nearby audiences in New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts. Currently, there are three MLSNP teams playing in the area: the New England Revolution II in Massachusetts, the New York City FC II, and the New York Red Bulls II in New Jersey, each of those teams also has a connected MLS expansion team. A Long Island-based MLSNP team, the Island F.C., is expected to begin play in 2027. 
A projected multibillion-dollar impact
Supporters of the soccer stadium argue that the project is about more than bringing a popular sport to Connecticut. Instead, they point to the broader effects of the investment, framing the stadium as a necessary catalyst for a larger series of  development projects — in a city where that kind of investment could be transformational. 
That includes a $1 billion mixed-use complex that would encompass the stadium, a hotel, public park space, a riverwalk and roughly 1,000 new housing units. The University of Connecticut’s Center for Economic Analysis estimated that, depending on the size of the stadium built, the project would generate somewhere between $2 billion and $3.4 billion in economic impact along with hundreds of jobs.
“Part of its appeal is that it’s of a sufficient scale to really be impactful,” Fred Carstensen, director of the CCEA, said of the Bridgeport development.

Carstensen added that the project has the potential to be one of the “most transformative projects in a generation,” allowing the state to address multiple needs: significant economic development, job creation and increased housing stock. 
The diversity of the development effort, he said, would keep the project from facing the typical limitations of publicly funded stadium initiatives, which have been found to have little economic impact on the cities they are built in.
“If they built the soccer stadium by itself, it would be really problematic, because it wouldn’t be integrated into the community,” Carstensen said.
State lawmakers said the waterfront development could help jumpstart Bridgeport’s economy, helping the region further build out a burgeoning reputation as a destination for events. 
“Bridgeport has kind of made their mark as the entertainment capital,” said state Rep. Chris Rosario, D-Bridgeport, a prominent supporter of the stadium effort. “What better addition than MLS NEXT Pro soccer as well as a now announced women’s team?” 
The state has been reluctant to put up money for the project
Still, the effort has faced headwinds on its path to funding. Swanston did not state an exact number when asked how much money the stadium effort needs, instead emphasizing that the project has “significant private capital” investment that would cover the majority of the cost. But earlier this year, a delegation of Bridgeport lawmakers brought a proposal to the state legislature, requesting $127 million in public investment for the project.
The request faced tough prospects before wary state leaders. Gov. Ned Lamont has made it clear he prefers tapping private funders to pay for the stadium, declining to commit public money to the effort. “Its a pretty big ask,” he told the Connecticut Post earlier this year. 
So far, the project has received $16 million from the state for remediating contaminated land on the build site. That money would also cover some infrastructure improvements to support access to the nearby waterfront. State leaders emphasized that these initiatives are meant to support whatever is constructed on the site, be that the stadium or otherwise. 
Lawmakers ultimately passed on providing more money for now, instead approving legislation that would allow for part of the stadium costs to be covered through tax increment financing, a tool that allows for development costs to be covered by future local tax revenue. Legislators also approved an economic impact study into the project to see if public investment would be worth it, giving the Department of Economic and Community Development a deadline of Oct. 1, 2025 to complete its analysis.  
But that study won’t materialize for months beyond that initial deadline. Last month, DECD requested an extension for completing the study, and a spokesman confirmed to the Connecticut Mirror that the agency did not have the resources to complete things by the deadline. DECD has since posted a request for proposals for a third-party agency to complete the study; the application will remain open until December. 
The impact analysis, which isn’t a prerequisite for state funding, is currently expected to be completed by July 2026, months after CT United FC begins its first season.
While the legislative effort has yet to result in any cash, supporters of the stadium remain optimistic. 
“At this point, I think an impact study doesn’t really matter,” said state Rep. Antonio Felipe, D-Bridgeport. “It wouldn’t affect whether or not the project is funded. It wouldn’t affect whether or not people look at the project differently.” 
Rather than a necessary component for funding, he views the study as “a way for us to keep the ball in the air.”
“I’m not jumping for joy, but it’s a good track to be on, as opposed to having no funding and no plan,” said Rosario, who emphasized that the delegation supporting the effort is in regular communication with the state and DECD. “We currently don’t have the funding yet, but we do have a plan.” 
A new sports opportunity
Swanston remains hopeful that the stadium will be built. For now, Connecticut United is focused on gearing up for its first season, which will be played at venues across the state next year. 
And the entrepreneur has felt bolstered by the state’s recent focus on women’s sports, noting that in recent months, state officials’ fight to keep the WNBA’s Connecticut Sun — an effort supported by Lamont, who has offered to commit state dollars to keep the team — shows that the state is willing to financially back efforts to retain professional sports teams. He hopes the pattern might hold for his prospective WPSL Pro team.

On a recent Sunday in East Hartford, a glimpse of what Swanston hopes to create in Connecticut came into focus. 
More than 20,000 soccer fans gathered last weekend to watch the US Women’s National Team play against Portugal, part of a series of international friendly matches. 
Hours before the game, fans milled about outside the Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field, taking photos, playing games, eating food and buying merch. Tailgaters fired up grills and pulled out chairs as they prepared in the nearby parking lots. Other spectators hovered near the gates, waiting to enter. 
Staffers for CT United FC were out to promote the team, standing under branded tents as they invited people to play cornhole games, sit for face painting and sign up for the mailing list. 
As he watched a round of cornhole, Ryan McGuinness, CT United FC’s  recently announced VP of Marketing and Fan Engagement, said that the activities are just the beginning of a long process of getting people around Connecticut acquainted with the team ahead of their debut. 
A Connecticut native with experience working for the MLS and ESPN, McGuinness said he’s looking forward to the work. 
“The fact that we have the opportunity to build a new professional soccer team on both the men’s and women’s side is something I’m really excited to be a part of,” he said.  
For supporters of the team, the effort is an easy one to get behind. But in the months and years to come, they’ll need to make their case to the rest of the state. 
How fans will react to the team is still unclear. When it comes to the numbers behind the effort, Swanston is more certain. 
“On the merits of the actual math, the jobs, the housing, the economic impact and aligning with what the priorities have been stated for this administration, it aligns perfectly,” Swanston said of the stadium construction effort.  “We’re really excited about that.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024_0109_SR_BPortSoccer_101-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-29 16:02:59.623863

Memphis educators say Hispanic students are showing up to class distressed and distracted, or not showing up at all, in the wake of a controversial federal law and immigration enforcement surge in the city.
The full impact on Memphis-Shelby County Schools is not yet clear. The district has not released complete attendance data for October, though leaders indicated there hasn’t been a sharp decline in attendance in the last few weeks. But educators say effects are being felt in classrooms at an increasingly diverse Memphis school system.
Board member Amber Huett-Garcia said multiple high school teachers told her that students “have just stopped showing up.”
“And they’ve stopped going to extracurricular activities, because they don’t want to be out of the house,” she added.
Nationwide, the increase in immigration enforcement has disproportionately affected Latino communities. Nearly one in five MSCS students is Hispanic, compared to just over 11% in 2014, according to data from the Tennessee Department of Education. And in local charter schools, the number of Hispanic students has more than doubled in the past decade.
One MSCS teacher in a predominantly Hispanic charter school said a parent pulled her child out of school entirely because of concerns about immigration enforcement.
“She sent me a message and just said that she was scared, that they were in a difficult situation and they would have to leave the city,” said the teacher, whom Chalkbeat is not naming due to her concerns about protecting her students. “They withdrew the next day.”
Now, some state and local immigration advocates are pushing district leaders to create “safe buffer zones” and increase busing to ease concerns about students and families encountering immigration officials on the way to and from school.
Last week, Huett-Garcia pressed MSCS leaders for attendance numbers and asked about resources available for concerned families. Superintendent Roderick Richmond said the district hasn’t put any new support measures in place because he hasn’t heard reports of ICE activity on school campuses.
But Memphis educators and local officials, including Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, say ICE agents are targeting Hispanic residents and focusing on neighborhoods where they live.
“Every single day this week, I have seen pickup trucks with the label ‘Border Patrol’ on Summer Avenue,” Huett-Garcia said. “When there are outside factors that affect our attendance, we should know and be aware of that. Our kids feel safe in our buildings, it’s just getting to and from those buildings.”
 Memphis educators: Classes are emptier, students more fearful

In the past month, hundreds of federal and state agents, including from the Tennessee National Guard and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, have arrived in Memphis in a push President Donald Trump has said is meant to reduce violent street crime.
Tennessee and Memphis Republicans have backed Trump’s law enforcement surge, arguing increased law enforcement is needed to address longstanding crime issues within the city.
“For too long, citizens of Memphis, Shelby Co, and West TN have dealt with the ravages of out-of-control crime,” Rep. Mark White, a GOP state lawmaker from Memphis, said in September. “We must fix this problem now and get routine offenders off the streets to save our city.”
State Democrats and local leaders have sharply criticized the National Guard deployment and the increase of federal agents in the city, saying the moves trample local authority and lack transparency concerning who’s arrested. Preliminary data suggested a majority of the task force’s arrests have been for non-violent offenses and immigration-related charges, the Commercial-Appeal reported this month.










Memphis is in this state of reality now where people are disappearing. As a community, as a country, we have to answer, ‘Are we OK with that?’


– Amber Huett-Garcia, Memphis-Shelby County Schools Board Member


In other cities subject to the Trump administration’s federal deployment, ICE has detained students. Chalkbeat reported the detainment of at least one public school student, a U.S. citizen, in Chicago, and the arrest of a 16-year-old student in New York last week.
There have been no reports that Memphis students have been detained, and no reports of ICE activity in Memphis schools. But Huett-Garcia said she talked to one MSCS teacher last week who cried with a student for hours because two of their family members had been detained that day.
“Memphis is in this state of reality now where people are disappearing,” she said. “As a community, as a country, we have to answer, ‘Are we OK with that?’”
The MSCS teacher at the predominantly Hispanic charter said she’s had “all time low” attendance this month. For three days in a row, 25% of her students were not in class, she said. When her young students do show up, she said, they’re “extremely scared” and distracted.
“My students are telling me that they miss their mom, that they want to go home even early in the day,” she said. “It’s been constant.”
During an October school board meeting, Stacey Davis, director of enrollment and attendance, said there has not been a “significant difference” in student attendance since the National Guard arrived on Oct. 10. Chalkbeat Tennessee requested individual school attendance data last week, but the district said it couldn’t provide that information until late November. 
One principal of a predominantly Hispanic school in Memphis said attendance is “hit or miss,” with families deciding to send their children based on what they see on the news or hear through their network.
“Parents are fearful about being out, dropping off their kids, picking them up, so they’re keeping them home more frequently,” the principal said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to protect their students’ privacy.
Meanwhile, the MSCS charter teacher said the threat to students and their families “can be paralyzing when you don’t have access to the right training.”
 Could MSCS do more in response to ICE?

Although she said immigration enforcement is “outside of our control or jurisdiction,” Huett-Garcia said she’s open to working with county and city government officials to brainstorm creative solutions, especially when it comes to transportation barriers.
And she said she wants to hear from teachers about support they need, including grief training.
In Chicago, some board members and educators are calling for Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker to permit an emergency switch to virtual learning, although Pritzker has expressed skepticism about the idea. Chicago Public Schools has also sent out messages assuring parents that school buildings are safe from ICE interference and reminding them of their rights.
But in other communities, many support efforts are happening on a school-by-school basis.
MSCS does have a list of parent rights and resources on the district website when it comes to immigration issues. But the elementary teacher said district leadership should offer teacher training on how to interact with federal agencies, even outside of school grounds.
“Realistically, I’m not expecting ICE to show up at my door and try to take away one of my students,” she said. “What I am expecting is for them to wait down the street and arrest a parent at a traffic stop, because that’s what we’re seeing happening.”

Free.,Food assistance funding cliff approaching as shutdown persists,"Ariana Figueroa, Jennifer Shutt",,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/food-assistance-funding-cliff-approaching-shutdown-persists,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Senate Democrats urged Republican leaders Wednesday to pass a bill to extend critical food assistance for the most vulnerable Americans during the ongoing government shutdown.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday that Democrats would support a standalone bill introduced by GOP Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley. And New Mexico Democratic Sen. Ben Ray Luján attempted to pass by unanimous consent his bill to fund two major nutrition assistance programs.“Let’s end this hunger crisis before it begins,” Schumer said on the Senate floor. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune objected to Luján’s proposal, and the government shutdown entered its fifth week with lawmakers of both parties showing no signs of the agreement needed to reopen the government in time to avoid putting 42 million people at risk of losing their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits Saturday.Beneficiaries of SNAP, which covers low-income people, children and those with disabilities, are supposed to receive payments Nov. 1. But the shutdown and the Trump administration’s contention it cannot release contingency funding to cover the cost of November benefits mean many will go without.Democrats held several press conferences Wednesday, the shutdown’s 29th day, raising concerns about the loss of SNAP benefits and slamming the U.S. Department of Agriculture for not tapping into its multi-year contingency fund to approve food assistance for November. The move has caused states to scramble to provide aid, strained local food banks and has resulted in a lawsuit from dozens of state officials this week to force the agency to release funds for SNAP.Schumer, a New York Democrat, urged Thune, a South Dakota Republican, to bring Hawley’s bill to the Senate for a floor vote. The bill would fund SNAP amid the funding lapse. Thune declines to bring standalone billsBut Thune has rejected considering bills that fund single programs during the shutdown. He has instead pushed for Democrats to approve a House-passed GOP measure to temporarily reopen the government.“We're not going to pick winners and losers,” he said after objecting to Lujan’s bill.”It's time to fund everybody who's experiencing the pain from this shutdown.”Thune said on the Senate floor that he will only call another vote on the House-passed GOP stopgap measure if Senate Democrats “tell me they have enough votes to fund the government.”

The Senate this week, for the 13th time, failed to reach the 60-vote threshold to move forward on a measure to extend government funding through Nov. 21. Democrats have voted against the short-term funding bill in an effort to spark negotiations on tax credits that will expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Republicans have said those talks can begin when the government is funded. Open enrollment for the ACA marketplace starts Nov. 1 in most states. Democrats have predicted that when people start getting their quotes for health insurance and seeing significantly higher prices for out-of-pocket premiums, it will force Republicans to negotiate on tax credits. “We are days away from a health care crisis,” Schumer said.  Shutdown to become ‘very real’House Speaker Mike Johnson said during a morning press conference the government shutdown “gets very real” Saturday when the federal government will no longer pay out SNAP benefits. “You're talking about tens of millions of Americans at risk of going hungry, if the Senate Democrats continue this gambit,” Johnson said. The Louisiana Republican, who voted against the stopgap spending bill that ended the 2018-2019 shutdown, repeatedly urged rank-and-file Democratic senators to “do the right thing.”“I think Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries are irredeemable at this point,” Johnson said, referring to the top Democrats in both chambers. “I've given up on the leadership. So we're trying to appeal to a handful of moderates or centrists who care more about the American people and will put the people's interest over their own and do the right thing in the Senate.”Johnson also disparaged a lawsuit filed by Democratic attorneys general that asked a federal judge to require funding for SNAP be paid out during the government shutdown. “Instead of taking a simple vote to fund the government, which Senate Democrats have now had more than a dozen opportunities to do, Democrat attorneys general are suing the federal government to try to compel SNAP benefits to flow, despite the government being closed and despite the fact that there is no money to do that,” Johnson said.Freeze on SNAP contingency fund questionedLuján held up a printed out copy of USDA’s Sept. 30 shutdown contingency plan during an early afternoon press conference, saying the agency’s refusal to tap into its emergency funds for SNAP recipients was nonsensical.He slammed the agency for removing its own contingency plan from its website, which verifies that in case of a funding lapse, USDA would use its roughly $6 billion in contingency funds to cover SNAP benefits during a government shutdown.“This is the bulls–t, taking these plans down to try to lie to the American people and justify why it's okay for people to go hungry,” Luján said. Luján’s bill that he tried to get approval through unanimous consent, would have funded SNAP during a government shutdown as well as the USDA’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC.Senate Agriculture Committee ranking Democrat Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, said that Democrats are ready to support Lujan’s bill or Hawley’s bill. She added that she and several other Democrats plan to co-sponsor Hawley's bill. So far, Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont is the only Democrat to co-sponsor the bill.The 10 Senate Republicans who have co-sponsored Hawley’s bill include Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, Bernie Moreno and Jon Husted of Ohio, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and John Cornyn of Texas. Colorado Democratic Rep. Joe Neguse argued during a midday press conference that Trump administration officials have “made a conscious and deliberate choice to suspend SNAP benefits.”“It is outrageous that the Trump administration can come up with $40 billion to bail out Argentina and refuses to spend the money that Congress has appropriated to feed hungry families in America,” Neguse said. House Agriculture Committee ranking member Angie Craig, D-Minn., said the law regarding SNAP’s contingency fund “is clear and unambiguous” and that Trump’s “actions display a pattern of callous disregard for America's hungry seniors, children and veterans.”Craig said the USDA should use the contingency fund to pay most of the November benefits. The department should then use some of the $23 billion in another account referred to as Section 32 to cover the rest of the cost, Craig said. Craig also pushed back against criticisms of SNAP, saying it provides about ​​$6.20 a day for food.“This does not come close to covering even one trip to the grocery store a month for most American families, especially as this administration has started a trade war that is driving up costs for everyone in our country,” Craig said. “So this is exactly the point.”Shutdown projected to hurt economyBecause of the ramifications for federal programs like SNAP and delayed paychecks for federal workers, the ongoing shutdown is expected to have a negative impact on the economy, according to an analysis the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released Wednesday.Director Phillip L. Swagel wrote in an eight-page letter to House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, that the funding lapse “will delay federal spending and have a negative effect on the economy that will mostly, but not entirely, reverse once the shutdown ends.”The federal government spent $33 billion less than it would have during the first four weeks of the shutdown. The funding lapse lasting for six weeks would result in a $54 billion drop in outlays and if it goes on for eight weeks, it would lead the federal government to put $74 billion less into the economy. “Those amounts include delayed spending for employee compensation, goods and services, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program,” Swagel wrote. “CBO expects that when appropriations resume, the spending that did not occur during the shutdown will be made up.”Swagel cautioned that the projections “are subject to considerable uncertainty. “The effects of the shutdown will depend on decisions made by the Administration throughout the shutdown, including decisions about which executive branch activities continue and which are halted.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-10-29 16:02:59.623863

(Graphic: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)The SNAP federal food assistance program helps feed a total of 1.4 million North Carolinians. They will all stop receiving benefits this week, when the federal government halts payment amid a continuing shutdown in Washington.
Every county in North Carolina will feel the effects, but counties with the most enrollees may not experience the largest impact.
When benefits are suspended Friday, more than 132,000 North Carolinians in the populous Mecklenburg County will be left without food assistance. It’s the county with the highest number of people receiving the aid, but that’s just 11% of its population.
It’s southern Robeson County, whose total population is around 116,000, that will see the largest percentage of its residents without aid. Roughly one in three Robeson residents participate in SNAP, according to state data.
Belts of rural counties in the south and northeast will see anywhere from a quarter to a third of their residents without food assistance. Ten of the state’s 99 counties, almost all majority rural, have 25% or more of its residents enrolled in SNAP.




In a news conference Tuesday, a top state health official said the pause in SNAP would “hit our small towns and rural communities especially hard.”
“One in six rural North Carolinians depend on SNAP,” said Jonathan Kappler, deputy secretary for the NC Department of Health & Human Services. “And when funding gets delayed, local grocery stores, farmers and small businesses all feel it.”
SNAP provides nearly a quarter of a billion dollars in benefits every month to North Carolinians. That’s money that flows immediately into local economies. Andy Ellen, president of the N.C. Retail Merchants Association, says it plays a critical role in sustaining local markets and food retailers.
“SNAP benefits help ensure customers can afford nutritious food, which keeps shelves stocked and businesses thriving,” Ellen told NC Newsline. ”[T]he suspension of $230 million in SNAP benefits on November 1 will have a ripple effect on jobs and the broader economy.”
Demand for the benefits is fairly steady: the state receives around 60,000 applications for SNAP every month. That number occasionally spikes due to households recertifying with the program, as well as applications filed after natural disasters. In September, the state received just over 65,000 applications.



In total, about 12.5% of North Carolinians participate in SNAP. That’s a higher rate than any of its three directly neighboring states. In South Carolina, roughly 10.4% are enrolled in the program; in Virginia, 9.36%.

Norm Pattis, Diamantis’ defense attorney, filed a motion in court on Wednesday requesting a special hearing and that jurors be recalled to the federal court in Bridgeport.
He cited comments that the jury’s forewoman, Nkong Tankeng, made to members of the media after she and the other jurors convicted Diamantis on 21 counts of bribery, extortion, conspiracy and lying to federal investigators.
Tankeng reportedly told Hearst Connecticut Media that she was not aware of Diamantis before the high-profile criminal trial, but she suggested that other members of the jury had heard of Diamantis before the nine-day trial began.
Pattis relied on that comment to question whether all of the jurors were truthful during the jury selection process. 
The 82 potential jurors who were summoned into court in early October were all specifically asked whether they had “heard of Mr. Diamantis or heard anything about this case before you came to court today.” And several of them told U.S. District Judge Stefan Underhill that they had.
But Pattis pointed out that only one of the people who served on the jury admitted during the voir dire process to reading press coverage about the years-long criminal investigation into Diamantis, who was accused of steering contracts to school construction companies in return for bribes.
If more than one of the jurors read or viewed media coverage about Diamantis before the trial, Pattis argued, that would call into question the impartiality of the jury.
“(Tankeng’s) remark raises serious questions about whether potential jurors were candid with the court during the brief court-conducted voir dire,” Pattis wrote in his motion. 
“The defendant therefore moves for a hearing at which jurors in the case can be asked whether they made a full disclosure of their awareness of press coverage about the case prior to the commencement of evidence and whether they read press coverage during trial,” Pattis added. 
There was considerable news coverage of Diamantis and the charges leveled against him before the trial commenced in early October.
And as Pattis pointed out, some of that coverage touched on issues that the jury was barred from learning about during the trial.
For instance, three of the witnesses who testified against Diamantis during the trial had already pleaded guilty to bribing him. But the prosecution was not allowed to mention that at the trial, per the judge’s order.
Diamantis is also facing a second bribery and extortion trial early next year for allegedly pressuring state officials to cancel an audit that was examining a Bristol eye doctor’s billing records. But the jury was intentionally shielded from that information as well.
If some of the jurors learned of that information through media coverage, however, Pattis said it could have impacted the eventual verdict, which went against Diamantis.
“Simple logic suggests that one or more jurors in this case were either exposed to potentially prejudicial pre-trial publicity in this case and failed to disclose it, or that one or more jurors were exposed to potentially prejudicial publicity during trial,” Pattis wrote in his motion. 
“The trial court has a responsibility to ensure that he did, in fact, enjoy his right to an impartial jury,” he added. 
It will be up to Judge Underhill to decide if the jurors are recalled into court. 
If the judge doesn’t agree, Diamantis is expected back in court on Jan. 14, when he will be sentenced.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/norm-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-29 16:02:59.623863

(iStock / Getty Images Plus)COLUMBIA — Although the number of measles cases in the state continues to rise, recent infections have all come from existing exposures, suggesting strict quarantine measures are working, according to the Department of Public Health.
Linda Bell, the state epidemiologist, reminded people to stay vigilant of the disease and get vaccinated if they are not already. The vaccine, typically administered in two doses during childhood, is available for free at mobile health units traveling the Upstate, as well as through state health departments and other clinics.

Eight people have tested positive for measles since Friday, bringing the total for the outbreak in the Upstate up to 30. All eight were considered close contacts of people already infected and quarantining at home, suggesting the disease was not spreading through the community, Bell said.
As of Wednesday, 27 people remained in active quarantine because they either tested positive or came into contact with someone who had measles, Bell said.
Quarantine lasts 21 days, since that is the incubation period for the disease, she said.
That means most of the 139 students from two Spartanburg County schools who were learning virtually because they were unvaccinated and exposed to measles are back in the classroom.
Bell did not specify how many of the 27 people were students, but the eight most recent cases were not from a school, she said.
Because measles is highly contagious, officials remain wary of the potential for the outbreak to continue and expand across the state, especially as people travel for the holidays, Bell said. The only sure way to stop transmission is through vaccination, she said.
SC offering free measles vaccines amid growing Upstate outbreak

The vaccine, “by providing lifelong immunity to the majority of those vaccinated, will help us stop this outbreak,” Bell told reporters Wednesday.
One of the eight people newly infected had one dose of the vaccine but not the second, Bell said. One dose is about 93% effective at preventing infections, while two doses is 97% effective, she said.
All other people to get measles in the state were unvaccinated.
Since the state’s mobile health units offering the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine launched Oct. 16, 24 people — 19 adults and five children — have gotten the shot. That’s up significantly from seven as of last Wednesday, according to the health department.
Another three people have contracted measles this year in cases unrelated to the outbreak. Those people became sick after traveling outside of the country to places with measles outbreaks, the health department has said.
A fever, cough, red eyes and runny nose can indicate an early measles infection.
Often, those symptoms are followed by a rash that typically begins on the face before spreading to the rest of the body. Severe cases can cause pneumonia or brain swelling, which can be fatal, especially in young children, according to the health department.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/measles-vaccine-1024x719.jpg,,,2025-10-29 16:02:59.623863

Morbid conversations, she calls them.
About what they’d do if a death came too soon.
“If one of us goes,” they’d say, “we’ve all got to live for them.”
Except Diedra “Roxy” Leaf and her four other sons don’t know if Renzo Bullhead — her second son, their brother — is really gone.
 
 Telling their stories: MMIP in South Dakota 

South Dakota Searchlight and ICT have partnered on a long-term project, funded in part by a grant from the Fund for Investigative Journalism, that aims to provide a snapshot of Missing and Murdered Indigenous People cases by combining multiple sources of data. 
The publications have also created a form for people to share a tip about their missing loved one, for possible inclusion in the project.



On Thursday, a clutch of volunteers pulled together by the family’s Standing Rock Sioux Tribe will conduct one more search for him before winter sets in, along the stretch of the Missouri River that separates Bismarck and Mandan, North Dakota. 
Seven months have passed since Bullhead, a 20-year-old welding student, a McLaughlin, South Dakota native, took a walk east across the railroad bridge that connects those two North Dakota cities.
Seven months since Snapchat pinged his location on the Bismarck side and didn’t budge, sending the girlfriend and brothers who kept in touch through the social media app into fits of worry. 
Seven months since Mandan police pinged Bullhead’s phone and logged its location on their side of the bridge. They told Leaf their ping was more accurate, she said. That he likely fell in the river. 
The police wanted to know if he’d been having problems lately, Leaf said. If he’d fought with his girlfriend.
She doesn’t believe he jumped or fell, even after seeing video footage suggesting he could have, but she can’t know for sure. And because there’s no body, she fears she’ll never know.
At this point, she said, her search for answers has stretched beyond the physical plane.
“I’m a grandpa’s girl,” Roxy said of her deceased grandfather. “Now I pray to him. I tell him, ‘Go look for my son. He’ll know you. All of them know you. I talk about you all the time.’”
Missing, but not alone
The South Dakota Missing Persons Clearinghouse, which launched in 2020, lists the names of those whose disappearances have been reported to law enforcement. On any given day, the list has at least 100 missing people, though the names shift in real time as people are found or go missing.
On Monday afternoon, Native Americans made up 63% of the 112 listed names. Of missing females, the figure was 70%. The percentages, as compiled periodically by South Dakota Searchlight, typically fall in or near that range.
Around 8.5% of South Dakotans are Native American.
On the national level, 3.5% of the people listed in the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System database in mid-2023 were Native American, according to the Congressional Research Service. Native Americans make up about 1.1 % of the U.S. population.
Remembering Renzo
Renzo Bullhead is now a name on an MMIP list, but Renzo Bullhead the person is a part of the fabric of his McLaughlin community. 
The town, a short drive west across the Missouri River from Mobridge, is Standing Rock’s most populous on the South Dakota side of its tribal borders, with around 600 people. 
Walk into the gas station on Highway 12, and you’ll see Renzo’s picture near the cash register, with a message urging anyone with information to share it.

Bullhead, the second of Leaf’s five sons, played football for the McLaughlin Mustangs during a standout high school career, Leaf said, and came to be seen as a humble leader.
Classmates voted him homecoming king his senior year, but Leaf said he turned down the crown.
“He didn’t like the light,” she said.
Lisa Taken Alive, McLaughlin’s superintendent, was principal during Bullhead’s senior year. She doesn’t remember the story about him giving up the crown, but it wouldn’t be out of character for the boy she knew.
Bullhead was easygoing, social, well-liked, a natural leader, Taken Alive said — and protective of classmates who couldn’t always stick up for themselves. Taken Alive remembers one boy in particular, a boy with issues who was picked on for having them. Bullhead stood up for him, pushing his friends and classmates to stand down. 
“He had every reason to not be that way, but he was,” Taken Alive said.
Rear-view mirror
Roxy Leaf last saw Bullhead on March 16. He’d been home for spring break from United Tribes Technical College in Bismarck, where he’d gone to pursue his welding degree after a short time working in McLaughlin. He spent the break relaxing and recharging at home, Leaf said, not out partying. He loaded up on his mother’s cooking, wolfing down quesadillas and burritos, spaghetti and goulash, just like he and his brothers had for years after school.
“That’s our main thing is cooking and making sure that they have what they need,” Leaf said. “You know, always asking about how they’re doing. What did you learn today?”
After the ride back to North Dakota on March 16 and dropping off his things at his dorm, Bullhead asked his mother for another ride, this time to meet up with two friends in Mandan. 
Leaf was a little worried. The young men, McLaughlin natives Leaf had known for more than a decade, weren’t students like her son. 
“They came up to me, gave me a hug,” she said. “I said, ‘Hey, you boys behave, you hear me?’ They said, ‘Yeah, yeah, we’re going to. We won’t be fighting or anything or doing something weird.’”
Call if you need a ride, she told her son. She and his stepfather would be in Bismarck a while. Bullhead told her not to worry.
“Last thing I remember is looking at him in my rear-view mirror,” Leaf said.
Search begins
Bullhead’s friends kept in touch with him over Snapchat, which showed his location. That Sunday night, the location got stuck somewhere near the Missouri River, on the Bismarck side of a railroad bridge, and stopped moving. 
On Monday, Leaf said, the family wasn’t concerned. By Tuesday, Bullhead’s uncharacteristic silence had his friends and family worried. A friend in North Dakota reported him missing. The school told Leaf he hadn’t come back.

Leaf and a group of family and friends spent the next few days retracing his possible steps. They walked the train tracks in Mandan, where he’d been before his friends back home lost his Snapchat signal. The friends he’d been there with knew he left that night, but not where he’d gone. 
Police had begun their work, as well. Officers in Mandan pinged his phone and logged it on their side of the river, so the Mandan Police Department became the lead agency on the case.
The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe got involved, offering additional resources for a search. Volunteers helped search, too.
Taken Alive, the McLaughlin superintendent, let students leave to help in those searches. The whole school was on edge, she said, because Bullhead was only a bit more than a year out from his high school graduation, and because he wasn’t the kind of person anyone would expect to go missing. But also because three of his brothers were still in school, trying their best to maintain some level of normal.
“We lose people all the time. Unfortunately, bad news isn’t something that’s rare for us. But this was different. This was so shocking,” Taken Alive said. “We were on pins and needles waiting to hear if they learned anything.”
No news came. 
As the months passed, video footage was collected and reviewed. There were hours of video along the bridge and around it, some from the railroad company, but not every foot of the bridge was covered. Some show a young man crossing toward Bismarck on March 16, but not reaching the other side.
Leaf’s seen plenty of footage, but she’s never been convinced her son landed in the water. She believes he’s out there, somewhere.
“He was a fighter,” Leaf said. 
Final search for 2025
Thursday’s search will be the last to comb the Missouri River before the winter freeze sets in. 
There have been many searches.
The Mandan Police Department doesn’t have a dive crew, but the Burleigh County Sheriff’s Office does. That team put in 130 hours searching the Missouri with sonar and water drones, Mandan Police Department Lt. Brent Wilmeth told South Dakota Searchlight by email this week. The Burleigh team worked with a group called North Star Search and Rescue, and Standing Rock had teams out looking.

Police in Mandan and Bismarck have used drones and foot searches, Wilmeth said, and the North Dakota Highway Patrol used aircraft and K-9 bloodhounds. The state’s Bureau of Criminal Investigation conducted interviews and helped pull together video footage. The BNSF Railroad Police Team, Wilmeth said, were “crucial in obtaining video for us.”
Mandan police won’t be part of Thursday’s search, but Wilmeth said he wishes the searchers luck.
“The organizers of the civilian search parties have a system for coordinating those searches,” he said. “They have done a good job, and we appreciate all the work of the volunteers who commit time looking for Renzo.”
The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe took the lead in pulling together a volunteer crew for Thursday’s sunrise-to-sundown search. Its law enforcement officers and volunteers from other North Dakota tribes’ search and rescue teams will work under the direction of Badlands Search and Rescue, a western North Dakota volunteer group founded in 2018 by a former sheriff’s deputy named Travis Bateman.
Searches on a body of water like the Missouri are difficult because rivers are “constantly changing,” Bateman said. Search teams just have to keep trying if they hope to find what they’re looking for.
“It changes from day to night. It changes with your seasons,” Bateman said. “They are uber-complex search problems.”
Bateman can’t predict what’s going to happen Thursday, but he knows what he wants for Bullhead’s family: closure, which he knows from his experience can only come with certainty about what happened to a loved one.
“I hope, I really hope, that we can get fortunate here and actually find him,” Bateman said.
Taken Alive, speaking to South Dakota Searchlight from her office at the high school whose students still want to find out what happened, feels the same way. 
Much like Leaf, like Renzo’s brothers, like the community as a whole, she said, “we’re all holding our breath.”
“And we can’t breathe until we know,” Taken Alive said.
Roxy said her “fingers are crossed,” but there’s something else on her mind, as well.
“If we don’t find anything, then there’s still hope. That something may have happened, but hope that he’s alive. No parent should have to go through this. Your kids aren’t supposed to go first.”

(Getty Images)With the expected loss of federal food assistance funding starting Saturday, Democratic state lawmakers are mounting a series of food drives as part of their campaign to draw attention to their argument that Republicans are to blame.
Wisconsin’s FoodShare program will stop receiving its monthly payments from the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, starting Nov. 1.
The Trump administration has blocked further SNAP funding as a result of the federal shutdown that began Oct. 1, although the U.S. Department of Agriculture has $6 billion in reserves. A coalition of Democratic attorneys general and governors, including in Wisconsin, has sued the administration over the refusal to tap the reserve fund.  
In Milwaukee County, Sen. Chris Larson and state Rep. Christine Sinicki, both Milwaukee Democrats, scheduled a news conference and food drive for Thursday morning at a food pantry in Cudahy, a suburb just south of the city.
Across the state, Rep. Jodi Emerson (D-Eau Claire) and Sen. Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) are holding a news conference and food drive Thursday morning in Eau Claire in conjunction with local nonprofits there.
Reps. Jill Billings (D-La Crosse) and Tara Johnson (D-Town of Shelby) are holding a press conference and food drive on Thursday afternoon at a La Crosse food bank, joined by local advocates. 
The aim is “to highlight the disastrous effects of the shutdown on Wisconsinites and discuss how our community can step up to support the most vulnerable among us in their time of need,” Billings’ office stated in announcing the event.
Johnson has also scheduled an event  and food drive Friday with Sen. Brad Pfaff (D-Onalaska) at a Viroqua food pantry with Vernon County advocates.
In Appleton, the Democratic Party of Outagamie County and state Senate hopeful Emily Tseffos have organized a two-week food drive that began Monday, Oct. 27 and will run through Nov. 8. That drive will supply pantries across the Fox Valley, according to the group.
“The fact that the government remains shut down while people right here are about to go hungry didn’t sit right with me,” Tseffos said in a statement. “So a group of friends and I got together to see what we could do.”

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)A North Dakota judge has nearly halved the $660 million sum Greenpeace was ordered to pay the developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline in March.
A nine-person jury had found the environmental group at fault for harming Energy Transfer during anti-pipeline protests in North Dakota in 2016 and 2017, as well as for publishing false statements to harm the company’s reputation.
The jury’s award included more than $200 million of compensatory damages — money to address financial harms — plus about $400 million in punitive damages.
In a Wednesday order, Southwest Judicial District Judge James Gion reduced the award after finding some of the jury’s damages had no legal basis, were duplicative or had exceeded statutory caps on punitive damages. The revised amount is about $345 million, according to Gion’s order.
Greenpeace was one of many activist groups that backed a movement to halt the Dakota Access Pipeline, which years ago drew thousands to rural south-central North Dakota to protest in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe.
Energy Transfer filed suit against Greenpeace in 2019, accusing it of orchestrating violent attacks against the pipeline company during the demonstrations and of waging a misinformation campaign to sabotage its business.
Energy Transfer built the Dakota Access Pipeline, also known as DAPL, to move crude oil from wells in North Dakota to refineries farther south. 
The case is against three Greenpeace-affiliated organizations: Greenpeace USA, Greenpeace Fund and the Netherlands-based Greenpeace International. All three Greenpeace organizations deny the allegations and have called the lawsuit a ploy to punish them for opposing the pipeline.
In wake of the verdict, Greenpeace asked Gion to reduce the award or throw it out entirely, arguing that the $660 million figure was unreasonable.
Gion on Wednesday partially granted that request. He eliminated awards related to the claim that Greenpeace had trespassed or encouraged trespassing on land owned by Energy Transfer, for example. He also threw out millions Greenpeace was ordered to award Energy Transfer on claims that the environmental group unlawfully seized and abused its property.
Greenpeace seeks to reduce jury’s award of $667M in Dakota Access Pipeline trial

Gion left intact about $149 million in damages for Greenpeace’s alleged on-the-ground harms to Energy Transfer, including for trespassing and nuisance.
Gion found some of the awards handed down for defamation were duplicative and must be eliminated. He also concluded that the jury could not assess punitive damages for defamation.
In all, he reduced the jury’s original roughly $250 million award for defamation down to about $50 million.
He allowed $3.5 million in damages for the claim that Greenpeace engaged in a conspiracy to harm the Dakota Access Pipeline and about $143 million in damages for the claim that Greenpeace interfered with Energy Transfer’s business.
The more than three-week trial earlier this year featured testimony from dozens of witnesses, including current and former Greenpeace employees, Indigenous activists, Energy Transfer representatives and law enforcement.
Gion’s memo reducing the award comes more than six months after the jury filed its verdict. He still has yet to enter a judgment in the case, according to the order. Spokespeople for Greenpeace and Energy Transfer were not immediately available for comment.
Greenpeace has indicated it plans to appeal the ruling to the North Dakota Supreme Court.
Greenpeace International is also pursuing a separate lawsuit in the Netherlands that accuses Energy Transfer of weaponizing the U.S. legal system against the environmental group.

“These workers are essential to the success of your company, and they deserve compensation that reflects their hard work and sacrifices,” states the letter, which was signed by 17 of the committee’s 61 members on Monday. “Both the workers and the work they do are vital to U.S. national security through the production of the current and future cutting-edge fighter aircraft.”
The letter is the latest in the mounting pressure from Congress urging Boeing to cut a better deal for its workers, as some senators have said the strike is threatening national security.
Earlier this month, the U.S. Airforce acknowledged that the 86-day strike at Boeing’s St. Louis facilities has delayed the delivery of F-15EX fighter jets, according to answers Gen. Kenneth S. Wilsbach provided to a U.S. Senate committee in his nomination for Air Force chief of staff. 
Workers at St. Louis facilities also build and support the production of other fighter jets, including the future F-47.
“Communication and negotiation are crucial to help navigate out of the current situation,” the letter states, “that preserves the long-term balance between workers’ rights and the defense of our nation.”
Missouri has two members on the armed services committee — Republican Sam Graves, who did not sign on to the letter, and Democrat Wesley Bell, who did. The only Republican committee member who signed the letter was U.S. Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska.
US Senate committee slams Boeing for cutting health care to striking St. Louis workers

The Congress members’ letter follows a fourth vote by Boeing workers on Sunday declining the company’s latest contract offer. The proposal didn’t include the 401(k) 100% match that workers have been demanding since the strike began on Aug. 4. Boeing also decreased the signing bonus from its $5,000 offer in July to $3,000, with $1,000 in the fourth year.
It offered $3,000 worth of Boeing stock, though employees wouldn’t own it immediately and would’ve had restrictions on the sale of stock. Boeing’s offer followed several meetings with a federal mediator that failed to reach an agreement.
Jody Bennett, resident general vice president of International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union, said the newest offer was “barely a shuffling” of prior offers.
This week, he said IAM union negotiators offered to take the 401(k) 100% match off the table and break up their requested $10,000 bonus by getting $5,000 the first year and $5,000 in the third year.
The union’s proposed signing bonus is lower than what the $12,000 Boeing employees in Seattle received last year after a seven-week strike, where workers also received the 401(k) match.
But at this point, Bennett said Boeing is unwilling to budge at all.
“The hold up is the fact they do not want to look as if they are conceding anything to the membership,” Bennett said. “We’ve made concessions in our counter proposals. It’s time for the company to make a concession and admit we may have to put more money on the table to get these people back.”
On Tuesday, Boeing sent a letter to all employees in the St. Louis region in response to the union’s Monday offer.
“Just yesterday, they asked for more money after we’ve repeatedly said more is not coming,” writes Steve Parker, executive vice president of The Boeing Company and president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space & Security. “Sadly, even with continued bargaining, the union’s rhetoric and actions are needlessly prolonging this strike and unfortunately many of our teammates are suffering as a result.”
Another big sticking point is the contract duration, Bennett said. When negotiations began this summer, Boeing wanted a five-year contract and the union wanted it to be three years, he said. 
They met in the middle, and the first two contracts were four-year agreements. Union members voted them both down because the wage increase didn’t support longtime workers, he said. 
In the next two contracts, the union agreed to do a five-year contract “if they could get the money right,” Bennett said. But the incentives weren’t there, he said, so members voted them down as well.
“Usually in contract negotiations, the longer a contract, the more bonus money,” he said, “because you’re not going back to the table soon to try to address inadequacies in pay due to the rising cost of living.”
In his letter Tuesday, Parker said Boeing is moving forward with the next phase of its contingency plan. 
“We are accelerating our efforts to hire permanent replacement workers, which will likely result in some striking employees being displaced,” he said.
That includes “expanding the use of third-party support” for certain positions, Parker said, and “assessing opportunities to streamline factory operations.”
Bennett said the Air Force is going to continue to see delays as long as striking workers “stay on the street.” 
“The company is not able to get enough replacement workers in there who have the skills and abilities to actually build an aircraft from start to finish,” Bennett said.
One reason is because these workers have to get certifications, and the people who would train them are on the strike line. They also have to get security clearances and because of the federal government shutdown, contractor security clearances are not a priority. 
“The fact of the matter is, our people already possess the skills, abilities, clearances, and certifications to go back to work and get the stuff done,” he said. “And really, we’re not that far apart, if the company would just listen to the latest counter proposal.”
Earlier this month, Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri called Boeing’s behavior in the strike negotiations “unbelievable,” during a meeting of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.
“You’ve offered Missouri workers a wage increase that’s 16% below what you offered the Seattle workers,” Hawley said. “You’re offering them bonuses that are thousands of dollars below — $8,000 less — with far fewer other benefits. What’s different about these Missouri workers?”
Hawley was speaking to Boeing Chief Labor Counsel Scott Mayer, who President Donald Trump has nominated to be a member of the National Labor Relations Board — which rules on labor-dispute cases. 
Mayer said “a number of factors” come into play in determining employee wages, and he didn’t know how the situation was going to end.
“With 3,000-plus residents in my state on strike, unable to work, unable to get health care, while your CEO is getting paid $30-some million,” Hawley said, “…that doesn’t look like fairness to me.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Boeing-strike-2-scaled-e1760644501497-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-10-29 15:16:57.375692

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana lawmakers will not convene on Monday for an upcoming special session, House Speaker Todd Huston said Wednesday, instead signaling that the Republican-led General Assembly plans to meet later within the 40-day window allowed by state law.
“House Republicans are working on scheduling and have been in communication with our colleagues in the Senate about the logistics of convening the General Assembly following the Governor’s call for a special session,” said Huston, R-Fishers, in an afternoon statement. “Given the calendar and member availability, we will not be convening on Nov. 3 but are working within this general time frame as we consider the schedule.”
Earlier this week, Republican Gov. Mike Braun officially called a special session to take up mid-cycle congressional redistricting.
Braun’s order set the session for Monday, Nov. 3. But legislative leaders don’t have to convene the exact day that he suggested.
Indiana governor summons lawmakers for redistricting session amid national GOP pressure

By law, the only requirement is it can’t last for more than 30 session days or 40 calendar days. That clock will begin Nov. 3.
Senate Republicans also indicated Wednesday that their chamber will not be ready to meet next week.
“We are working with our senators and our counterparts in the House to determine the scheduling availability of members,” said Senate GOP spokesperson Molly Swigart. “In all likelihood, the Senate will not be ready to convene the week of Nov. 3. Recall that in the most recent special session, the legislature did not convene for a few weeks after the initial date provided by the governor. I will let you know when we have an update to share.”
In 2022, then-Gov. Eric Holcomb called a special session for July 6, but the legislature didn’t convene until July 25 and wrapped up Aug. 5.
The next regularly scheduled legislative session kicks off in January, although the ceremonial first day — Organization Day — is set for Nov. 18.
“The General Assembly is statutorily required to convene for Organization Day on Tuesday, Nov. 18, which is the official start of the 2026 regular session,” Huston said. “As always, our goal is to accomplish our work in a way that is most efficient and cost effective for Hoosier taxpayers. Our plan is to have a legislative schedule out as soon as possible.”
Braun’s summons to lawmakers tasked them with addressing early redistricting and state tax code mismatches.
The move came amid mounting national GOP pressure for Republican-led states to redraw congressional maps before the 2026 midterm elections, in a bid to maintain the party’s control over the U.S. House.
It’s still unclear when exactly lawmakers will return to the Statehouse or how long the special session will last.
The last time Indiana redrew its congressional lines, the process stretched over several months and included statewide public hearings. This time, lawmakers will be under greater pressure to move quickly.
Candidate filing for the 2026 primary opens Jan. 7, possibly leaving a narrow window for debate, map approval and potential legal challenges.

The Alyce G. Clarke Center for Medically Fragile Children will provide long-term care for patients younger than 19-years-old with complex medical conditions and training for others’ families to care for them at home. It is a part of Children’s of Mississippi, the pediatric arm of the University of Mississippi Medical Center. 
“The Alyce G. Clarke Center is so much more than a building,” Dr. Mary Taylor, the Suzan B Thames Chair and professor of pediatrics at UMMC, said in a press release.
“It represents hope, and we are so proud that this is going to be a new home for children with special needs. The medical care they need will be provided here, and also supportive care for their families.” 
The facility has already admitted its first patient, UMMC spokesperson Annie Oeth told Mississippi Today. 
The $15.9 million, 20-bed facility is located about two and a half miles from the University of Mississippi Medical Center’s main campus on North State Street. It has two wings, each with a shared area that serves as a living room. 
“It took a whole team of people from the entire state of Mississippi to come together to get this beautiful building built,” said Dr. Alan Jones, UMMC’s associate vice chancellor for health affairs, in a press release. “This building and the people who staff it will deliver life-changing care.” 
The pediatric facility’s opening comes after several delays and scrutiny over funding and location. 
The center held its first groundbreaking in 2019 and planned to begin construction in 2021. But the COVID-19 pandemic slowed the project due to rising costs and supply chain issues, Jones said in a previous press release. 
UMMC awarded the contract to Mid State Construction Co., Inc in February 2024, and construction of the facility began in August 2024. 
The project was funded with $14.5 million in bonds awarded by the state Legislature in 2019 and 2020. However, the project was originally intended to be paid for by private funders and constructed, owned and operated by a nonprofit. 
The nonprofit that would spearhead and fundraise for the project, Mississippi Center for Medically Fragile Children, was set up by then-First Lady Deborah Bryant’s chief of staff. Nancy New, the Families First leader who pleaded guilty in 2022 for her role in channeling Mississippi welfare grant funds for illegal projects, served on the nonprofit’s board. 
After New was arrested in 2020, she was removed from the board, the nonprofit dissolved and Children’s of Mississippi assumed responsibility for the project. The nonprofit transferred its remaining funds to UMMC. 
The center is named for former Rep. Clarke, the first African American woman to serve in the Mississippi Legislature and a longtime advocate for the project. 
She became involved when Calvary Baptist Church in west Jackson, the area Clarke represented, planned to renovate its building to house the center. The church was ultimately left out of the plan after years of working on the proposal. Some lawmakers argued that state leaders hijacked the church’s proposal in order to place the center near the wealthier neighborhood of Eastover in Jackson. 
Children’s of Mississippi has provided long-term care to patients in an acute-care hospital setting for years. The new building will serve as a bridge from pediatric inpatient care to home for patients and parents. 
“This center will be able to provide medical care for these special children and education for their families in learning to care for them, but it will be a safe, warm place that will feel like home,” Taylor said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29103918/Clarke-Center-20251028-02.jpg,,,2025-10-29 15:16:57.375692

(Department of Defense Inspector General)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser is suing President Donald Trump’s administration over its “retaliatory” decision to relocate U.S. Space Command from Colorado Springs to Huntsville, Alabama.
In a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court of Colorado on Wednesday, Weiser wrote that the president “could not have been clearer about his motivations” for the move, citing Trump’s comments during the Oval Office announcement last month acknowledging that Colorado’s elections, which he falsely described as “crooked,” were a “big factor” in his decision.
That admission makes Trump’s decision to vacate Space Command’s temporary location in Colorado — the latest twist in a years-long battle over the permanent home of Space Force headquarters — an unconstitutional violation of state sovereignty, Weiser said in a press conference.

“The executive branch isn’t allowed to punish, retaliate, or seek to coerce states who lawfully exercise powers that are reserved to them,” Weiser said. “And that includes the power to oversee the time, place and manner of elections.”
Colorado adopted its universal mail-in ballot system in 2014. Like other top Republicans, Trump — who has lost the contest for the Centennial State’s electoral votes in three consecutive presidential elections — has repeatedly and baselessly impugned the integrity of elections held using mail-in ballots. Studies have found no evidence that vote-by-mail increases the incidence of voter fraud, which is extremely rare in U.S. elections across many different state-administered voting systems.
“If we in Colorado don’t take a stand against this unconstitutional and unlawful decision, we in Colorado and other states who use mail-in voting are going to be subject to further pressure or punishment, unless and until we stop exercising our constitutional authority,” Weiser added. “That’s not acceptable.”
The lawsuit filed Wednesday marks the 41st time that Weiser, a two-term Democratic attorney general and a candidate for governor in 2026, has sued the federal government since Trump’s second presidential term began in January.
Trump created Space Force in 2019 as an independent service branch during his first term, and he established Space Command, previously part of the U.S. Air Force, as one of the military’s 11 so-called unified combatant commands. Since then, Peterson Space Force Base in Colorado Springs has served as the command’s interim headquarters.
In the final days of his first term, Trump endorsed a permanent move for Space Command to Huntsville’s Redstone Arsenal, but President Joe Biden’s administration reversed that decision in 2023. A Department of Defense inspector general report released in April found that while some senior military leaders preferred the Alabama location because of greater long-term cost efficiency, others said a permanent home in Colorado would allow it to better retain its civilian workforce and ensure operational readiness.
Construction of secure facilities for a new Space Command headquarters in Alabama is expected to take years, and the command has continued to operate from Colorado since Trump’s announcement. Weiser said his office will seek relief in the form of a pause on any concrete steps taken towards relocation while the litigation proceeds through the courts.
“We don’t know yet that there’s been any imminent steps where Space Command is being relocated,” Weiser told reporters Wednesday. “We’re acting now so that we’re getting ahead of any potential actions and … prevent them from happening, until a court looks at the merits of our case and can determine that the basis for this move is unlawful and can’t be justified as set forth by the president.”

Ron DeSantis speaking at the University of South Florida campus in Tampa on Oct. 29, 2025 (photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)TAMPA —Gov. Ron DeSantis continued to jab at House Republicans over property taxes on Wednesday and insisted that voters should be given just one proposed constitutional amendment to overhaul the system instead of multiple proposals.
House Speaker Daniel Perez earlier this month said that voters should decide what type of property tax cuts should be enacted and rolled out seven potential amendments that could be placed on the 2026 ballot.
But this is a no-go with DeSantis who has suggested that Perez is doing this to undermine any effort to cut property taxes.
“It’s got to be very clearly written and give people a chance to vote for it,” he said while speaking on the University of South Florida campus in Tampa. “What you don’t do is put five [constitutional amendments] on there…because they’re going to be written in ways that are not going to be clear – and so there’s going to create confusion on the ballot.”
The governor has made clear for months that he wants to provide property tax relief for those with homestead properties and that can only be achieved by placing such a measure on the ballot via a constitutional amendment. The most likely way that will happen is by having the Legislature create and approve a proposal that gets three-fifths support from both the House and Senate to be placed on the November 2026 ballot. Then 60% of the public must vote for it to become law.
This marks the second time that DeSantis has zinged House Republicans. After they  offered seven separate proposed constitutional amendments  to reduce property taxes earlier this month, DeSantis dismissed their offers as “not serious.” He doubled down on those comments on Wednesday.
 “Total half measures”

“Just understand what they’re trying to do in the Florida House – they put out a bunch of proposals,” he said. “They’re all milquetoast. There’s not one proposal that would get people excited about. Not one. So they’re total half measures. Which is not what people are asking for. People want to be bold. So just right there’s a problem. But they say, ‘No, we’re just going to put it all out to let the people decide. We’ll put five on the ballot and let the people decide.’ First of all, the Senate’s not going to do that. But if that were to be done, that is a way to kill any type of getting property tax reform. Because different voters are going to read different things and none of them are going to end up getting 60%.”
One big potential problem for DeSantis, however, is that he has no veto power over what the Legislature eventually draws up and places on the ballot.
Perez responded to DeSantis’ initial criticisms of the House’s proposals last week by pointing out that the governor has not yet released his own proposal to address the issue. He added that he had personally reached out to the governor to share the House’s offers and had never heard back.
(One Democrat, Sen. Mack Bernard from Palm Beach County, filed four proposed constitutional amendments on property taxes as well last week).
DeSantis confirmed at the press conference that he hasn’t spoken with Perez regarding property taxes, and didn’t sound like he intended to anytime soon.
The pair began feuding over various issues during the 2025 legislative session. When DeSantis first brought up the issue of providing property tax relief during the legislative session earlier this year, Perez countered by proposing a $5 billion plan to reduce sales taxes in Florida, which the governor derided again on Wednesday as “a tax cut for tourists and Canadians.”
Speaker Perez’s office did not immediately respond Wednesday to the Florida Phoenix’s request for comment.
The governor said that with the 2026 election still a year away, there was no urgency to release his own proposed amendment right now, but said that he was working “with folks” to get the language right so that it can ultimately get the support it needs to pass.
 The measure will require 60% approval from the voters

Public opinion polls show Floridians are generally supportive of eliminating or reducing property taxes. A University of North Florida Public Opinion Research Lab survey released on Tuesday of 728 likely voters showed 49% of Floridians supporting the elimination of property taxes for homeowners, with 43% against. While the survey shows a plurality of voters support the idea, it’s far from the 60% support required for passage.
DeSantis emphasized that whatever proposed constitutional amendment on property taxes appears on the ballot it must be clear and concisely written. The governor claimed that two constitutional amendments passed by the Legislature that appeared on the 2024 ballot failed because they were poorly written: Amendment 1 to  make school board races partisan, and Amendment to repeal the state’s public campaign financing programs for statewide candidates.
Critics say whatever is ultimately proposed regarding a significant reduction if not outright repeal of property taxes on homestead properties will result in a significant cost shift – whether in taxes, fees or inadequate services. “That’s a reality if we’re going to be clear about what this does,”  Florida Policy Institute director of research Esteban Leonardo Santis said Wednesday during an online discussion on property taxes.
“Ultimately if we were to just eliminate property taxes – non-school property taxes for homesteads – that would cost $11 billion statewide,” Santis added. “This would be $7.8 billion for counties. It would also be $3 billion for municipalities.”

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The six states that lead in corn production — Minnesota, Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana and Kansas — have seen higher rates of cancer among young people than other states over the past decade, according to Washington Post reporting published this week. 
The Washington Post data analysis found that six corn belt states have cancer rates 5% higher than the overall population, both among young adults and across all ages. The distressing data about Corn Belt cancer comes even as overall cancer rates are declining. 
Young adults in those states have especially higher rates of kidney and skin cancers. The skin cancer risk for young adults in the Corn Belt states is 35% higher for men and 66% higher for women than those in other states.
“Researchers are still working to disentangle national trends from regional anomalies, and the data doesn’t yet offer a satisfying explanation for why cancer rates among the young have shot up here. The increase in cancer diagnoses among young adults may reflect broader changes: better detection, shifting environmental factors or even evolving lifestyle patterns,” wrote Washington Post reporters Ariana Eunjung Cha, Dan Keating, Jahi Chikwendiu and Luis Melgar.
Certain chemicals used on farms, including pesticides and herbicides, have been linked to increased cancer rates. There’s also some evidence that nitrates, which can seep into drinking water from crop fields, are linked to some forms of cancer. 
Minnesota’s robust health care system means cancer is likely detected more often than in places where people have less access to doctors. It also keeps Minnesota’s cancer mortality rate relatively low, the Reformer reported in March.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)“Economic Outlook: Flying Blind” is what Emily Mandel, a senior economist at Moody’s Analytics, titled her presentation to Rhode Island state budget analysts Wednesday morning.
“It’s a reference to the federal shutdown,” Mandel said. “We don’t have the new data.”
Twice a year, economic experts and state budget crunchers attempt to bring the state’s revenue and spending picture into focus during the Revenue and Caseload Estimating Conference. 
Initial projections are laid out each fall before the governor releases a proposed budget, typically in early January. The forecast is revised again in May based on updated state and federal data, before lawmakers adopt a final budget, no later than June 30.
But the government shutdown has made the routine exercise for fiscal 2027 anything but. Large chunks of federal economic data have not been published, or collected, during the shutdown. For example, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics was scheduled to release its September jobs report three weeks ago. The publication remains indefinitely postponed, and the release of October employment information — scheduled for Nov. 7 — is also expected to be delayed. Meanwhile, the White House indicated the October inflation report may never come out.
“We’re only a month behind at this point, but it’s another layer of complexity over the outlook right now,” Mandel said.
Employees at the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training have also been blocked from accessing the federal software used to drill down to state-level employment information, said Lisa Dutilly, chief of research and statistics within DLT’s Labor Market Information Division.

Dutilly recalled the problems in data access and reporting caused by the last prolonged government shutdown in 2013, when a 16-day shutdown led to a one month delay in federal jobs data even after the government reopened.
“I think we’re already past the point where we can get October data in a short period of time,” Dutilly told state budget analysts on Wednesday. “If this goes on much further…”
She trailed off, leaving her sentence incomplete.
Suspension of government funding and operations has already caused major economic shocks: federal workers laid off or working without pay, limited operations at critical federal agencies and the looming evaporation of federal food assistance for millions of low-income families on Nov. 1.
The nation appears to be able to avoid a recession, though it remains an “uncomfortable close,” possibility, said Emily Mandel, senior economist at Moody’s Analytics. (Courtesy of Moody’s Analytics)
‘Muddling along’
Not that the economy was thriving before the stalemate in Washington D.C. gripped the nation.
“Muddling along is how you could describe the economic forecast,” Mandel said of the national outlook. “It’s an economy that’s functioning, it’s an economy that is running, but it is not particularly resilient at this point.”
Fallout from President Donald Trump’s trade wars along with federal immigration policies have stifled labor force growth. Consumer spending remains at some of the weakest levels measured since the 2008 recession, while lack of affordable housing continues to be a problem across the Northeast.
And it wouldn’t take much to dip below the baseline into a recession, a prospect Mandel considered “uncomfortably close.”

Rhode Island is famously vulnerable, considered in recent economic downturns and recessions as a “first in, last out” state, to use a common accounting term.
By some measures, that label still holds true. An aging population — well above the national average — and a lack of new, younger residents appears to be suppressing labor force growth, Dutilly said. Long-term population declines remain likely in the Ocean State, like much of the Northeast.
Lack of affordable housing, or any housing at all, is well-documented across the region, even with a recent uptick in permit applications for multifamily housing projects in Rhode Island. 
The 4.6% state unemployment rate as of August is the 11th highest in the country, and the fifth highest in New England, though the Ocean State fared slightly better than Massachusetts, which reported a 4.8% unemployment rate in August, according to information from DLT.

Health care jobs a pain point
While health care jobs are a major source of job growth nationwide, Rhode Island has been unable to reap the benefits of the burgeoning demand. In fact, the state has lost 1,700 health care and social assistance jobs since April, partly due to the three-month Butler Hospital worker strike, but also because primary care centers closed and ambulatory service companies shed workers, according to DLT analysis.
One sign of strength: the state’s small but mighty manufacturing industry which has withstood the fallout from Trump’s trade wars, thanks largely to companies that serve as federal defense contractors.
“That’s very much a sturdy backbone of the economy here in Rhode Island,” Mandel said.
While stated tariff rates have changed rapidly over the last 10 months, the impact on manufacturers, and in turn, consumers, has been less chaotic. At least, so far. Moody’s forecasts prices on apparel, food, drugs and appliances, among other tariff-sensitive consumer goods, will continue to rise in 2026. 
Rhode Island’s unemployment rate is also expected to tick up slightly next year as fewer people work or actively seek employment. Across the country, labor force participation has been on a yearslong descent, though Rhode Island’s participation rate remains above the national average.
These projections rest on the assumption that the federal shutdown won’t last, however. A prolonged government shutdown would wreak havoc on the state’s economy. A 12-week shutdown, for example, could send the state into economic contraction by the end of the year, with a corresponding plunge in employment, Moody’s forecast showed.

500 fewer federal workers 
Already, the state’s civilian federal workforce has fallen by 500 people, down to 11,600 workers as of August, according to DLT. Information on whether they had been laid off, or opted to find new jobs, was not immediately available.
The U.S. Department of Defense, Postal Service and the Department of Veterans Affairs are the largest federal employers for civilian workers in Rhode Island, representing 85% of the state’s civil federal workers. Including active-duty military and National Guard and Reserve members, 17,500 Rhode Islanders hold full or part-time federal jobs affected by the shutdown.
About 200 federal workers in Rhode Island have filed for unemployment as of Wednesday, Dutilly said. 
“The further this goes on, the more you’ll see,” she warned.
The fall Revenue and Caseload Estimating Conference continues through Nov. 10.

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — Civil engineer Wes Marshall says government transportation agencies make life-or-death decisions based on data that clouds thinking on how roadway infrastructure ought to be redesigned to better protect pedestrians and bicyclists.
Marshall, a professor at University of Colorado at Denver, said the number of U.S. traffic fatalities since 1899 was approaching 4 million, but those deaths were generally accepted as part of the cost of a modern transportation network anchored to movement of vehicles. He told participants Wednesday in the Walk Bike Roll Kansas summit hosted by the Kansas Department of Transportation that addressing the carnage required a new mindset that placed a premium on examining why dominant methods of engineering killed so many people.
“How do we fix it? We can maybe stop bowing down to the secret art of traffic flow, stop playing whack-a-mole with all our safety problems and try to build better places,” he said.
He said the United States lacked essential research on traffic safety and relied on plausible but unproven assumptions about traffic speed limits, lane widths, roadside zones cleared of obstructions, crosswalks, bicycle lanes and sidewalks. The problems persist, in part, because of a lack of interest among states in gathering the detailed crash-by-crash information that is important to understand the root causes of accidents and what might be done to make the public safer, he said.
“Police are out there to … just figure out who’s at fault for the sake of the insurance companies or for giving citations,” Marshall said. “They’re not taking this data down to help me understand what the infrastructure was like and whether there was a bike lane or protected signal.”
Marshall argued states should do a much better job of tracking injuries and deaths involving pedestrians and cyclists. Most police departments required a minimum $1,000 in damage to take a crash report, he said. In San Diego, he said, there were 250 bicycle crashes in one year that were oddly defined in reports as overturned vehicles.
“Most states, it’s easier to do what we’ve always done,” Marshall said. “So collecting better data that we can begin to trust more, it would be a great start.”
He said traffic fatalities and accidents should be factored in relation to total population rather than miles traveled so the numbers could be routinely viewed in the context of a health risk. Data too often placed responsibility for accidents on human error rather than poorly designed infrastructure, he said.
Marshall wrote the book “Killed by a Traffic Engineer: Shattering the Delusion that Science Underlies Our Transportation System.”
“There are a few DOTs that have banned my book from their library just strictly based on the title,” he said. “I’m an engineer myself, and if you can sort of get past the title, you realize I’m not blaming us. We are doing what we were told. We are doing what we were taught, but what we were taught isn’t quite so. I was told there was science behind all this stuff.”
Marshall intended the book to be of use to engineering professionals as well as community transportation activists. The intent was to evaluate available research, explain transportation jargon and pull the curtain back on the regulatory landscape, he said.
“I’m trying to give everyone ammunition so you can more effectively argue with an engineer. So you can understand what engineering judgment is and how we can use it. Engineers, as we all know, are great at coming to a community meeting, you’ve already decided what we want to do, and we can just shut down things by calling them standards, even though we know they are guidelines,” he said.
It wasn’t enough to design streets, roads and highways to get vehicles from Point A to Point B the fastest way possible, he said.
And, he said, engineers who insisted that making traffic lanes wider would make roads safer at elevated speeds didn’t take into account how motorists frequently took more liberties behind the wheel whenever they considered the road less risky.
“It makes logical sense. It gives people extra room. It should work well, but human beings behave differently on this (wide) road than a narrow one,” he said. “Maximizing the kinetic energy of anything is not what we want in terms of road safety.”
He said infrastructure reform had to supplement educational programs designed to encourage people to behave better on highways, streets and roads.
For example, he said, there was no doubt many cities needed to invest in comprehensive sidewalk networks and in building dedicated lanes for bicycles on streets that featured rigid barriers to protect riders.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Wes-Marshall-engineer-2b-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-29 14:57:40.859024

Without the credits, her bill jumps to $900 a month.","Editor’s note: This essay is part of Mississippi Today Ideas, a platform for thoughtful Mississippians to share fact-based ideas about our state’s past, present and future. You can read more about the section here.

A small-business owner in our district (the 2nd U.S. House District) is alive today because of the Affordable Care Act premium tax credits.
Before the ACA, he faced a life-or-death situation. Insurance companies either denied him coverage outright or quoted $2,000 to $3,000 a month for coverage he could never afford. Without health insurance, even a routine doctor’s visit could have been impossible.
It is because of the ACA tax credits that he finally found a plan he could afford, received life-saving heart surgery and regained his quality of life.
Today, he runs his business, supports his family and provides insurance for six employees. His story is proof of what affordable health care means for real people and real communities. Now, Republicans in Washington want to take that away.
We are living through what could be the longest government shutdown in U.S. history because Republican leaders are trying to end these very same ACA tax credits. If they succeed, Mississippi families –  especially in the 2nd Congressional District – will pay the highest price.
These credits are the only reason many Mississippians can afford health insurance. Without them, average premiums in our state would rise by 314%. 
That means 338,159 Mississippians, including more than 81,000 people in the 2nd District that I represent, would be at risk of losing coverage.
One 54-year-old small business owner in my district now pays $268 a month for ACA Marketplace coverage. Without the credits, her bill would jump to nearly $900 a month. That’s money she needs for her mortgage, groceries and medication. Hardworking Mississippians should never have to make those choices. 
Republicans are also promoting the $50-billion Rural Health Transformation, RHT,  Program, created under H.R. 1 – their so-called ‘Big Ugly Bill’ – as a one-time pool of  money meant to help rural hospitals and attract doctors and nurses.
To be clear, H.R. 1 was not designed to save rural hospitals. It was written to strip away sustainable funding streams – like Medicaid expansion and Affordable Care Act  subsidies – and replace them with a short-term band-aid, the $50 billion RHT Program. Dividing that one pot of money across 50 states over five years doesn’t come close to filling the funding gap needed to stabilize rural hospitals and communities. 
Take Mississippi as an example. Had our state approved Medicaid expansion, we would have collected nearly $15 billion in federal funds to date – the very money our  hospitals and communities need to remain sustainable.
Instead of creating stability, H.R. 1 pushes 338 rural hospitals across the U.S. closer to closure. Eight of these hospitals are in Mississippi and are barely hanging on financially. Four of them are in the 2nd District: Delta Health – Northwest Regional (Clarksdale), Greenwood  Leflore Hospital (Greenwood), Panola Medical Center (Batesville) and Baptist  Medical Center – Yazoo (Yazoo City). They are weighed down by the cost of treating  patients who can’t pay, and government programs like Medicare and Medicaid don’t make up the difference.
If ACA premiums rise, more families will skip checkups, cut medicines and show up sicker in emergency rooms. That costs all of us more in the long run. 
Now, the Republican shutdown makes this health crisis even worse. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has warned that SNAP benefits to nearly 42 million Americans could stop in November if the shutdown continues. That includes over 357,000 Mississippians left without the means to put food on the table. Nutrition and health are inseparable, and in Mississippi, both are at risk. 
As members of Congress, we have health insurance. Who are we to deny the same opportunity to the people we serve? That is hypocrisy, plain and simple. 
The government could reopen tomorrow if Republicans would work with Democrats to make sure Mississippi families have access to health care and food assistance.
In our community, we take care of each other, and our government should do the same. I will continue to fight for fairness, and I won’t stop until every family has the  support they deserve.
Keep the faith.

Sen. Larry Hart, R-Orange, announced in a letter Monday to state officials that he will resign effective Nov. 14. 
The first-term senator was part of the Vermont Legislature’s red wave in 2024, when the GOP flipped House and Senate seats up and down the state. 
In his letter of resignation, Hart said he’d struggled to make the impact he wanted during his first session, particularly on substance use policy. 
“As you may know I experienced the loss of my daughter and grandchild to addiction prior to running for the Senate,” he said in the letter. He said he had hoped to honor his daughter by serving in office.
“The time and commitment became too great for my health and emotional well-being. I feel I owe it to my constituents to step down,” Hart wrote. 
Hart did not respond to requests for comment this week. 
With Hart’s departure, Vermont’s Senate now has two vacancies following the resignation of fellow Republican Sam Douglass earlier this month. 
Douglass drew national headlines when hateful comments he and others made in a national Young Republican group chat leaked. Politicians across the political spectrum in Vermont immediately called for his resignation. 
Gov. Phil Scott will appoint replacements for Douglass and Hart once the Republican parties in both districts submit a list of potential successors. Those appointed replacements will be up for election in November 2026. 
Following Hart’s resignation, Rep. Monique Priestley, D-Bradford, announced Wednesday she intended to run for the Orange County Senate seat in 2026. 
“Affordability isn’t a talking point – it’s a daily reality for families, seniors, and young people trying to make a life here,” Priestley said in a statement accompanying her announcement. “Vermonters sent a clear message this year: it’s time for leadership that listens and responds. We can’t afford to ignore the pressures facing everyday people any longer.” 
Priestley’s decision mirrors that of Gaston Bathalon, a Democrat from Troy serving on the town’s selectboard, who said he’d run for Douglass’ seat. 
Both the Orleans and Orange county seats were previously held by Democrats before the 2024 election.

Povich/Stateline)Addressing barriers to child care licensing in Arkansas, such as regulatory burdens and dependence on federal funding, could lead to greater access to care, particularly in underserved and rural areas of the state, according to a report released Wednesday. 
The national, nonprofit, nonpartisan “think-and-do-tank” United WE commissioned the University of Arkansas’ Office for Education Policy to produce the new report, which was also supported by funding from the Walton Family Foundation. 

Arkansas Child Care Licensing Report October 2025 
United WE is focused on “elevating” women’s labor force participation to strengthen the economy, and the group’s research has consistently found a “lack of affordable, accessible child care” is keeping women out of the workforce, President and CEO Wendy Doyle said during a virtual press conference Wednesday. State Sen. Breanne Davis, a Russellville Republican and mother of four, agreed. 
“We know in Arkansas that women are drastically underemployed and that’s due in large part, I think, to having child care options available in all areas across the state,” Davis said. 
Around 41% of Arkansas’ population live in rural areas, which often have a limited supply of child care providers, according to the study. Smaller, dispersed populations make it challenging for programs to remain financially viable. Recruiting and retaining qualified staff is also difficult because of lower wages and fewer professional opportunities compared to urban areas, according to the report. 
Addressing child care shortages in rural areas require targeted strategies reflective of a community’s needs, including home-based programs and financial incentives, such as subsidies or grants, that can stabilize programs and attract new providers, according to the report. 
Researchers conducted about 50 interviews and six focus groups as part of the year-long study. Those conversations helped them identify six core challenges for Arkansas’ early childhood care providers and recommend the following solutions:

Licensing and regulatory burdens: Streamline licensing, enhance provider and specialist support, and improve collaboration with local governments by simplifying processes, aligning state and local requirements, and creating a centralized structure to coordinate services, provide consistent guidance, and tailor resources to community needs.
Financial barriers: Provide financial support through subsidies for background checks, state-backed insurance options, and grants or low-interest loans for facility upgrades and compliance. 
Workforce shortages: Expand workforce support by offering low-cost professional development, creating career pathways for entry-level staff, and coordinating background checks to reduce redundancy. 
Zoning and code enforcement challenges: Modernize zoning and land-use codes to permit child care in residential and mixed-use areas, establish pre-approved “Child Care Zones,” and simplify applications for compliance. 
Dependence on federal funding: Diversify funding sources to reduce dependence on federal funding by expanding state-level support, creating public-private partnerships, and offering flexible grants or loans. 
Family child care barriers: Recruit and sustain family child care homes in rural areas by replicating successful pilot programs, pairing new providers with mentorship, and providing business development support.

Streamlining licensing and inspections “is the easiest barrier to remove,” said Sarah McKenzie, the Office of Education Policy’s executive director and one of the report’s authors. The LEARNS Act, a wide-ranging education law approved in 2023, “resulted in that tangible improvement, but there’s more work to do, especially when it comes to aligning state and local requirements,” McKenzie said. 
The LEARNS Act shifted licensing authority and most federal early childhood education funding from the Arkansas Department of Human Services to the Arkansas Department of Education, which helped streamline responsibilities that used to be divided among multiple state agencies, according to the report. 
Drafts of revised child care licensing guidelines, which are “part of a broader strategic plan aimed at enhancing early childhood education across the state,” are currently under review and are expected to be presented to the state’s Early Childhood Commission for approval in the coming months, according to the report. 
Panel recommends changes to sustain Arkansas child care during government shutdown

McKenzie also highlighted a recommendation to “expand state funding and public-private partnerships to reduce the dependence on federal funding.” 
“I don’t need to tell you how timely this recommendation is but, for example, New Mexico recently became the first U.S. state to offer free universal child care for nearly all families and Virginia offers low-cost loans to eligible child care programs,” she said.
The new report comes as Arkansas is struggling to make its child care assistance program financially sustainable, a challenge complicated by a lack of access to federal funding due to the government shutdown. 
Recently announced changes to the School Readiness Assistance Program’s reimbursement rates and copayments resulted in public pushback, and the state’s Early Childhood Commission responded by meeting several times this month in search of alternative solutions. The commission formed an emergency working group that proposed a $28 million plan Tuesday that could sustain the program for eight weeks and forgo the need to ask the state Legislature for financial aid. 
The state’s education department and the commission are expected to discuss the recommended plan and decide next steps by the end of the week. Without imminent changes to the funding formula, 250 child care facilities in 50 of Arkansas’ 75 counties would see a total of 400 layoffs by next month, according to a survey presented to the commission Oct. 15.

The Secretary of State’s office confirmed Wednesday that the initiative has been approved for circulation, meaning those behind the effort can begin collecting signatures. 
The petition will need about 68,000 signatures by early February to make it onto the 2026 ballot. The number of signatures required represents 10% of the total votes cast in the last gubernatorial election in 2022. Lookner said whether there will be signature gathering efforts on Election Day next week depends on whether the group behind the petition can secure funding.
Lookner said the time is right for this effort, given the federal shutdown. He argued the state needs to step up and make sure residents have access to medical care.
As a lawmaker, Lookner could introduce a bill proposing universal health care, but he said it’s important that the Legislature “sees that the vast majority of Maine sees health care as a human right, so taking it directly to the people is what we want to do.” 
“We need to ask ourselves how much we want the state to step up in lieu of what’s happening federally with just massive cuts that are going to really adversely affect huge parts of our population,” he added.
Lookner said the hope is to get on the 2026 ballot, but if they aren’t able to secure what they need in time, the group behind the petition would push for the following year. 
Abbie Ryder, the former campaign manager for Maine Healthcare Action, which attempted a similar ballot measure during the Covid-19 pandemic but came up short on signatures, said the petition was filed on the off chance that funding could be secured in time to collect signatures on Election Day, though she said that’s doubtful. 
Still, like Lookner, she said it’s important, given the current state of health coverage, to show popular support for the Legislature to draft a plan for a universal system. 
“Time and time again, multiple bills have been presented and some have been very comprehensive, only for them to not pass,” said Ryder, who also used to work for Maine AllCare, a nonprofit focused on educating the public on the health care system. “The effort will continue whether it starts this November or not.”
The November 2026 ballot is already stacked with key races including an open seat for governor and a strong effort from Democrats to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, who is up for reelection alongside both of Maine’s members of the U.S. House of Representatives. 
Earlier this year, two bills were introduced in the Maine Legislature to restart the conversation around universal health care. Proponents stressed the need for a better system, specifically aiming to address rising health care challenges including the closure of hospitals in rural Maine, the uncertainty around Medicaid funding, and overall health care costs increasing.
However, the legislation ultimately failed. During public hearings, the state’s Office of Affordable Health Care said the state isn’t in a position to implement the proposal with the current financial constraints and the amount of change that would be required for implementation..
Health care costs are top of mind not only in Maine, but across the country. Congressional Democrats have said they won’t support a stopgap spending bill to reopen the government until there is bipartisan agreement to extend expiring tax credits for people who buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. 
On Wednesday the Trump administration gave a preview of how much those costs are expected to rise, which in some locations could be as much as 30%. For states like Maine that run their own insurance markets, those increases are set to be slightly lower, closer to 17%, according to an analysis by KFF.
The Maine Bureau of Insurance warned last month that if the credits expire thousands of Mainers could see their monthly health premiums increase by as much as 117%. 
Of the 61,000 Maine people who enroll through CoverME.gov, 85% rely on premium tax credits to reduce their monthly costs. These families are expected to see an average premium increase of $258 per month if the enhanced credits expire. Nearly 9,500 consumers — 18% of those receiving assistance — will lose all premium support if the enhanced credits expire, leading to average increases of more than $900 per month.

Jane Winik Sartwell / Carolina Public PressNorth Carolina’s system of targeted economic development — economic distress tiers — was designed to distribute a tax credit that no longer exists. Today, the system persists, and various state agencies and nongovernmental organizations continually apply it in ways the original designers never could have anticipated, influencing economic growth in many parts of North Carolina, but not always for the better.
In Tier 1 Columbus County, where the decline of textile mills and tobacco farming left behind economic stagnation, the town of Chadbourn’s main street looks almost post-apocalyptic. Between 2022 and 2023, employment declined another 16% in Chadbourn. The median income in town is less than $20,000.
The tier system is specifically designed to help places like Chadbourn by prioritizing job creation there. So why isn’t anything changing in Chadbourn and many other communities across the state?
The poverty rate in Chadbourn is more than 50%. That town’s economic plight is, under the current distress tiers system, equal to that of Bethlehem in Tier 1 Alexander County. Yet the poverty rate in Bethlehem is less than 4%.
This kind of issue is a feature of the tiers system, not a bug.

This is part two of Trapped By Tiers, a three-part Carolina Public Press investigative series examining North Carolina’s economic distress tiers, a system intended to promote economic mobility across the state. CPP analyzed state data and found that this system is ineffective, stagnant, and at times, counterproductive.
The first article examined the ways this system fails counties across the economic spectrum. This article focuses on where North Carolina went wrong. The third and final installment explores possible solutions and alternatives.
The history of a broken system
North Carolina devised a system of five economic distress tiers in 1996 as a method to distribute the William S. Lee tax credit, which incentivized businesses to create new jobs in struggling counties.
The Lee tax credit hasn’t existed since 2010, but the system built to distribute it carries on. The tiers weren’t designed to be flexible, nor were they built to be an accurate reflection of North Carolina’s economic health.
The system is now officially used by North Carolina’s Commerce Department to distribute money relating to competitive incentive programs, public infrastructure, building renovation and downtown redevelopment, through state programs like:

Job Development and Investment Grant (JDIG)
One North Carolina Fund (OneNC)
Community Development Block Grant — Economic Development (CDBG-ED)
State Rural Grants Economic Infrastructure Program
Industrial Development Fund (IDF) Utility Account
State Rural Grants Building Reuse Program

In the years since, misrepresentation and broad application of the tiers has spiraled.
Many state departments besides Commerce use the tiers in a variety of different programs, the exact number of which is difficult to determine. They now affect each county’s eligibility for public and private dollars, as well as its overall reputation.
At the time of its inception, only two tiers existed: 20 counties qualified for incentives and 80 didn’t. In 1996, the program scaled up from two tiers to five, reflecting the idea that economic distress went beyond just the 20 most disadvantaged counties.
“Years and years ago, we used to have five tiers,” Ashley Wooten, McDowell County manager, told Carolina Public Press. “That gave you a little more of a granular look. There was a lot more movement between tiers back then.”
Ten years later, in 2006, the framework was simplified to just three tiers.
“Now, with three tiers, you have counties that are very different economically in the same tier,” Wooten said.
Jane Winik Sartwell / Carolina Public Press
In 2018 came one of the biggest reforms of the tier system since its inception. Before that year, Commerce included two automatic qualifiers alongside the four economic indicators it considers: small population sizes and high poverty rates. Counties with populations of less than 12,000 were automatically classified as Tier 1, while counties with populations smaller than 50,000 were limited to Tier 1 or 2, regardless of the health of their economies.
Camden County was the best example of the system’s distortions pre-2018. It had the lowest poverty rate in the state, yet couldn’t leave Tier 1 due to its small population, displacing genuinely distressed counties from that designation.
Arbitrary arrangement
Though the state has done away with those pesky automatic qualifiers, the bones of the system still present serious problems.
The preprescribed number of counties in each category is one of these broken bones. Every year, there must be 40 Tier 1 counties, or most distressed, 40 Tier 2 counties, or medium distressed, and 20 Tier 3 counties — those which are least distressed. These numbers are entirely arbitrary, except that they add up to 100. The distribution does not reflect an actual ratio of distressed to nondistressed counties in North Carolina.
“It’s almost like musical chairs,” Cherokee County manager Paul Worley told Carolina Public Press. “Because there’s a set number of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3, if someone moves up, you automatically get pushed down. Cherokee County has moved back and forth without any major change here.”
Infinitesimal and even nonexistent changes are magnified. Meanwhile, if a county truly did improve or decline, but not enough to exit its tier, that change is reduced to nothing.
“First, they are forcing a rank of 1 to 100. Then, they are forcing that into three buckets. You end up creating difference where difference doesn’t exist, and obscuring differences that actually do exist,” said Carolyn Fryberger, co-author of a recent UNC School of Government study on the distress tiers system.
“You could shift places because someone else is doing way better or way worse — not because the underlying conditions in your own county have fundamentally changed.”
The system masks the unique issues of individual counties that are wildly different but end up in the same tier as one another.

“Are we really to believe that Haywood County — Canton, Waynesville — is in the same economic category as Charlotte?” said Rep. Brian Turner, D-Buncombe.
The system also obscures progress or decline in the overall state economy.
For example, isolating the unemployment rate data point shows considerable improvement in the state’s economy between 2014 and 2024. Still, the county tier rankings remained very similar over this period, and the system had no way to represent this change. Further, the system necessitates that 80% of the state is labeled as “distressed,” regardless of actual conditions.
The system is not flexible or adaptable enough to address economic crises, like COVID-19, Hurricane Florence or Tropical Storm Helene. If in next year’s ranking, Western North Carolina counties drop because of Helene’s lingering impact, that will artificially bump up counties that have not experienced any change — making them less attractive for state dollars.
The four-factor distress tier fallacy
The system uses four factors to determine each county’s rank: median household income, unemployment rate, population growth, and property tax base per capita.
That these are the only factors in the system results in a narrow picture of economic health.
“Some of those four stats unfairly advantage or disadvantage certain counties in the state, just based on that county’s particular point in time,” Curtis Potter, Washington County manager, told CPP.
“In Washington County, one of those four things is population growth. The fact that we are a shrinking-on-paper county in terms of population holds us down more than it otherwise should in the tier rankings.”

Population growth is a sticking point for other counties as well, largely because of North Carolina’s explosive growth over the last decade. Places that aren’t growing as fast as Charlotte, Raleigh or Wilmington are penalized, even if their growth rate isn’t negative. That’s the case in Caldwell County, where Ashley Bolick is the economic development director.
“Our growth pales in comparison to some of those communities, and that’s a hard narrative to describe or explain when people just read the headline that we are an economically distressed county,” Bolick said.
“The tier designation is not an accurate depiction of where we’re moving as a community. I don’t think the general public understands that. It’s really just intended to be a tool for the state to allocate resources.”
The other input factors present problems as well.
Using the property tax base per capita can artificially inflate county ranks in places where wealthy people own second homes, like the Outer Banks or the high country.

Using the median household income can disguise pockets of deep poverty in Tier 3 counties. It also inflates counties that attract wealthy retirees.
“I appreciate the theory behind creating such a system, and the benefits of having one, but I do not believe that the current system accurately reflects the reality in Buncombe County,” Rep. Lindsey Prather, D-Buncombe, told CPP.
“For example, Biltmore Forest, a small municipality in Buncombe, claims the highest income for any city in NC. But our county as a whole doesn’t even break the top 10 in the state for overall income. There are major variations within the county that are not accounted for in the county tier system, and it means that rural places in Buncombe are being underserved simply because of their proximity to Asheville.”
Other factors that could be considered in the assessment of a county’s economic health, but are left out of the distress tiers system. These include poverty rate, educational attainment, health care access, transportation infrastructure, child care availability, broadband access, wage growth, rate of home construction, cost of living, climate resilience, or small-business density — just to name a few.

“It’s really hard to boil an entire economy down to four metrics,” said Josh Carpenter, director of economic development group Mountain West Partnership. “Economic development is much more complicated than that.”
Yet even adding or switching out factors wouldn’t fix the fundamental problem, according to Fryberger. The methodology is set up to produce arbitrary results, she says.
Geographic complexities
The tier system treats each county as an autonomous economic zone, ignoring vast disparities that exist within county lines.
“If you went across Davie County, you would see all three tiers within the county itself,” said Davie County manager Brian Barnett.
This sentiment is echoed by county managers across the state, especially in Tier 2 and 3 counties, where the system ignores struggling towns and neighborhoods based on the affluence of another section of the county.
The system also ignores how regional labor markets function. Workers routinely cross county lines for employment, making a county-by-county system somewhat random.

Sometimes, this county-centric system produces absurd results. The town of Mebane, for example, straddles Alamance and Orange counties. Companies receive better incentives to locate on one side of town rather than the other, according to Orange County Commissioner Steve Brantley. That’s because Alamance is a Tier 2 county and Orange is Tier 3.
The system also fails to address the geographic clustering of persistently distressed counties in Eastern North Carolina — a regional economic challenge that might require regional solutions.
What keeps counties in distress
CPP analysis showed that half of the 40 Tier 1 counties have held that same status for more than a decade. The distress tiers system does not outline a clear process for improvement for these persistent Tier 1 counties. The incentives and funding the state is offering them now are not enough to allow them to move up in the rankings.
Part of the problem is that these counties may not have the resources to develop relevant projects or to apply for grants or incentives, even if they are given special treatment.
Jane Winik Sartwell / Carolina Public Press
“Most of the Tier 1 counties don’t have the resources to go after all those grants anyway,” Potter said.
Parts of North Carolina desperately need economic help. The question is whether the tiers are doing so.
Vance County Manager Renee Perry appreciates the idea that counties like hers are singled out by the system. But she doesn’t think her county has what it takes to transform, even under that spotlight.
“Some counties will always be at a disadvantage because of location, because of the demographics, because of the poverty in that county,” Perry said.
“I’m not going to say that the tier system is not working. It’s just certain opportunities come this way and some don’t, unfortunately. There are concerns from businesses about coming here because of the demographics and because our infrastructure is not that of a Tier 3 county. We don’t have certain things that are needed for your big Amazons, or other big industries, to actually come here and set up shop. We don’t have the infrastructure.”
That lack of infrastructure and interest from businesses is exactly the problem the distress tier system aims to solve. But so far, the system hasn’t shown itself able to do that.

Oct. 29. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan Advance. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel called for a temporary restraining order against the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s decision to allow Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, also known as SNAP, to lapse on Nov. 1 due to the ongoing federal shutdown. 
Nessel spoke alongside Lansing Mayor Andy Schor in a press conference inside a food bank at LMTS Community Outreach Services in Lansing, discussing the federal lawsuit that she filed alongside 22 other state attorneys general and three governors. The suit calls on the Department of Agriculture to use congressionally-appropriated contingency funding to continue SNAP benefits. 
“If you visit the USDA website, you’ll be met with a shockingly political and hostile message claiming that ‘the well has run dry,’ but that’s a lie,” she said, citing $6 billion in reserve funds to carry out SNAP operations. As of Oct. 2, the Office of Management and Budget indicated that those funds were still available, Nessel added.

An additional $23 billion, appropriated to Section 32 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1935, Nessel added, could be transferred to fund SNAP.
“Congress has clearly spoken to provide that SNAP benefits should continue even during a government shutdown. The USDA does not have the authority to say otherwise,” she said.
“On Nov. 1, when we have all these people who are on SNAP benefits that are in jeopardy, it becomes a crisis,” Schor said. “I am excited that this lawsuit has been filed, because it’s taking real action.”
Nessel further called on the federal government to make funding SNAP through the shutdown a priority. 
“If we have all the money in the world to pay ICE to, frankly, snatch people off of our city streets who are not posing a danger to our communities, then certainly we can come up with this money to feed hungry people,” she said.
Schor also highlighted the fact that local funding and support from food banks and pantries cannot replace the federal funding from SNAP. 
“We cannot make up for the power and the funding of the federal government. We don’t have those kinds of resources,” he said. “The federal government needs to come through.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Today is not about politics or policy. It’s about people,” said Joshua Gillespie, the executive director of LMTS Community Outreach Services. “Every single day, right here in our community, we have children who go to school hungry, seniors who silently skip a meal, families who have the daunting task of deciphering if ‘I’m going to pay rent or buy groceries, if I’m going to fill up my gas or fill the stomach of my babies.’”
While Nessel and others spoke, Lansing-area residents entered the LMTS Community Outreach Services food pantry to pick food off of shelves and out of freezers. A line outside the door stretched into the parking lot as more people waited for their turn to get food. 
Schor said that on Saturday — days after the announcement that SNAP would be pausing at the end of the month — food pantries had run out of food in less than an hour. 
“No one should go hungry. Not in our city, not in our state, not on our watch,” Gillespie said.

“These cuts force our family, friends and neighbors to prioritize between necessities they wouldn’t otherwise have to choose between,” Nessel said. “Next week, people will be forced to decide between buying groceries or filling prescriptions, or between going into work as scheduled or calling off so that they can come visit a local food bank.”
“While I believe in providing SNAP benefits as a moral issue, there’s also an economic argument to make as well,” she added, citing that for every dollar spent under SNAP, $1.54 goes back into the local economy — especially for local food retailers and farmers markets. 
Amanda Shreve, Executive Director of the Michigan Farmers Market Association, added that at least 2,500 farmers and small business owners across the state would be impacted by cuts to SNAP by losing part of their customer base. 
“SNAP meaningfully contributes to farmer and market viability,” Shreve continued. “Perhaps no one exemplifies this more than the direct marketing farmer, the farmer who grows or produces food right here in Michigan and sells it directly to their neighbors and communities. For direct marketing farmers, accepting SNAP expands their customer base, increases their sales and allows them to serve all members of their community.”
House Dems eye relief package as federal stalemate continues
As Nessel and other states pursue a remedy to the freeze in federal court, Michigan House Democrats are proposing temporary relief for SNAP and food bank beneficiaries.
The five-bill package, which proposes the creation of a $600 million emergency relief fund to temporarily backfill the loss of SNAP funding to Michigan, is still currently being drafted by legislative staff. State Reps. Tonya Myers Phillips (D-Detroit), Betsy Coffia (D-Traverse City) and Kimberly Edwards (D-Eastpointe) are among those sponsoring the legislation.
“It will allow our constituents to eat and not go hungry,” Phillips told reporters on Tuesday during House session. “That’s what it’s all about for me. Children, elders, seniors, our most vulnerable citizens should not go hungry, should not go without food, because of what’s happening right now with Washington Republicans.”
The legislation comes after the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services was notified last week that the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service would pause November SNAP payments due to the shutdown.
Phillips said she would seek the funding through a supplemental bill, considering the state budget is already in place and was kept tight with an emphasis on road funding with a mix of deeper cuts and new taxes.
The $600 million fund would cover two months of SNAP backfill, assuming that the federal government shutdown ends quickly. But the legislative process is often slow, and it’s uncertain if the Republicans who control the House will let the bills move out of committee, or reach the chamber’s floor for a vote. The federal government shutdown could end by that time and money could flow again to states, like Michigan, that were notified
A message seeking comment from House leadership on the bills were not returned at the time of publication.
The package would also provide a $12.5 million supplemental to the Food Bank Council of America, and another $12.5 million in supplemental funding to food pantry programs across Michigan.

Although the package could certainly help those in need due to no fault of their own, Coffia said it was not the solution.
“We have a crisis that is unnecessary, it is manufactured by Washington Republicans who have illegally frozen USDA funds so that 1.4 million children, seniors, people with disabilities, veterans and families – many of whom are working – are not going to have food in their SNAP benefits this Saturday,” Coffia said. “And it’s not because we don’t have the money. This administration … just approved a $40 million bailout to Argentina while they are agreeing to a sort of ‘Hunger Games’ for 40 million Americans who depend on SNAP benefits.
When asked if there was $600 million available in state coffers to fund the money, the trio said yes, but said the numbers were still in flux. Initially, the lawmakers said the fund would be $900 million, but walked that figure back as they announced the move on social media on Tuesday afternoon.
“That is federal tax money. That’s our tax money that should be released, and it’s being illegally held,” Coffia said. “If they back us into a corner, there’s $2 million in the rainy day fund. I don’t know what kind of rainy day you’ve seen, but if people can’t eat, that’s a pretty damn rainy day.”
When asked about the bills, Nessel said at the press conference that she couldn’t “think of anything more important than feeding people and making sure that people don’t go hungry, making sure that people don’t starve to death” and encouraged Gov. Whitmer and the legislature to take action.
“I hope that those bills will move. I think it’s important that those bills move,” Nessel added. “Is there an appetite by the speaker? You’ll have to ask him that question.”

Candace Newell, D-New Orleans, says Republicans in the Louisiana Legislature are likely to dilute Black voter strength if a pending U.S. Supreme Court ruling allows them redraw the state's six congressional districts. (Photo by Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Republicans in the Louisiana Legislature gave final approval Wednesday to pushing back 2026 primary election dates, capping a one-week special session that sets the stage for revising the state’s U.S. House districts ahead of next year’s congressional midterms. Their calendar adjustment banks on the U.S. Supreme bucking its pattern of issuing decisions in the spring and instead making a ruling in a key redistricting case before Christmas.
In the GOP’s preferred scenario, justices would issue a decision in the case by Dec. 20 that would clear the way for legislators to redraw the maps in an early January special session. The ruling might allow Republican lawmakers to remove one or both majority Black districts that Black Democrats currently hold out of the state’s six U.S. House seats.
In the case in question, Louisiana v. Callais, Attorney General Liz Murrill has argued that race was used illegally to draw boundaries of the 6th Congressional District that state lawmakers gave bipartisan approval to in early 2024. Specifically, she has called into question whether Section 2 the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 violates the U.S. Constitution. 
The section of the landmark civil rights legislation prohibits voting laws or procedures that discriminate based on race, color or membership in a language minority group. Murrill contends Section 2 conflicts with the 14th and 15th amendments of the U.S. Constitution, which cover representation in Congress and racial discrimination in voting, respectively.
Black Democrats in the Louisiana Legislature led opposition to pushing back qualifying and party primary elections dates a month to allow for a possible redistricting. They noted that Murrill and Republicans, including Gov. Jeff Landry, originally supported and called for the creation of a second majority-Black congressional district in Louisiana to avoid having a federal court drawing the lines.
After an initial hearing in March, the Supreme Court scheduled a rare second round of arguments for the parties in Callais for October, asking them to evaluate whether Louisiana’s current congressional map violates the 14th and 15th amendments to the U.S. Constitution. It was then that Murrill ended her defense of the map and joined the white plaintiffs who sued to block it.
The decision in the case could determine the degree to which race can be considered when drawing election maps after each decennial census, creating nationwide implications. 
Justices could simply keep as is Louisiana’s challenged 6th Congressional District, which Rep. Cleo Fields, D-Baton Rouge, currently holds. But if Fields’ district is rejected without undermining the Voting Rights Act, state lawmakers would have to approve a new congressional map with two majority Black districts. 
Justices could also overturn Fields’ district and scale back Section 2. Republicans would then have the opportunity to eliminate either or both of the state’s two majority Black districts.
Throughout the special session, Black lawmakers were pointed in their remarks toward Republican colleagues, saying that they are carrying out President Donald Trump’s orders to help preserve the GOP’s majority in Congress. Several Republican-led states have launched efforts to redraw their House districts, a process that typically takes place closer to the completion of the decennial U.S. census. 
Rep. Candace Newell, a Black Democrat from New Orleans, noted the redistricting cycle based on the 2020 census was the first since the U.S. Department of Justice ended its preclearance of Louisiana’s election mapmaking process. A Supreme Court decision in 2013 determined the oversight was unconstitutional, weakening Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act.
“We are seeing now that the South is not far enough removed from racist practices where we can trust that the fundamentally correct thing will be done,” Newell said to House members. 
Rep. Beau Beaullieu, who co-authored the bill to push back qualifying and primary dates next year, pushed back on this as well as suggestions that the changes would create confusion among voters. 
He framed the special session as an opportunity to position the state to act quickly if the Supreme Court rules soon on Callias. The fact that justices held a second hearing in the Callais could lead to a ruling from the Supreme Court in the coming weeks, he said.   
“I don’t think it’s out of the realm of possibilities that, because they’ve delayed us already, they wouldn’t provide us with a decision before the end of the year,” Beaullieu told lawmakers Wednesday.
Even if a Supreme Court ruling invalidates Louisiana’s current congressional map, the state would not be obligated to implement new maps for the 2026 election.  
The date changes lawmakers approved in a 73-29 vote move next year’s primary election schedule back roughly one month. Instead of an April 18 party primary for Louisiana’s congressional races and some municipal elections, the new date would be May 16. Primary runoffs would be moved from May 30 to June 2. 
The qualifying period for the election would be adjusted from Jan. 14-16 to Feb. 11-13.
A separate measure lawmakers approved moves five state constitutional amendments and local propositions on the March ballot to the new April date. 
Beaullieu said the Secretary of State would need the legislature to provide a new congressional district map by Jan. 13 in order for her office to hold the qualifying period a month later.
Next year’s congressional midterm election will be the first Louisiana holds under a closed primary system since 1975. Lawmakers chose in 2024 to end the state’s open “jungle” primary process that places candidates from all parties in a weed-out election and sends the top two vote-getters to a runoff unless someone claims more than 50% of the primary vote. The implementation of closed primaries was delayed until 2026.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Department of Public Instruction is seeking applications to fill a pending vacancy on the State Board of Higher Education left by Levi Bachmeier, who was appointed to be the next state superintendent.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong appointed Bachmeier during a press conference last week, but he will not assume the role until current Superintendent Kirsten Baesler officially resigns and is sworn into her new position as an assistant secretary with the U.S. Department of Education. Baesler is expected to be sworn-in as soon as the federal government shutdown ends.
Candidates for the State Board of Higher Education need to have lived in North Dakota for the previous five years and not have been employed by the North Dakota University System within the last two years, according to a Department of Public Instruction news release on Wednesday.
The governor appoints members to the board, but the state superintendent chairs a five-member committee that screens the applicants and advances three names to Armstrong for his consideration.

The nomination committee includes: the superintendent; North Dakota Supreme Court Chief Justice Jon Jensen; Nick Archuleta, president of North Dakota United, a union representing teachers and public employees; Speaker of the House Rep. Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield; and Sen. Kyle Davison, R-Fargo, the state Senate’s president pro tempore.
The appointee would serve on the State Board of Higher Education immediately and need to be confirmed by the state Senate during the 2027 legislative session. The new board member would serve the remainder of Bachmeier’s four-year term, which expires June 30, 2029, according to the department.
The State Board of Higher Education oversees North Dakota’s 11 public colleges. 
Applicants must fill out an application and provide no more than six letters of reference to be considered for the position.
Applications are due Jan. 2, 2026 and packages can be emailed to the Department of Public Instruction at: dpipa@nd.gov, or mailed to: NDDPI at 600 E. Boulevard Ave., Dept. 201, Bismarck, ND, 58505.

(Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)HIGH POINT — Exploring showrooms and offerings at the High Point Market, I plopped down in a bean bag, amazed at how soft and luxurious it felt — a sharp contrast from the rocky ones of my elementary school days. 
Fibre by Auskin describes itself as a global company, sourcing alpaca fur from South America and wool from Tibetan lamb. The company says it has purchasing, manufacturing, design and sales teams in Australia, China and New Zealand. 
Like most wholesalers at the market, Fibre by Auskin is decidedly high-end. But even luxury goods like the bean bag are bearing the brunt of tariffs. Its manufacturer’s suggested retail price rose 37% this year, going from $1,320 to $1,814.

Other products by the same company saw even steeper markups — sales executive Erin Dowd said a pillow went from $71 to $101, a 42% increase. 
The company faced a 25% tariff on all inbound goods from China in 2018. Tariffs increased by an additional 30% in 2025, resulting in a total of 55%. 
“We managed to absorb as much of that as possible, but this year hit hard,” Dowd said. “I would say there’s not a day that goes by that somebody calls and they ask for a price and say, ‘Oh, that’s gone up.’”
Thousands of exhibitors gather in the Tar Heel State twice a year for the High Point Market, displaying the latest innovations in furniture, interior design and home furnishings. The showrooms welcome about 75,000 attendees representing more than 100 countries, according to the website. 
Tariffs specifically aimed at the furniture sector were front of mind at this fall’s market, which took place from Oct. 25 to 29. 
At the end of September, President Donald Trump announced “substantial” tariffs on imported furniture, a move he said would help manufacturers in North Carolina. 
The U.S. began charging a 10% tariff on foreign softwood lumber and timber, and a 25% tariff on kitchen cabinets, vanities and upholstered wooden furniture on Oct. 14, Trump announced in a Sept. 29 proclamation. The rates on cabinets will increase to 50% and upholstered furniture to 30% on Jan. 1.
“In order to make North Carolina, which has completely lost its furniture business to China, and other Countries, GREAT again, I will be imposing substantial Tariffs on any Country that does not make its furniture in the United States,” Trump wrote on Truth Social.
The market comes at a point of high political tension, with the federal government shutdown approaching a full month and a contentious U.S. Senate race brewing in the Tar Heel State.
The North Carolina Democratic Party put out a press release on Monday saying “Whatley-backed” tariffs could raise furniture costs. 
This refers to Michael Whatley, the former Republican National Committee chair who resigned from his position to launch a 2026 Senate bid against former Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. Whatley has voiced support for Trump’s tariff strategy.
In the furniture industry, tariffs are also limiting options for designers relying on foreign goods and manufacturing. 
Previously, producers at Union Home Furniture had a supply of backstock and could make pieces available for designers who wanted to experiment with new ideas. Now, the company has reduced its available stock and is sending products to fulfill orders as they come, according to Gauri Pal, a sales and operations manager.
“We’ve had to be conservative with production,” she said. 
Meanwhile, domestic manufacturers say they’re faring better under the tariffs.
Old Hickory Furniture produces rustic pieces that are featured in national parks. (Christine Zhu/NC Newsline)
Indiana-based Old Hickory Furniture produces rustic pieces that are featured in national parks. Its latest release, dubbed “The Lodge Collection,” features rugged wood detailing and gingham covers. 
Beau Parsons, the company’s president, estimates 90% or more of Old Hickory Furniture’s raw materials come from sources within the U.S. The hickory comes from either Tennessee or Mississippi, so prices haven’t changed much there.
But furniture manufacturers have felt the impact of tariffs on plywood, he said.
“Plywood has been difficult, but everything else, for the most part, has stayed pretty steady for us,” Parsons said. “Tariffs have been a great conversation starter for us, because we’re an American-made furniture company.”
It’s a similar case for Copeland Furniture, a family-owned business and the largest employer in Bradford, Vermont.
Most of the company’s raw materials are grown in the U.S., exclusively sourcing solid hardwoods that are grown and harvested in North America. 
Copeland Furniture only imports some components of their products — for example, textiles, glass centers and stone table tops.
With tariffs weighing more on brands relying heavily on imported goods, sales and marketing director Ben Copeland said he’s noticed more customers turning to Copeland Furniture. 
“We’ve gotten some interest from retailers that might not have come to us five years ago,” he said. “Consumers are more likely to say, ‘What’s the country of origin of this product?’ and they assume that if the origin is something imported, they’re paying a penalty, a tax. If they’re buying something that’s American, they’re getting full value for the dollar.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_4449-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-29 13:58:54.985853

(Photo by Pat Kinney)WATERLOO — Eight-year-old Shia Paige had a history lesson for his classmates from Waterloo’s Lincoln Elementary School during their Museum School visit to the Grout Museum two weeks ago.
On display on the museum’s lower level is a trunk that belonged to his great-grandfather, Jozef Maidan. Jozef and his wife, Sonia, had operated J&M Tailors in downtown Waterloo for many years.
Still emblazoned on the top and one end of the trunk in block letters are the words “JEWISH RESETTLEMENT SERVICE, WATERLOO IOWA USA.”
It’s the trunk in which Jozef Maidan had placed all his life’s remaining belongings when he came to Waterloo after World War II. He had just been reunited with his wife, Sonia — in a displaced persons camp in Germany.
The Maidans were Polish Jews — and survivors of the Holocaust, also known as The Final Solution — the genocide committed against the Jews in Europe by Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime. Jozef was sent to the Nazi death camps at Bergen-Belsen and Dachau; Sonia went to Auschwitz. Miraculously, both survived. Their children they had at the time weren’t as fortunate. Two young sons and more than 200 extended family members perished.
Their granddaughter, Erin Maidan Paige, Shia’s mom, grew up alongside her grandparents and, from an early age, heard stories about their ordeal — also absorbing the Jewish culture and faith. She is careful about sharing the full story with her children — Shia, 8, and Ezra, 6.
But Shia, like his mother, has taken an interest in history and is inquisitive — and he thinks it’s pretty cool his great-grandpa’s trunk is at the museum. And he can see a photo there of his great-

grandparents and his great-aunt Rifka, born in the displaced persons camp after the war. She lives in Florida.
Erin is measured in what she shares of Jozef’s and Sonia’s story. It is a story of courage and perseverance in the face of evil.
“I’ve been thinking more about what it means to pass down a beautiful legacy, but a legacy filled with so much trauma too, and how it’s not so simple to share with the boys at their current ages,” Erin said. “I do have to pick and choose what is shared, in an effort to not scare them, but to also specifically focus in on the triumph of survival, and the strength of the family they were born into, and the city that saved us – Waterloo.”
Her husband and the boys’ father, Chawne Paige, executive director of the Waterloo Center for the Arts, is a Black American and the son of a career Marine. His side of the family has its own history of resiliency in the face of racism.

”Add to it growing up in Iowa, our Jewish isolation here, and the current climate of rising antisemitism — how and when to share what, is half the battle. And their identity will take a lifetime of learning and understanding,” Erin said. “There’s no clear path, and I endeavor every day to honor my grandparents’ legacy, but it is truly one that must unfold over time, not in one conversation, but in many.”
The Jewish community in Waterloo, always small but vibrant and fairly prominent in the years after World War II, has dwindled considerably in recent decades as later generations have moved out of the area.
Jozef and Sonia raised three children in Waterloo. In addition to Rifka, Sonia’s father, Henry, is a retired Cedar Falls financial planner and her uncle Rubin is a cardiologist in Seattle. Rifka, a pre-needs funeral counselor, has been active in the USC Shoah Foundation, founded by movie director Steven Spielberg in 1994 and dedicated to documenting accounts of the Holocaust. Jozef died in 1993 and Sonia then lived with Rifka until Sonia’s passing in 2009.
The journey of Erin’s grandparents’ trunk is a story in itself.
It came back to the family’s possession in 2012 after having passed through a couple of different owners when Erin’s grandparents’ Waterloo clothing store was sold in 1974.
The trunk held all of Jozef and Sonia’s worldly possessions when they emigrated from Europe to America and Waterloo in 1949 after World War II. They had $18 in cash. They were sponsored by Sons of Jacob Synagogue in Waterloo — where, decades later, Erin would be a lay leader. After graduating from Waterloo West High School in 1999, she attended Brandeis University in Massachusetts and continued her studies in Europe, including a trip to Auschwitz — where she saw her grandmother’s bunk in the camp.
The trunk was secured and returned to Erin and her family by Bob Neymeyer, a state-renowned historian for the Grout Museum District, and Francesca Soans, a communication arts professor at the University of Northern Iowa. They were working independently of the Grout and UNI on a history of the Waterloo synagogue and its congregation.

Neymeyer heard the story of the trunk from Erin when she worked at the Grout as an intern.
He and Soans learned that local history buff Orrin Miller had bought the Maidans’ trunk years earlier from the party who had purchased their store. Miller preserved it for years, until approached by Neymeyer and Soans. Soans purchased the trunk and she and Neymeyer gave it to the Maidans, who in turn provided it to the Grout for display.
In addition to the three children they raised after liberation, Jozef and Sonia’s family tree consists of three grandchildren, including Erin, and seven great-grandchildren. It’s not as large a family tree as it could have been but for the Holocaust, but the tree continued, nonetheless.
The tragedy is the family that could have been. The triumph is the family that endures. Erin agrees it’s a bittersweet but profound and proud legacy.

Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) led legislation to fund SNAP, which he and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Klobuchar (D-Minn.) introduced in a news conference in Washington, D.C. on Oct. 29, 2025. (Screenshot)U.S. Senate Democrats on Wednesday introduced the Keep SNAP and WIC Funded Act of 2025, legislation aimed at curtailing the pending Nov. 1 stop for federal food assistance. New Mexico U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján, the ranking member for a Senate Agriculture Committee subcommittee, led the legislation, which is co-sponsored by all the Democratic members.
The United States Department of Agriculture informed states earlier this month that funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would be unavailable starting Nov. 1. as a result of the ongoing federal shutdown. More recently, it rejected calls by members of Congress—including New Mexico’s representatives—to use contingency funding to make up the gap. That position represents a reversal from an earlier stance, according to a since-deleted copy of the USDA’s Sept. 30 shutdown plan. Moreover, it told states they would not be reimbursed if they tried to fund SNAP.
New Mexico has the highest rate of SNAP participation in the country, with approximately 460,000 recipients—over 21% of the population. The U.S. Senate bill directs USDA to release funds for SNAP and to its supplementary program for Women, Children and Infants, and also requires the federal government to reimburse states for covering SNAP benefits during a shutdown.
In a news conference Wednesday, Luján joined Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota to discuss the legislation—and call out the Trump administration for threatening a program on which 42 million U.S. residents rely for food.
“Trump and Senate Republicans are the first in history to make the cruel and unprecedented decision to let tens of millions of Americans go hungry,” Schumer said in a statement. “This pain doesn’t need to happen: Trump is choosing to inflict it on American families.”
Luján, in a fiery speech, described Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.)’s statement earlier this week that SNAP can’t be legally funded as “bulls***. I come from a small farm. I know the difference of good soil and the bulls*** that goes in it. And this is the bulls*** taking these plans down to try to lie to the American people and justify why it’s OK for people to go hungry. Forty million people, plain and simple, 40 million people that are going to miss a meal in the United States of America.”
He also invoked the late former New Mexico Gov. Bruce King, a cattle rancher.
“He always used to tell folks, ‘If you can’t come up with the solution, sometimes you need to lock them up in a barn until they come up with a solution.’ Well, Mr. President, come back from jetting around the world, get back to the White House.”
New Mexico’s three U.S. House of Representatives members this week also introduced a bill to keep funding in place for food assistance, and avoid gaps in funding in future shutdowns.
U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury, who represents New Mexico’s 1st congressional district, told reporters in a call on Tuesday that she, along with U.S. Reps. Teresa Leger Fernández and Gabe Vasquez, of the state’s 1st and 2nd congressional districts, respectively, introduced the SNAP BACK Act  during the brief “gavel in” for the U.S. House, which has been otherwise shut down. She acknowledged that the legislation is “not likely to pass” as the House is not in session, but said, “It’s our hope that by filing additional legislation, this will put continued bipartisan pressure on both sides of the aisle to get something done, because we cannot allow families to go without food.”
The bill, among other facets, also would require the “immediate release” of funds for SNAP and WIC; prohibit withholding funds “for political or administrative reasons”; and guarantee continued enrollment and access to benefits during a shutdown.
“We are using Congress, the courts and our communities to push back every single possible way that we can,” Stansbury said, noting the lawsuit filed by more than 20 attorneys general—including New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez—along with the state of New Mexico’s forthcoming plans to provide additional funding to food banks, which Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and other state leader are scheduled to discuss Wednesday afternoon.
“This is, in many, many ways, very similar to the food emergency that we faced at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020,” Stansbury said. “This is an all hands-on-deck food emergency for New Mexico families. So we are working at the federal level, the state level, working with tribes. We’re working in our communities, and we will find a way to get New Mexico families food assistance, but it’s going to take all of us.”

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Salt Lake County health officials announced on Wednesday that they have identified what is likely the county’s first case of measles amid an ongoing national outbreak. 
The Salt Lake County Health Department said in a news release it was alerted to the “probable” case late Monday and spent Tuesday “attempting to contact the patient to conduct a disease investigation.”

“The patient has declined to be tested, or to fully participate in our disease investigation, so we will not be able to technically confirm the illness or properly do contact tracing to warn anyone with whom the patient may have had contact,” Salt Lake County Health Department executive director Dorothy Adams said in a prepared statement. 
“But based on the specific symptoms reported by the healthcare provider and the limited conversation our investigators have had with the patient, this is very likely a case of measles in someone living in Salt Lake County,” she said. 
Health officials urged Utahns to “please speak” with public health workers if they contact you and “provide the information they’re seeking so they can properly investigate the situation and hopefully prevent further illness in our community.”
“Information we get during illness interviews is completely confidential, and we do not share it with anyone — including federal, state, or other local government agencies,” Adams said. “We collect the information only to investigate the source of illness and attempt to prevent further spread.”

To confirm a public health worker’s legitimacy, health officials said to check if their emails come from a .gov address, such as @SaltLakeCounty.gov. If contacted by phone, you can ask the worker to send an email from their verified .gov email address, the department said. 
“They may also call a publicly listed phone number for their state or local health department (385-468-4100 for SLCoHD) and ask to be transferred to the investigator who called them,” health officials said.
Salt Lake County officials emphasized that measles is one of the most contagious viruses known. 
“It is so easily spread that people who are not immune have a 90% chance of getting the disease if they are near an infected person,” the department said. “Someone with measles can spread it to others even before they know they are ill, and the virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person has left the area.” 
The best protection against the virus is vaccination — specifically, two doses of a measles-containing virus, the most common of which is the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine. Two doses can prevent more than 97% of measles infections, according to health experts. 
In the remaining 3%, when a fully vaccinated person becomes infected with measles, symptoms are “milder, the illness is shorter and the infected person is less likely to spread the disease to others,” health officials said. 
Unvaccinated people — including children too young to be vaccinated — are more likely to experience severe complications from a measles infection. 
Symptoms usually start seven to 14 days after infection. They include fever, cough, runny nose, and red or watery eyes. Tiny white spots typically appear inside the mouth two to three days after symptoms begin. Three to five days after the first symptoms, a rash appears. The rash usually begins as flat, red spots at the hairline or on the face, which then spread down the body.
Many people infected with measles will experience mild symptoms, but about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people need to be hospitalized, according to health officials. Young children, pregnant women and people who have weakened immune systems are more likely to have serious problems from measles.  
Salt Lake County health officials listed the following vaccine recommendations, which vary depending on age and vaccination history: 

Children should receive two doses of measles vaccine: one dose at 12 to 15 months of age and another at 4 to 6 years. 
Adults born before 1957 generally do not need to be vaccinated because they are likely already immune to measles due to widespread infection and illness before the measles vaccine became available in 1963. 
Adults who were vaccinated before 1968 should have a second dose because the vaccine used from 1963 to1967 was less effective than the current vaccine, which became available in 1968. 
Adults who were vaccinated in 1968 or later are considered fully protected whether they have one or two doses, though certain higher risk groups (like college students, health care workers and international travelers) should have two doses.

To learn whether you or your child needs a dose of measles vaccine, health officials urge Utahns to talk to their doctors or check their immunization records. Most Utahns’ records are available through the secure Docket app or website. 
“If you’re unsure about your vaccination status and don’t have record of having received an MMR, there is no harm in getting an additional dose now,” county officials said. “ The MMR vaccine is widely available at local pharmacies, doctor’s offices or SLCoHD immunization clinics; call 385-468-SHOT to schedule a vaccination appointment at a health department clinic.”
If you suspect you may have measles or learn you have been near someone with measles, health officials urge that you contact your health care provider immediately.  
“Tell them about your measles concern so they can make special arrangements to see you without putting other people at risk,” the health department said.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)LAWRENCE — The Lawrence public school district switched digital surveillance software vendors for the new school year while facing litigation that accuses school officials of unconstitutional spying on students, including high school journalists.
The district on Monday asked a federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit brought by current and former students in part because it stopped using Gaggle, a surveillance program the district deployed in November 2023. But the district failed to disclose to the court that it is now monitoring students with ManagedMethods, which offers the same kind of surveillance of student devices, files, emails and online accounts.
Companies such as Gaggle and ManagedMethods enjoy lucrative contracts from school districts that buy into their promise of ensuring student safety by using artificial intelligence to warn school leaders of potential self-harm and concerning behavior. But academic research questions how effective the software is while raising concerns that such excessive surveillance may actually harm students’ learning, social development and mental health.
Student journalists at Lawrence High School identified numerous flaws in the Gaggle software, from a failure to detect test messages about self-harm to falsely flagging artwork as child pornography.
The software allowed school leaders to monitor the journalists’ work before it was published, an unlawful practice known as “prior restraint,” and some of the students’ files disappeared without warning. The district told student journalists in April 2024 they would be exempted from the surveillance, but the district continued to monitor them anyway.
Nine current and former students sued the school district, school board and assistant principal Greg Farley in August, alleging unconstitutional searches and seizures and First Amendment violations.
The lawsuit challenges the school district’s “decision and policy to subject all students to round-the-clock digital surveillance — scanning their files, flagging their speech, and removing their creative work from access, often without any notice, suspicion of suspected wrongdoing, or meaningful recourse,” according to the complaint filed in federal court. The surveillance extended to students’ personal phones and computers.
The complaint said school leaders had conducted “suspicionless searches and seizures of student expression on a scale and scope that no court has ever upheld — and that the Constitution does not permit.”
The district, which is represented by Wichita attorney Alan Rupe, argued in Monday’s court filings that the the claims are all moot because the district no longer uses Gaggle. Superintendent Jeanice Kerr Swift filed an affidavit with the court that says the contract with Gaggle expired during the summer and has not been renewed, and that the district “has stopped using Gaggle to monitor students.”
None of the court filings mention that the school is still monitoring students through a different software vendor.
In response to Kansas Reflector questions, the superintendent said the district switched vendors in a cost-saving move.
“In the regular course of business this fall, as part of the continuing effort to evaluate and streamline contracts with vendors and identify cost savings, the district implemented Managed Methods, a proficient tool that continues to monitor for student safety,” Kerr Swift said in an emailed statement.
The school agreed to pay Gaggle $53,000 under a contract for the 2024-25 school year. The superintendent said ManagedMethods will save the district about $35,000 this year. She didn’t respond to a follow-up question about how the two programs compare.
Attorneys for the plaintiffs didn’t respond to Kansas Reflector inquiries.
Research published in July in the Journal of Medical Internet Research and by the National Institutes of Health examined surveillance products from 17 companies, including Gaggle and ManagedMethods, and raised concerns about the use of the software in schools.
Alison O’Daffer, a Ph.D. student at University of California San Diego, Wendy Liu, an associate professor of marketing at the university, and Cinnamon Bloss, director of the Center for Empathy and Technology at the university, produced the study. The authors found “a notable lack of transparency” about how the programs work, and questioned whether they were effective in preventing violence. They also pointed to the potential harm the programs could have on students.
“Excessive surveillance may lead to a loss of students’ intimate privacy which can impede their learning, social development, and mental health,” the authors wrote in their summary. “Sharing of student data with outside companies also exposes such data to wider cybersecurity attacks. The sensitivity of the topic area, an opaque market, a lack of empirical assessment of effectiveness, and the growing prowess of data extraction and analysis are concerning.
“These factors, taken together with trade-offs of decreased privacy and increased cybersecurity risks, suggest that the school-based online surveillance industry may require more oversight from regulators, greater monitoring from the public, and more thorough risk assessment.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/P4191034-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-29 13:58:54.985853

Farmers are dreading Nov. 1, they said.","Evelyn Schiller stands behind produce at the Downtown Growers’ Market in Albuquerque on Oct. 24, 2025. The expected SNAP halt on Nov. 1, 2025 will leave the farm without a major revenue stream and low-income families with less access to nutritious food, Schiller said. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)New Mexico farmers and the manager of the state’s biggest farmers’ market say they are dreading the market this Saturday morning, which will coincide with an expected halt to a food assistance program on which approximately 460,000 New Mexicans rely. 
Farmers’ markets across the state are popular with Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients, because many vendors accept SNAP and also participate in SNAP “Double Up Food Bucks.” That program allows SNAP recipients to double their SNAP dollars so long as they buy fresh fruits, vegetables and plant starters. The program aims to spur healthy eating, particularly among low-income families, while also helping local farmers.
About one-third of the roughly 4,000 attendees each week at the Downtown Growers’ Market in Albuquerque use SNAP, Market Director LeVar Eady told Source New Mexico in an interview Tuesday. 
He says farmers who accept SNAP also receive up to one-third of their revenue from SNAP, thanks to the “Double Up” program and regular SNAP. Losing all that revenue at once at the end of the season could be “devastating” for farmers, while also meaning families have less access to food, not to mention healthy food. 
Hunger Pangs: New Mexico farmers worry about forthcoming SNAP cuts

Saturday morning, Nov. 1, marks the second-to-last market of the season in Albuquerque. That’s also the day the United States Agriculture Department slated  SNAP benefits to stop due to the ongoing government shutdown. 
As a result, roughly $90 million in SNAP benefits won’t flow to New Mexico, which has the highest rate of SNAP reliance in the country.
“It’s going to sound alarmist,” Eady said. “But I just see it as a reality:When people don’t have access to food, people are hungry. There’s already information indicating that there’s not gonna be enough food at the food banks to sustain the number of people that are on SNAP.”
Much remains uncertain about how the market will fare Saturday, he said, including how many people will show up and whether the state will find a stop-gap solution or the federal government will come to an agreement.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is expected to detail the state’s plan to counteract the stoppage in a news conference Wednesday afternoon. Whether the state can put its own funds on SNAP recipients’ Electronic Balance Transfer cards remains to be seen. Barring that, food bank leaders have said they are gearing up to meet an expected huge increase in demand, though they warn they don’t have anywhere near the capacity to feed all current SNAP recipients.
NM food banks say they have no time to prepare for Nov. 1 SNAP stoppage 

And even if the federal government were to agree to fund SNAP, effective immediately, state officials have said there will likely be a delay in getting the system back up and running. That’s because the USDA’s Oct. 10 order ordered states not to send recipient data to SNAP vendors, including farmers’ markets. 
All of that uncertainty swirled around farmer Evelyn Schiller’s operation at the market Oct. 24. Chispa’s Farm, where Schiller works, received about 40% of its revenue from “Double Up” bucks the previous week, which Schiller said is typical. 
SNAP has been a key part of keeping farms like theirs profitable, they said, both at farmers’ markets and in selling produce wholesale to grocery stores. The farm in Albuquerque’s South Valley is doing its best to survive amid drought, inflation and other factors.
“It’s a hard job to make sustainable, being a small farm in America, in the desert, in the southwest, in Albuquerque,” they said. “Every [bad] thing that happens makes it harder. Every extra hot year, every cut to SNAP.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_1267-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-29 13:58:54.985853

Together, we surveyed more than 5,000 residents across Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee. 
Across people in the Deep South, about half said they still turn to local television, newspapers or regional websites for political and civic information, almost as many as those who rely on national broadcasts. Social media was just as common, with roughly 55% using platforms like Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram to keep up. Around 1 in 5 listen to podcasts or talk radio, and many said they also learn about current events from friends, family or people they follow online.
In a world where national headlines dominate feeds, this mix of sources reveals something important: People in the South still look for news that feels close, familiar and relevant to their lives. 
The Story is Local
When asked to name a story that had recently caught their attention, 1 in 4 people pointed to something local — a shooting in town, a new policy in Baton Rouge, a school event in Memphis, or a community initiative nearby. That’s a couple points higher (+2.6pp) than in other parts of the country (the range across all 50 states was 12% to 29% local story recall). About 14% of stories were multiclassified because they spanned levels of geography (e.g. “I saw a news story covering Trump and China suspending tariffs for 90 days that caught my attention.”).
Certain patterns stand out. Women were significantly more likely than men to remember local stories (+11pp). Younger adults were far more attuned to community happenings than older residents (+9pp). Urban dwellers remembered more than suburban or rural ones (+7-8pp). Black Southerners remembered more than white Southerners (+5pp). People without college degrees (+7pp), and parents with children at home (+5pp), were also more likely to recall a local event.
Most of those local stories, however, focused on violence or tragedy. Nearly six in 10 covered crime, four in 10 addressed violence, and one in 10 involved both. By contrast, only about one in 10 mentioned government, policy, or civic action. In the Deep South, people remember what they feel and often, what they feel most sharply are the moments of loss.
Local news REALLY matters 
At the same time, local story recall was stronger in Mississippi (25%) and Louisiana (24%) where local outlets like Mississippi Today, Verite News and The Current continue to invest in community-based reporting. It was similarly solid in Arkansas (26%). On the other hand, in Alabama and Tennessee, recall lagged behind (20% and 21%, respectively). 
Access to credible local information is critical because people who regularly consume local news are more than 13 percentage points more likely to say they feel informed about social and political issues in their community.
Why does that matter? Because access to information doesn’t just shape what people know. It shapes what they do. Among those who feel knowledgeable about local life, roughly two-thirds say they vote in every local election (66%). Among those who do not feel informed, the number drops by half (35%).
Final thoughts
This partnership between Deep South Today and Murmuration began as a simple idea: to bridge real-time data with local storytelling and see what we might learn about civic life in a part of the country often written about, but rarely written with.
What we found is that local news still carries real power — not because it’s nostalgic or small, but because it’s near. It is the heartbeat of trust and participation. It shapes whether people feel seen, whether they show up, and whether they believe what happens next is still up to them.
We uncovered so much, yet the deeper questions are still unfolding:

How do we rebuild local information networks so that everyone can see what’s happening in their own backyard?
What would it look like to invest in stories that strengthen belonging, not just break news?
How can researchers and journalists work together to make local truth-telling more visible, more trusted, and more lasting?

If democracy begins with knowing your neighbors, then the future of civic life may depend on something easier said than done: keeping the story close to home.
Thank you to Murmuration!

The crux of the new effort will rely on the state’s Mass Save program, which funds energy efficiency upgrades around the state through ratepayer charges.","BOSTON IS ENTERING the energy affordability buzzsaw. 
With winter rate hike requests pending before state regulators, federal cuts to energy efficiency incentives and belt-tightening at the state level, Boston is launching a new program to install thousands of heat pumps and provide free individual consultations to help lower gas and electric bills.  
Boston’s push to deliver 5,000 heat pumps and 10,000 building upgrades to weatherize against fluctuating temperatures by 2027, in addition to the consultations offered in six languages, comes amid a larger effort by Gov. Maura Healey to reduce utility bills through a legislative package currently sitting on Beacon Hill.  
“This program is very much designed to meet the moment that we’re in,” said Oliver Sellers-Garcia, Boston’s Green New Deal director and environment commissioner, “which is concern about energy costs… [and] a real recognition that we have housing affordability issues to deal with.” 
Boston’s new “energy saver program” is targeting buildings heated by expensive and inefficient sources like oil. Officials are hoping the program produces $300 million in benefits for city residents, including rebates of up to $10,000 for a heat pump installation and an average savings of $380 per year for residents heating with oil who weatherize their building.  
But cuts at the state level mean the city’s initiative will be operating in a more financially constrained environment. The crux of the new effort will rely on the state’s Mass Save program, which funds energy efficiency upgrades around the state through ratepayer charges. 
The Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities cut Mass Save’s budget earlier this year to $4.5 billion, a $500 million reduction, amid uproar over spiking utility bills last winter. The most tangible outcome of that cut: a smaller budget for heat pump installations and weatherizations. 
Boston officials insist that this new effort is rolling out with that context in mind. The goals, which include a $150 million investment in the city through Mass Save over the three-year period, stem from a memorandum of understanding signed between the city, Eversource, and National Grid right around the time the Mass Save cuts were made.  
Eversource and National Grid didn’t respond to a request for comment about whether the goals are achievable given the tighter Mass Save budget. DPU also didn’t respond to a request for comment about Boston’s push to target a certain pool of money from Mass Save.  
The financial commitment is about making sure that Bostonians earn a return on their investments into Mass Save, according to a program official who was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue – a larger structural issue with the program that has come under scrutiny.  
The city has negotiated with the two utilities to offer “enhanced incentives” for residents across many of Boston’s neighborhoods, including Allston, Brighton, Dorchester, Roxbury, East Boston, and others, which include free weatherizations and potentially free heat pump conversions, too. Those are “the most energy-burdened neighborhoods in Boston, and they will appreciate, thus, the biggest benefit from improving their building stock,” said Brian Swett, Boston’s chief climate officer. 
State Auditor Diana DiZoglio released a report on Mass Save last month that found that as a community’s population density and the proportion of renters increase, benefits from the Mass Save program typically decrease.  
Denser urban municipalities with more renters, like Boston, “were consistently found to contribute more to the program even when they ultimately do not get much back, if anything, from the program,” the report found. 
“This is proportional to what should be going back into Boston, given our population and the need that’s here,” said Sellers-Garcia. “I do want to send the message to all communities that are served by Mass Save in Massachusetts: Boston is not stealing your incentive dollars. We’re just making a commitment for the first time with the administrators of the program, the utilities, that we’re going to know how much should go to Boston, and we’re going to really shoot for that target.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_4510-scaled.jpeg?fit=1024%2C768&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-29 13:03:15.623502

Oct. 29. | Photo by Katherine Dailey/Michigan AdvanceThe Michigan Senate Education Committee considered how best to inform the state’s students and their parents about the risks and harms of high-potency THC and cannabis products, as well as vaping, in a hearing on Tuesday. 
The bill in question, SB 433, was put forward by Sen. Dayna Polehanki (D-Livonia), who chairs the committee. In the hearing, she compared her bill to legislation signed earlier this year that created and allowed for the distribution of a flyer on the safe storage of guns to be distributed in schools and sent to parents. 
“This bill isn’t about adding another burden to our schools. It’s about giving them the proper tools. It’s about prevention, not punishment, education, not enforcement,” Polehanki said.
Olivia Ponte, a legislative liaison for the Michigan Department of Education, agreed with that characterization. 
“The new requirement in this bill is small and would simply require an informational notice for schools to send to parents and guardians,” she said. “However, providing the information could make a significant impact on the well being and safety of Michigan children.”
One difficult element of that prevention, according to Gabrielle Green, a prevention specialist with the Barry County Substance Abuse Task Force, is that students often start vaping at a young age and become addicted.
“I get calls every single day about students who have been vaping since elementary school, fourth grade, fifth grade, who are showing signs of dependence to nicotine,” Green said. “At this point, they are years into a tobacco dependency, and we as adults recognize that a person quitting smoking is one of the hardest things they will ever do in their lives, and students and youth are left in the lurch.”
And for non-nicotine issues, Green added, “Almost 100% of the time in the past five years, it has been a THC-related offense.”
One program that Green has worked on is a restorative program where, if students are suspended for nicotine or drug-related issues, they are able to get some of that suspension time back if they meet with her to learn about the health impacts of the substances. 
Some members of the committee questioned how to best use the resources in the bill to effectively get the message across to young people — and whether flyers were the right method. SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“It might be worth exploring other ways, should this pass, to also provide that messaging,” said Sen. Erika Geiss (D-Taylor). “I know that, as a parent, when my kids were in middle school, this would have been left in the ‘this goes home’ folder and would have been forgotten to be given to me.” 
She proposed billboards as a potential supplement to the flyers, which Polehanki agreed with but suggested might be a separate piece of legislation to put forward. 
“I think that one of the biggest problems is peer pressure and impulsivity and lack of knowledge and wisdom,” said. Sen. Ruth Johnson (R-Groveland Twp.). “It’s a tough, tough group to get to.”
Ava Dietz and Joslynn Wynsma, both juniors at Reeths-Puffer High School in Muskegon County, presented to the committee on how they work to spread awareness within their county and district. They present to middle school students around the district, which Polehanki noted could be an effective way to share the information — having older students act as role models. 
Less than 54% of students in Muskegon County know what is in a vape when they use it, Wynsma said. But about 40% of students said it was very easy to get a vape, Dietz noted. 
Polehanki noted that the information was more needed due to higher potency of THC in many products, as well as “marketing in ways that downplay risk, often resembling candy or common household items.” 
Sen. Jeff Irwin (D-Ann Arbor) pushed back on elements of that, noting, “the Cannabis Regulatory Agency has the authority and has been pretty aggressive with prohibiting any licensed cannabis operations from producing any candy that looks like or resembles any commercially available candy.” 
“In fact, the rules even prevent them from having shapes or pictures on the packaging,” he continued. “They’re certainly not allowed to mimic commercially available candy.”
The committee voted to include a substitute on the bill to add details on how to recognize signs of THC poisoning and proper steps to take. However, they did not vote on the overall bill, instead indicating they would likely do that next week.

TOPEKA — Los arándanos sin recolectar que caen de las plantas en Nueva Jersey, los cultivos secándose en los campos de Carolina del Norte y las explotaciones ganaderas rurales con poco personal en Kansas son cada vez más habituales, y los alimentos en Estados Unidos se están desperdiciando, según agricultores y profesionales del sector agrícola.
Esto se debe en gran parte a una crisis de escasez de mano de obra, dijeron durante una rueda de prensa celebrada el jueves y organizada por una coalición llamada Grow It Here, que reunió los temas de inmigración, gobierno y agricultura.
“Para mí está claro que podemos importar trabajadores o importar alimentos, y esa es una cuestión clave, un tema fundamental que debemos tratar”, dijo Matt Teagarden, director ejecutivo de la Asociación Ganadera de Kansas, que representa a unos 5,000 miembros involucrados en la multimillonaria industria ganadera de Kansas.
Agricultores de Carolina del Norte, Wisconsin, California y Nueva Jersey también se pronunciaron, expresando su frustración ante las dificultades laborales y describiendo su dependencia del programa federal de visas para trabajadores temporales, que puede servir como solución temporal a problemas mayores. El programa suele presentarse como un ganar-ganar tanto para empleadores como para trabajadores, pero no siempre es así.
Brandon Batten, de Triple B Farms en Four Oaks, Carolina del Norte, comentó que su granja comenzó a utilizar el programa de visas H-2A del gobierno federal hace aproximadamente un año. Este programa permite a los empleadores que cumplen con ciertos requisitos contratar trabajadores extranjeros para empleos temporales, ofreciéndoles un salario base y alojamiento. Sin embargo, los cambios recientes al programa aumentaron las tarifas de solicitud y procesamiento, y eliminaron protecciones para los trabajadores.
Según Batten, la mano de obra ha sido su mayor desafío, y aunque el programa H2A proporciona una red de seguridad, no siempre es eficiente.
“Por muy caro y engorroso que sea el programa, es más caro sembrar un cultivo y no cosecharlo”, dijo.
Las explotaciones ganaderas a menudo no pueden acogerse al programa de visados. Dado que estos empleos no son estacionales, Teagarden explicó que los empresarios rurales de Kansas están intentando adoptar un enfoque integral, reclutando personal local, visitando en ocasiones institutos para fomentar carreras profesionales gratificantes en la agricultura y tratando de retener a los trabajadores actuales.
John Rosenow es dueño de una granja lechera con 700 vacas en el oeste de Wisconsin que emplea a 18 personas. Trece de ellas son de México, según indicó. Sin embargo, no puede acogerse al programa H-2A.
“La industria láctea lleva años solicitando al Congreso y al gobierno federal que modernice el sistema de inmigración, ya que está específicamente excluida de la contratación de empleados con visa H-2A”, afirmó. “Nosotros dependemos de los inmigrantes”.
Dijo que el 90% de los productos lácteos obtenidos de las vacas de Wisconsin son producidos por inmigrantes.
Brandon Raso, agricultor de arándanos de cuarta generación en Nueva Jersey, comenzó a utilizar el programa H-2A hace más de una década.
“A pesar de las dificultades logísticas y los costos, ha sido un programa que nos ha ayudado a mantenernos a flote”, dijo Raso. “Pero debo admitir que, debido al aumento de los costos y las crecientes dificultades que ha presentado el programa, hemos reducido drásticamente el número de trabajadores que empleamos a través de él”.
La granja solía tener 250 trabajadores a través del programa H-2A para paliar la escasez de mano de obra local, explicó Raso. Esta temporada, la granja contó con solo 30 trabajadores.
Históricamente, los agricultores de Nueva Jersey podían producir alrededor de 60 millones de libras de arándanos por temporada, lo que equivaldría a unos 140 millones de dólares, según Raso. Este año, la producción fue de aproximadamente 36 millones de libras. Raso atribuye la principal causa de esta disminución a la escasez de mano de obra.
“Lo sé por experiencia propia: nosotros dejamos caer al suelo cerca de dos millones de libras de fruta de las plantas en nuestra granja porque simplemente no había nadie que la recogiera”, dijo.
Según Zach Rutledge, profesor y economista de la Universidad Estatal de Michigan, aproximadamente el 70% de los trabajadores agrícolas en Estados Unidos son extranjeros. La mayoría de estos trabajadores provienen de México, y cerca del 41% no tienen autorización para trabajar en Estados Unidos.
Según Rutledge, aproximadamente la mitad de los agricultores afirma no contar con la mano de obra necesaria y estiman que les falta el 21% de los trabajadores requeridos. Él añadió que la reducción de mano de obra conlleva una disminución de la producción y de los ingresos agrícolas. Las tendencias actuales podrían generar pérdidas de miles de millones de dólares, un aumento en los precios de los alimentos y una mayor dependencia de las importaciones.
También dijo que si la aplicación de la ley de inmigración se centra en la agricultura, “podrían surgir graves problemas”.
“Entre ellos, los efectos directos de las detenciones y deportaciones de trabajadores agrícolas y lo que llamamos efectos disuasorios, que se producen cuando los trabajadores se asustan al oír hablar de la aplicación de las leyes de inmigración y no van a trabajar por miedo a ser deportados”, dijo Rutledge.
Los empleadores se enfrentan a cargas significativas bajo el programa federal H-2A.
Los empleados también.
“Además del aumento de la aplicación de las leyes de inmigración, que ya está exacerbando un efecto disuasorio entre los trabajadores que sufren abusos, desde el inicio de la administración Trump hemos visto esfuerzos sostenidos para desmantelar las protecciones laborales que tanto nos ha costado conseguir”, dijo Jimena de Haro del Centro de los Derechos del Migrante, una organización binacional de derechos de los trabajadores.
La administración Trump ha revertido las protecciones de la era Biden para los trabajadores bajo las reglas H-2A y ha propuesto recortes salariales de al menos 17,290 millones de dólares para los trabajadores H-2A durante 10 años.
Las deportaciones llevadas a cabo por la administración y sus esfuerzos por despojar a las personas en Estados Unidos de su estatus migratorio y de autorización de trabajo exacerban la escasez de mano de obra, dijo De Haro.
“En respuesta, estamos viendo cómo los productores y los legisladores proponen ‘soluciones parche’ para aumentar el número de trabajadores disponibles —centrándose principalmente en la expansión de los programas de trabajadores temporales— sin tener en cuenta el bienestar ni los derechos de los trabajadores”, dijo de Haro.
Según ella, entre las propuestas recientes, también mencionadas en la convocatoria “Grow It Here”, se incluyen iniciativas para que el programa H-2A sea permanente y esté disponible para otras industrias.
“Pero en un programa plagado de abusos, su expansión solo provocaría más abusos y explotación de los trabajadores agrícolas migrantes, especialmente cuando los llamados a la expansión van acompañados de la eliminación de importantes protecciones para los trabajadores”, dijo ella.
Un informe de Centro titulado “Ripe for Reform” y una investigación de septiembre realizada por ProPublica demostraron que el programa H-2A es propenso al abuso y la explotación de los trabajadores.
Kristi Boswell, exasesora laboral agrícola durante la primera administración Trump y asesora de Grow It Here, dijo que la campaña fue creada para educar a los legisladores y al público sobre las dificultades de la escasez de mano de obra y las repercusiones que se derivan de ella.
El grupo utilizó la palabra “crisis” varias veces.
“Llevo quince años trabajando en este tema”, dijo Boswell. “Las situaciones y las circunstancias han empeorado. Los costos laborales han aumentado. Hemos visto un déficit comercial en cultivos especializados, frutas y hortalizas. Yo creo que seguirá aumentando”.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cattle-feedlot-scaled-edit-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-29 13:03:15.623502

As a result of the executed search warrants at the Capitol and Midwest City residence, agents recovered items including five laptops, four flash drives, one hard drive, three iPhones, banking and financial documents, two iPads, and U-Haul keys. 
Pittman did not immediately return a request for comment. She has not been charged with a crime.
Pittman’s investigation follows a settlement agreement with the state Ethics Commission. In 2024 she agreed to pay the Ethics Commission $35,000 for using campaign funds for personal use and improperly maintaining campaign records in 2020 and 2022, according to the settlement agreement. 
Pittman failed to make payments toward the settlement on time, according to a filing in a civil lawsuit the Commission filed against her. And the Ethics Commission alleged she submitted false checks totalling $7,500 as proof of payment, according to the filing. The Commission also suspected her mother had forged a letter from a landlord about flooding at her campaign office destroying records. 
An agent from the Attorney General’s Office was first assigned June 26 to investigate Pittman’s 2024 campaign account after the Ethics Commission contacted the office, according to the search warrant affidavit. 
The House Democratic Caucus voted to suspend Pittman’s caucus membership and recommended her temporary removal from House committees, pending developments in the investigation. A spokesperson for Minority Leader Cyndi Munson said Wednesday she had no further comment at this time. 
House Speaker Kyle Hilbert stripped Pittman of her committee memberships Friday. A spokesperson for Hilbert did not immediately return a request for comment.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)With Election Day approaching next week, I’ve been reflecting on women’s representation in political leadership. According to the annual Best & Worst States for Women’s Equality report, Utah made notable progress in 2025 in the category of Political Empowerment. The state ranked 28th out of 50 — up from 42nd in 2022, 49th in 2023, and 41st in 2024.
This improvement is largely due to gains in the “Disparity in Share of State-Elected Executives” metric. Tina Cannon now serves as state auditor alongside Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, meaning women hold two of Utah’s five statewide executive positions. Additionally, Celeste Maloy’s election to the U.S. House of Representatives has helped narrow the gender gap in Utah’s congressional delegation, contributing to a stronger showing in the “Disparity in Share of Lawmakers” metric.
Yet, in 2025, RepresentWomen’s 2025 Gender Parity Index (GPI) assigned Utah a “D” according to what it stated as its “proximity to parity in political offices.” GPI was launched in 2013 to help researchers and advocates track progress toward “gender-balanced governance.” Through the years, I’ve had several people ask me why it is so important to pay such close attention to the gender balance in political roles. In fact, one individual stated: “We just need good people to serve. It doesn’t really matter whether they are men or women.” Let me be clear: It does matter!
The published research on this topic has exploded the last few decades, and the results are clear. Decision-making is better and more representative of the views of all Utahs when there are more equal numbers of men and women on teams, committees, boards, commissions, councils, legislatures, and basically any decision-making body. In fact, business and political research has found that more gender-balanced governance leads to increased innovation, improved creativity, better team decision-making, greater team problem solving, better team performance on highly complex tasks, increased knowledge formation, and higher social sensitivity and collective intelligence, to name a few.
So how is Utah doing according to the RepresentWomen GPI? Although Utah received a “D,” we are not the worst! In fact, our state ranking on this index is 32nd this year. According to the report, “Utah received its first ‘D’ grade in 2021. Prior to 2021, it consistently received an ‘F’ grade, with the except of 2015.” Of 100 points available, here are the details for Utah:

S. Congress (3.3 of 30 points): In 2025, only one of Utah’s four representatives in the U.S. House is a woman: Rep. Celeste Maloy (Republican, serving since 2023). Former Rep. Mia Love (Republican, 2015–2018) made history as both the first Black Republican woman and the first Haitian-American woman elected to the U.S. Congress. To date, Utah has never elected a woman to serve in the U.S. Senate.
Statewide Executive (5.0 of 30 points): Of Utah’s five statewide elected executive offices, two are currently held by women. As mentioned previously, Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson (Republican, 2021–present) and State Auditor Tina Cannon both serve in top leadership roles. Olene S. Walker (Republican) remains the only woman to have served as governor of Utah, appointed in 2003 to complete her predecessor’s term. She also made history as the first woman to serve as both lieutenant governor (1993–2003) and governor in the state’s history.
State Legislator (8.0 of 30 points): Women’s representation in Utah’s state legislature has more than doubled over the past three decades — rising from 14% in 1995 to 31% in 2025. Among the women currently serving, 53% are Republicans and 47% are Democrats, reflecting a near-even partisan balance.
Cities and Counties (3.7 of 10 points): Among Utah’s 36 cities with populations over 30,000, 13 are currently led by women mayors — reflecting growing, though still limited, gender diversity in municipal leadership. In 2021, nearly two dozen Utah cities adopted ranked-choice voting for their local elections, including Salt Lake City, the state’s most populous municipality. At the county level, three of Utah’s five largest counties are headed by women executives, signaling incremental progress in women’s representation across local government.

In the 2025 Gender Parity Index, Utah received just 20 out of 100 points — earning a “D” grade alongside 24 other states. Only three states achieved an “A” (New Hampshire, Oregon, and Maine), while 11 earned a “B,” 11 a “C,” and five states — Missouri, Idaho, Kentucky, Indiana and Texas — ranked at the very bottom.
While a “D” may sound discouraging, Utah is making incremental progress in advancing women’s political representation. Even amid turbulent times, more women are stepping forward to lead, vote, and shape the future of our state. That matters. When decision-making power rests solely with men — or solely with any one demographic group — those decisions inevitably fall short of representing the full diversity of Utah’s residents. Gender is just one lens among many, but inclusive leadership is essential to building a government that truly reflects and serves all Utahns.
What is best for any state is to have the decision-making bodies truly demographically represent the people they serve. It is important for all of us to remember that American democracy is grounded in the principle of representation — not only in elected offices but also within its administrative institutions, a concept known as representative bureaucracy. This theory holds that a government functions more equitably and effectively when its elected officials and workforce reflect the diversity of the population it serves.
Utah still has work to do to ensure that the voices and needs of all residents are fully represented in government. One meaningful step toward that goal is increasing both the number and proportion of women serving in elected office across the state. Encouragingly, many impactful initiatives are driving this change — including the Political and Civic Representation Spoke of A Bolder Way Forward and its dedicated network of partners — working collectively to expand pathways for women’s leadership and civic engagement.
While gender is never the sole factor in my voting decisions, I do consider it — alongside things like competence, experience, integrity, and ethical leadership — because I believe our communities deserve decision-makers who reflect the full diversity of Utah and are equipped to serve with excellence and accountability. In Utah and across the country, we need this more today than ever before!",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/110524_Election-Day_43-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-29 13:03:15.623502

Matt Lesser, other Democratic lawmakers to be shot and killed.","As threats of political violence continue to grow in the United States, a Rocky Hill man is facing criminal charges for repeatedly threatening Connecticut Democratic lawmakers online. 
Local police in Rocky Hill seized four rifles and ammunition from Robert Pabich on Oct. 19 and later charged him on Oct. 24 with intimidation, stalking and disorderly conduct after he posted a comment online calling for state Sen. Matt Lesser, D-Middletown, and nine other Democratic lawmakers to be shot and killed.
“Take note of this picture. Every one of these pieces of trash need bullets shot directly into their faces… Just like they did to Charlie Kirk,” Pabich wrote below a photo of the Lesser and the nine other Democratic lawmakers who participated in the No Kings protest at the state Capitol on Oct. 18.
The arrest warrant issued for Pabich shows that this was not the first time the Rocky Hill resident has posted threatening messages about Connecticut Democrats online.
The police investigation into Pabich, 43, detailed a long history of violent messaging, including numerous antisemitic remarks directed at Lesser and other Jewish officials. 
According to the arrest warrant, the Connecticut Capitol Police had a case file on Pabich that included similar instances of threats spanning from 2002 to 2020. 
But the new charges filed against Pabich came as threats of politically-motivated violence are gaining far more attention due to the murder of Minnesota’s former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman, the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk and the two assassination attempts on President Donald Trump during the 2024 election.
When Rocky Hill police confronted Pabich about the threatening messages he posted online this month, he told officers that he was a “peaceful, non-violent guy.” 
And he suggested that he was just speaking his mind online. “I’m the ultimate expression of free speech. I won’t threaten someone directly, but I’ll say things,” Pabich said, according to the affidavit. 
“I try not to overtly threaten people,” he added. 
The messages that police officers cited in the arrest warrant, however, highlight a significant number of threatening and antisemitic posts, many of which were directed specifically at Lesser. 
In 2022, Pabich wrote on Instagram that Lesser deserved the “Paul Pelosi treatment,” ostensibly referring to the former U.S. House Speaker’s husband who was assaulted with a hammer in his home.
“Can people like you just do society a favor and die before we just have to round you up and execute you,” Pabich wrote at another point.
He also went so far as to post Lesser’s home address online while making some of the threatening comments. 
“Perfect example of why the Tree of Life Synagogue deserved to be fumigated,” he wrote, referencing the 2018 mass shooting in Pittsburgh in which a white supremacist targeted and killed 11 Jewish worshipers. “If anything we should clean house over at (Lesser’s address) as well, and purge more of these Jewish communists out of our community.” 
Lesser, who has served in the legislature since 2019, told police that the latest posts from Pabich made him fear for his family’s safety. His wife and infant daughter were forced to leave their house, Lesser told police. 
“Mr. Pabich’s pattern of serious and escalating threats have caused considerable distress,” Lesser told police. 
Rocky Hill police relied on the social media posts to seek a risk protection order from a Connecticut judge, which allowed officers to legally seize four rifles and “military-grade” ammunition from Pabich’s home. 
Lesser told the Connecticut Mirror he was thankful for the quick action of law enforcement. 
News of Pabich’s arrest, which was first reported by Hearst Connecticut Media, prompted an outpouring of support for Lesser and widespread condemnation of political violence from Republican and Democratic leaders in Connecticut. 
“Connecticut Senate Republicans condemn these vile threats in the strongest of terms,” Stephen Harding, the state Senate’s Republican Minority Leader said in a statement. “We are relieved that Sen. Matthew Lesser and our other colleagues are safe. We will continue to call out all forms of political violence. We thank law enforcement and state prosecutors for their work.”
Harding himself was the target of a bomb threat at his home in Brookfield earlier this year.
A similar threat was also directed at Attorney General William Tong around the same time.
U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro issued a statement Wednesday denouncing the threats and antisemitic comments made toward Lesser and other officials. 
“In the wake of rising political violence, we must stand strong and united against hate speech, including those that target religion, race, or political beliefs,” DeLauro said. “I applaud law enforcement for quickly taking action against these serious threats and protecting our elected officials. Intimidation is never acceptable.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/626E58E2-B0BD-4C38-B24A-9667D41341DE-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-29 13:03:15.623502

(Photo by Getty Images)Republicans on Indiana’s State Budget Committee rejected an effort to direct state surplus funding to low-income Hoosiers and food banks as federal SNAP benefits expire next month amid a federal shutdown.
Rep. Greg Porter, D-Indianapolis, urged Indiana leaders to step up, arguing that hundreds of thousands of Hoosiers are at risk of losing the food aid they receive through SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
More than 571,000 Hoosiers were receiving SNAP benefits in September, the latest data available, according to the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration.
SNAP benefits are provided on an electronic benefit card that is used like a debit card and accepted at most grocery stores. The benefit is 100% federally funded and administrative costs are split 50% with states — for now.
“We just have to have the will to do it,” Porter said during the committee’s regularly scheduled meeting. “We just (want to) take care of people that live next door to us and in our communities.”
Porter’s motion was symbolic in nature: calling on the governor and the State Board of Finance to take “concrete action” under their authority and provide funding to SNAP recipients and food banks.
Porter said state officials have moved money around for emergencies in the past. He noted the current state budget includes a $300 million contingency fund for three agencies, including the Family and Social Services Administration.
State Budget Director Chad Ranney said that money is for agencies that might have a shortfall in the budget’s second year because of state funding cuts.
Upcoming federal food assistance pause intensifies shutdown fight

Ranney said the Braun administration could take action on its own, without a statement from the State Budget Committee. But a transfer for SNAP would be complicated, he cautioned.
That’s because the money never flows to the state — instead going from the federal government to a third-party provider that loads it onto the EBT cards.
Indiana’s SNAP benefits cost about $112 million a month.
Rep. Ed Delaney, D-Indianapolis, said it would be easier to send additional support to food banks, which will immediately face an increase in demand from hungry Hoosiers.
Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis, observed that state coffers are running ahead of tax projections. First quarter results show an additional $270 million in revenue has flowed to the state over what was expected.
“It’s just that, unfortunately, Washington, D.C., they’re not getting their acts together, and people will be hungry in the state of Indiana,” Qaddoura said. “I think the responsible thing for us to do as legislators and as a committee is truly to work with the governor’s office and be sure that at least for the upcoming month, hopefully, until they reopen the federal government, that no one in our state goes hungry.”
Sen. Ryan Mishler, R-Mishawaka, said the administration appears to have options but the issue is too complicated to add to the committee’s agenda. Republicans voted 3-2 against the move.
The FSSA said current balances on EBT cards remain available for use. Hoosiers in need of support are encouraged to call 211 to learn about local resources and services available.
“The surest way to protect Hoosiers from a disruption in their SNAP benefits is for Senate Democrats to quickly pass the Clean Continuing Resolution,” FSSA Secretary Mitch Roob said in a statement. “Until then, families across Indiana are left in limbo — their ability to put food on the table tied up in political gridlock.”
Indiana will likely be on the hook for more SNAP costs in the future under changes from President Donald Trump’s administration.
States will pay a percentage of benefit costs depending on their error rates starting October 2027, and they’ll have to pony up for 75% of the administrative costs beginning October 2026. Those changes could cost Indiana up to $264 million more annually, according to FSSA estimates.

On November 4th, the question will be how many thousands of Bridgeport residents will take to the polls to strengthen Bridgeport’s democratic governance structures and civic discourse?
Bridgeport’s charter, which is the city’s constitution, is on the municipal ballot and very few residents seem aware of the important proposed changes to our system of governance. These changes include ethics accountability, increased checks and balances, and modernization of the Civil Service. Critically, Bridgeport’s charter has not been updated since 1993, a reflection of a political culture that has been anemic to civic debate, transparency, and consensus building.
The revised charter looks to directly address the city’s political stagnation by shifting the dynamics within the municipal government, most notably through several provisions that strengthen the role and capacities of the City Council. The charter establishes a Director of Legislative Services, a full-time position with the responsibility of supporting efforts of the Council members to craft quality, 21st-century legislation.
The charter also empowers the City Council to fill vacancies on city boards and commissions when the mayor fails to do so. For too long, the trope that “there are no qualified candidates to fill these roles” has been used to strangle the participation of qualified citizens in our municipal government. Bridgeport desperately needs new energy and expertise from our residents to break through the inertia of the current political climate and advocate for better planning and policies. The revised charter entrusts the City Council to make sure these boards and commissions no longer languish in functional purgatory.
Beyond the role of the Council, the charter looks to strengthen ethical governance by establishing the first Office of Municipal Ethics in the state. In a city plagued by absentee ballot fraud indictments and a perceived culture of favoritism and nepotism in the awarding of some government jobs, this office is a key step in eradicating unethical behavior and keeping Bridgeport officials and employees accountable for their actions.
Of possible greatest importance to Bridgeport residents may be the modernization of the provisions that govern the Civil Service, or city workforce. The revisions to this section, which contained language that had not been updated for nearly a century, enable a crucial modernization of a system that is designed for a bygone era. For the first time, the charter provides an exhaustive list of officials that are in temporary, appointed positions. The charter also provides clarification as to which positions are permanent and filled through a competitive process open to all qualified applicants. These new civil service provisions aim to modernize government technology, strengthen professional hiring standards, and bolster employee accountability to build public trust in how our city government serves residents.
Bridgeport has long suffered from declining civic participation, engagement, and belief in the fairness of our local government; less than 10% of eligible voters have participated in some recent municipal elections. Viewed from this perspective, the work of the Charter Review Commission is not merely the studied recommendations of 13 informed residents from across the city of Bridgeport. The support of charter reform is a much greater act; it is an affirmation of civic participation and the principle that we as citizens have a voice in shaping the form and structure of our local governance. It is a belief in a new blueprint for Bridgeport’s future.
Please support Bridgeport charter reform. Use your voice to shout no to the status quo and usher in a new era for Bridgeport when you head for the polls on November 4th.

Read additional coverage of the November 2025 election in Maine here.

	These results from 4,254 students from 29 schools give a glimpse into how young Mainers feel about the statewide ballot measures ahead of the Nov. 4 election.  
Question 1 asks whether Mainers want to require photo identification to be shown at polling places, in addition to limiting absentee voting and a multitude of other changes to the state’s election law.  
About 65% of students voted against this question, while nearly 35% voted for it. 
The margins were even wider for Question 2, which proposes a “red flag” law that would allow people to directly petition a judge to remove someone’s firearms if they pose a threat to themselves or others.
Nearly 80% of students voted for it, while about 20% voted against it.  
Secretary of State Shenna Bellows described the mock election as a hands-on way for students to learn about voting and the electoral system.
“This was the first year we’ve held a mock election surrounding a referendum election rather than a general election,” Bellows said, noting that they also included a question related to the upcoming 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States. 
That question read: “Do you believe that the language in the Declaration of Independence, written 250 years ago, is still relevant today?” Nearly 71% of students voted yes, while nearly 30% voted no. 
In Maine, 16- and 17-year-olds can preregister to vote and if they will be 18 years old by Election Day, they can vote. They can also serve as poll workers if they’re preregistered.  
While the results were from 29 schools, a total of 78 schools across the state signed up to receive mock election materials from the Secretary of State. Due to scheduling needs, they may be holding their mock elections at another date.
More on the referendums can be found at Maine Morning Star’s voter guide.

I’ve had to cover bills, and my credit cards have been paying my medical and doctor's appointments.

The Trump administration has said it will not tap emergency funds at the USDA to extend the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, despite loud cries from advocates and Democrats who say it’s perfectly legal for officials to use the rainy day money.“The longer the shutdown continues, distributions like this will end up being truly a lifeline for so many,” said Radha Muthiah, president and CEO of the Capital Area Food Bank. “And I worry that we're just going to see double, triple the numbers of people, both federal government furloughed workers, as well as those who are expecting SNAP benefits and being surprised Saturday morning when they don't have it,” Muthiah said.Food bank staff anticipated about 150 households would show up at its first distribution event for federal workers earlier in October. The organization had to quickly double its figures, Muthiah said. At Tuesday’s event, the food bank and No Limits Outreach Ministries brought enough to serve 400 households. Add a complete stop to food assistance to low-income families, and the region’s hunger needs will skyrocket, Muthiah said.“In our entire region, there are about 400,000 SNAP recipients, and on average, they receive about $330 in SNAP benefits for a family of two people a month. And so if that were to be disrupted at the cost of a meal in our region, that's about 80 meals vanishing from the tables of SNAP recipients across our region,” Muthiah said. “So we are ramping up, purchasing more food to be able to distribute through our partners into the community.” Kale, collard greens handed outTracy Bryce, 59, of District Heights, Maryland, unloaded kale and collard greens from the back of a U-Haul truck as hundreds of federal workers, with employment IDs in hand, waited for the noon distribution to open.Bryce, a retired U.S. Marshal of 34 years, now volunteers with No Limits Outreach Ministries.“I’ve been where they are,” Bryce said.

Byron Ford, 34, of Hyattsville, sat for hours in a chair he brought that morning, as temperatures hovered in the high 40s. “I'm just here today trying to get some food, just trying to provide healthy food for the family,” said Ford, who has two children ages 4 and 7.“We’re fortunate that we have things like this to provide for people who aren't receiving a paycheck. So we're fortunate, we're still blessed.”A civilian employee who works in finance for the Department of the Navy, Ford is also worried about family members who receive SNAP benefits.“We’re just spending our savings and trying to help,” he said.Young said she remembers what it was like to need SNAP several decades ago.“I was, you know, trying to work and go to college at the same time, and I had my kid, so yeah, I had SNAP for a little while. It's meant to help people until they get on their feet,” she said.

A furloughed government project manager who did not want to provide her full name for fear of losing her job, said “being a political pawn is hard.”“They (lawmakers) get the chance to go home in the middle of all this and not finish with the appropriations, not continue to walk through conversations, because they are choosing to dishonor the position that the people put them in and still get paid while their people suffer,” she said.Grocers, retailers worry over SNAP cutoffRetailers and grocers, already bracing for losses when Republicans’ “big, beautiful bill” SNAP cuts take effect, are also urging lawmakers to reopen the government.“We urge Congress to move forward now on a path that reopens the government and ensures families relying on SNAP can access their November benefits without interruption or delay,"" Jennifer Hatcher, The Food Industry Association’s chief public policy officer, said in a statement Oct. 21.The already planned SNAP cuts are slated to cost food retailers hundreds of millions of dollars, industry groups warned. Food retailers estimate up-front costs of forthcoming new SNAP requirements signed into law by President Donald Trump in July will cost convenience stores roughly $1 billion, supermarkets just over $305 million, supercenters such as Walmart an estimated $215.5 million and small-format stores about $11.8 million, according to an impact analysis last month by The Food Industry Association, the National Association of Convenience Stores and the National Grocers Association.

Ed Bolen, director of SNAP State Strategies at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said retailers could face “very drastic” losses if SNAP is also completely stopped Nov. 1.“Just imagine a 100% cut for a month or so,” said Bolen, of the left-leaning think tank.The United Food and Commercial Workers union sent a letter to USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins Monday requesting the agency spend contingency funding to extend SNAP benefits beyond next week.“Rising costs at the grocery store already threaten household budgets, especially for low-income families. An interruption in food assistance will only make matters worse, and workers in meatpacking, food processing, and grocery could see a reduction in hours and wages if SNAP dollars aren’t available to be spent in their stores or on their products,” wrote Milton Jones, president of the union that, according to the organization, represents roughly 1.2 million workers.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/themes/custom/sn/images/icons/No_image.svg,,,2025-10-29 12:02:16.218271

Nano particles released from Department of War jets are sterilizing soils, blocking sun, lawmakers hear from Wyomingites and YouTuber before backing bill.
The post Claims ‘chemtrails’ poison citizens spur Wyoming lawmakers to advance ‘geoengineering’ ban appeared first on WyoFile .","After fretting for a day over claims the government is poisoning citizens by spraying chemicals in the sky, a Wyoming legislative committee endorsed a bill banning the release of “atmospheric contaminants” above the state.
The federal government is creating poisonous trails of chemicals — known as chemtrails — from nozzles on jet aircraft flying thousands of feet above the earth, witnesses told the Legislature’s Joint Agriculture, State and Public Lands and Water Resources Interim Committee.
Vapor-like trails that appear behind jets — also known as contrails and widely understood to be water vapor from engines — are actually poisonous sprays intentionally released by the Department of War to change the climate, witnesses said.
A University of Wyoming professor, speaking for himself, sought to dismiss those fears.
“The formation of clouds from jet aircraft is a very well understood phenomenon,” said Jeff French, an associate professor and head of the university’s Atmospheric Science Department. “Combustion of jet fuel releases water vapor.”
“We have up-close photographs [of] retrofit nozzles mounted on wing pylons aimed at the exhaust jet stream to make this look like ‘condensation.’” Dane Wigington
Unconvinced, the panel advanced the Clean Air and Geoengineering Prohibition Act, prohibiting airborne releases because they “are not well understood and may have harmful consequences.” Snowmaking and cloud seeding would be exempt, although the Legislature earlier this year defunded a Wyoming aerial cloud seeding program.
The committee also backed a resolution to Congress to ban “unauthorized atmospheric geoengineering and weather modification.” The panel failed, on a tie vote, to advance a 10-year moratorium on cloud seeding.
Aerial spraying goes on in plain sight, Casper resident Maria Crisler told the committee.
“You can look outside Cheyenne, Casper — you know over population centers — you can see on any given day,” she said. “I have tons of pictures. They are chemtrailing, trying to block out the sun.”
Dane Wigington, a controversial YouTube sensation and promoter of geoengineering fears, testifying via a video link, said aluminum nano particles, “toxic to all life, period — no exceptions,” are a principal ingredient in the poisonous sprays. Geoengineering is ongoing and there’s evidence of misfeasance, Wigington said.
“It is sterilizing [the] soil microbiome,” he said of the jet trails. “It is affecting root systems.
“We have up-close photographs [of] retrofit nozzles mounted on wing pylons aimed at the exhaust jet stream to make this look like ‘condensation,’” he said.
Snowmaking, cloud seeding allowed
Water users from Wyoming’s portion of the Colorado River Basin and others representing ag interests successfully asked that cloud seeding be exempt from the proposed geoengineering ban. They worried that Wyoming would be seen as flighty in efforts to compromise over overallocated water use from the river.
The Environmental Protection Agency states on its website that “the federal government is not aware of there ever being a contrail intentionally formed over the United States for the purpose of geoengineering or weather modification.” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in July said his agency would no longer dismiss geoengineering fears and would provide an online list “of everything we know about contrails and geoengineering.”
Wyoming committee member Rep. Karlee Provenza, a Laramie Democrat, dismissed worries of government conspiracies that apparently captivated most of the committee.
“I don’t think that there’s a problem,” Provenza said when asked by co-chair Rep. John Winter, a Republican from Thermopolis, for a solution to alleged efforts to alter the earth’s atmosphere and climate.
Wyoming residents are worried about drought, among other things, she said. “They’re seeing a bunch of different impacts on our environment.”
But they latch onto chemtrail theories “instead of blaming the culprit — climate change,” she said.
Provenza sympathized with Wyomingites who “are just heartbroken … [who] think that chemtrails [are] the reason for all of their ailments.” However, she said there was no sound scientific evidence presented to reach that conclusion.
This geoengineering bill is “picking a fight with the federal government, who is allegedly poisoning the people of Wyoming,” she said before voting against the measure. “So we’re growing government with no actual solution, not really doing anything in here except giving our DEQ office a lot of work to do, to monitor all aircraft, drones, balloons or rockets that enter the state’s airspace, to determine whether atmospheric contaminants are being dispersed.”
She envisioned the bill would see state regulators flying around in a helicopter to “capture particles from whatever is dropping materials on us.”
Defamation denied
With skepticism from only Provenza and Sen. Barry Crago, a Buffalo Republican, the committee accepted Wigington’s testimony. In 2021, Wigington unsuccessfully sued a climate scientist for defamation.
Douglas MacMartin, an associate professor at Cornell’s Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, called Wigington’s beliefs, as stated in a documentary, “pure fantasy,” according to court records.
The federal court for the Eastern District of California granted MacMartin’s motion to dismiss the case and ordered Wigington to pay the professor’s costs as provided by California’s anti-SLAPP law, which guards against meritless suits known as “strategic lawsuits against public participation.”
The parties agreed on a payment figure that was not made public in court papers.
The geoengineering bill and resolution now head to the Legislature, which meets early next year in a session devoted primarily to budget matters. The committee’s endorsement boosts the measures’ chance of passage.

Like many food pantries across Kansas, the organization is  struggling to meet community needs. (Submitted)TOPEKA — Kansans who receive food assistance or are furloughed from federal jobs are scrambling to pay bills and feed their families as the federal government shutdown drags on.  
Tuesday was the deadline for the federal government to reopen so that November Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program payments could go out to beneficiaries. It takes 72 hours for the payments to process, according to the Kansas Department for Children and Families.
More than 93,000 Kansas households — nearly 188,000 Kansans — use SNAP benefits to put food on their tables, DCF said in a press release. The bulk of those using SNAP are children.
As politicians on both sides exchange barbs on social media and in news releases about who is at fault for shutting down the government, Kansans like Daniel Scharpenburg, of Overland Park, are carefully tracking their bank account balances. He’s worried about a teenage son with a big appetite and the possibility of empty kitchen cabinets.
Scharpenburg, 45, is furloughed from the Internal Revenue Service office in Kansas City, Missouri. He worked the first five days of the shutdown, leaving Oct. 8 and receiving a paycheck in mid-October for those days of work. 
“I have to be very careful with my bills, because I have now missed a paycheck,” he said. “I’m having to rely on food banks and things like that to make sure I have food. If I start thinking about my car payment and my phone bill and my rent, I’m gonna go crazy. I really do have to focus on the next bill that’s due and hope for the best.”
Scharpenburg is applying for jobs in the Kansas City area but isn’t having much luck. He said all furloughed workers in the area are competing for jobs.
The IRS location employs about 6,000 people, and reports from the federal government indicate about half of IRS workers have been furloughed, he said. Housing and Urban Development also has a Kansas City office, and those employees are affected by the shutdown too, Scharpenburg said.
Scharpenburg’s ex-wife is also a furloughed IRS employee, and he worries that his 15-year-old son at home will eventually be affected by the situation.
“I really thought it would be over before now,” Scharpenburg said. “In another week, it’s going to break the record for longest shutdown if it keeps going, and that’s not a record I want to see broken. So, yeah, I am worried that it will go on longer.”
Scharpenburg is first vice president in the National Treasury Employees Union Chapter 66, which covers Kansas City, Missouri. In that role, he’s hearing daily from furloughed employees who are scared and frustrated.
The union put together lists of food banks and other local resources, he said. 
“But you know, it’s hard times for a lot of people, so it seems like the resources we lean on to help us are being stretched thin, just like just like our dollars are,” he said.
Scharpenburg said union members tell him that landlords and bankers have been willing to work with furloughed employees, knowing that eventually they’ll get back pay. The idea floated in Washington of withholding back pay was like a “slap in the face,” he said.
“When a politician says something like that, it feels like, oh, they don’t respect our work at all,” he said. “I am nervous. The law is clear that we will get paid at the end of this, but that being said, if Congress could pass something to change that … I don’t know what will happen if the executive branch were to decide just to not pay us. They’d have to go to court, but I don’t know if that would be resolved quickly.”
 
Food pantries struggling
Many pantries statewide are stretching to meet community needs generated by rising prices and furloughed employees. Now, missing SNAP payments are expected to intensify the situation, said Debbie Johns, director of the Geary County Food Pantry.
Located in Junction City, the food pantry has been adding 12 to 15 new families each time it has a food distribution, Johns said. Typically, the organization sees just three to five new families each time it opens its doors, she said.
“It’s a little scary,” Johns said. “We’ve got a pretty good stock but you just see it go each time. If they clear the shelves, how long are we going to be able to keep up with this?”
Johns said the food pantry adapted its guidelines to make sure they are able to serve furloughed federal employees. Many of them work at Fort Riley and would exceed income guidelines.
Johns is grateful many in the Geary County area are donating food and holding food drives to help out. The county has the highest child food insecurity rate in Kansas, she said, so all of the challenges this year have made the problem worse.
Gov. Laura Kelly added food drives to the remaining stops on her statewide “The People’s Budget” listening tour because of the widespread need. Working in partnership with the Kansas Food Bank and Harvesters — The Community Food Network, she encouraged anyone attending the town hall events to bring nonperishable, nonglass food items.
“As the federal government shutdown continues to drag on, Kansans who are furloughed, and especially those who receive SNAP and WIC benefits, are caught in the crossfire,” Kelly said. 
Kelly also announced this week that she joined a coalition of 22 states and two governors in suing the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Secretary Brooke Rollins for “unlawfully suspending” SNAP funds during the government shutdown. 
“States cannot, and should not, take on the federal government’s responsibility to fund SNAP,” Kelly said in a news release. “Cutting off SNAP payments is an unprecedented choice made by the Trump Administration and Congress that will harm millions of families across the country. I joined this lawsuit to protect Kansans, because the federal government has a legal and moral responsibility to fund this program, not to take food out of the mouths of Kansas children.”
 
Economic challenges
Grocery stores are planning for changed buying patterns as SNAP funding cuts off, said Jon McCormick, president and CEO at Retail Grocers Association, Kansas and Missouri.
SNAP benefits put nearly $33 million each month into the Kansas economy, according to the USDA. 
The effect on grocery stores of missing SNAP payments will be “immediate,” McCormick said, although multiple factors determine the effect in specific stores.
“A store in Lenexa is going to have minimal SNAP recipients shopping,” he said. “A store in the urban core of Wichita is totally different.That could be 40% of the business. It certainly is going to affect the urban core stores and the very small rural stores.”
McCormick serves on the National Grocers Association government relations committee, and he visited Washington, D.C., last week to discuss resolutions to continue SNAP funding.
“For us as an industry, including all food manufacturers and providers, it is disruptive for the customer. It’s disruptive for the supply chain. It’s disruptive for the retailer,” he said, adding that he’s confident retailers will be able to manage through this challenge.
“The independent retailer is rather resilient and creative when it comes to adversity,” McCormick said.
Grocery store owners and managers across the state are unsure exactly how they will be affected when SNAP payments stop. Some, like Pam Budenbender, owner of Onaga Country Market, don’t expect to see many changes because her store doesn’t serve many people using SNAP. 
However, she said she’s worried about a customer who is deaf and needs the benefit to buy food. Budenbender already helps her out as much as she can. 
Scott Bird, co-owner of Family Market in Quinter, said his store definitely will be affected, as it participates in eWIC, part of the Women, Infant and Children’s program that offers supplemental nutrition for mothers and infants.
“It definitely will have an effect on small-town stores and people who need those services,” he said.
He isn’t yet adapting inventory but is in a “wait-and-see” mode, Bird added.
Others affected by the federal government shutdown include banks, mortgage companies and property management companies that rent apartments.
“Kansas banks and bankers stand ready to work with and support their customers who may be facing any hardships due to the current federal government shutdown,” said Doug Wareham, president and CEO of the Kansas Bankers Association. 
In a statement, he encouraged federal employees to reach out to their banks as soon as possible to discuss their personal situation and see what help may be available, including potential fee waivers, payment deadline extensions, or other accommodations.
“The banking industry will continue to support Kansans through major challenges such as this shutdown just as we did during the pandemic and previous interruptions in government operations,” Wareham said.
Gary Olds, with the Geary County Landlords Association, said it is early in the shutdown to determine how landlords will manage missed rental payments. The Junction City area is military-dependent, he said. 
“I think in general, landlords are going to try to work with military with regards to the rent, but that’s a broadbrush statement on my part,” he said. “Most landlords can probably weather about 30 days because they have the security deposit. Hopefully at least some of the tenants that are military have some level of savings that can make a payment or make a partial payment.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/JC-food-pantry-1024x805.jpg,,,2025-10-29 11:20:08.108607

The Senate panel on Tuesday heard from a charter school researcher and others during a seven-hour meeting, the committee’s second hearing this month. The hearing also focused on the challenges facing traditional public schools — which superintendents said would only get worse if “school choice” is expanded in Mississippi.
“School choice” refers to a number of policies that give parents more educational options outside of traditional public schools, including private schools, often funding those opportunities with taxpayer dollars. House leaders have vowed it’ll be the key issue of the 2026 legislative session and are already working on a draft bill. 
That bill could spell disaster for Mississippi schools, the four superintendents warned the Senate committee. 
The school leaders from Oxford, Jackson, Greene County and Scott County said they feared school choice would siphon money and resources away from traditional public schools. Instead, they asked lawmakers to consider investing in the state’s existing education system by continuing to support early education, career and technical education opportunities and student mental-health resources.
“On the surface, it does sound like a good idea to give families dollars to choose the school their child should attend,” said Superintendent Bradley Roberson from Oxford. “But if we look at it, it’s not that appealing for families across our state.”
Last week, the executive director of the regional private school association told lawmakers on the House committee selected to study school-choice policies that private schools were not willing to support school choice unless the dollars came with no strings attached. He said private schools under no circumstances would make their students take state tests or change their curriculum, regardless of whether they received state funds. 
Roberson said that’s what sets traditional public schools apart. 
“I can assure you public schools aren’t afraid of competition, but I do want to hit on something about competition,” he said. “True competition only exists when everyone plays by the same rules. Our private school friends have made it clear they have no interest in doing that. And why would they? They get to choose the students they serve.
“We open our doors to every child every day regardless of background, income, ability, or circumstance. And y’all, that’s not a weakness … That’s a promise,” he said.
The superintendents lauded the hard work of their teachers and students that’s led to the state’s academic turnaround in recent years, and questioned why lawmakers would threaten to disrupt their progress.
Increasing teacher pay emerged as a top issue during the meeting. 
Roberson reminded lawmakers that many of Mississippi districts that struggle academically also struggle to recruit and retain certified teachers. Both Alan Lumpkin from Scott County and Charles Breland from Greene County told lawmakers about challenges recruiting their own daughters to their school districts because of low salaries. 
“If we want to sustain the Mississippi miracle, we have to retain teachers and we have to recruit teachers into this profession, and the current salary is not recruiting teachers into the profession,” Lumpkins said. “That’s the struggle that we’re having. I’m having it with my own daughter who wants to be a teacher one day, but she also wants to be able to provide things for her children and her future family.”
Their accounts lined up with data presented by Megan Boren, the Southern Regional Education Board’s director of educator workforce policy. 
Mississippi’s teacher pay is among the lowest in the nation, according to SREB data. The state trails its neighbors in average top salary, average salary and starting salary, and generally sits thousands below national averages in those categories. 
Boren said interest in teaching among high school students is down to an average of 4%, an alarming statistic in a region experiencing major teacher shortages. Boren suggested raising pay, creating a “residency year” for teachers and establishing an “induction” process in which teachers are extensively supported during their first few years in the classroom. 
Another challenge unanimous across schools: chronic absenteeism. Boren encouraged school leaders to build a positive culture at school to incentivize attendance and build relationships with families to establish community-wide the importance of consistently going to school. 
Errick Greene, superintendent of Jackson Public Schools, had a unique point to take up with lawmakers. He said the district was challenged by the local presence of charter schools. The Jackson Public Schools board of education last week voted to deny a local charter’s request to expand into high school grades, but the charter authorizer board said the school doesn’t need JPS approval. 
Greene encouraged legislators to take a closer look at charter accountability measures and funding.
“We’re required to cut a lump sum check to charter schools but we don’t get paid in a lump sum,” he said. “We’re paid in increments throughout the year … As you might imagine, given that we’re now at about $12 million in payment annually to charter schools just from our district, that’s a huge hit to our schools.”
Greene’s comments were in stark contrast to remarks given earlier in the day by Lisa Karmacharya, executive director of the Mississippi Charter School Authorizer Board. 
Karmacharya, in the meeting’s opening presentation, implored senators to loosen charter school laws to allow the sector to grow and make it easier to establish charter schools across the state. Currently, charter schools can only be established in areas where the local school district is rated A, B or C if the local school district’s board approves. New charter schools can only be established without local school board approval in areas rated D or F. 
She said current state law has created a charter system parallel to the state’s traditional public school system, and for the two to be successful, they need to work together. Aimee Evan, an education researcher from WestEd, said charter school systems need to be given time to show results. 
But several senators were skeptical. 
“I question whether this 10-year experiment has worked,” said Sen. David Blount, a Democrat from Jackson and vice-chairman of the education committee. The state’s first charter school was established in 2015.
Sen. Nicole Boyd, R-Oxford, asked Karmacharya why the authorizer board hasn’t closed low-performing charters. Most of Mississippi’s charter schools are failing by the state’s accountability measures, which lawmakers noted are set to get even more rigorous next year. Karmacharya told the panel that her board needs more freedom in legislation to act more quickly to renew and close schools, which Sen. Dennis DeBar, a Republican from Leakesville and chairman of the education committee, said he was happy to consider. 
But DeBar left her with a stern warning.
“I am concerned that the charter schools have not progressed to where they need to be … I would like to see more charter schools but it’s hard to justify that when the performance that we have just isn’t up to snuff,” he said. “Hopefully next year when we come back ratings will be better. If they’re not, there need to be drastic changes by the Legislature.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/09143002/3X0A1001.jpg,,,2025-10-29 11:20:08.108607

(Photo by Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A recent report examining the Kansas foster care agency’s performance in 2024 improved from last year, the agency head said, but one region is especially struggling to meet expectations.
The agency’s annual progress is measured by benchmarks outlined in a 2021 federal court settlement that holds the state to certain promises, including lowering the number of times a child is moved, eliminating overnight stays in offices and offering timely mental health services. A neutral third party released the report analyzing 2024’s progress in September.
Laura Howard, secretary for the Kansas Department for Children and Families, said at a Monday committee hearing in Topeka that improvement plans look different in each part of the state.
“We can’t just look at the aggregate,” she said. “We have to look at what’s happening in each area in each part of the state. What’s going well? What still needs to improve?”
Five private foster care providers serve eight areas in Kansas, and those organizations are also bound by the requirements of the settlement agreement. One in four Kansas kids in foster care lives in Sedgwick County, which is now served by EmberHope Connections after it replaced Saint Francis Ministries in 2024.
That county, which is home to Wichita, has had the most significant struggles in meeting the settlement requirements. 
In 2024, 100 kids experienced more than 200 instances of spending nights in unsuitable places, such as offices. About 83% of those instances were in the Wichita area. It is the only region in the state that continues to have significant issues with placement, Howard said.
The state will no longer be monitored for one metric that ensures placements don’t exceed a home’s licensed capacity. It also improved in decreasing the number of children who had delayed mental health services, but still hasn’t met the settlement’s benchmark.
The one outcome the state did not improve upon was the failure to place measure, which refers to a child sleeping in an office, hotel or other unlicensed setting.
“While we’re seeing progress, and this is definitely a better report than last year’s report, where we saw some declines in performance, it’s just important that we continue to really place the focus on plans for improvement,” Howard said.
Brenda Watkins, president of EmberHope, said her organization is facing three main challenges: high acuity children, the rising cost of liability insurance and struggles to recruit and retain a qualified workforce.
Other Kansas organizations said the same thing at Monday’s hearing, and Watkins said other states are facing similar issues.
In Sedgwick County, EmberHope struggles to find placements for children because, often, no placements are available, Watkins said.
“Truly, there is no placement,” she said.
That means either no beds exist or households and facilities are not willing or able to take a child, she said.
One 6-year-old boy spent 48 nights in an EmberHope office and 40 nights in a hospital in a three-month span.
“He has been wrapped around with community services and supports to meet his needs,” Watkins said.
The boy, who was eventually diagnosed with a neurological condition, has been living in a residential psychiatric treatment facility and is expected to soon be discharged into a therapeutic foster home, Watkins said.
“When the system comes together across the shared parts to share the client that we serve, which is the child and the family, we can be very successful,” she said. “However, that doesn’t happen all the time, and we do need to continue to increase our focus on how we can coordinate care (and) achieve better outcomes for kids in care.”
In fiscal year 2025, which stretches from July 2024 to June 2025, EmberHope had 450 total instances of failure to place in Sedgwick County. In the first four months of the 2026 fiscal year, there have been 527 instances among 75 children, Watkins said.
Organizations are required under the terms of the settlement agreement to end all instances of failure to place by February 2026.
Watkins said the situation in Sedgwick County is at a crisis level. She described “pandemonium,” staff and child injuries and security troubles. One security company fired EmberHope, and off-duty Wichita Police Department officers now help in place of private security guards.
Watkins was among several organization representatives who asked legislators for help in covering the rising cost of liability insurance.
The cost of liability insurance for Cornerstones of Care, which serves foster children in the Kansas City region, is going up 131% in 2026 compared to 2025, said Justin Horton, the chief programs and innovation officer for the organization. Compared to 2022 costs, it is up 235%.
The issue is not unique to Kansas, he said.
“But, nonetheless, if you license foster homes, if you case manage foster homes, (if) you run a residential facility — and I check all three of those boxes — it’s very costly,” Horton said.
Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Shawnee Democrat, speculated that finding liability insurance carriers willing to cover foster care organizations was also an issue. Horton affirmed.
“I would hate to see insurance dictate how we serve our kids,” Ruiz said, “but it seems like in this kind of scenario, that’s what we’re looking at.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/P6100110-2-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-29 10:56:50.638795

Last week, the National Republican Senatorial Committee said on a donor call that it sees the Great Lakes state as a jumping off point for an expansion of its majority in the upper chamber of Congress. The call was first reported by Axios.
The mention of Michigan on the call was, in a sense, the GOP coping with its lack of a challenger in the Georgia race to take on U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, with the National Republican Senatorial Committee looking to Michigan as its best attempt to play offense in 2026.
Brendan Jaspers, the committee’s political director, went so far as to tell Republican donors that those who have said Rogers can’t win in the upcoming race, due to his loss in 2024, were “perpetuating [a] lie” that was out of touch with “the realities of the data.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Some of that also has to do with the state of the Democratic primary in Michigan, which currently has three contenders: current U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens of Birmingham, state Sen. Mallory McMorrow of Royal Oak and Abdul El-Sayed, the former Wayne County Department of Health, Human and Veterans Services.
Although the race is still in its early phases and the primary won’t commence until August next year, the three candidates are already starting to turn inward and throw jabs at one another. Meanwhile, they’ve also been laser focused on Rogers, who is not the only name in the race but is by far the main contender. Kent Behman, a dentist, Fred Heurtebise, an engineer and welder, and Geneveive Peters Scott are also in the hunt for the Republican nomination, although they each lack major party funding, and perhaps most importantly, the endorsement that President Donald Trump has already bestowed on Rogers.
Rogers’ campaign did not respond to a message from Michigan Advance seeking comment.

Those projecting a Rogers victory this early, however, should heed not just the 2024 results – in which Rogers lost to current Democratic U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Holly – but also the broad electoral history of Michigan’s U.S. Senate races.
Of note, no Republican has won a Senate seat in Michigan for more than three decades. Looking to the last race involving Rogers, he underperformed Trump by over 100,000 votes in a Republican wave year. A straw poll conducted by the Michigan 9th Congressional District also showed Rogers didn’t run away with the survey. Scott was within 10 percentage points from Rogers’ top spot. Rogers garnered 52% out of a little more than 100 delegates voting in the straw poll, to Scott’s 42%.

The 9th Congressional District is located in the state’s blood red Thumb region that covers a wide swath of strong GOP territory, including portions of Huron, Tuscola, Sanilac, Lapeer, St. Clair, Macomb and Oakland counties.
“Even his own base wishes they had a different candidate as he runs on a deeply unpopular agenda that’s spiking costs and threatening to kick hundreds of thousands of Michiganders off their health care,” Michigan Democratic Party spokesperson Joey Hannum told the Advance. “Michiganders know Mike Rogers is an out-of-touch, Florida mansion-dwelling multi-millionaire and they’ll reject him again in 2026.”
McMorrow also told the Advance that “Michiganders rejected Rogers once, and we’ll do it again.”
“Prices are through the roof, families are struggling, and Michiganders aren’t buying what he and Trump are selling,” McMorrow said of Rogers.
Stevens campaign spokesperson Joetta Appiah told the Advance that Rogers will have to answer to voters after making jokes about rising prices spurred by the economic policies of President Donald Trump. Contrast that with the Democrats, and Stevens herself, who are focused on lowering costs for families feeling the pressure.
“The contrast is clear: Mike Rogers is a Florida man looking for a promotion and a platform to rubber-stamp Donald Trump’s chaos agenda,” Appiah said via email.

El-Sayed campaign spokesperson Roxie Richner also said Rogers is a known commodity, but not in a way that’s beneficial to Michigan voters.
“He is a famous flop of a Senate candidate and if given any power he will always choose Big Pharma over the rest of us,” Richner told the Advance.
Christyna Thompson, press secretary for the Democratic Senate Majority PAC, also believed that the overconfidence in Rogers was “wish-casting.”
“Washington Republicans love Rogers because he’ll be a rubber stamp for the very same economic agenda that’s keeping grocery and health care costs high for Michiganders,” Thompson said. “But that doesn’t reflect the reality that he’s a weak general election candidate. He’s already lost the state once, in an election where Donald Trump should have carried him over the top, and he’s trailing every Democrat in the race in fundraising. Strip away the spin, and he’s just another weak candidate riding the fumes.”
That said, the GOP’s supposed prescience on the upcoming potential nastiness of the Democratic primary was clear while reporting this story.

When asked to comment on the National Republican Senatorial Committee’s projections and whether they thought the race was already won by Rogers, each of the respective Democratic campaigns jockeyed to say why they, over the others, would be the best person to beat Rogers in November.
“Everywhere I go, people tell me the same thing: we need a Senator who works for Michigan, not Trump,” McMorrow said. “That’s why we’ve outraised everyone in this race – and will be the next one to beat him.”
Richner, similarly, used the opportunity to showcase E-Sayed’s credentials against Rogers.
“Meanwhile, Abdul is joining nurses on the picket line, helping Yoopers eliminate medical debt, and building a people-powered movement,” she said. “Abdul beats Mike, both in the November election – and at life, generally.”
Appiah was adamant that Stevens was still “the best Democrat to defeat him,” noting her consistent polling advantage in a head-to-head race with Rogers – the Detroit Regional Chamber’s May poll conducted by Glengariff Group shows that only Stevens beats the Republican candidate in a survey of registered voters, but not by much.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-29 14:37:05+00:00,CT Mirror,New Haven food pantries brace for SNAP benefits cutoff,Mona Mahadevan | New Haven Independent,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/29/snap-benefits-cutoff-new-haven-food-pantries/,"An estimated 31% of New Haven's population will lose access to SNAP, and two food pantries expect to feed at least 150 more families than usual next week.","With the country’s largest food assistance program set to lapse on Saturday, two local food pantries — Loaves & Fishes and the Downtown Evening Soup Kitchen (DESK) — are expecting to feed at least 150 more families than usual next week.
Those preliminary estimates were provided to the Independent on Tuesday by Lorrice Grant, executive director of Loaves & Fishes, and Steve Werlin, executive director of DESK.
The federal government shut down on Oct. 1 after the U.S. Congress failed to pass a budget bill on Sept. 30. The U.S. Senate rejected the House-passed stopgap solution, which would fund the government through Nov. 21, for the thirteenth time on Tuesday.
As a result of the shutdown, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), previously known as food stamps, will not send out benefits to the 42 million people that rely on them at the start of November.
[RELATED: SNAP benefits poised to stop Nov. 1 despite CT hopes to continue]
While SNAP maintains a reserve of an estimated $5 billion, the U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA), which administers the benefits, said the funds were prescribed for sudden emergencies, not a government shutdown. In response, 25 states, including Connecticut, have sued the Trump administration, arguing that USDA has a legal obligation to maintain permanent funding for food stamps. In a press release sent Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Rosa DeLauro wrote that the USDA’s refusal to provide contingency funding is against the law.
So what does this all mean for New Haveners?
According to DataHaven, as of August 2025, 18,168 families in New Haven receive SNAP benefits. The state Department of Social Services (DSS) estimates that 42,930 people participated in the program in 2024, which means that, come early November, 31 percent of the city’s population will lose access to critical benefits.
That’s an average monthly loss of $190 per household.
[RELATED: SNAP cuts to families in CT will hit harder than any other state]
Grant said Loaves & Fishes served 412 families on Saturday, already a significant uptick from their usual demand. This Saturday, she’s expecting 75 additional families.
Of the 412 families served on Saturday, 125 had their food delivered. That’s because Loaves & Fishes saw a sharp drop in the number of families seeking help at the start of the Trump administration, which Grant attributed to growing anxiety around Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Over the last six weeks, volunteers have been delivering food to people unable to come to the Wooster Square pantry, due to mobility issues or the fear of being detained.
At DESK, which is located on State Street, Werlin expects the number of families needing assistance to climb each week. Normally, demand builds over the month as people use up their SNAP benefits, rising from around 110 families in the first week to between 160 and 180 in the last. With SNAP set to lapse, Werlin said they’re bracing for end-of-month numbers at the start of November, and then more than 200 families per week after that.
From Monday through Nov. 10, the Hamden’s Best Video Film & Cultural Center is hosting a clothing and food drive for Loaves & Fishes. It’s the first food drive that Best Video has ever hosted, according to Executive Director Raizine Bruton.
Bruton said she’s been “blown away” by the level of support already, with people donating tuna, formula, and children’s snacks. She estimates that on Monday and Tuesday alone, she received enough donations to fill half a car.
This is “the community coming together,” said Bruton. You can drop your donations in boxes at the front of Best Video, located at 1842 Whitney Ave.
Gov. Ned Lamont, meanwhile, announced on Monday that the state would provide $3 million in emergency funding to the state’s largest food bank, Connecticut Foodshare, spread evenly between the first two weeks of November. Separately, the food bank authorized an emergency expenditure of $1 million.
But given the level of need in Connecticut and New Haven, Werlin warned that local food pantries, already stretched thin by rising food prices and federal aid cuts, won’t be able to close the gap in funding for food benefits.
“There is no way that the emergency food system, built around community-level food pantries, could ever replace the $70 million dollar gap that we’re going to see in the month of November,” he argued.
To contextualize the difference between state and federal food benefits: In the fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, Connecticut Foodshare spent $110 million, with about $95 million designated as either “donated food distributed” or “purchased food.” That’s compared to the estimated $894 million spent by the federal government annually on SNAP in Connecticut.
In addition to the difference in scale, local food pantries are also significantly less efficient than SNAP.
“The beauty of the SNAP program,” said Werlin, “is that it puts funds directly in the hands of those that need it, with very little overhead.” That’s because SNAP loads money directly onto a debit-like EBT card, which allows recipients to access the same food resources as anyone else.
As a result, when it comes to the state’s $3 million, Werlin expects a meaningful portion of those funds to be directed to administrative costs, storage, transportation, and internal staffing. Grassroots food pantries are an “emergency food system,” explained Werlin, built to be a “supplement to” SNAP, not its substitute.
According to Grant, it’s also been more expensive to procure food since the Trump administration took office. For one thing, she said, after the administration cut The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) by $500 million, Connecticut Foodshare had to reduce its supply of free foods to pantries by 36 truckloads. Food prices are also up, primarily due to supply chain issues and Trump’s tariffs.
That’s all “changed the way we reach out to partners to obtain food,” explained Grant. “We’re making the network a little bit wider,” by, for example, going to food distribution sites with surpluses, even if they’re hours away.
The Greater New Haven Coordinated Food Assistance Network (CFAN) has also met last week and this week to discuss ways pantries can brace for November.
One initiative, said Grant, relates to distributing information to people in need. On a call, CFAN shared ways people can access information about food pantries, including by texting “foodshare” to 85511 or calling 211.
Another initiative relates to strengthening purchasing power.
“When one of us finds a deal, we call each other, and we all purchase at the same time,” explained Grant. By buying in bulk, they can also sometimes negotiate lower costs. “We’re all in this together. We’re trying to make sure we cover the city.”
During an interview Tuesday on WNHH’s “Dateline New Haven” radio show, Mayor Justin Elicker said that while the city is cash-strapped, it could provide “coordination” and “operational support” to CFAN, as it did during the Covid-19 pandemic. He also suggested using the city’s “relatively large megaphone” to amplify where and how people can access food.
If the federal government stays shut down for more than a week or two, Werlin expects demand for food pantries to increase significantly.
For many families, said Werlin, “SNAP is one piece of the puzzle.” Under normal circumstances, those households have other sources of income and rarely, if ever, turn to food pantries.
Without SNAP, that could change, adding even more demand to an already overstretched system.
“The degree to which our residents rely on these funds is under-appreciated,” said Werlin. “It’s incredibly serious and asinine for our federal government to believe that community-based organizations can fill the gap.”

Ron DeSantis announces his proposed budget from the Capitol on Feb. 3, 2025. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Gov. Ron DeSantis is directing Florida’s top higher education board to prevent state universities from hiring foreign specialty workers, he announced Wednesday.
At a Tampa press conference, DeSantis said the Board of Governors should fully “pull the plug” on the visas that allow foreigners in a specialty occupation to temporarily work in the United States, called H1-B visas. This comes a month after President Donald Trump announced a $100,000 fee for future H1-B visa applications amid his administration’s broader efforts to stop illegal immigration and roadblock non-Americans from working in the U.S.
“I’m directing today the Florida Board of Governors to pull the plug on the use of these H1-B visas in our universities,” DeSantis said, likening their usage to “indentured servitude” and deriding how “troubling” it is that Florida universities are relying on cheaper labor — especially as workers nationwide are experiencing increased layoffs due to artificial intelligence, a DOGE-style of thinking, and federal furloughs.
“We can do it with our residents in Florida or with Americans, and if we can’t do it, then man—we need to really look deeply about what is going on with this situation,” he continued.
He then rattled off a list of assistant professors, coaches, data analysts, coordinators, marketers, and more university workers on H1-B visas from areas like the United Kingdom, China, Spain, Canada, Trinidad and Tobago, Russia, Poland, Albania, Argentina, and the West Bank, appearing increasingly incredulous at how these various positions were deemed specialty occupations.
The Phoenix was unable to independently verify the list of professors and their countries of origin.
“Why aren’t we producing math and engineering folks who can do this?” DeSantis questioned, after claiming one college had a power systems researcher from Wuhan, China. “[There’s] a clinical assistant professor from supposed Palestine. Why are they—is that just social justice that they’re doing?”
As of June 30, 2025, there were more than 1,900 Florida employers sponsoring over 7,200 H1-B visa holders, according to the USCIS. There were a total of 78 employers and 677 beneficiaries in the education sphere, with the University of Florida boasting the most H1-B beneficiaries at 156, followed by the University of Miami with 90, and the University of South Florida with 72.
These schools also have the three largest medical programs in the state. Thousands of H1-B visas nationwide are used by foreign physicians, although the majority of H1-B recipients are in the tech industry.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
H1-B visas have become a flashpoint in Republican circles, as party leaders like Trump and DeSantis urge less reliance on foreign labor while others insist that businesses need workers, NOTUS reported.
The conversation erupted as an offshoot from the larger discussion on illegal immigration and America-first businesses, two of Trump’s top priorities during his 2024 presidential campaign and the subject of many of his day one executive orders. In the immigration sphere, Trump has ordered mass deportations, increased ICE presence, and allocated federal dollars to states assisting in detention efforts of migrants illegally in the country — led by Florida under DeSantis.
This comes after Trump — in the early days of his term — stood alongside Elon Musk as they touted the new Department of Governmental Efficiency to cut down on alleged excesses in spending. This led to thousands of firings across federal agencies.
Just as Florida reflected the national model on immigration onto the state level, DeSantis also created a state-level DOGE to audit state universities and local governments to search for waste, fraud, and abuse. That torch has been taken up by Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia, who’s unofficially renamed the task force the Florida Agency for Fiscal Oversight, or FAFO.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — Dozens of volunteers at the University of South Carolina on Tuesday packaged hundreds of homecoming weekend leftovers for students unable to afford a meal as part of a new and growing program called Feed the Flock.
Since the federal grant-funded program started last spring, participants have wrapped up 5,000 meals for students struggling with food insecurity, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture defines as limited or uncertain availability of nutritional things to eat.
Hospitality faculty and students at USC worked with campus dining, the president and first lady’s residence, and fraternities and sororities to salvage the excess food, including barbecue chicken legs, pulled pork, collard greens and biscuits and gravy, that had gone uneaten during the football weekend festivities. Feed the Flock seeks to put it all to good use instead of sending it to the landfill.

“I get to see firsthand just how much food we really waste in the Greek village, day in and day out,” said Madison Jones, as she scooped chicken pasta into containers that will be sent to the Gamecock CommUnity Shop on campus for students to pick up as needed.
Jones, a master’s degree student studying hospitality at USC, also works as the property manager for the school’s Kappa Delta sorority chapter and helped gather much of the donated meals.
“We have these private chefs, but a lot of students don’t have that luxury,” she said. “Being able to take this food and provide it to students who are underprivileged and need resources, that’s why I come out.”
The CommUnity Shop, located inside the Carolina Coliseum, provides clothing, toiletries and shelf-stable food, in addition to the ready-made meals.
In 2024, it saw 12,000 visits from students. Those visit numbers are up 300% so far this year, according to Allen Wallace, a spokesman for the hospitality school.
And with federal food benefits set to run out of funding at the end of the week amid the ongoing government shutdown, Feed the Flock has tried to prepare in case any students who had been receiving those benefits come in need of a meal.

After all, in 2022, USC’s hospitality department surveyed students and found 46% of respondents had experienced food insecurity at some point during their college career.
“That number tends to be higher amongst international students and international graduate students, who also are probably here on campus with significant others and/or children,” said professor Scott Taylor, who leads Feed the Flock. “So, you can imagine, if that student is food insecure, so are the other people in their household.”
To feed those in need each week, culinary students and faculty come up with creative ways to use any items left from the school’s bulk-ordered food. They prepare and package about 50 meals every Thursday afternoon, Taylor said.
Over the summer, that included leftover chocolate, marshmallows and pie crust to make s’more pies. One man, a foreign exchange student from Myanmar, enjoyed the dessert so much that he came back the next day for seconds, Taylor said.
“Oftentimes we’re not even able to get it out of our containers and into the refrigerator before students are coming to grab them, asking us what we packed that day,” Taylor said.

In addition to Thursday’s meals, Feed the Flock packages on Mondays and Fridays when there’s extra food available from Greek Village, campus dining or catered events at the president’s house. With the homecoming, they packaged an extra day.
The program is modeled after a similar program at the University of Tennessee, which is the lead partner on the federal grant that splits funding between the Knoxville college, USC and Montana State University.
Food4VOLS, as the Tennessee program is known, packages more than 500 meals a day — about 140,000 pounds of food across campus last year alone — Taylor said. He hopes to reach similar numbers at USC.
South Carolina’s share of the three-year federal grant is about $200,000, covering a portion of faculty salaries, as well as stipends for student research assistants.
In addition to feeding students, researchers are gathering data and coming up with curriculum to teach both public health and hospitality students about how to safely and effectively use food waste to mitigate food insecurity.
“For hospitality students in particular, one of my goals is to make sure they understand the role that hospitality operations play,” Taylor said.
“Anywhere you make food there’s food waste,” he said. “If I can get students to understand that food waste and hunger are the two dumbest problems we face as human beings, and that one of them can help fix the other, then I’ve done my job.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_0475-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-29 10:17:17.874214

(Alaska Division of Forestry photo)President Donald Trump plans to nominate Aaron Peterson, an attorney with the Alaska Department of Law’s natural resources division, for one of two open federal judgeships on the bench of the U.S. District Court for the District of Alaska.
The president’s plans were confirmed by the news organization Reuters, which published a copy of a questionnaire Peterson submitted to the U.S. Senate’s judiciary committee. 
Trump himself has not formally announced Peterson’s nomination, but state and federal officials confirmed the president’s plans with the Beacon.
Reuters reported that Trump is preparing to nominate two federal judges in other states as well as Peterson.
A message left on Peterson’s work phone was not returned Tuesday afternoon. 
According to a copy of Peterson’s questionnaire, a member of Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s federal transition team encouraged him to apply to a committee formed by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, to vet possible candidates for the federal judiciary. 
According to state voter records, Peterson is a Republican. He identified himself in the questionnaire as a member of the Federalist Society, whose members generally follow Republican legal principles and support President Donald Trump.
Records published by the Federal Elections Commission and the Alaska Public Offices Commission do not list any political contributions by Peterson. 
Attorney General-designee Stephen Cox served on the Sullivan committee. By email, he called Peterson an “outstanding choice.”
“He’s demonstrated a remarkable ability to navigate complex issues with fairness and integrity, including during his representation of the Board of Fisheries. His extensive understanding of both civil and criminal law, honed through his experience as a prosecutor, makes him uniquely qualified for this position. Alaska needs judges who are equipped to handle the complex cases before them and the realities of our state, and I am confident that Aaron will be an excellent addition to the bench,” Cox wrote.
Alaska has three federal judgeships but only one sitting federal judge. Judge Timothy Burgess retired at the end of 2021, and Judge Joshua Kindred resigned in disgrace in 2024 amid a sexual scandal.
Since then, Alaska’s two U.S. senators have been divided about who to pick as replacements and how to pick those replacements. Under longstanding Senate tradition, judge picks normally advance only with the assent of both home state senators.
As a result of the senators’ disagreements and Sullivan’s decision to not attempt to fill a vacancy under President Joe Biden, the judgeship vacated by Burgess is now the fifth-oldest vacancy among 50 in the federal court system.
Sullivan has not disclosed the names of judicial candidates that he examined through a special committee designed to serve as an alternative to the Alaska Bar Association’s traditional review process. 
Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, disclosed the names of applicants she received and solicited opinions from the Bar Association. Peterson’s application was not among those initially received by Murkowski.
Through a spokesperson, Murkowski said she learned about Peterson’s nomination from the White House.
“After speaking extensively with him last week about his many qualifications, I informed the White House that I would support his nomination. Alaska’s District Court has had two vacancies for far too long, and I hope the White House will soon announce a second qualified nominee whom I can support to fill out the bench,” Murkowski said. 
According to Peterson’s questionnaire, he met with Murkowski on Oct. 23, seven months after being interviewed by Sullivan and four months after his initial interview by the White House Counsel’s Office. Since September, according to the questionnaire, he has been in regular contact with White House and Department of Justice officials.
By email, Sullivan said Peterson has “extensive legal experience.”
“Throughout his career, which includes military service, Aaron has demonstrated a commitment to the rule of law and federalism. He also understands the principle that the job of a federal judge is to interpret the law, not to make policy,” Sullivan said. “I’d like to thank each of the members of the Alaska Federal Judiciary Council, who worked with me to fully vet a number of well-qualified Alaska nominees, including Aaron. The council’s diligent work and input are invaluable in ensuring Alaskans are represented by jurists and citizens of the highest caliber. I also want to thank President Trump and his team for working closely with my office on identifying outstanding judges who will serve Alaska and our country well.”
According to the information Peterson submitted to the U.S. Senate’s judiciary committee, he was born in Anchorage in 1981 and served in the U.S. Air Force from 2000 to 2003 before attending the University of Alaska Anchorage, graduating in 2007. He attended Gonzaga University School of Law and graduated in 2010.
After graduation, he returned to Alaska, serving first as a clerk to Justice Michael Spaan of the Alaska Supreme Court, then as a prosecutor with the Municipality of Anchorage.
The Alaska Bar Association’s directory says he was admitted to the state bar on Nov. 16, 2010.
Peterson worked in the Anchorage District Attorney’s office starting in 2012, including on violent felonies, such as murder and sexual assault. He moved to the Department of Law’s office of special prosecutions in 2015 before beginning work with the Department of Law’s natural resources section in 2019.
Since joining that section, he’s prosecuted high-profile criminal cases, including a 2018 incident in which two Matanuska-Susitna Borough men illegally killed a black bear and her two squealing cubs within their den.
More recently, Peterson has represented the state in an ongoing case that challenges the state’s current two-tier system of subsistence fishing management. He also represented the state in a lawsuit that challenged salmon fishery management in Cook Inlet.
“If confirmed,” Peterson said in his questionnaire, “I will recuse myself from any case where I have ever played a role. Further, I will evaluate any potential conflict or issue that could give rise to the appearance of a conflict, on a case-by-case basis and determine appropriate action, including recusal where necessary.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/240222-Aaron-Peterson-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-29 10:01:07.420549

(Photo courtesy of Drake University)More than one year after expressing its wish to make the Republic of Panama a “global outpost” of Bulldog education and outreach, Drake University announced Tuesday it will launch new degree pathways for Panamanian students in partnership with social innovation community organization.
The Des Moines private university will work with Ciudad del Saber, or City of Knowledge, to offer a three-year degree program in which students would earn a bachelor’s degree in data analytics and a minor in artificial intelligence, according to a news release. Students would also have the option to pursue other programs through a “2+2” model, the release stated, where students would finish their first two years of study in Panama then come to Drake to complete their degrees.
Ciudad del Saber is located in Panama City in front of the Panama Canal, its website stated, and is described as “an innovative community that drives social change through humanism, science and business.” The campus houses different groups and organizations in education, research, entrepreneurship, science and technology, the release stated.

“At Ciudad del Saber, we are committed to elevating Panama’s academic landscape by attracting world-class higher education institutions,” said Jorge Arosemena Román, executive president of the Ciudad del Saber Foundation, in the release. “Drake University brings immense value through a cutting-edge program focused on Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence. This initiative will empower local talent, build critical capabilities, and contribute meaningfully to our country’s development.”
The accelerated data analytics program will take students three years and one summer to complete, and will be offered entirely on the Ciudad del Saber campus. Those who go through this program will have a “guaranteed internship with a leading Panamanian company or organization,” the release stated.
Students enrolled in a 2+2 program will spend their first two years in Panama City as well, according to the release, where they’ll study “liberal arts curriculum” as well as data analytics and AI. Once they come to Des Moines to complete their Drake education, students can keep studying these topics or branch out into computer science, information systems, international business or other areas of study, the release stated.
Those studying in the U.S. will have the chance to apply for the federal Operational Practical Training program, the release stated, which would allow them to work in the U.S. for one year, with potential extension.
“This program is built to meet the growing demand for data analysts and artificial intelligence experts worldwide,” said Drake University President Marty Martin in the release. “With Drake’s deep and long-standing ties to the Republic of Panama, a demand for professionals that is outpacing the global talent pipeline, and Panama’s position as a thriving hub for the global supply chain, we couldn’t be more excited to bring this highly in-demand program to fruition at Ciudad del Saber.”

From CalMatters Capitol reporter Jeanne Kuang:
California is one of 23 states suing President Donald Trump’s administration trying to force it to use emergency money to cover food benefits for millions of poor families during the federal government shutdown, Gov. Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta said Tuesday. 
More than five million Californians rely on the program each month, known in California as CalFresh, nationally as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and colloquially as food stamps. 
The federally-funded benefits amount to about $1 billion delivered to Californians’ electronic benefits cards each month to spend on groceries; the program lowers the state’s poverty rate by 3 percent, state Health and Human Services Secretary Kim Johnson said Tuesday. The average family receiving CalFresh gets $330 a month. 
Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture indicated it wouldn’t send the money for November as the federal government remained shut down, an about-face from prior department plans — and prior government shutdowns. Congress hasn’t passed a bill funding the federal government, as Democrats and Republicans remain in a stalemate over whether to extend health care premiums subsidies that Trump wants to cut.
State officials are warning of spiking hunger and demand at food banks when recipients have their monthly benefits withheld next week for the first time in the program’s 60-year history. Last week, Newsom fast-tracked $80 million in previously-approved state funds toward food banks and called up the National Guard to help deliver aid. On Tuesday, he slammed the administration for withholding benefits as Americans head into the holidays.
Newsom and Bonta argue it’s unlawful not to pay the benefits when the USDA has $5 to $6 billion in contingency funding that Congress has already allowed for emergency use on the program. The department spends about $8 billion monthly providing food aid nationwide. 
A department spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. A banner on its website blamed Democrats for the shutdown, falsely stating they were using it to push health care for undocumented immigrants.

Young men need help, and CA is trying to provide it

Troubling statistics concerning young men’s mental health and well being have prompted a state effort to lead a series of initiatives aimed at helping them, writes CalMatters’ Adam Echelman.
Of the roughly 4.6 million Californians ages 16 to 24, nearly 500,000 of them, or more than 10%, are considered disconnected — meaning they do not go to work or attend school. The majority of these disconnected teens and young adults are men. 
Men are also four times more likely than women to die by suicide; have higher rates of cardiovascular diseases and cancer; and are more likely to use drugs and to overdose. 
State officials and agencies are trying to address the issue. In a July executive order, Newsom detailed the “alarming rise in suicides and disconnection among California’s young men and boys” and called for a series of education, health and career state initiatives to assist men. The governor later unveiled in September a $5 million grant program to create more mentorship opportunities for young men.
The mental health team at California Health and Human Services helped set up nearly 250 billboards across major cities promoting the 9-8-8 suicide and crisis number, which featured the faces of young men. Funding from Proposition 1 — a state mental health bond that voters passed last year — is also being used to increase the number of male therapists.

Lawmakers try to resuscitate hospital

A pair of recently introduced congressional bills may help a shuttered hospital in a California rural town, but the road to reopening its doors remains unclear and difficult, reports CalMatters’ Ana B. Ibarra.
Democratic U.S. Sen. Adam Schiff and Republican U.S. Rep. Doug LaMalfa of Richvale are pushing two bills that would restore Glenn Medical Center’s “critical access” status, something it had for more than 20 years before having it revoked in April by the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Critical access hospitals can receive more federal money.
The revoked status left Glenn Medical Center with a budget gap it could not fill. It ceased operations on Sept. 30, leaving Glenn County without its only hospital and 150 health workers without a job. 
But besides restoring its critical access status, the hospital would also need a lot of cash to reopen immediately — particularly because it takes months before a hospital receives reimbursement from insurers, and the facility needs money to bring back and pay doctors, nurses and other workers.
A spokesperson for American Advanced Management, the for-profit company that owns Glenn Medical Center, estimated it would cost tens of millions of dollars to bring back the medical center.

California lawmakers passed a bill in September to revert the excise tax on cannabis to 15% until 2028, suspending a 19% hike. CalMatters’ Nadia Lathan and video strategy director Robert Meeks have a video segment on the measure, which aims to help legal sellers compete with an illicit market, as part of our partnership with PBS SoCal. Watch it here.

California Voices
CalMatters columnist Dan Walters: As Newsom edges closer to full-fledged presidential candidacy, he faces escalating scrutiny from naysayers — but oftentimes he can be his own worst enemy.
CalMatters contributor George B. Sánchez-Tello: The abrupt closure of a Spanish-language television news station eliminated one of the main sources of reliable information in California’s central coast — and could have ripple effects on voting and civic engagement.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-10-29 12:42:01+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,"Drawbridge, Green Line investments top narrower MBTA capital plan",Chris Lisinski,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/transportation/drawbridge-green-line-investments-top-narrower-mbta-capital-plan/,"Boxed in by prior commitments, inflation, and federal uncertainty, the MBTA is narrowing its approach to its five-year capital plan to focus on projects such as replacement of the North Station Draw One bridge.","YOU DON’T HAVE TO read between the lines too closely to see the more constrained approach MBTA officials want to take to construction projects and big-ticket maintenance in the near future in its capital investment plan. 
Facing pressure from inflation, federal uncertainty, and previous funding commitments, the T will focus on a trio of major capital projects further along in the pipeline, keeping the universe of work smaller than in prior planning cycles. 
To one watchdog, the new messaging is a realistic, “honest” approach that more clearly communicates the limits of the T’s capital budget. 
“For far too long, government entities have overpromised and underdelivered,” said Brian Kane, executive director of the MBTA Advisory Board. “It makes common sense to me to be honest with the public what is and is not possible given existing resources.” 
The T’s capital investment plan is a rolling five-year document updated annually. In May, agency overseers approved a $9.8 billion plan to cover fiscal years 2026 through 2030. (It’s not yet clear what the bottom line will be on the 2027-2031 version.) 
Early in the process for developing the next version, the T has limited flexibility as a result of inflation, tariffs, and what MBTA Deputy Chief of Capital Strategy Michael Malia called “federal funding uncertainty writ large.” Employees of the transit agency, who this time of year typically get a chance to suggest where additional dollars should be directed, have been told to keep their focus narrow. 
In past cycles, capital funding requests tended to reflect the steep costs of maintaining and upgrading the oldest transit system in the country. Last year, staff proposals totaled about $13.5 billion even though only about $1 billion was available for new commitments, according to Malia. 
But this time around, Malia said, the T is taking a “new approach.”  
Officials asked staff to limit their requests only to areas where additional money is needed to finish existing projects or to fund the most important maintenance and repairs. The goal is to keep resources focused on a handful of areas while navigating an uncertain fiscal outlook. 
“I think the T is putting down a marker that their approach going forward is to do maintenance, reconstruction, and replacement of existing infrastructure, and any sort of expansion project [or] big megaproject is going to have to be paid for elsewhere, [such as] by the commonwealth itself,” Kane said. 
In the next three years, a trio of projects will take up much of the MBTA’s available capital funding: the roughly $1.2 billion replacement of the North Station commuter rail drawbridge, the $1 billion procurement of new “Type 10” trains for the Green Line, and the effort to stockpile enough money to qualify for a crucial federal grant that would fund Green Line infrastructure improvements. 
To secure that grant, which could help cover power and signal upgrades needed to accommodate the newer trolleys, the T needs to program $1.9 billion in matching funds over the next two years, Malia said.  
About 45 percent of the T’s current five-year capital plan comes from the agency itself, which borrows $600 million per year to cover these expenses and then repays that money over time. Another 40 percent comes from federal sources, and state government pays for 14 percent, according to an analysis by the MBTA Advisory Board. 
Some projects get funding outside of the capital plan. The T gained an additional $850 million in bonding capacity last week, essentially allowing it to borrow more money for infrastructure work, thanks to an accounting maneuver that deployed revenue from the voter-approved surtax on wealthy households. 
Those dollars will help fund a bus maintenance facility in Arborway, a rail layover facility at Boston’s Widett Circle, Green Line improvements, and the purchase of new commuter rail locomotives.  
“It’s interesting to come here saying ‘We’re getting something great, but it’s still going to be challenging going forward,’ but it is. This is the world we’re living in,” Malia told the T’s Board of Directors last week. “We have a legacy system that has a tremendous amount of need, but we’re doing everything we can to make sure we’re meeting that efficiently, appropriately and with the proper vision.” 
Kane, whose group represents cities and towns that help fund the T, said the narrower focus will slow down work on overhauling other, non-Arborway bus maintenance facilities to support battery-powered electric vehicles. It’s also likely to keep blue-sky ideas, such as extending the Green Line’s E Branch, in hypothetical territory. 
He noted that the two most recent major expansions — the Green Line Extension into Somerville and Medford, and the commuter rail’s South Coast Rail — were “projects agreed upon in the 1990s.” 
“There’s nothing else on the proverbial drawing board,” Kane said. “I don’t think anything like that will happen in the foreseeable future.” 
The T’s capital budget, he added, “is simply too constrained to consider major expansion projects.” His group has long called on the MBTA to prioritize infrastructure investments that strengthen service instead of pursuing heavier-lift extensions. 
The nuts-and-bolts need is significant. In 2023, T officials said it would cost $24.5 billion to bring all of its assets into a state of good repair. 
“Politicians and leaders don’t get credit for preventing things going wrong. They get credit for cutting ribbons,” Kane said. “It’s cheaper over the long run, as we all know, to maintain what you have as you go and put money aside as you go to replace things at some point. We don’t do that. No one does that in the public sector.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/drawbridge3-scaled.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-29 08:56:11.802556
,California,2025-10-29 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,Half a million young Californians aren’t in school or work. Most are men,Adam Echelman,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/10/men-in-crisis-california/,"Thousands of men in California are neither working nor in school. Gov. Gavin Newsom has called it a “crisis,” both for the labor market and for men’s mental health.","In summary
Thousands of men in California are neither working nor in school. Gov. Gavin Newsom has called it a “crisis,” both for the labor market and for men’s mental health. 


If you ask Jodeah Wilson how his life got off track, he’ll say it’s all about money. 
He needs money for November rent. He also needs money to pay back the tuition he owes for the spring semester at Sacramento State University, which would allow him to re-enroll. Until then, he’s stuck in limbo.
“All I need is a goddamn job so I can pay this off myself,” he said. But it’s been months and so far, he’s still unemployed.
To state leaders and researchers, though, it’s more than just money. California has nearly 500,000 young people ages 16 to 24 who are in the same predicament, neither working nor in school. Finding them a job is part of the solution, but it goes much deeper than that. Many are struggling socially and emotionally, too, making it even harder to move forward. 
Men are particularly at risk. In July, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order to address “the alarming rise in suicides and disconnection among California’s young men and boys.”
It’s a “crisis,” Newsom told former President Bill Clinton in an interview at the Clinton Global Initiative last month. “Look at the dropout rates. Look at the depths of despair. Look at the issues around loneliness. Look at every critical category. It’s just blinking red lights for young men.” 
Newsom pointed to Charlie Kirk as a model for how to make young men feel heard and get them re-engaged politically, albeit for Trump. Then he slammed Democrats for ignoring these young men and their needs.
Wilson is convinced he’s an exception to these trends and that his unemployment is temporary. He talks fast, speaking in short sentences, repeating himself when needed, like a coach hyping up a team. When he gets excited or gestures for emphasis, a dreadlock falls from his bun and shakes with his words. 
“I’ve been persistent,” he said. “You can check Indeed. You can check Glassdoor. You can check my network. You can check how many career fairs I attended, how many internships I’ve acquired.”
His checking account has $76, and his savings account has 8 cents, he said during an interview earlier this month. Despite his persistence, he’s worried about becoming homeless in November  if a job doesn’t materialize soon.

Of the roughly 4.6 million Californians between the ages of 16 and 24, more than 10% are considered disconnected, meaning they’re neither working nor in school, according to Kristen Lewis, the director of the research organization Measure of America. The majority are men, and Black and Native American men have higher rates. 
The reasons so many young men drop out of school and work are varied. Economists point to rising automation or the loss of male-dominated manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Some of these men have disabilities or are struggling with addiction or mental health challenges. Many are incarcerated — California’s prisons are 96% male. Most of California’s homeless population is male too. 
For Newsom, though, it’s not just about men’s role in the economy or education. In the executive order, he points to a slew of other disturbing statistics:

Nearly 1 in 4 men under the age of 30 say they have no close friends, a “five-fold increase since 1990” and “with higher rates of disconnection for Black males.”
Men are four times more likely than women to die by suicide — a disparity that has grown over the past few decades.
Men also have higher rates of cardiovascular diseases and cancer.

Wilson, who is both Black and Native American, said his issues are just a product of the job market. He has been rejected by restaurants, call centers and delivery services over the past two years, representing more than 50 different online job applications on Indeed alone. He’s done some seasonal or temporary work, he said, such as a four-hour catering shift about once a month, but other than that, he’s had little professional luck. 
Regardless of the reason, the sole fact that he is neither working nor in school right now could have an impact on his future quality of life, even if he does find a job soon. Lewis, the Measure of America director, pointed to a longitudinal study of young people in similar situations. It found they’re likely to make less money and have worse health outcomes by the time they reach their 30s. The longer a person is unemployed and out of school, she said, the greater the likelihood of long-term consequences.
No car and no financial aid
In one of Wilson’s communications classes at Sac State, a professor compared adulthood to the experience of climbing a rope, where every responsibility or misfortune is a knife, cutting off those who are too weak to climb any higher. 
Wilson said he feels like he’s at the bottom of the rope and about to get cut off.
He started Sac State in the spring of 2024 with $20,000 in his bank account, money that he’d saved by working at Red Robin while attending community college. But one year later, he had spent most of it.

In January, Wilson was driving southbound on I-5 from his hometown of Redding toward Sac State, ready to start the spring semester. Near Arbuckle, he noticed the temperature gauge on his 2002 Honda Accord suddenly swung right. The car was slowing down, even though his foot was still on the gas. He pulled over to the breakdown lane and watched steam pour from the hood. By the time he had towed the car to a mechanic, it was too late, he said — part of the engine had melted.
Without a car, he struggled to find a job, he said. His grades started to slip, too. “I needed to stop focusing on school and focus instead on how the hell I’m going to get this rent and tuition paid.”
For Lewis, who has long studied the struggles that young people face, it’s everyday setbacks — a broken car, failing grades — that often set someone on the path to dropping out of school or abandoning the workforce. “Young people who are out of school and out of work basically need what all young people need,” she said. “They need guidance. They need help. They need understanding. They need a chance to try and fail and try again.” 
California offers generous financial aid for the majority of students enrolled at California State University campuses, covering tuition and daily living costs such as food and housing, but Wilson doesn’t qualify. Although he’s 22, he’s still considered a child for the purposes of financial aid, and his father, who owns a construction company, and his father’s new wife, a paralegal, collectively make too much money for him to qualify for state or federal aid, he said.

Wilson’s father helped out a little over the spring semester, sending a few hundred dollars to his bank account when funds were low, but the major costs, such as rent and tuition, have always been Wilson’s sole responsibility. He’s proud of that. 
“(My father) supports me where it’s necessary, but in other aspects of my life, he shouldn’t, because I’m a man. I’m supposed to kind of do what I got to do,” said Wilson. Though he finished the spring semester, he owes over $4,000 in missed tuition payments, which he has to pay before he can re-enroll. 
Ten years of depression, never seeking help
If you ask Will Rose how his life got off track, he’ll say it’s all about mental health. 
After dropping out of college 10 years ago, Rose, now 29,  always thought he might return, though he never did. He worked retail jobs, mostly for Target, while living at his father’s house in Hermosa Beach. In retrospect, he said he was often depressed, though he wasn’t conscious of it at the time. 
At night after working a shift or in the middle of the day, during one of his stints of unemployment, Rose would drive around the corner to the 7-Eleven and return home with a Big Gulp, Cheetos or Takis. “Anything that would overload my senses,” he said.  
Over the course of 10 years, he gained more than 60 pounds. When he felt stuck, he would buzz off all his hair as a way to regain control over his body and his life.

As a follow-up to Newsom’s executive order, state agencies submitted a 75-page document outlining the work they’re doing to support young men. The mental health team at California Health and Human Services  highlighted a federally funded project run by the state, which helped set up nearly 250 billboards in all of California’s major cities featuring the faces of young men, looking hopeful or determined. Next to each face is the 9-8-8 suicide and crisis number.  The goal is to help men see that “it’s OK to not feel OK, and it’s OK to ask for help,” said Ahn Bui, a project director at the California Health and Human Services Agency. 
Her colleague at the agency, Stephanie Welch, added that most mental health professionals are female, which makes it even harder for some men to feel welcome in a therapist’s office. Nationally, suicide is a leading cause of death among men ages 15 to 44 — with more men dying by suicide than cancer, heart disease or homicide. Yet men are less likely to seek treatment for mental health issues than women, Bui said. 
Men are also more likely to use drugs and to overdose.  
Last year, Rose was working as a contractor, delivering packages for Amazon part time. When he wasn’t working, he was using meth. When the high was good, he felt invincible, infallible, he said, even if he was just sitting on his couch. But when it was bad, he would watch hours of porn. 
Once, he spent two full days so high that he couldn’t sleep. He was alone in his room, he said — his thoughts were racing so fast that he couldn’t recognize who he was or that he was even human. His dad was still in the house, though Rose said he felt so “dystopian” that he didn’t even know he needed help. “I was seriously suicidal. I was seriously going to end it.” 
In May 2024, Rose admitted himself to a psychiatric ward near downtown Los Angeles. 
What’s happening to ‘prime-age’ men?
As a child, Rose was in foster care and lived in roughly 25 different homes, including some where he said he was sexually abused, repeatedly.  He only remembers a few of the homes, he said; the rest are a blur. Mostly, he remembers getting adopted at age 10 and moving to his first permanent home in Hermosa Beach.
Sitting in the silence of his hospital room in the psychiatric ward last year, and in the months that followed, Rose said he began to reflect on the impact of his childhood trauma. Bui, a psychiatrist by training, prefers to use the clinical term, “adverse childhood experiences,” to describe what Rose has gone through. Sexual abuse, for instance, is linked to mental health challenges and substance use issues later in life, she said. 
This summer, with help from his father, Rose got a new car and finally moved into his own apartment in San Pedro, just a few blocks from the Los Angeles Harbor, as he continued working for Amazon. In his spare time, he began going on short meditative walks.

But soon after moving, he lost his job. “I was cutting corners,” he acknowledged, marking packages as delivered so he could leave work a few minutes early. “With everything being AI-based, they just keep track of everything you do. They’re just so strict.”
At 29, Rose is what economists consider a “prime-age man,” meaning that he’s in the peak age for employment. Since the 1960s, the number of prime age men opting out of the labor force has grown, especially among those without college degrees, according to a recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. It’s unprecedented, Newsom said in his executive order. 
Beyond the usual labor market explanations, such as automation, researchers have analyzed other potential trends. Some point to family dynamics, such as the rising number of men who are living with a parent or serving as caretakers. 
One 2017 study found a link between the advent of new and improved video games and the decline in men’s working hours. Today, the average non-working man spends 520 hours a year on “recreational computer time,” most of it video games. For comparison, the average employee works about 2,000 hours a year. 
State agency officials say they’re leading a series of education, health and career initiatives aimed at men, including using money from Proposition 1, a state mental health bond that passed last year, to increase the pipeline of male therapists. Last month, Newsom said his office is starting a $5 million grant program to create more mentorship opportunities for young men.  
What causes a person to leave school or work varies, and so do the solutions for bringing them back, said Lewis, with Measure of America. “There tends to be a desire for some sort of silver bullet,” she said, such as summer jobs programs or employment assistance. 
“I mean, it’s great to get someone a job, but if someone has a traumatic upbringing, and is dealing with a substance use disorder and has mental health challenges, they need other kinds of support.”
‘I feel like I can pick myself up back on my feet’
Now unemployed again, Rose walks several times a day, at all hours. On good days, he wakes up at 6 a.m., puts his phone in a drawer and starts his morning walk. A few blocks from his house is a greenway lined with palm trees that stretches along the water, where he walks for about 10 minutes, ambling slowly, passing markers along the way: a Swedish church, a homeless shelter, a rehabilitation center. 
Seeing the rehabilitation center is a relief, he said. “If shit ever hits the fan, I have something to fall back on.”

There are bad days too, hours that he lies in bed, scrolling TikTok, where the app’s algorithm shows him videos about conspiracy theories, motivational speakers or existential questions about the universe. In July, while on his usual walking route late at night, a man approached Rose, asked him where he’s from and punched him, fracturing his nose, before he could even respond. Rose said he suspects the man was high on meth, but stumbling home that night, he remembers worrying that others might see him and assume he was the one on drugs. “I just felt so defeated in that moment.”
Because the problems facing men and boys are so complex — spanning employment, health, and education — there is no “quick and easy answer,” said Brooks Allen, an education policy advisor to the governor and the executive director of the State Board of Education. He said Newsom’s initiative and other efforts by state agencies are an attempt to show these men that resources do exist and are tailored to their needs.

One of the organizations highlighted by Newsom is Improve Your Tomorrow, a Sacramento-based national nonprofit that supports young men of color. The organization referred Wilson to a job this past summer and helped him submit a petition to Sac State, asking the university to exclude his father’s income in its financial aid calculations. Wilson got the summer job, though it was only temporary. The university denied the petition. 
Earlier this year, when his car broke down, Wilson kept the news secret from his father, who only found out through a grandparent. His father was mad Wilson didn’t tell him but purchased him another car nonetheless.
Wilson said his father would likely want to help with rent this November, but he isn’t sure he would accept. “There’s a high chance that I would sleep in my car before he knows I’m homeless,” he said. “I feel like I can pick myself up back on my feet.”

,California,2025-10-29 12:30:00+00:00,CalMatters,"When this California Spanish-language TV station closed, a news desert opened for Latino viewers",George B. Sánchez-Tello,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/central-coast-spanish-tv-news/,"The loss of KMUV 23, a Telemundo affiliate in Salinas, adds to the atrophy of local journalism. It also harms civic engagement and public advocacy.","Univision and Telemundo were constantly on in Suzanne García’s childhood home in Santa Ana. For immigrant families like hers, Spanish-language news is not simply news translated from English; it’s news tailored to their experience, identity, interests and background, explained García, a professor at Cal State Monterey Bay. 
It doesn’t take an expert in bilingual and bicultural education like García to understand what it means for communities when these channels suddenly go dark.
KMUV 23, a Telemundo affiliate, was the Central California Coast’s only local, Spanish-language television news station. It abruptly shuttered in late September, eliminating one of the main sources of reliable information for viewers dependent on local reporting in their language.
“It’s a huge loss to not have Telemundo,” García said.
While much of the news coverage of the station’s closure focused on the English-language broadcast side, KION, and on the accelerating atrophy of local journalism, there are even fewer remaining options for the region’s Spanish-speakers — especially immigrants, who are vital to the economy but terrorized by raids on their communities.
The Salinas Valley is known as the salad bowl of the world. Field workers and farms produce more than 371 million pounds of fruits and vegetables. More than half the leaf and head lettuce consumed in the United States is grown here. 
Almost two-thirds of Monterey County’s residents are Latino, according to the U.S. Census. More than a quarter of residents are foreign born and the largest of that group — 102,772 people — are from Latin America. 
That’s too many people without a single source of local news in their main language.

Telemundo and KION are owned by Missouri-based News-Press & Gazette Co., which owns TV stations in 10 regions across the country, including Palm Springs and El Centro. 
On Sept. 23, KION posted on its website that effective 5 p.m. that day, it would begin airing news from KPIX, a station in the San Francisco Bay Area more than 100 miles away. 
KION’s closure came after the region’s two largest newspapers — the Salinas Californian and the Monterey County Herald — had already withered from daily publications to paywalled news sites. 
The collapse of the Californian ended El Sol, a local bi-weekly, Spanish-language newspaper. And it has been 20 years since the San Jose Mercury News closed Nuevo Mundo, its Spanish-language weekly. 
Local Spanish-language radio remains, but Sandy Santos, the last producer at KMUV, said there is a distinction between those stations and what KMUV offered. Local Spanish-language radio is not properly set up for reporting and fact-finding, she said.
“We have some radio, but it’s more music and entertainment, not news,” Santos said.
Salinas, like elsewhere, has seen the vacuum of local news lead to a rise of social media content creators. 
Alejandra Ruiz, a health outreach worker with Mujeres en Acción, said that, in the absence of trusted outlets and reporting, migrant communities are turning to social media for updates on immigration raids and local news. Garcia said even she is starting to do that.
Santos acknowledged that reliance on social media for news is the new reality, but “likes” and “shares” are not the same as reported fact.
“It leads to chaos, misinformation and half-truth,” Santos said.
In the meantime, locals will get Spanish-language television news from the Bay Area. Santos said Telemundo’s other Costa Central station north of Los Angeles still exists, but news from Santa Barbara, Santa Maria and Oxnard won’t help these locals.
“I just don’t know how useful that is for folks in Monterey County, Salinas or Santa Cruz,” she said.
Civic engagement and local accountability suffer
The closure of the region’s last locally produced Spanish-language news broadcast will have repercussions beyond media metrics and the commercial value of a captive audience. It could impact voting and civic engagement, García said, especially among mixed-status families, where some members are undocumented and others are citizens.
García remembers TV news coverage in 1994 of Proposition 187, the voter-approved initiative that sought to deny undocumented immigrants public education, social services and non-emergency medical aid. Los Angeles’ Telemundo and Univision stations reported on the ballot initiative from the perspective and understanding of immigrant communities, she recalled. 
Education policy shapes schools, she added, and Monterey County has high rates of English-learners and bilingual students. Residents, including immigrant and Spanish-only homes, need to be informed about school policy, including this summer’s freeze in federal funding for migrant education and looming federal budget cuts. 
Residents need to be aware of their right and duty to advocate for programs that serve themselves and the broader community. 
In general, the loss of local reporting ultimately correlates with a decline in civic engagement — think voting — and an increase in corruption, studies show. It doesn’t matter what language is spoken. We may soon know what that looks like for the Spanish-speaking population in Monterey County.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Clean energy advocates unsuccessfully petitioned the Utah Public Service Commission to direct the state’s largest electric utility to accelerate procurement processes for renewable energy. While their direct petition was denied, they aren’t counting the ruling as a defeat.
Utah Clean Energy asked commissioners to require PacifiCorp, Rocky Mountain Power’s parent company, to start an open call to identify potential developments that would qualify for clean energy tax credits expiring under congressional Republicans’ spending package, widely known as the “big, beautiful bill.” An action that, according to Utah Clean Energy’s calculations, could save ratepayers millions, if not billions of dollars in future energy costs. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In an order issued this month, the commission determined that it doesn’t have the authority to require a utility to solicit a specific generation resource. But, the order also clarified that in its rate-regulating duties, the commission will take into consideration whether Rocky Mountain Power evaluated projects that are eligible for the tax incentives — and that Rocky Mountain Power must “responsibly and prudently evaluate” these limited-time opportunities to keep energy costs low. 
“While the (public service commission) has no authority to dictate RMP’s resource procurement decisions, the reasonableness of RMP’s actions in evaluating and acting on any time-sensitive opportunities may certainly be a material factor in future rate proceedings,” the commission wrote.
Any requests by Rocky Mountain Power to expedite applications to procure resources that may qualify for preferential tax treatment in a limited time will be granted, according to the order.
The commission may have denied the request, but it also started a conversation before it was too late to capture the incentives, Logan Mitchell, climate scientist and energy analyst at Utah Clean Energy said. 
“In some ways this is almost the best outcome,” Mitchell said. “They’re saying ‘hey, we expect you guys to do your job and take advantage of opportunities for ratepayers to build resources.’”
Request to PacifiCorp to accelerate clean energy developments could save ratepayers millions

Mitchell also highlighted that Utah Clean Energy’s request didn’t ask the utility to procure extra resources it didn’t need, but to use generation included in the company’s resource plan.
“These are things that they’re planning to build anyway, and the question is whether or not we’ll get tax credits with them or not,” Mitchell said.
According to Rocky Mountain Power, that’s something the company could figure out through bilateral negotiations without this process, the utility said in a comment asking the commission to deny the advocates’ request. 
The utility also said that its regional resource planning assumed the end of tax subsidies for renewables, which resulted in the removal of over 3,700 MW of wind, 3,366 MW of solar and 2,382 MW of storage from their plan. 
“This shows that since the Company does not need new resources to serve Utah customers, rapid procurement of resources, even if they are tax-advantaged, will impose unnecessary costs on Utah customers,” the company wrote.
A conversation starter
States like Colorado and Arizona have issued executive orders aiming to fast-track the procurement processes of new clean energy projects before the federal incentives end, so the clean energy advocates wanted to ensure Utah was also having similar debates.      
Especially, Mitchell said, since the organization has kept in touch with developers with existing projects that could reach agreements with Rocky Mountain Power for either development, or to purchase power.
State entities, like the Office of Consumer Services, commended Utah Clean Energy’s effort to capture the federal benefits. However, the office doesn’t believe that parties have adequate resources to participate in the proposal because of their current and upcoming regulatory workload.
“As an alternative, the (Office of Consumer Services) recommends that PacifiCorp identify shovel ready projects and bring them before the PSC under the waiver provision of the Utah Energy Resource Procurement Act,” the office wrote in a comment.
Interwest Energy Alliance, a trade association representing clean energy developers, said in a comment that “given the revised IRS guidance requiring a project to ‘commence construction,’ (before July, 2026) there is now a finite pool of available projects and development resources with a clear pathway to satisfying revised tax credit eligibility requirements and deadlines.” 
Therefore, processes must be expedited if the state wants to benefit from the outgoing tax incentives, according to the association.

Two authors whose books have been targeted by Alabama book bans criticized proposed state guidelines restricting content on library shelves. (Getty)The authors of two books targeted by activists trying to restrict access to books with LGBTQ+ themes for youth in libraries have criticized new state policies to move their books to adult sections.
Patricia McCormick, the author of “Sold,” a novel about human trafficking and child sexual exploitation, and Megan Pamela Ruth Madison, one of the writers of “Yes! No!: A First Conversation of Consent,” said the restrictions approved by the Alabama Public Library Service (APLS) Board starting in the summer of 2024 deprive children and teenagers of the ability to learn about issues affecting them and the world.
“All the books in our series talk about issues that many adults in the United States find difficult to talk about, and particularly difficult to talk about with young children,” Madison said. “In large part because they are not conversations that grownups have with us, with newer kids.”
McCormick said in a statement sent in early October that the APLS proposal “amounts to censorship.”
“It represents coercion from on high — and it tells young people, especially those who already feel unwelcome and underrepresented, that their stories do not belong,” the statement said.
For the past two years, a cadre of individuals appointed to the APLS Board have enacted policy changes to further restrict access to library materials. The board has required libraries to remove library materials deemed sexually explicit, obscene or inappropriate, or lose funding.
Critics have said the policy is being used to remove any content with any LGBTQ+ characters or themes. In the coming weeks, board members are expected to approve a policy to restrict minors from having access to library materials with positive depictions transgender individuals or “gender ideology,” a term the board has not defined.
The Fairhope Public Library is the lone library thus far that has its funding suspended.
Review process
Their actions stem from some in the community who repeatedly attended local library and APLS board meetings and read passages to prove the books are inappropriate to be part of the library’s collection.
The updated state administrative code bypasses processes and rules that local libraries had established for years. The process for local libraries begins with library staff reading publications that review potential books they may want to purchase. This includes the recommended age range for the book.
The reviewers of the books typically have credentials in library science or academic qualifications.
“We had a staff member years ago who reviewed adult nonfiction, and he had been a professor and had at least two master’s degrees,” said Mary Campbell, president- elect of the Alabama Library Association (ALLA). “He did nonfiction, historical, because that was what his concentration was in. He is currently an archivist with NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration).”
When the book is received, staff conduct their own review, at least for the more sensitive materials.
“When some of those books come in, they bring them to me and say, ‘Hey, I made a mistake, this really belongs, not in the kids’ section but somewhere else,’” said Craig Scott, past president of the Alabama Library Association. “So we do our own self-policing.”
“It is not on a whim,” Campbell said. “We do not just go on Amazon and purchase what is selling great on Amazon, although that might be one place that we look to see what is popular, but we do a lot of work beforehand to make sure we are getting the right books.”
‘Her confusion, her bewilderment, and her physical pain’
“Sold,” first published in 2006, is about a 13-year-old girl in Nepal sold into sexual slavery by her stepfather and her attempts to survive life in a brothel in India. McCormick said in the interview last week that she wanted the book to shed light on child trafficking and that she wanted to “be a part of the solution.”
“The scene is essential to the book, but it is written from the point of view of a 13-year-old girl. There isn’t any graphic language. It basically describes her confusion, her bewilderment, and her physical pain. I am very aware that when I am writing, I am writing for other people’s children. And I have no desire to brutalize the readers by using brutal language. I tried to use language that was appropriate to the 13-year-old narrator,” McCormick said in an interview last week.
McCormick said in the interview that she has visited schools to discuss the book and said that it has taught students about what their peers in other countries experience. Some, she said, have spoken about their personal experience with sexual assault.
Critics have repeatedly targeted the book over a scene in which the main character was sexually assaulted by a patron in a brothel while drugged. Critics of the Fairhope Public Library would read the passage then urge the board members to withhold state funding until the book is removed from the shelves during at least two APLS meetings in 2025 because they said the book was sexually explicit.
“Yes! No!: A First Conversation About Consent,” published in 2022, is part of a series aimed at helping educators and parents who want to have conversations with young children about topics such as race, gender and their bodies.
Critics have expressed concern about the book’s illustrations of sexual reproductive organs, which they believe makes it inappropriate for the children’s section.
Madison wrote the book with Jessica Ralli, a librarian, after hosting a series of workshops for teachers who asked for resources to inform their students about a host of issues, including consent.
“Our book equips young children with the language to keep themselves safe,” Madison said.
The new code would move both books into the adults’ section of local libraries. Both authors object to the moves, saying that they will deprive children and teens of important information.
“I believe that it belongs in the teens section because trafficking is something that happens to teenagers,” McCormick said in an interview last week. “And I think that a well-informed teenager is less vulnerable.”
Madison said her book aims to keep children safe.
“I don’t believe any parent has a right to decide what all children have access to, and I think my books are really good,” Madison said. “They are based on the research and based on decades of professional experience providing kids with accurate information about their bodies and the world so that they can keep themselves safe and be informed citizens in building a just and inclusive world for everybody.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Library-books.jpeg,,,2025-10-29 08:16:33.968357

Susie Lee on Tuesday criticized Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo for not doing more to provide substitute benefits to the hundreds of thousands of Nevadans who are supposed to receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits next month but who won’t because of the government shutdown.
Lee first called it “cruel” of the Trump administration to allow SNAP benefits to pause at all.
“There have been shutdowns in the past,” she said. “Never before in the history of shutdowns has food been cut off from millions of Americans. Donald Trump made this decision.”
But she added that the State of Nevada “is complicit by not figuring out how we can use emergency funding and turn it around quickly to get emergency funds into the hands of Nevadans.”
Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, on Tuesday announced his state has set up a state-level replacement that will provide $37.5 million per week to Virginia’s roughly 850,000 SNAP recipients.
The State of Nevada’s plan, announced by Lombardo’s office Monday, is to funnel $38.8 million to local food banks, which are expected to see a deluge of demand starting Saturday. 
Food banks have said it will be “impossible” to scale up to fill the gap left by SNAP.
Lee echoed that sentiment, saying that in order for food banks to meet the needs of Nevadans on SNAP for one month, they would need $270 million.
Lee’s comments came after a press conference in North Las Vegas to celebrate the state receiving $51 million in charter school grants. Lombardo and Lee both attended and then, separately, spoke to media after.
Lombardo, relying on recent Trump administration directives, emphasized that the state cannot seamlessly funnel millions of dollars into the federal system because it involves a third-party vendor and confidential information.
Lee rejected that, arguing there are ways to respond quickly. She said the state “could provide emergency payments to individuals in lieu of their SNAP benefits so that they can purchase food.”
Even without the use of U.S. Department of Agriculture SNAP data, there are other ways to determine those most in need, she added.
Lombardo described his approach as “more of an emergency measure.”
When asked about the possibility of tapping into the state’s flush Rainy Day Fund, Lombardo responded that it isn’t an option because Nevada law requires the state’s end fund balance to dip below 5% of Economic Forum revenue projections before accessing the money.
He did not acknowledge that the law also allows the governor and state legislators to access the Rainy Day Fund by declaring a fiscal emergency.
“This governor does have a choice,” Lee said of Lombardo. “He is complicit if he does not use the emergency fund. We have $1.3 billion in emergency funds, and you just heard him put up every excuse not to do it.”
When asked why the governor didn’t mention the declaration of a fiscal emergency as a possibility, Lombardo spokesperson Elizabeth Ray said the state “anticipates the ability to fund the currently identified funding shortfalls without tapping into the Rainy Day Fund.”
She continued, “However, as the federal shutdown continues, the State will consider additional appropriations as necessary.”
Lombardo during his comments noted that the S in SNAP stands for ‘supplemental.’
“It’s not intended to be all encompassing, to solve all the food needs across the board,” he said. “So, we are supplementing that to get us through mid-November. If the shutdown continues, we will take legislative action.”
Such actions could involve reverting unused American Rescue Plan Act dollars, which could be done through the governor’s office and the legislative Interim Finance Committee. Or it could involve “a forum that may or may not” be a special legislative session, something that the governor and lawmakers have been contemplating for months and is rumored to be happening in mid-November.
Ford on suing Trump
Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford on Tuesday was among 22 attorneys general and three governors — all Democrats — that sued the Trump administration over its shutdown SNAP policy.
“The Trump administration has made a cruel — and an illegal — choice,” said Ford during a press conference Tuesday afternoon. “Donald Trump claims that he can’t move money around, but notably, he just gave $20 billion to Argentina. He just bought two new jets for over $300 million so that (Secretary of Homeland Security ) Kristi Noem could go around the country posing for pictures. But when it comes to feeding Americans, they’re cut off.”
Despite holding $6 billion in a reserve fund, USDA said last week it would not process November SNAP benefits without fiscal 2026 funding approved by Congress.
The USDA’s refusal to provide November benefits runs contrary to precedent from other recent shutdowns, and even the department’s own Sept. 30 contingency plan that said the contingency fund would be used to continue benefits through the shutdown.
The administration has also shuffled some other money to provide funding for certain programs, but not SNAP.
The Democratic officials said those factors made the decision arbitrary and capricious, a violation of federal administrative law, and asked a federal court in Massachusetts to order the USDA’s move unlawful and block the administration from putting it in place.
No Republican leaders joined the lawsuit, though some Republicans have encouraged the Trump administration to release the USDA contingency funds.
Lombardo, at the press event Tuesday morning, said those funds “would be very beneficial.”
“That was a request that we had made,” he said, “and we were advised that would not happen.”

Ibarra,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/10/glenn-medical-congressional-proposal/,"Glenn Medical Center has been in the same location for decades, but a narrow interpretation of a federal rule shut it down. Now thousands of people have to leave the county for emergency care.","In summary
Glenn Medical Center has been in the same location for decades, but a narrow interpretation of a federal rule shut it down. Now thousands of people have to leave the county for emergency care. 


Four weeks after Glenn County lost its only hospital, two California lawmakers in Congress have revived hopes for its return — though the road to reopening remains uncertain.
Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa introduced two separate bills that aim to help Glenn Medical Center, a 25-bed hospital in the rural town of Willows. Each proposal would restore the hospital’s “critical access” status, a designation that brings increased Medicare reimbursement and regulatory flexibilities that help small hospitals. 
This past spring, the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services notified Glenn Medical that it was no longer eligible for the critical access title because it didn’t meet a key distance rule that requires it to be at least 35 miles from the next closest hospital. The nearest hospital, Colusa Medical Center, is 32 miles away, the agency told the hospital in a letter. Glenn Medical Center unsuccessfully appealed the decision, noting that the distance between the two hospitals has not changed in decades. 
Without the revenue that comes from having critical access status, operations would be unsustainable, hospital management previously told CalMatters. Once administrators told staff that the hospital would have to close, workers started to leave for other jobs. The hospital ceased operations on Sept. 30, earlier than administrators first anticipated.

Changing federal policy to restore the hospital’s critical access status, however, would not enable Glenn Medical to reopen immediately. Even if Congress approves Schiff’s or LaMalfa’s bill, the hospital is still left with another problem: reopening a closed facility requires cash, and lots of it.
“Having the critical access designation reinstated, which is my understanding of what the bill would do, that at least makes [reopening] a possibility,” said Matthew Beehler, a spokesperson for American Advanced Management, the for-profit company that owns Glenn Medical Center and several other rural hospitals in California. 
But, he said, “the reality is once the employees have left, you’re starting from scratch. We need to see this be successful first and then work with electeds to help identify potential funding sources,” he said.
Beehler did not have an exact figure, but reopening Glenn Medical, he said, would cost in the tens of millions of dollars.
Lawmakers craft rescue plans 
Schiff teamed up with Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi to introduce legislation that would amend the Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program, which helps fund critical access hospitals. Their bill would allow hospitals designated critical access as of Jan. 1, 2024 – including Glenn Medical Center – to keep that status. 
“The resulting closure of this hospital or others like it, is devastating and potentially deadly for California families,” Schiff said in a statement announcing his legislation. 
A day later, Rep. LaMalfa of Richvale proposed a different solution with the Rural Hospital Fairness Act, which would allow hospitals that are the only emergency providers in their county and that had an active critical access title at the end of 2024 to continue being eligible for the program.
In his bill announcement, LaMalfa said U.S. Health and Human Services, which oversees the Centers of Medicaid and Medicare Services, “initially indicated that Glenn Medical’s status would be restored, but CMS later refused to do so without legislation.”
CMS, says LaMalfa, “admits it made a mistake over 20 years ago when the hospital was first designated, but it’s the people of Glenn County who are being punished for it.” 
“That’s unacceptable,” LaMalfa added.
New costs to open a hospital
Glenn County’s 28,000 residents now are traveling farther for emergency care. The hospital, on its Facebook page, has redirected patients to the three next closest facilities: Colusa Medical Center, a 35-minute drive; Enloe Medical Center in Chico, about 45-minutes away; and St. Elizabeth Community Hospital in Red Bluff, about a 45-minute drive up Interstate 5.
Glenn County has two ambulances, and the longer drives to hospitals leaves them less time to respond to residents in need.Beehler at American Advanced Management said one advantage for Glenn Medical Center is that when it closed its doors, it only suspended its state license and did not terminate it. Reinstating a hospital license can be a costly and lengthy process.
American Advanced Management is the same company that reopened Madera Community Hospital earlier this year. It did so with the help of a $57 million loan from the state. Beehler said that part of the reason hospitals need such a big infusion of cash to restart is because it can be months before a facility receives reimbursement from insurers and public payers.
And it needs that money to bring back and pay physicians, nurses and other hospital workers, Beehler said, some of whom by now may have taken other opportunities.
Legislation is step one, Beehler said. The next challenge is finding “a source of funding directed to reopening efforts.”

Two of the ten Rosalynn Carter Fellowships for Mental Health Journalism were awarded to CalMatters journalists.


Two CalMatters journalists recently started their 2025-26 Rosalynn Carter Fellowships for Mental Health Journalism.
The Carter Center, which seeks to prevent and resolve conflicts, enhance freedom and democracy, and improve health, named 10 fellows this year, two of whom are CalMatters reporters Marisa Kendall and Joe Garcia. 
The fellowships challenge recipients to delve deeper into learning about mental health and substance use disorders and to share reliable information with the public related to caregiving, research and possible solutions to systemic challenges. Carter Center U.S. fellows receive a $10,000 stipend in addition to intensive training from leading mental health and journalism experts.
Fellows were selected by a committee of current and former journalists, mental health experts and the U.S. Fellowship Advisory Board.
Joe Garcia
Garcia joined CalMatters as a UC Berkeley Local News Fellow in 2024. He started writing while serving 21 years in the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. His unexpected journalism career began at the San Quentin News and led to bylines in the Sacramento Bee, Washington Post, MIT Tech Review, Alta Journal and The New Yorker.
Most notably, his 2023 article, “Listening to Taylor Swift in prison” for The New Yorker went viral online. In it, he chronicles the impact of Swift’s music on his personal growth and development. In a recent follow-up article, Garcia shares that he even wrote while in administrative segregation, called “the Hole” after he was accused of “incendiary comments” after speaking out about showering conditions.
Garcia writes: “No pens were allowed in the Hole — only the flimsy ink reservoirs from inside ballpoint cases. I had to twist paper tightly around the ink tubes, glue the paper in place with wet soap, and wait for it all to dry. I changed my sleep schedule so that I could work in the quiet of the night. We could only listen to music using small, hand-cranked radios, and I suffered through static to hear “Anti-Hero,” “Karma,” and “Snow on the Beach.”
He now lives in Los Angeles and writes for CalMatters. This summer, he took readers into San Quentin in a way only he could, writing about prisoners beautifying the walls with murals.
Marisa Kendall
Kendall is a CalMatters reporter focused on California’s homelessness crisis, a topic on which she has won multiple awards for sensitive and comprehensive coverage.
Kendall’s reporting has brought Californians the real-world view of homelessness and associated topics, including progress on mental health via CARE Courts, what happens after homeless encampments are cleared, and a look at where mental health money is going.
Prior to CalMatters, she covered housing and homelessness for the Bay Area News Group where she was part of a team that won a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the deadly Ghost Ship warehouse fire in Oakland. Kendall has also covered high-stakes court cases in Silicon Valley and crime in Southwest Florida. She is a Bay Area native and a graduate of American University.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/012825-LAHSA-Documents-MG-CM-04.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-29 08:16:33.968357

Reid said APT could possibly stop all PBS programming on the network (Andrea Tinker/Alabama Reflector)BIRMINGHAM — The director of Alabama Public Television (APT) said Tuesday that the outlet could drop PBS programming in the future.
Wayne Reid, executive director of APT, told the Alabama Education Television Commission that the network is looking into ways to fully separate from PBS after the Trump administration this summer slashed funding to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CBP), which funded public broadcasting around the country.
Commissioners at the meeting were split over the proposal. And because APT remains in a contract with PBS and other obstacles, Reid said the split may not happen.

“You’re going to have to redo our websites, redo our media library, because that’s all supported by PBS. Now, the traffic system is really set up for PBS,” Reid told commissioners.
CBP faced a $1.1 billion budget in July after Congress approved House Resolution 4. In 2023, APT reported that it received $2.4 million from CBP.
The budget cuts also meant that APT would have to cut NPR programming for WLRH in Huntsville. While APT has local coverage, NPR and PBS provided national coverage to the network through programs like PBS NewsHour.
Commissioner Bebe Williams said she thought cutting all PBS programming wasn’t the correct move for the network.
“When you cut off all the programming that we do, you’re cutting off so many programs I watch. And the people that pay money for what they want and we’re going to have to have the membership in order to be able to afford things,” Williams said.
Williams said the network should keep the children’s programming and Masterpiece, which broadcasts prestige dramas like Downton Abbey, Sherlock and Prime Suspect.
Board member Johnny Curry agreed that cutting all PBS programming would be detrimental to APT due to the amount of content the network gets from PBS.
“You have to be very careful about deciding whether to sever that relationship, because it’s my understanding that 90% of the programs that this network broadcasts come through and from PBS,” Curry said. “If you sever that relationship, and I’m not saying you should or shouldn’t, but if you sever it, you gotta come up with 90% of your programming to replace, and that includes all of the educational programming the children watch during the day, which is the main mission of this institution,” Board Member Johnny Curry said.
Commissioner Pete Conroy spoke in support of keeping PBS programming.
“This morning in Hoover, there was a church school, and every single morning, these six and seven year olds watch Daniel Tiger[‘s Neighborhood] before the bell rings. And that’s 300 moms that we’re going to have to talk to, because that would just be gone,” he said to the commission.
Commissioners William Green Jr., who joined the meeting via Zoom, and Les Barnett said APT should move away from PBS programming altogether.
“PBS right now carries a negative connotation, and there’s no telling what they will do, how they will do it, and then if they make a statement or move a certain way, APT is going to be thrown in with them,” Green said.
Barnett said funding PBS isn’t something he’s interested in continuing to do.
“Even if the federal Corporation for Public Broadcasting money came back in, I still don’t understand PBS. PBS has made themselves an atma to the President and a sizable chunk of the state legislature, and probably a sizable chunk of the 65% of people voted for Trump, and I’m one of those people in both categories,” he said. “I just, I don’t want to fund it, PBS has made themselves the enemy of what I stand with, and so I do not like them, and I don’t follow the philosophy of feeding the beast.”
Jack Williams, APT’s external affairs director, said he was given no indication that PBS programming should be dropped by state officials.
“The conversation is kind of focused around ‘How do we how do we help you guys, since you’ve lost federal funding,’ and we’re looking to do what we can this year, because in [20]27 there’s concern that the state may have to dip into the reserve funds for the first time since 2009 [or] 2010,” he said to the board.
Williams also mentioned to the commission that taking away PBS programming could impact school aged children.
“There are [5,800] fewer children in public schools today than there were last year, and many of them were, as evidenced by Wayne’s slide, using the resources of the Learning Media Center, and that will go away,” he said to commissioners.
PBS LearningMedia offers free educational materials for K-12 students and educators. Data presented at the meeting showed that PBS LearningMedia had over 50,000 quarterly users and over 322,000 quarterly streams on videos.
The commission decided at the meeting to not take public comment on keeping PBS programming at this time. A vote to decide whether to maintain programming will happen Nov. 18.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_7796-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-10-29 08:16:33.968357

Reno’s fall season is heating up faster than any other city in the U.S. and pushing back the date of the average first freeze – when the low temperature hits 32 degrees or colder – by almost six full weeks later than in 1970. 
Reno isn’t alone. An analysis by Climate Central this month found that the first freeze now arrives later in 88% of the 204 cities reviewed by researchers. On average, the first freeze occurred about 12 days later in U.S. cities than in the early 1970s.
The analysis is based on open-access temperature data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) from 1970 to 2024. 
Reno saw the biggest delay in the first freeze date compared with 1970 data, according to the Climate Central analysis. The average first freeze in Reno has shifted from the third week in September back in 1970 to the first week in November now – 41 days later.
As of Tuesday, Reno has not yet reached the temperatures needed to hit its first freeze this fall, according to the National Weather Service. The lowest temperature so far this month was a close 33 degrees on Oct. 16. Last year, Reno’s first freeze was on Oct. 18.
Nevada State Climatologist Baker Perry said his office examined Reno weather station data as far back as 1965 and came to a similar conclusion as the Climate Central analysis.
“I can tell you from just looking at the data I have been very impressed at just how cold Reno could get in the past looking at the historical records,” Perry said. “That certainly struck me. Clearly we have experienced some regional climate warming, and certainly global warming.”
The biggest influence for the shift in fall temperatures is likely the urban heat island effect — a phenomenon that creates higher temperatures in cities due to an abundance of superheating man-made surfaces like roads and pavement, said Perry.

An analysis by the Nevada State Climate Office found that while neighboring rural areas in northern Nevada did show delays in their first freeze compared to 1970 it was much less pronounced than in Reno.
Historical weather data from the Boca Reservoir on the Little Truckee River showed on average, its first freeze occurred about 13 days later than in the early 1970s. Similarly, weather data from the Winnemucca Airport revealed an average first freeze 11 days later during that same time period. 
“Both of those sites have also seen later dates. We’re talking on average, about 12 days later compared to 1970 but not nearly to the extent that Reno has. What that tells us is that the urbanization that has occurred in the Reno area since around 1970 is playing a big role in this,” Perry said. 
Perry said his office has observed rising nighttime temperatures in Reno that have prevented the city from hitting freezing low temperatures. 
“We can still get cold at night, but not nearly as cold as we have seen in the past by all indications,” Perry said. 
The urban heat island effect has increased in Reno as more super-heating man made materials cover the landscape, helping the city reach the status as one of the fastest warming cities in the nation.  
Urban heat has only increased with the city’s population growth, said Perry. From 1970 to 2025, Reno’s population has increased five-fold from about 121,000 to about 575,000. 
“There’s more urban building materials, there’s more parking lots, there’s more homes, there’s less natural surfaces. And those built surfaces retain heat at night, and that is a big factor,” Perry said. 
Higher than average temperatures across Nevada are likely to continue into November and early winter, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Weather Prediction Center. 
“We’re going to be above normal for the rest of the month in early November. It’s quite possible that we may not have our first official freeze at the Reno airport until sometime in November,” Perry said.
Warmer temperatures means residents of Reno may have to wait longer to see snowfall in the valley, but it can have more critical consequences, according to the analysis by Climate Central.
Hotter falls also mean a longer wildfire season. Wildfire risk is getting longer and more intense in the fall for Nevada. Wildfire smoke combined with climate change-fueled heat can further worsen air quality, posing additional risk to human health.
Warming also allows disease-carrying insects such as mosquitoes to linger later into the fall. Rising temperatures allow mosquitoes to grow faster and live longer. Cooler winters help reduce the survival of mosquito larvae, but with warmer temperatures in the fall due to climate change, they have a greater shot at survival and longer breeding seasons to build up their populations.
This year’s mosquito season, from May through September, in Washoe County saw an eight-fold increase in mosquitoes per trap compared to last year, according to Northern Nevada Public Health. However, the agency did warn the count may be higher than expected due to a lack of treatment activities this year.
Still, September temperatures at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport was about 70 degrees, about two degrees above normal for the time of year, according to the National Weather Service. Weather and climate agencies announced this week that September 2025 was the third warmest in recorded history, trailing Septembers of 2023 and 2024.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RenoNeon7_SM-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-29 07:56:27.764785

(Mesquite City Council video stream screengrab)For the second time this year, efforts by Mesquite elected officials to streamline city council meetings by eliminating some public comment died when proposals before the council failed to garner a motion to proceed to a vote.  
State law requires that local governments offer the opportunity for public comment at the beginning and end of a meeting, or after the public body holds discussion on each action item that comes before it. The government must also afford the public the chance “to comment on any matter that is not specifically included on the agenda.” 
On Tuesday, Mesquite considered two proposals. One would have eliminated the first public comment period and provided one opportunity for general comment at the end of the meeting. Additionally, under that proposal, the council would hear public comment before voting on individual agenda items. 
“Why are you a city council member or the mayor if you don’t want to hear from the people?” former Councilman Dave Ballweg asked rhetorically during a phone interview. Ballweg authored Mesquite’s current public comment ordinance in 2017, which requires time for comment at the beginning and end of each meeting, as well as during individual action items. 
The option, critics contend, was intended to discourage public comment by requiring individuals to sit for hours before being allowed to comment.   
The second proposal would have eliminated public comment during each action item, and would have restricted comment at the beginning of the meeting to only items on the agenda. 
Mesquite and Yerington are the only cities in Nevada that allow unfettered comment at the beginning and end of the meeting, as well as comment on specific action items, observed Mesquite resident Nick Alfonsetti.  
Resident Bob Muszar told the Current that eliminating comment on individual agenda items, as is the practice of the Southern Nevada Regional Transportation Commission and the Clark County Regional Flood Control District, should not be considered “under any circumstances,” adding it’s unfair to expect the public to opine at the beginning of the meeting, “when we haven’t had a chance to hear staff reports or council discussion.  We’re not fully participating in the government.” 
Mesquite resident Ron Shackelford, who ran unsuccessfully for city council and intends to run again, called the proposed ordinances “nothing less than suppression of the community’s voice.” 
Mesquite, once a predominantly Mormon community, is Nevada’s fastest growing city. Some residents suggest a good old boy network, frustrated by longer meetings, a lack of decorum, a small group of regular attendees inclined to pontificate, and the influence of newcomers, is attempting to control public dialogue.
Mesquite has no shortage of topics city officials would prefer to ignore. 
“A lot of what gets addressed in public comment is the rumor mill that’s going on in Mesquite, and unfortunately, you ain’t never getting rid of that,” observed resident Sue Tabor. 
‘In these days and times’ 
Mesquite is not alone when it comes to governments debating how to strike the proper balance between the public’s right to be heard and the desire of public officials to gain more control of meetings.
In Texas this month, the Ft. Worth City Council voted to limit public comment on topics unrelated to city business to one meeting a month. 
In Colorado, the Boulder City Council proposed restrictions in July, after calls for an end to the violence in Gaza dominated  public comment. 
“Boulder certainly isn’t the only city struggling these days with how to handle public comment,” said Jeff Roberts, executive director of the Colorado Freedom of Information Coalition.
The City of Aurora eventually reversed course after it banned public comment because of a dispute between lawmakers and activists.
Most Nevada local governments, including Clark County, Las Vegas, Henderson, Reno, and Washoe County, exceed the state law requirement by hearing public comments at the beginning and end of each meeting, as well as before voting on action items. Most limit the first public comment session to items on the agenda. Some reserve the final public comment segment to matters within the public body’s jurisdiction.
The trend to limit comment extends to federal affairs, including land use matters, such as those before the Bureau of Land Management, which regulates about 48 million acres in Nevada, or about 63% of the state’s land. 
In January, the Trump Administration directed the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to rescind rules implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), removing the requirement that agencies prepare environmental impact studies, or consider or respond to public comments. 
Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. has discontinued the department’s long-standing practice of seeking comment beyond that which is required by law, according to the National Association of Counties, and Public Citizen reports that in August, the General Services Administration removed a tool from the website Regulations.gov that allowed organizations to collect and submit comment to federal agencies.  
The Mesquite ordinances, opponents contend, represent a knee-jerk reaction that rejects not only a longstanding American tradition, but also the very notion of community. An effort to stifle public input is a danger, they say, to democracy. 
Only Councilman Paul Wanlass voiced support for changing the ordinance. Mayor Jesse Whipple, who is permitted to vote only in the event of a tie, offered no hint of where he stood. 
“Any time that you limit the public’s voice, it’s concerning,” former Mesquite Councilwoman Karen Dutkowski told the Current. “But in these days and times, it’s a problem.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-7-1024x576.png,,,2025-10-29 10:01:07.420549

A new proposal from Michigan’s Senate Democrats could shake up the state’s election calendar and would mean major changes for both campaigns and the election administrators. But it could have trouble balancing the interests of municipal clerks and school districts.
Sen. Sam Singh, the Senate majority floor leader and a Democrat from East Lansing, plans to introduce legislation within two weeks to move Michigan’s August primary to May, with some May races potentially shifting to February.
The changes would take effect in 2027, Singh said, potentially eliminating concerns Republicans in the House expressed about disrupting the 2026 election cycle. Because many campaigns are “up and running,” Singh told Votebeat in an interview last week, making changes in the middle of a cycle “was a significant concern.”
If the proposal becomes law, the general-election period would effectively be stretched out by three months each year. Meanwhile, clerks around the state would see a big shift in their election calendar — but it’s not the one they want. Clerks say they want just two elections a year: one in May or June and one in November.
 Getting rid of Michigan’s August primary

Election officials have long urged the state to eliminate the August election and instead combine it with the May contests. Held just three months before the general election, August elections tend to draw low turnout. A recent Department of State report also deemed them “impractical” to audit, as the post-election period creeps up on preparations for November.
The Michigan Association of Municipal Clerks’ official stance is that Michigan doesn’t need three elections each year. Keeping all three, regardless of the timing, is expensive for local governments, said Michael Siegrist, the Canton Township clerk and first vice president of the local clerks association.
“We can satisfy the needs of the voters and other jurisdictions, like school districts, with having a May and November election,” Siegrist told Votebeat. “It ensures decent turnout. It’s more economically advantageous for the state of Michigan. Moving the primary to May or June is ideal, but we believe in merging August and May, as opposed to having the February date.”
 Consensus on eliminating August primary fades

Last month, as legislators from both parties struggled through a contentious budget cycle, Democrats in the Senate and Republicans in the House told The Detroit News that they were working on bills that would eliminate the August primary. That brief moment of unity has faded.
Rep. Rachelle Smit, a Republican from Martin Township and former clerk, told The News last month that legislation was in progress to consolidate all elections to May ahead of the 2026 election. However, a Smit spokesperson told Votebeat last week that the House Election Integrity Committee — which Smit chairs — would not consider those bills. Her office declined an interview and did not respond to a request for further comment.
Smit’s pivot follows a new wave of Republican opposition to the plan. Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall told the radio news outlet Michigan Public that he was “very strongly opposed” to changing the primaries ahead of the 2026 election, arguing it would benefit Democrats looking to attack Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a Democrat who is running for governor as an independent candidate.
Hall and Smit did not say whether they would support the bills if implementation was moved back to 2027.
Singh told Votebeat his proposal has bipartisan support in the Senate. “My hope is with the fact that we’re looking at future elections, that there will be an opening at some point for the House to consider it,” he said.
 School leaders prefer three elections

Similar bills have been introduced in the past with limited success, never advancing to the governor’s desk. In 2021, a cluster of bills made it through the Michigan House to the Senate, then controlled by Republicans, ultimately dying there.
At the time, the legislation was opposed by the Michigan Association of School Boards and other school groups across the state.
School districts have to pay for their own elections under Michigan law, including additional fees if the district joins in on an election with other races, or 100% of the cost if the district’s election is the only one on the ballot.
It can be worth the expense, though, if the election helps the district ensure its funding for future years through approval of millages or bond issues.
Jennifer Smith, director of government relations for MASB, said districts want to be “good stewards” of public money, and part of that is ensuring that they can get the best interest rates on their debt issues. Having three elections offers districts opportunities to time their funding requests for when the best rates are available, and her group has long been in favor of maintaining all three.
“That’s what we’ve been fighting about for years,” she said. “Every time they’ve tried to move the primary, the clerks want to, but they’re not the ones that have to go out for the bond like we do. … More dates to do that would be better.”

I am deeply disappointed in my colleague, Sen, Sam Douglass. I say that not as a political rival, but as someone who once worked side by side with him — on legislation, on the Institutions Committee and, most importantly, as a friend.
What makes this so painful is not only what was said, but who said it. As one of only two African Americans currently serving in the Vermont Senate — and one of only four in our state’s history — I have long believed that our shared work could transcend party and background. I saw in Sam one of the youngest and most promising members of the Senate, someone who represented the future of the Republican Party: energetic, engaged and eager to serve.
That is why his recent comments were not only offensive, but profoundly sad. Words matter. They shape how people see each other and, in moments like this, they reveal how far we still have to go.

READ MORE

I appreciate that Republican leadership — from the governor to the minority leaders in both the House and Senate — spoke out clearly and swiftly. Their response sent an important message that hateful speech has no place in Vermont politics, or anywhere in our public life. But condemnation is only the first step.
We must be honest with ourselves: this kind of rhetoric continues to surface, time and again. It is not isolated, and it is not harmless. Words like these carry real consequences. During my own campaign, I received a racist death threat. That experience taught me, in the most personal way possible, that hate is not abstract — it endangers real people, real families, real communities.
It’s time for all of us — especially those within the Republican Party — to look inward. To ask hard questions about what kind of politics we want to stand for, and what kind of future we want to build. We must do the work to ensure that decency, respect, and inclusion are not slogans, but the standards by which we hold ourselves and each other.
Vermont has always prided itself on being a place of civility, compassion, and community. Let’s live up to that ideal — not just in our words, but in our actions.

(Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)Voters in western Washington are casting ballots in four legislative races that could reveal whether the electorate wants to change the direction the state is going.
But another factor might be more decisive in the Nov. 4 election: Democrats’ desire to rebuke President Donald Trump.
“They used to say all politics are local. But, in a lot of ways, all politics are national right now,” said Jared Leopold of New Direction PAC, the political committee behind hundreds of thousands of dollars in spending across the four contests. “Everyone who is upset with Donald Trump is looking for a way to send a message and voting is the easiest way to do it.”
It’s a dynamic largely unchanged since the August primary, when four appointed Democratic state lawmakers defeated experienced opponents. 
Those results came about seven months into a second Trump administration, and after a legislative session when Democratic majorities pushed through tax hikes, budget cuts and expansive social policies
In two Senate primaries, Democratic Sens. Deb Krishnadasan and Victoria Hunt held off Republicans — state Rep. Michelle Caldier and former state lawmaker Chad Magendanz, respectively. 
Caldier and Magendanz both hammered Democrats’ approval of a $9.4 billion package of tax increases and a $3.2 billion transportation revenue measure anchored by the 6-cent increase in the state’s gas tax.
They also highlighted controversial Democratic-backed policy changes, including a cap on rent increases, unemployment benefits for striking workers and requiring a state-issued permit to buy a gun. 
But Caldier and Magendanz struggled to escape Trump’s shadow. It showed in the primary results. It hasn’t gotten easier since.
Meanwhile, two other races, one in the House and the other in the Senate, are Democrat-versus-Democrat battles illuminating stresses within the party among progressive and centrist forces. 
There too, Rep. Edwin Obras and Sen. Vandana Slatter are benefitting from anti-Trump fervor among the party’s left flank as they look to fend off moderates Kevin Schilling and Rep. Amy Walen, respectively.
The Trump factor
The duel between Krishnadasan, a former school board director, and Caldier, a six-term representative, is the Republicans’ best chance to flip a seat in the Senate, where Democrats hold a 30-19 seat advantage. 
This contest is in the 26th District that encompasses parts of Pierce and Kitsap counties and includes Bremerton, Port Orchard, Purdy and Gig Harbor. It is one of Washington’s few districts represented by lawmakers from both parties. 
Krishnadasan is running as a moderate and touts her votes against this year’s tax hikes.
“We need to bring a voice that will get the majority party to work for our people, to take the word ‘taxes’ off our most vulnerable. We need to change direction,” she said at a forum in September.
Caldier, considered a moderate in her party, has said without more Republicans in the chamber, there will be more taxes from the majority next year.
“The makeup of the Legislature is so bad. The direction that we are going is absolutely ridiculous,” she said at the forum. “We need to change the balance of the Legislature…and turn around the direction of our state.”
But Caldier’s been hard-pressed to make her case amid an onslaught of mailers and ads from New Direction labeling her an “extremist” and pairing her with Trump. 
The political committee, which supports incumbent and progressive Democrats, is funded largely by the Democratic caucuses of the House and Senate, the Service Employees International Union, and the Washington Education Association, which is the state’s largest union representing public school employees.
It is a strategy intended to deter Democrats who have voted for Caldier before. 
In more subtle ways, New Direction is also trying to scare off MAGA Republicans, who’ve not been Caldier fans in the past, by trying to spotlight her old tensions with Jesse Young, a former state representative and a right-wing standard bearer in the Pierce County Republican Party.
In the 5th District, Hunt won a House seat last November, moving to the Senate following the unexpected death of Sen. Bill Ramos in April. 
Her opponent, Magendanz, is a former two-term state representative in the district. He ran unsuccessfully for the House seat in 2022 and the Senate in 2024. Tuesday’s winner will represent Issaquah, Black Diamond, Covington, and part of Snoqualmie.
As in the 26th District race, a major focus has been on the new and higher taxes enacted in the 2025 session. And Trump.
Unlike Krishnadasan, Hunt did vote for the tax bills and has defended that decision. It didn’t hurt her as she won the primary handily. 
Magendanz, like Caldier, was a centrist in his party during his tenure but has been hit with mailers labeling him an “extremist” and “too MAGA.” Rather than respond, he said he’s focused on getting Republican and independent voters who know him to vote.
Steve Gordon, a Pierce County Republican, has contributed to Caldier and Magendanz and to business-oriented political committees working independently to support them. He didn’t sugarcoat the difficult environment for GOP candidates in Washington state
“Polling shows voters don’t like all the taxes. But voters also say ‘we really, really don’t like Republicans’ and vote against them,” he said.
Democratic divisions
In the 33rd District in south King County, Schilling’s bid to unseat Obras is cast as a barometer of where Democrats want their party to go in the Seattle suburbs. Schilling is currently the mayor of Burien.
“Among rank and file Democrat voters, there are real differences of opinion on real quality of life issues like public safety and homelessness. These are the issues that are front and center in this race,” said Sandeep Kaushik of Soundview Strategies. 
He manages an outside campaign against Obras funded by Pragmatic Washington, whose donors are statewide business and health care organizations and individuals, including Gordon.
Obras’ outside backers, like New Direction, are portraying Schilling as a tool of corporate and pro-Trump interests. “This year, there are two Democrats on the ballot — but only one who represents us,” reads one of the group’s hit pieces.
This group first inserted Trump into the conversation in the primary after seeing Gordon had given to Pragmatic Washington.
“They make everything about Trump and if they make everything about Trump, they hope people forget about what is going on in the state,” Schilling said.
It’s been a little less intense in the 48th District, where the progressive Slatter, of Bellevue, and moderate Walen, of Kirkland, are squaring off in an expensive contest. 
Slatter won the primary with nearly 60% of the vote.
The two lawmakers voted similarly on a couple major tax bills last session, though Slatter voted for the gas tax increase and Walen did not. Walen opposed the new rent increase cap. Slatter voted for it.
Trump has made it into this race, too, with a pro-Slatter group putting out mailers describing her as “The Real Democrat” who is on the “front lines” opposing the president’s policies. 



5 contests without surprises
Five other appointed Democratic state lawmakers are on the ballot.
Rep. Janice Zahn, D-Bellevue, is favored against Republican John Whitney of Bellevue in the 41st District after winning the primary with nearly 63%.
It’s similar in the 48th District, where Rep. Osman Salahuddin, D-Redmond, faces Republican Dennis Ellis. Salahuddin received close to 61% in the primary.

(Photo by Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)From Minneapolis to rural towns like Fergus Falls, Minnesotans are struggling to find homes they can afford in the places they want to live. Our state is suffering an urgent housing shortage, and we need thousands more homes to meet our communities’ needs.
Northfield, for instance, doesn’t have enough starter homes to meet the demand of all the families that want to move there. And when there aren’t enough homes available, tough competition drives up prices and pushes out working families, retirees and other community members who can’t compete with the wealthy for the few available homes. That means health care workers, teachers, firefighters and other essential workers can’t live in the communities they serve. It means aging seniors or young adults can’t afford to downsize or find a starter home near their families.
During the 2025 legislative session, homeowners and renters across Minnesota advocated tirelessly for policies that would make it easier and more affordable to build homes, but we weren’t able to get zoning reform — to make it easier to build more affordable homes of all kinds — over the finish line.
As we gear up for statewide wins in 2026, we have new inspiration: U.S. Sen. Tina Smith is now championing the Renewing Opportunity in the American Dream — ROAD — to Housing Act in Congress.
The ROAD to Housing Act is a bipartisan package of legislation that would give states and cities more tools to reform outdated housing policy; streamline federal regulations to remove red tape that delays homebuilding; and create new opportunities for working people and rural residents to access loans and mortgages.
It’s the most significant housing solution legislation we’ve seen introduced in years, and can’t be passed soon enough.
The ROAD to Housing Act would support measures we’ve already seen succeed in Minnesota, like incentivizing cities and towns to reform outdated zoning policy. The legislation would help remove outdated parking mandates and allow flexibility for parking that matches local needs; invest in community development and streamline permitting for affordable homes; eliminate bans on smaller and more affordable home types, among other reforms.
I was especially excited to see Smith lead on the Rural Housing Service Reform Act, which would strengthen federal rural housing programs and remove barriers that rural residents face when pursuing homeownership.
At Neighbors for More Neighbors — an organization dedicated to securing abundant housing for everyone in Minnesota — we’re proud to have worked with Smith on these issues before. I applaud her latest work to address the housing shortage in our state, and nationwide, and hope that other federal, state and local leaders will soon follow suit.
Our U.S. House Reps. Betty McCollum and Ilhan Omar, for instance, have been champions for housing that our communities can afford. I’m grateful for their dedication and hope they soon have the chance to lead again on housing by working closely with the U.S. Senate to pass a major housing package, which hasn’t been done since 2008.
But we can’t wait for national changes to start local progress. We need to take bold statewide action to allow more homes in Minnesota by passing the Yes to Homes agenda at the Legislature next session.
With bipartisan leadership from state Reps. Mike Howard and Spencer Igo, and Sens. Lindsey Port and Jordan Rasmusson, the Yes to Homes agenda will finally bring more homes — that families can actually afford — to our state.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Minnesota-Reformer-File-49-2048x1366-1-1536x1025-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-29 07:16:41.325523

Gerrymandering is the political manipulation of electoral district boundaries to advantage a party, group, or socioeconomic class within the constituency. (Photo by Getty Images)Gov. Mike Braun this week called for a special session of the legislature to look into redistricting. So far, the Republican supermajority in the Indiana General Assembly has shown admirable restraint in the face of external pressure to redraw the state’s congressional districts. 
While some other states have been quick to fall in line and pursue a mid-decade round of redistricting, Hoosier politicians have expressed some real doubts about whether this is a wise course of action.
Part of the reason for this hesitancy is that the legislature already did its job four years ago after the last census. 
Lawmakers worked on this for months and held hearings soliciting public input in every congressional district. The same people who drew the current maps would have to repudiate their own work after telling the people of Indiana in 2021 that these were “fair maps” that “will serve Hoosiers well for the next decade.”
Everyone knows that the reason behind the push nationwide to get Republican-controlled state legislatures to redraw these congressional districts is the upcoming 2026 midterm elections. U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-L.A., currently has a majority that is so incredibly small that Democrats would retake the House if they can pick up just three seats out of 435. 
How likely is this to happen? History provides a good guide to what is probably in store next year.
Indiana governor summons lawmakers for redistricting session amid national GOP pressure

Since the 1930s, the party of the president has lost an average of 28 seats in a midterm. In 2018, during Donald Trump’s first term, House Republicans lost 40 seats. Barack Obama’s party lost 63 House seats in 2010. 
What does this mean for the Indiana legislature? It means it is entirely possible that the Indiana General Assembly could move heaven and earth during a special session to gerrymander the congressional maps and the House Republicans would still end up losing their majority on Capitol Hill.
The Supreme Court of the United States has typically allowed partisan gerrymandering to happen, but there is no guarantee that a redistricting scheme will end up having the desired effect. One of the most consequential Supreme Court decisions on this issue is actually an Indiana case, Davis v. Bandemer from 1986. The estimable Ted Boehm argued that case on behalf of the Indiana Democratic Party before he went on to serve with distinction on the Indiana Supreme Court. 
The Indiana Democrats lost their case in the Supreme Court that year, but they went on to win in the court of public opinion. 
 The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the district maps in Indiana even after acknowledging that they were drawn in a way that would make it extremely hard for Democrats to get elected. In just a few short years, however, the Hoosier delegation to Congress went from being evenly divided between the two parties (a 5-5 split) to 8-2 after the 1992 elections.
Any student of politics knows that “gerrymandering” is a word coined over 200 years ago to describe a practice that is almost universally viewed as unfair. By all accounts, Elbridge Gerry led a fairly remarkable life. Among other things, he helped to write the Constitution in Philadelphia, he was elected governor of Massachusetts, and he served as James Madison’s vice president. 
Today, he is remembered for just one thing, and his name has been immortalized as a synonym for cheating.
Conscience
Many of our political leaders in the state capital have been serving the public for a long time. They were there before Trump and Braun were elected to office, and a good number of them will still be around long after those two have left the scene. For years, they have worked hard to legislate in the public interest. 
All of that is put in jeopardy with this redistricting scheme. By breaking faith with Hoosier voters and declaring that they no longer believe in fair elections, they run the risk of having their own political careers being remembered as Gerry is now remembered.
There have been other turbulent times in American politics where leaders have had to make difficult choices, and these episodes can be instructive to us today. In 1950, Senator Margaret Chase Smith, R-M.E., expressed her deep frustration with the Truman administration in a famous Senate speech. At the same time, she insisted that her own Republican party needed to adhere to rules of fairness and decency as they sought to retake power.
In her “Declaration of Conscience,” she was sharply critical of the Democrats running the federal government, but she warned that “to displace it with a Republican regime embracing a philosophy that lacks political integrity or intellectual honesty would prove equally disastrous to the nation … I do not want to see the Republican party win that way. While it might be a fleeting victory for the Republican Party, it would be a more lasting defeat for the American people.”
Hoosiers today are watching and hoping that our elected leaders will make their own declaration of conscience and reject this push to engage in a mid-decade redistricting that presents far more risks than rewards.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/gettyimages-2205777306-1024x1024-1-e1761662776992.jpg,,,2025-10-29 07:16:41.325523

(Phillip Rubino/Getty Images)Indiana lawmakers could use the upcoming special session not only to draw new legislative maps but also to head off what tax experts call impending “chaos” for taxpayers and businesses. 
Gov. Mike Braun has asked legislators to bring the state’s tax code in line with recent, major federal changes — warning of “discrepancies” between Indiana and federal law that could complicate 2025 tax filings.
Tax experts say that differences stem from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or OBBBA, which made significant revisions to the federal Internal Revenue Code.
Indiana currently conforms to the federal tax code as it existed on Jan. 1, 2023, meaning recent federal changes aren’t automatically reflected in state law.
The Indiana Department of Revenue said it has identified 42 provisions in the OBBBA that could affect state tax filings, including five with direct implications for 2025 returns filed in 2026.
Those include:

Section 70402, which makes up to $5,000 of the adoption tax credit refundable starting in 2025;
Section 70403, allowing tribal governments to designate children as having special needs for adoption tax credit purposes;
Section 70307, providing 100% depreciation for certain manufacturing-related real property placed in service between 2025 and 2031;
Section 71306, permanently allowing high-deductible health plans to cover telehealth services pre-deductible without affecting HSA eligibility; and
Section 70509, which repeals accelerated depreciation for certain energy-related assets.

DOR officials told the Indiana Capital Chronicle that the agency is still evaluating the overall fiscal impact of all provisions.
‘This is vital’
Because Indiana is a “static” — not an “automatic” — conformity state, lawmakers must pass legislation to update the state’s definition of the Internal Revenue Code. Without that step, the state continues using the older version of federal law, even as taxpayers file under the new federal rules.
Matthew Will, an associate professor of finance at the University of Indianapolis, said Indiana’s approach means the legislature must affirmatively act each time Congress overhauls the federal tax code.

“This is vital,” Will said about expected tax changes to be made during the special session.
He emphasized that the OBBBA made “massive changes” to adjusted gross income definitions and deductions. He cited overtime and bonus depreciation as “two huge examples.”
He added that Indiana’s current conformity date — set to March 31, 2021 — no longer reflects years of subsequent federal updates and is now badly outdated. That leaves accountants and businesses unsure which federal rules the state actually follows.
“It is 100% necessary,” he continued. “Software providers like H&R Block and Intuit need guidance. Businesses really need to know how to proceed or face lawsuits if they guess wrong.”
Will warned that postponing action until the regular legislative session would likely sow confusion during the 2025 filing season.
“Once people start filing, you can’t make changes,” he said. “It would have been chaos. It would have been absolute chaos in the business world.”
The professor noted, too, that Indiana’s static system requires conscious legislative action to “decide whether to accept or reject” new federal provisions. 
“The federal government changed the entire definition of adjusted gross income,” he said. “That’s the starting point where we make our changes. It’s one of the biggest things you could possibly do.”
The last major conformity update came in 2021, when Indiana adopted the Internal Revenue Code as of March 31, 2021, bringing the state into line with pandemic-era relief measures such as the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan. 
At that time, the DOR issued a 14-page bulletin listing numerous federal provisions Indiana chose not to follow, including exclusions for student loan forgiveness and certain charitable deductions.
Updating state tax law to reflect new federal definitions and deductions is a regular part of legislative housekeeping, though it usually happens during the regular session each winter. 
“Maybe small things happen on a regular basis,” Will said. “But this is a substantial change.”
Chamber in support
The Indiana Chamber of Commerce said it supports a careful but timely review of the new federal provisions. 
“Indiana has worked over many years to maintain a tax code that is broad-based, stable and relatively easy for individuals and employers to navigate,” said Natalie Goodwin, the chamber’s vice president of government affairs. “When federal legislation introduces new, highly targeted deductions or exemptions, states often need to determine whether adopting those provisions aligns with their own goals for tax simplicity and sustainable revenue.”
Indiana governor summons lawmakers for redistricting session amid national GOP pressure

Goodwin said the chamber is “closely reviewing the federal changes and assessing where conformity would support Indiana’s long-standing commitment to a predictable and growth-oriented tax structure, and where selective decoupling may be appropriate.”
Will said the consequences of inaction could reach far beyond confusion for accountants. 
“If you work overtime, it’s now not taxable at the federal level, but in Indiana, it currently is taxable,” he said. “So are we going to adopt the federal AGI definition, or are we in Indiana going to say, no, if you work overtime, it’s taxable? That’s huge.”
He credited Braun for tying the tax conformity measure to the same special session as redistricting. 
“It’s dire,” Will said. “But it’s not sexy. So I’m so glad the governor is attaching it … because it’s vital. It would have been chaos.”
The special session officially begins Nov. 3, but legislative leaders don’t have to convene the exact day that Braun suggested. By law, the only rule is it can’t last for more than 30 session days or 40 calendar days.
In 2022, then-Gov. Eric Holcomb’s order began the session on July 6 but lawmakers didn’t convene until July 25, and it ended Aug. 5.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Leaders in small Minnesota communities are helping big tech companies dot the state with gigantic computers used to power AI, often under the cloak of code names and nondisclosure agreements — which legal experts and residents say is damaging public trust.
City councilors, mayors and other elected officials across the state have been aware for months, even years, of various massive AI data center proposals, while sharing little to no information publicly until the projects are set in motion — often bound by secrecy agreements. 
The City of Hermantown, muzzled by nondisclosure agreements, called a proposal “Project Loon” in early planning documents. If approved, the project would comprise over 200 acres of the wooded Duluth suburb with 1.8 million square-feet worth of AI data processors.
Power and water consumption — and even the identity of the company that will use the campus — are still under wraps even as the project reaches the permitting stage. 
Jane Kirtley, a professor of media law and ethics at the University of Minnesota, said the phenomenon of elected officials signing secrecy agreements isn’t entirely surprising: “Many of them are willing to sign their lives away in order to lure the businesses to their area.” 
Still, Kirtley said, the non-disclosure agreements are “extremely problematic” because they compound the problem of opaque local government: “In smaller communities where there’s often less oversight, where fewer media are paying attention to it and fewer citizens participating, councils can get away with an awful lot of secrecy for a very long time without anybody complaining about it,” she said.

The jurisdictions cooperating with the tech behemoths say they’re in fierce competition with rival cities, counties and states and want to be able to negotiate privately, while the companies say they are guarding proprietary information and need the secrecy that an NDA guarantees. 
The data centers provide jobs to construction workers who build and maintain them, and piles of property tax money for often cash-starved local governments. 
Some elected officials have had enough, however, and are refusing to go along, while a state lawmaker wants to make these nondisclosure agreements illegal for elected officials. 
‘A total disservice to our office’ 
When St. Louis County Commissioner Ashley Grimm heard her colleagues knew about the proposed Hermantown campus a full six months before the public, she said she was “shocked.”
Hermantown is in south St. Louis County. 
“To say that we would sign away our rights to talk to our constituents about that (data center project) is a total disservice to our office,” she said. Grimm scoffed at the idea that constituents had to file public records requests to get information.
Much of the available information related to the Hermantown proposal was made public recently through a Data Practices Act request — which is Minnesota’s version of a public records request and named after the state’s open records law —  filed by Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, or MCEA. 
The records include hundreds of pages of correspondence between consultants, city staffers and local elected officials regarding “Project Loon,” some dating back more than a year. (Additional documentation can be found on citizen-led stophermantowndatacenter.org.) 
Grimm said the secrecy surrounding Project Loon motivated her to propose a prohibition on commissioners signing nondisclosure agreements when big data center projects come to town.
Her proposal was quickly rejected during a heated commission meeting earlier this month.

‘I don’t give a s*** what you think’
The meeting room was packed, but the County Commission allotted no time for the public to comment on Grimm’s proposal. At one point after the meeting, Commissioner Keith Nelson, one of three who signed a nondisclosure agreement, repeatedly told a Duluth Monitor reporter on video “I don’t give a sh*t what you think” about there being no opportunity for public comment.
Nelson did not respond to a request for comment on the interaction.
Instead, the county provided to the Reformer a statement on NDAs.
“In the economic development world, this is common practice as developers do their due diligence during their evaluation phase to determine a project’s feasibility without tipping their hat to a competitor. St. Louis County signed a non-disclosure agreement so that we could receive information that is considered confidential and proprietary. Should the developer decide to move forward, the public will be provided opportunity to weigh in on any involvement the county may have with this project.”
MCEA Executive Director Kathryn Hoffman replied,  “We’re just way past the point where that argument makes any sense.” 
MCEA has filed four lawsuits against cities that have advanced data center projects with what MCEA alleges are a lack of transparency and incomplete environmental reviews: Faribault, Pine Island, North Mankato and Lakeville. 
Hoffman allowed that city staff could conceivably be required to sign a secrecy agreement. If an elected official signs one, however, the NDA could easily become a cover for something else entirely, Hoffman charged: secret lobbying. 
A legislative response
Major AI data center projects — campuses known in the industry as “hyperscale” — are planned for Farmington and Rosemount, and both achieved significant momentum before the public knew anything about them. 
In Farmington’s case, city officials did not speak publicly about the development until Tract — the company building the campus — presented its project application during a City Council meeting.
Farmington City Administrator Lynn Gorski said in a statement that’ “it’s not uncommon to not speak publicly about any project until an application is received.” Gorski emphasized that the application materials — like details of the environmental review — are public, and that to date the city of Farmington has not approved any data centers. 
State Sen. Erin Maye Quade, DFL-Apple Valley, said she grew concerned as she learned about the Rosemount project, which will host Facebook parent Meta.

Like in Hermantown, the proposal was listed in early planning documents under a code name: “Project Bigfoot.” An employee of the tech giant attended public meetings and corresponded with local officials using the alias “Ken Confidential,” Maye Quade recalled.
Maye Quade’s district falls on the project’s border.
Maye Quade proposed a bill earlier this year that would have barred local officials from signing nondisclosure agreements when planning data centers. It failed.
“I’m appalled that these large multi-billion dollar international corporations are entering into NDA’s with cities where you might not have a full-time mayor or city council,” Maye Quade said. The problem, she said, is that secrecy requirement exacerbates the power differential between a tech company and small city mayors.  
“The Legislature should provide citizens the opportunity to be involved. NDAs are taking local communities’ rights away from being involved; our basic democratic, fundamental right is to participate in the process.”
Maye Quade said she will try again during next year’s legislative session, and expects more support — and bipartisan support at that. 
Many of her Republican colleagues are on board, she said: “You could sit us all on a panel and ask ‘What are three things you agree upon?’ and it would be one thing — the needed regulation for big tech and AI.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/NN251025_0722-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-29 07:16:41.325523

Creating “The World’s Greatest Audit Podcast” is one way that Fitzpatrick attempts to change conversations around government and educate people on what he calls “inappropriate expenses.”
Fitzpatrick said the business he opened in high school, MariCorp U.S., is the reason he decided to enter the world of politics.
“I was 24 years old when I ran for the House of Representatives. And I did it because I was a business owner,” Fitzpatrick said. He served in the state House for five years.
His marine products company grew to over 30 employees by the time Fitzpatrick graduated from college.
“After getting into business and becoming a taxpayer and dealing with different bureaucracies, it seemed like every day, I really started to get frustrated with government,” he said. “It wasn’t because I didn’t want to pay taxes or anything like that. It was just because it seemed like it was so nonresponsive to the needs of citizens.”
This frustration with bureaucracy led Fitzpatrick to the role he holds today.
“You can have an immediate impact on the way that the executive branch behaves if you’re in charge of the budget,” Fitzpatrick said.
He said he leads an agency that has about 125 personnel, including some 80 auditors. The auditors typically work in teams to carry out their audits, varying in size based on the expected workload. The rest of the team deals with administrative work.
Fitzpatrick works with his team as well as auditors at the county level.
Boone County Auditor Kyle Rieman said that the state level auditors don’t interpose day-to-day with his auditing department or have a ton of interaction but they do offer tips and information.
Rieman said Fitzpatrick’s team comes to their annual training and works with them, discussing things they have seen on routine audits. He also praised Fitzpatrick for not sticking too closely to political party lines.
“I think (Fitzpatrick) tries to take a very fair, fairly nonpartisan approach,” Rieman said. “I think a lot of county auditors do, you know, we’re not really into the partisan aspect.”
“We have to run as a party, but our job primarily is kind of calling balls fair and calling balls fouls,” Rieman said.
On the state level, Fitzpatrick’s team handles a lot of what he calls “quick and dirty audits,” but if he is especially interested in an audit he gets involved and surveys things deeper than he otherwise would.
“There are some audits where I have some personal interest that I want to make sure, hey, this is going to be a high-profile audit, and I want to make sure we do a good job on it,” he said.
A common issue, Fitzpatrick said, is money being inappropriately used to make contributions or donations to nonprofits.
His office recently published a report detailing an audit done on the Randolph County Sheriff’s Department that uncovered over $222,000 that had been misused.
Some of the money was used to buy toys to donate to kids. Over $9,500 was used for lodging at a Margaritaville Resort.
“As an elected official, if I want to give money to a cause, a church or a food bank, or a pregnancy care center or whatever, that’s something I can either do from my own personal funds or I can do it from my campaign funds that I fundraise with,” Fitzpatrick said. “You can’t use public money to just do charitable stuff.”
“I think there’s potentially criminal charges coming on that one,” he said.
Fitzpatrick said he will probably record a podcast episode about the audit of the Randolph County Sheriff’s department.
Prior audits, he said, can help inform his team on what to look at next. Besides that, the auditors also receive whistleblower tips or follow the agenda that Fitzpatrick ran for office on.
One of the priorities during Fitzpatrick’s campaign for auditor in 2022 was to figure out a successful way to audit Missouri’s public schools.
“We spent a lot of money on schools, and we were not auditing any of them,” Fitzpatrick said. “We’re trying to build a school audit program, basically, and kind of figuring out the best way to audit a school district and what to look at so that you can make sure that the time we’re spending there is actually having a positive effect on the kids.”
The auditing team doesn’t have the power to come in and overhaul how a system works or give an operation a new set of guidelines to run things profitably.
“We’re not going to be the ones to be able to tell them how they’re going to solve their budget problem. The board is going to have to do that,” Fitzpatrick said.
“We identify: here’s the problem. This is how long you have before you run out of money. The recommendation we have is for you to start planning immediately,” he added.
Fitzpatrick won the election for auditor in 2022 against Alan Green and replaced Nicole Galloway, the last state level Democrat in office.
Speaking of his predecessor, Fitzpatrick said, “They didn’t do any school stuff. Honestly, they weren’t doing much at the end because the staffing was so low. When I got here, we had 89 total people. So that was not a good situation. I wouldn’t say it was a shift in priorities. It was just more like things were added that were not getting done.”
A good amount of his team’s energy at the beginning was getting up to pace to where he felt they could be most productive. This included increasing staffing and changing how the team shared files.
“When you go campaigning for a year and a half running for office and you get elected to it and you show up, it’s a real frustrating experience to show up and realize that you don’t have people here to do what you campaigned on,” Fitzpatrick said.
Despite coming from different political parties, Fitzpatrick said he thinks both he and Galloway have the same end goals.
“We want to make government work more efficient, and we want to identify waste and taxpayer money and fraud where it occurs and hold those people accountable,” he said. “I think the way in which we were going about doing that is starkly different.”
Fitzpatrick is over halfway through his first term as auditor, following a four-year stint as treasurer.
The current state treasurer, and Fitzpatrick’s successor, is Vivek Malek, who was appointed by Republican Gov. Mike Parson after Fitzpatrick’s election to auditor. Malek was elected to a full term in November 2024.
In the early days of Fitzpatrick’s term, he was tasked with auditing his previous department, the Treasury.
During the audit, Fitzpatrick’s team uncovered almost $35 million in interest deposited in the wrong account. The money was meant for the general revenue fund but put towards improving Interstate 70.
Despite the two departments butting heads, Fitzpatrick said, “When you’re auditing somebody and you put the information out that they may not like, it can probably strain relationships. But so far, I mean, we’re fine. We don’t have any issues.”
“Collaboration between the Treasurer’s Office and other state agencies — including the State Auditor’s Office — remains open, constructive, and focused on serving the public interest,” Malek’s communication director said in an email.
Fitzpatrick hasn’t formally launched his reelection campaign but says he plans on running.
“I’d like to have another term to kind of reap the benefits of the work we’ve done to rebuild the office and use the skill sets that we’ve built over the last two and a half years to kind of go one more term and have the impact I was hoping to be able to have immediately,” he said.
Following the interview Fitzpatrick was preparing to meet with his communications director, Trevor Fox, to record another episode of the agency’s podcast.
Fox handles a lot of the production for the show, Fitzpatrick said: “He’s like a one man wrecking ball. He does it all, man.”
That’s some high praise for a producer of what may be the ‘World’s Greatest Audit Podcast.’
As for the case of the 76 missing hams, the audit office doesn’t have an exact answer on where the hams went. According to the first episode of the podcast, they believe the former sheriff gifted the hams, bought with the inmate commissary fund, to other sheriff’s office employees.

“The bottom line is we don’t have enough lawyers to do the work in Vermont,” said Defender General Matt Valerio.

Prominent lawyers in criminal and civil law and across the private and public sectors concur that a dearth of lawyers, especially in their early careers, present barriers to accessing legal services in Vermont  — which they say threatens the principle of a functioning justice system. 
Earlier this month, the Vermont Supreme Court formed a commission of legal experts from across the state to take a closer look at the issue. The group will begin meeting in November and will eventually recommend ways to fill gaps in services. 
“If people can’t access the courts, that’s a real problem for our democracy,” said Josh Diamond, president of the Vermont Bar Association, an association of lawyers in the state. 
What concerns experts is that there are only a handful of attorneys in Vermont’s most rural counties and “many of them are greying,” he said. 
Attorneys are reportedly seeing a shortage of legal services in the Northeast Kingdom and across southern Vermont. And with more than half the attorneys in the state over the age of 56, officials at the head of Vermont’s judicial system are concerned about the future of legal services in Vermont. 
“The bottom line is we don’t have enough lawyers to do the work in Vermont,” said Defender General Matt Valerio. 
The commission plans to determine what areas of Vermont count as “legal deserts” — which the American Bar Association defines as a place with fewer than one attorney per 1,000 residents. The group will also look to identify what areas have the fewest legal resources. The goal is to recommend strategies for attracting more attorneys, and their services, to where they are needed.

The group will be co-chaired by state Supreme Court Associate Justice Harold E. Eaton and Bar Counsel for the Vermont Judiciary Michael Kennedy. Among the members will be representatives from the state attorney general’s office, defender general’s office and the Vermont Law and Graduate School.
“I think it’s going to take a village for everyone to come together to address these problems and come up with a solution,” Diamond said.
One concern is that there are as many attorneys over the age of 80 in the state as there are under 30, according to a 2025 report issued by the Vermont Supreme Court. That study encompassed lawyers across all areas of law and across public and private sectors. 
Whether attorneys are starting out in the field or have experience, younger attorneys aren’t seeking out jobs in Vermont, Diamond said. Young lawyers have high student loan debt, and salaries for attorneys in the state tend to be lower compared to other places in the country, he said. 
Another factor is that Vermont Law School, the state’s sole law school, tends to almost exclusively attract students from out of state who often leave Vermont after graduation. A 2021 report from the state bar association found that fewer than 10% of Vermont Law School students are from Vermont, and that fewer than 10% of the private school’s graduates remain in the state. 
A lack of affordable housing and affordable childcare, while not unique to attorneys, also tends to be a significant barrier for young people looking to practice law in the state, the bar association report found. 
People across the profession have a particularly hard time recruiting diverse lawyers from elsewhere, Diamond said. He has heard anecdotally that it can be difficult for attorneys who are part of an ethnic minority to find community and affinity organizations. People don’t want to live in the state if there might be only a few people in their minority group in town, he said. 
Valerio, whose office oversees all public defenders in the state, has had similar problems finding lawyers to work in the public sector, he said.

“Twenty-five years ago they used to come to us,” he said. Now he has to poach lawyers from outside of the state, he said. And he figures he still has it better than private practices because there is some student loan forgiveness in the public sector, he said. 
When there are very few attorneys in a county, that also causes problems with conflict of interest, Valerio said. If a public defender has represented someone in the past, they can’t represent a case in which that same person is a witness. As a result, it becomes difficult for people to find an attorney if they’ve been involved with other lawsuits in the past, Valerio said. Diamond echoed the same concern. 
In the realm of civil law, Legal Services Vermont and Vermont Legal Aid, which handle some civil legal cases at a low cost or free of charge, are usually able to fill open positions, but do not have the financial resources to hire enough lawyers amid steep increases in housing-related cases, according to Executive Director Sam Abel-Palmer. 
The organization doesn’t have “remotely enough people to help everyone who needs help,” he said. It often serves vulnerable Vermonters who can’t afford to hire a private attorney. 
The organization has no physical offices south of Springfield and Rutland, and he considers it a barrier for people to have to travel long distances to an office, he said. 
A large bulk of the cases they handle are family law cases, and in recent years Legal Services Vermont has seen a significant uptick in eviction cases, Abel-Palmer said. The Vermont Human Rights Commission, which also handles cases of housing discrimination, has had to turn away many cases because of understaffing. 
Kennedy, a co-chair of the new Vermont Supreme Court commission, said that while he didn’t want to speak for the commission before its first meeting, he expected the group would likely turn to other states for examples of how they are addressing similar issues. 
“I hope what we’re able to do is look to see what has worked in other jurisdictions, what hasn’t worked, and use that to inform any decision we make,” Kennedy said.

(Photos by Hal Brown and Amanda Brown)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]New Jersey was hailed as a model for criminal justice reform nationally when state lawmakers eliminated cash bail more than a decade ago.
Supporters of the move cheered that poor defendants would no longer be jailed before their trial just because they couldn’t pay, and public officials celebrated the savings from a plummeting jail population.
But the two front-runners in the race to replace Gov. Phil Murphy (D) both want to change the risk-based system of pretrial incarceration that replaced cash bail.
Democrat Mikie Sherrill says she supports the current system conceptually but has concerns about defendants not showing up for court and those accused of violent crimes not being detained before trial. Republican Jack Ciattarelli blames bail reform for repeat offenders, saying he would appoint conservative judges and prosecutors and fix “loopholes” to ensure more defendants are jailed pretrial.
Neither candidate offered data to back up their concerns or specific plans for change. Supporters of cashless bail say that’s because the system works.
Former Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican who signed the 2014 bail reform law, said arguments against cashless bail often are rooted in “ignorance.” Christie spoke at a forum on Friday in Princeton on how policymakers and advocates could use bail reform as a model for sentencing reform.
“This is not some unusual, lenient way of dealing with people who have been charged with crimes. In fact, it’s been done in the federal system in every federal district, all 93 of them across the country, for a very long time,” said Christie, a former U.S. attorney for New Jersey.

 How it works

Under the cash-based bail system that predated the 2014 law, New Jersey judges set a monetary amount defendants had to pay in order to go free before their trial.
That left poor defendants who were unable to afford bail languishing sometimes months or even longer behind bars awaiting trial, while dangerous defendants could get out of jail as long as they paid, Christie noted. Such an inequitable system did little to protect public safety, he added.
“Drug dealers, violent drug dealers, and gangbangers were regularly being able to be released from prison. Why? Because you can’t set the bail high enough,” Christie said. “They got the cash because of their criminal activity.”
The 2014 bail-reform law took effect in January 2017. It requires prosecutors who consider a defendant a flight risk or a danger to the community to ask a judge to order pretrial incarceration, and the judge must consider nine risk-based factors in deciding whether to hold them. Those factors include their age at arrest, the violence of their offense, prior convictions and sentences of incarceration, and prior failures to appear in court. The courts also created an online system to allow judges, prosecutors, public defenders, and corrections officials to share information about a defendant, case status, and more, said Glenn Grant, the recently retired judge who served as the longtime administrative director of New Jersey’s courts.
Since the state embraced cashless bail, more low-level offenders await trial at home while more serious offenders get incarcerated pretrial, according to a 2023 report to the Legislature.
In 2012, more than 1,500 people were in custody because they couldn’t pay bail of $2,500 or less — representing nearly 12% of people in county jails — while less than half of county jails’ population were people charged with violent crimes, sex crimes, or weapons offenses, according to the report.
Now, most people in county jails are there for more serious first- and second-degree crimes, Grant said.
He called bail reform’s success “remarkable.”
“The state’s county jail population has been reduced by almost 40%. Eighty percent of the defendants are released within 48 hours, and a majority of that 80% are released within 24 hours,” Grant said at the Princeton forum.
Limiting pretrial incarceration to the most dangerous and elusive defendants also better protects defendants who don’t pose such risks from the harmful impacts of lengthy incarceration, such as job loss, housing loss, educational impacts, and family disruption, he added.
 Caveats and loopholes

So what exactly are Ciattarelli and Sherrill saying about the system?
Sherrill, a four-term congresswoman who worked at the New Jersey U.S. Attorney’s Office from 2012 to 2016, said she believes in the current system “with caveats” to better ensure that people don’t blow off scheduled court dates and violent offenders get held.
“We need to look at ways to make sure that, either, if they’re a danger that they’re held, or if they’re a flight risk that we have ways of getting them back to return. Often that’s (an electronic) bracelet or something like that,” she told the New Jersey Monitor.
Sherrill’s comments echoed what she told members of the New Jersey State Policemen’s Benevolent Association in August.
“What I see in too many cases with criminal justice reform is you’re throwing the baby out with the bathwater. You’re saying, I don’t like this process, so I’m going to get rid of this process, but I’m not putting anything in its place to keep us safe and to keep people accountable,” she said then.
Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman and retired medical publisher whose running mate is Morris County Sheriff Jim Gannon, promised broader changes.
“We will fix bail reform loopholes that currently allow violent and repeat offenders to walk free by appointing conservative state judges and county prosecutors as well as revising the current bail reform law to toughen rules governing juvenile offenders,” Ciattarelli told the New Jersey Monitor.
Ciattarelli added that local police confirm that “arrest, release, repeat is real.”
“It’s also demoralizing for law enforcement professionals to have to arrest the same person time and time again. Cashless bail has created a professional criminal who’s learned how to game the system,” he said.
Gannon echoed that complaint, saying police can attest that bail has “turned some of our correctional facilities into revolving doors.”

 What the data says

Grant, the former courts administrator, cites data showing there has been no increase in court no-shows, and that recidivism rates of those released “are equal to or better than” the rates before bail reform.
Almost all defendants released before trial do not reoffend, with the rate of rearrest for very serious crimes like violent felonies at less than 1% annually since 2018, according to the 2023 legislative report.
Defendants released before their trial also appear for court more consistently, with the court appearance rate at 93% in 2014 compared to 97% in 2020, the report notes.
Such statistics are why New Jersey’s cashless bail system is considered “the gold standard” nationally, Grant said.
Attorney Alexander Shalom, who was active in efforts to end New Jersey’s cash-bail system, conceded an 11-year-old law could be ripe for review to ensure it’s working. He pointed to the length of pretrial incarceration and the need to make sure defendants get their constitutional right to a speedy trial.
But he called the concerns now being aired on the campaign trail “more propaganda than reality.”
“We have to make sure that we’re making changes, when we do, based on data and reality rather than perception and fear,” said Shalom, who now heads the Lowenstein Center for Public Interest. “What we shouldn’t do is take a stray story or someone’s fear or speculation and let that drive changes to a statute that has been wildly successful at both protecting our communities and ensuring that people show up in court.”
Multiple studies have shown that bail reform has not worsened crime rates.
Reducing pretrial detention did not impact domestic violence fatalities or gun violence in New Jersey, two separate studies last year and earlier this year found. Penn State researchers found in 2019 that both New Jersey’s crime rate and pretrial jail population fell after lawmakers ended cash bail, while the Brennan Center for Justice found no link between bail reform and crime rates in a 2024 study of 33 cities that enacted cashless bail systems.
“Sometimes when a crime happens or we have a thing where there’s a rash of car thefts, people are quick to blame bail reform. But that’s not the case,” New Jersey Public Defender Jennifer Sellitti said.
 Federal attacks

Doubts persist. Observers say that is probably because of federal attacks on cashless bail.
President Donald Trump in August signed an executive order threatening federal funding cuts to cities and states with cashless bail systems, which “allow dangerous individuals to immediately return to the streets and further endanger law-abiding, hard-working Americans because they know our laws will not be enforced,” a White House statement said.
Many Republican lawmakers consequently moved to limit pretrial release.
Christie, a Trump foe, said bail reform has been “mischaracterized by my party” as liberal and permissive and noted Ciattarelli, who Trump endorsed, “will listen to some of the yelling voices in my own party about this.”
He predicted that whoever wins the governor’s race might not change New Jersey’s bail system, despite what they say on the campaign trail. But advocates and policymakers who believe in the success of New Jersey’s bail reform should fight to preserve it, he added.
“Justice which is dispensed with care, with reason, and with compassion is the best justice and should be the justice we should be striving for all the time,” he said.

The State of Wisconsin Building Commission on Tuesday approved releasing $15 million to prepare preliminary plans and a design report for major changes to Wisconsin’s prison system requested by Gov. Tony Evers. Wisconsin prisons have long been criticized for aging facilities, overcrowding and deaths. 
Republican lawmakers on the commission complained that Evers has not incorporated their ideas in his plan, but the commission ultimately voted unanimously to release the money to pay for the first step in the process of realizing it. 
At a press conference before the Building Commission meeting, Rep. Rob Swearingen (R-Rhinelander) said Republican lawmakers’ goal is “to ensure we have the information needed” for informed decisions about facility upgrades, prison capacity and responsibly closing the Green Bay Correctional Institution. 
Money for the planning will come from the state budget, which included the $15 million released by the commission Tuesday.
Under the project, the Wisconsin Department of Corrections would be able to close the Green Bay Correctional Institution, the department’s request to the commission states. Upgrades would be made to infrastructure at five other facilities, including the troubled Waupun Correctional Institution. 
The aging Waupun and Green Bay prisons have generated a public outcry over living conditions, as well as the deaths of several people incarcerated at Waupun and criminal charges filed last year against Waupun staff. 
Republicans criticize Evers’ approach
“Currently, [the Department of Corrections] is in a world of hurt,” Senate President Mary Felzkowski (R-Tomahawk) said at the Republicans’ press conference. She cited overcrowding at men’s and women’s facilities, facility infrastructure problems and the death of Lincoln Hills youth counselor Corey Proulx last year. 
Felzskowski referenced the prison proposal Evers put out in February and said he never reached out to the Legislature. 
“The Republicans in this building have plans, proposals that we’ve been working on for a long time, that we could’ve worked with the governor in a bipartisan fashion,” Felzskowski said.
Sen. André Jacque (R-New Franken) said that “what we have before us is, unfortunately, not a serious proposal.”
“…We look at a scenario where the governor says, ‘My way or the highway,’ when we know he’s not going to be in the governor’s mansion come 2027,” Jacque said, saying “it’s unfortunately a plan doomed to failure unless some additional steps are taken.”
Jacque attempted to add projects to the original motion: expansion of Taycheedah Correctional Institution, expansion of medium and minimum security beds at Jackson Correctional Institution and closure of Green Bay Correctional Institution by Dec. 31, 2029. But his motion failed with four members in favor and four opposed.
“Let’s just get something goddamn done here, please,” Evers said during the commission meeting. “…We got to fix the system, and we have an opportunity now.” In a statement, Felzkowski said she is cautiously optimistic following the building commission meeting and looks forward to “having productive conversations to move Wisconsin’s corrections system in the right direction.” 
What’s in the plan?
Under the project, the Waupun prison would become a medium security prison, and it would have upgraded housing units and  enhanced vocational programming. Gov. Tony Evers said he wants to revamp the prison into a “state-of-the-art ‘vocational village.’” 
The troubled Lincoln Hills School, which has remained open as a juvenile facility long after a deadline for closure has passed, would be converted to a 500-bed men’s medium security facility. 
Medium-security Stanley Correctional Institution, which is northeast of Eau Claire, would switch to maximum security, while John C. Burke Correctional Center in Waupun would become a women’s facility. Sanger B. Powers Correctional Center in northeast Wisconsin would receive housing expansion and kitchen replacement that would increase its capacity. 
The request to the commission included an anticipated budget and schedule, which put the total cost at $325 million and final completion in January 2031.  By releasing the planning money that had been included in the state budget, the eight-member commission, chaired by the governor and comprised of legislators from both parties, took the first step in the process. But Republicans and Evers continue to disagree on next steps. Evers promised Tuesday to include legislators in discussions throughout the process.

(Getty Images)The Indiana Court of Appeals heard arguments Tuesday in a wrongful death case that could shape how far the National Collegiate Athletic Association’s responsibility extends to former college athletes who later develop degenerative brain disease.
The estate of Christopher Riggs, a former Texas A&M football player who died in 2020 and was later diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, contends that the Indianapolis-based NCAA failed to warn athletes of known risks tied to repetitive head impacts.
Riggs played football for Texas A&M from 1965 to 1968. 
The Marion Superior Court granted summary judgment for the NCAA in January, finding the association owed Riggs no “duty of care.” His family is now asking the appellate court to overturn that ruling.
The three-judge panel — Chief Judge Melissa May, Judge Leanna Weissmann and Judge Dana Kenworthy — heard nearly 45 minutes of oral arguments Tuesday morning at DePauw University.
Attorney Tyler Zipes, arguing on behalf of Riggs’ estate, told the court the NCAA was founded in 1906 “explicitly to address health and safety issues in college sports, and specifically to address brain injuries in college football.”
Attorney Tyler Zipes argues before the Indiana Court of Appeals on Tuesday, Oct. 28, 2025. (Screenshot from livestream)
He said President Theodore Roosevelt helped lead to the NCAA’s creation when he called out college football’s “alarming” high rate brain injuries and deaths.
Zipes argued that, despite decades of research, the NCAA “failed to warn somebody in an inferior position who has less knowledge about that risk,” even though the organization “knew in the 1930s all it had to do was warn” about repetitive head trauma.
After Riggs’ death, his family filed a wrongful death claim in 2022, alleging that the NCAA breached its duty to protect athletes from long-term neurological harm.
“Throughout its history, the NCAA has not only embraced the duty or responsibility of addressing brain injuries for men and women across college sports, but specifically football,” Zipes said. “The NCAA promotes college football. It profits off college football. It profits off these players. These players go out there without knowledge of the risk that they’re being put into by taking repetitive hits over and over. And the NCAA says, ‘Well, we don’t have any duty to tell them about that?'”
“Since the 1930s, the NCAA knew that repetitive head trauma — not necessarily concussions — but repeated hits over and over to the head, can cause degenerative, latent brain disease down the road,” he continued. “To suggest that it doesn’t have a duty to tell the players … that’s bad public policy.”
‘You can’t impose duty by hindsight’
But the NCAA, represented Tuesday by Brian Paul of Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath, countered that it had no such legal duty.
He argued that the organization’s historical role was to issue health and safety “recommendations” — not legally binding rules — to its member institutions, placing ultimate responsibility on the schools themselves.
“The NCAA role is to support its members in carrying out their retained responsibility and legal duty … to care for their health and safety,” Paul said, citing the association’s long-standing principle of “institutional control,” in which member institutions retained control over the day-to-day medical care and supervision of their student-athletes.
Attorney Brian Paul, representing the National Collegiate Athletic Association, argues before the Indiana Court of Appeals on Tuesday, Oct. 28, 2025. (Screenshot from livestream)
He emphasized that in the 1960s, the NCAA had fewer than 10 employees nationally and could not practically oversee safety for thousands of student-athletes.
“You can’t impose a duty on the NCAA in the 1960s … by hindsight,” Paul told the court.
He pointed to U.S. Supreme Court precedent, warning that “to impose liability on these sorts of organizations would disincentivize them from issuing health and safety guidance,” and maintained that in the time period at issue, “the schools … were the ones who would have been [with the athletes] day in and day out at every training session, every practice, every scrimmage, in every game.”
Still, Riggs’s attorneys said that interpretation ignores decades of the NCAA’s own statements and conduct. In court filings, they noted that by the 1930s, the NCAA’s medical committee had acknowledged links between head trauma and “punch drunk” syndrome, an early term for CTE, and recommended rules requiring injured players to be withheld from play for weeks.
Those recommendations, Zipes said, were never enforced. 
“The NCAA failed to implement any such rules before or during the time Riggs played NCAA football,” the appellants brief stated.
Zipes further compared the NCAA’s stance to prior Indiana cases involving hazing and other campus safety issues, saying the NCAA was asking the court to read Yost v. Wabash College and Lanni v. NCAA too broadly.
“That’s not what the Supreme Court intended,” he said. “This is not that case. The relationship here is the only questionable factor — reasonable foreseeability.”
No timeline for decision
Paul, for the NCAA, emphasized that CTE was not diagnosed in a football player until decades after Riggs’s career. 
“What exactly should the rule have been in the mid-1960s, when Riggs played, given the state of the scientific evidence?” the NCAA wrote in an earlier motion. “How would the NCAA have known whether that rule would have minimized the potential for a type of brain injury that would not be diagnosed until decades down the road?”
The trial court’s decision — issued by Marion Superior Court Judge Timothy Oakes — created what Riggs’s attorneys called a “split” with other rulings in similar cases against the NCAA where other judges found the NCAA owed a duty to warn.
At Tuesday’s hearing, the appellate judges pressed both sides about the scope of that duty and whether the question should be left for a jury. The case is one of several pending in Indiana involving the NCAA’s responsibility for concussion-related injuries among former college athletes.
The court took the matter under advisement and did not indicate when it will rule.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin state lawmakers said a pair of bipartisan bills would help to fill existing gaps in aid after a disaster and get businesses and families back on their feet at a public hearing in the Senate Natural Resources, Veteran and Military Affairs committee Tuesday.
SB 558 would create a grant program under the Wisconsin Department of Military Affairs for people and businesses that are adversely affected by a disaster that is the subject of a state of emergency declared by the governor on or after January 1, 2025. 
A second bill, SB 557, would provide funding for the grant program, including an initial $10 million meant for individuals and another $20 million meant for businesses.
The record-breaking thousand-year storm that hit Wisconsin in August led to flooding and damage across the eastern parts of the state. President Donald Trump approved $29.8 million in federal relief funding in September to provide individual support for flood damage victims in Milwaukee, Washington and Waukesha counties. Other counties that sustained damage, including Door, Grant and Ozaukee, were not included in the federal assistance.
Rep. Dan Knodl (R-Germantown) told the committee that many residents and businesses in those counties were left without a safety net without the federal assistance. 
“It isn’t about creating a new bureaucracy, it is about ensuring that help doesn’t stop at the county line,” Knodl added. “When a disaster strikes, Wisconsin should be able to stand on its own two feet, helping our families and small businesses.”
The bills received a public hearing just days after the Trump administration denied additional disaster assistance aid to repair parks, government buildings and other public infrastructure in Door, Grant, Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Washington and Waukesha counties. 
Knodl said the legislation would ensure that Wisconsin can act “when Washington cannot or will not.” 
The bills are coauthored by Knodl and Sen. Rob Hutton (R-Brookfield) and have bipartisan support from Sens. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay), Steve Nass (R-Whitewater) and Mark Spreitzer (D-Beloit) as well as Reps. Paul Melotik (R-Grafton), Bob Donovan, Travis Tranel, Jim Piwowarczyk, Robyn Vining (D-Wauwatosa), Deb Andraca (D-Whitefish Bay), Tara Johnson (D-Town of Shelby) and Rob Kreibich (R-New Richmond).
Knodl said the bill would be especially helpful in filling the gaps for businesses. 
“Currently, small businesses have no grant options available to them, only loans. Loans can help, but for many small employers already reeling from physical and economic damage, more debt isn’t really a viable solution,” Knodl said. “These businesses are the backbone of our local economies, and when they can’t reopen, it affects not just the owners, but their employees, their customers, and really the entire fabric of the community.”
Susan Quam, executive vice president of the Wisconsin Restaurant Association, told lawmakers that many restaurants sustained large amounts of damage during the floods. She said one of the association’s  members had over $200,000 in losses just from being at the Wisconsin State Fair. She said that didn’t include losses sustained at their brick and mortar location in Wauwatosa.
“Business insurance that will cover natural disasters is becoming increasingly harder and more expensive for all businesses. We know that many of our members who are in historic buildings, especially those with landmark status, are finding it even more difficult to secure decent coverage for these kinds of disasters. As it becomes riskier to be in business, these types of grants can mean the difference between a business recovering or staying closed for good with substantial personal losses for their owners,” Quam said. “It’s imperative that these types of programs exist.” 
Businesses would be eligible for up to $50,000 for eligible disaster-related expenses incurred to  fix or replace damaged property as well as payroll assistance, working capital and business operating expenses. 
Individuals would be eligible for grants of up to $25,000 for the eligible disaster-related expenses to fix or replace personal property damaged by a disaster, home repair conducted by a contractor approved by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development and temporary housing assistance.
Grant applicants would need to provide the agency with receipts for expenses, apply within 90 days after the governor declares an emergency or within 90 days after the date on which the bill becomes law and sign an affidavit committing to return money to the agency if it is duplicated by insurance money or another source of disaster-related assistance that is not a loan awarded directly by the federal government. The DMA would need to process applications within 14 days. 
The state grants would only be available if the president of the United States has declared a major disaster to exist in this state and federal aid is made available to individuals and businesses.
Knodl said they aren’t looking to appropriate funds on a regular basis, but that funding could be sought in the case of disaster. Under the bill, DMA would have the ability to request supplemental funding from the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee if the agency determines it needs additional funding.

Biologists, volunteers and others gather to install beaver dam analogues in hopes the real critters will eventually move in.
The post Fake beaver dams help restore Wyoming wetlands appeared first on WyoFile .","My rubber boots squelched as I grabbed another 5-gallon bucket full of mud from a Wyoming Game and Fish Department herpetology technician. We performed an awkward handoff before I dumped the mud on the ground in front of my sinking boots. The squelching continued as I used my boots to mash the fresh mud up against willow branches woven among 4-inch-wide posts rammed in a streambed. 
Our little team, the herpetology technician, a Trout Unlimited project manager and another volunteer like me, were finishing up the first in a series of nearly a dozen fake beaver dams on a creek on the west side of the Snowy Range Mountains in southeast Wyoming. They’re technically called beaver dam analogues — since with their complex patterns of sticks and mud, they’re supposed to imitate real beaver dams. Although I’m not sure my noisy rubber boots really compare to the efficacy of the beaver tail.
The dams’ purpose, as the name implies, is to slow streamflow, lightly flooding banks and providing the water more time to seep into the ground. 
If we’re lucky, a family of beavers will come along and make this analogue their home, even tearing out our handiwork to construct something they like better that’s more permanent and sturdier. Beavers are, after all, professional furry engineers, who perfected their craft over millennia.

Our fake beaver dams aren’t meant to last forever. They’ll be maintained annually for about five years (unless real beavers take over earlier), but the result when established in the right place can be remarkable, restoring and rejuvenating wetlands, replenishing the water table, keeping water higher up in systems longer in the year, and providing habitat for everything from insects, frogs and toads to elk and moose, and yes, even beavers. 
Stream restoration experts like Steve Gale, the Wyoming Game and Fish Department’s aquatic habitat biologist, can and do extoll the benefits of beavers and beaver dams. And while the rest of us standing in the stream bed see their utility, we also agreed with Gale when he said: “Who doesn’t want to play in the water with mud and sticks?”
Bigger than just beavers
Before European settlers streamed onto this continent, bringing an insatiable demand for beaver pelts, the rodents lived in streams, creeks and rivers almost everywhere. They dammed any flowing water they could find and had a hand in shaping large swaths of the nation. 
While beavers can be a nuisance, falling ancient cottonwoods in parched areas and flooding creeks and irrigation ditches, they’re also one of the best examples of ecosystem engineers, Gale said, and their services have been missed. Without beavers and beaver dams, rivers run faster and cut down into the soil, they wash away sediment and move water faster from headwater states like Wyoming to other states downstream. 
Biologists have tried reintroducing beavers across the country — the Army Corps of Engineers even famously airdropped beavers into an Idaho wilderness area — with mixed success. 
So now watershed managers are turning to contraptions like the ones a team of nearly 20, including Game and Fish employees and volunteers from all over the state, helped build in mid-September. 
Two specialists with the Wyoming Game and Fish Department weave willow branches between posts in one of 11 beaver dam analogues built in mid-September. (Christine Peterson)
We stood on the banks of the South Fork of Lake Creek in the Pennock Wildlife Habitat Management Area and listened to Gale walk us through the process. In the last few decades, the South Fork of Lake Creek had cut deeper and deeper into the earth, ultimately sinking lower than the floodplain and as a result offering little water to surrounding vegetation. When runoff hit each spring, the water rushed down as plants sat parched on the banks. 
“We lost riparian habitat and riparian width, which is important for calving areas,” he said. “We’re doing this work primarily for the deer, elk and moose.”
Beavers had been reintroduced here before, but even the industrious rodents had a hard time building dams and ponds deep enough to keep them alive and safe through winter. 
We were here to help, hopefully. We would spend the bulk of the day pounding posts made from trees across the width of the creek over a quarter-mile-long stretch and then weaving bendy willow branches through the posts. After building a wall of willows, we would use buckets of mud and sod to fill in the cracks. With any luck, water would begin backing up almost immediately, eventually filling and slowly trickling over the tops. 
Life or death
As beaver dam analogues become increasingly popular, biologists with state agencies and nonprofits are teaming up to place them in streams across the landscape. 
Austin Quynn, the Trout Unlimited project manager helping direct our team, worked with groups of youth corps members over the last couple summers building, maintaining and repairing hundreds of analogues on a stream called Muddy Creek southwest of Rawlins to help habitat for four native fish species: flannelmouth and bluehead suckers, roundtail chubs and Colorado River cutthroat. Last summer, beavers came from miles downstream and tore out dozens of analogues in one stretch. He sounded amused that his work was destroyed, because in its place, they’d built a massive dam that must have been what the beavers wanted and needed.

Some of the dams blew out from spring runoff, scouring the creek bed of sediment and leaving behind gravel that cutthroat trout could use for spawning. 
Deep pools created by the analogues — and eventually beavers themselves — also offer fish refuge from the heat on mid-summer days. 
On the east side of the Snowy Range, Wendy Estes-Zumpf, Game and Fish’s herpetological coordinator, and others built eight analogues in a creek which contains one of the last boreal toad populations in southeast Wyoming. It had been a stronghold for the creatures, but in the absence of beavers, the creek became incised, leaving little wetland habitat for toads to breed and survive.
A few seasons after Estes-Zumpf’s team erected the fake beaver dams, boreal toad populations have started to come back. She counted as few as four toads on past spring surveys and found almost 30 this spring including multiple age classes. 
Beaver dam analogues aren’t a silver bullet for a drought-stricken West, Gale said, but for some species and some creeks, they could be the difference between life and death. 
Plus, it’s hard to beat a day playing in the mud.

Miller’s mythical cowboys wonder whether they're making America or Argentina great again.
The post Alrededor de la vieja fogata (Around the ol’ campfire) appeared first on WyoFile .","It was a motley looking crew that sat cross-legged around the ol’ campfire in their gaucho finery, munching on Cookie’s frijoles. They were tuckered after trailing a herd of bony cattle from the pampas of Argentina to their new home in the Big Empty. In the darkness outside the firelight, cattle bellowed and mooed in a south-of-the-border accent.

Opinion

Sweetwater Slim broke the smoky silence and said, “Fellers, I’m not too sure all this MAGA stuff is working out fer us cowboys.” Slim’s face was bruised, and there were lumps on his noggin from practicing with his South American bola, since the drovers were forbidden, by executive order, to use their King ropes. The gauchos made it look easy, but Slim kept wrapping the braided leather cords with wooden balls around himself instead of the cattle. 
“I hear ya, Slim,” said Sourdough as he tried to adjust the sash on his balloony gaucho britches, “When Trump said ‘America First,’ I thought he was talkin’ ‘bout NORTH America.”
Panhandle had a pained look on his weathered face and spat a stream of Copenhagen juice into the coals. “Worst part was swimmin’ these cows ‘cross the Panama Canal, dodgin’ freighters. But I figger we all gotta do our part to Make Argentina Great Again.”
Goshen Gus shook his head and said, “I dunno what these cows is gonna eat. Mosta the good grass on the winter range is paved over with asphalt fer that Qatari air base. I tell ya boys, the cow business is in a helluva fix these days.”
The Trail Boss strode into the campfire light to try to ease the sour mood among the sullen drovers. “These is the cards we been dealt pards,” he explained. “Trump is replacin’ Wyoming beef with Argentinian beef fer some reason. He has smart folks advisin’ him.”
Little Joe the Wrangler looked up from his copy of “How to Cuss Cows in Spanish for Dummies” and said, “Hell, they took away our Quarter Horses an’ made us ride these dinky Argentinian Paso Finos. That ain’t right. An’ we gotta use them goldarned bolas cuz ya cain’t rope offen a Paso Fino. Soon as ya dally up, a good-sized calf is gonna topple that midget cayuse over an’ drag ya both through the cactus.”
As Joe went back to his reading, he was heard to mutter, “What’s next? Change the name of our football team to the Vaqueros?”

“Look at the bright side, Joe,” comforted the Trail Boss. “At least we all got VIP tickets to tango at the grand openin’ of Trump’s new Eva Peron Memorial Ballroom. I hear tell that Kid Rock’s gonna headline. Should be a helluva shindig.”
Silence descended around the ol’ campfire, as the trail-weary crew fiddled with their new and unfamiliar gaucho paraphernalia. Usually, it took a disaster like an uncontrollable stampede or a white-out blizzard to dampen the spirits of these stalwart cowboys. But this new turn of events in favor of the homeland of Che Guevara had them all on edge.
Hoolihan grumbled, “Ya know who I put the blame on fer this mess? Our congressgal an’ senators, that’s who.”
Sweaty Stetsons nodded in the smoke.
Hoolihan continued, “Hell, they’s all in the same party, an’ they’s s’posed to be good pals with Trump. So, why didn’t they raise a fuss when he picked Argentina over us?”
Stetsons nodded more vigorously at Hoolihan’s observation.
Cookie banged on a skillet with the butt of his six-shooter to get the crew’s attention. “Don’t ferget that them politicians gotta put in appearances at the Stock Growers convention, an’ answer some tough questions from the cowbosses about it. That’ll be a livelier show than a Kid Rock twist contest in the White House. Thank you for your attention to this matter.”
“Now,” he said, wiping his hands on his greasy apron, “who wants coffee?”

When UW played a video at a recent football game of Trump celebrating coal, it politicized an event that should be about unity, writes alumna Jessica Nyffler.
The post More Wyoming football, less propaganda appeared first on WyoFile .","At the University of Wyoming’s football game this past Saturday in Laramie, the crowd was shown a propaganda video for all to see. In it, President Donald Trump applauded Wyoming and its coal industry — an industry he’s already been propping up in his less than a year in office. Trump has expanded the federal lands available for coal mining, which sounds good on the surface and appears to be something to benefit the people in this state, but neglects to mention the harm this will do to the regular Joe of Wyoming, increasing energy bills and increasing dangerous air pollution. 

Opinion

While the federal government remains shut down, affecting millions of Americans, UW apparently thought it could boost morale by showing a video promoting coal. Yet every expansion of this industry stands to harm Wyomingites, not to mention the recent blow Trump dealt to the state’s cattle industry.
Watching this video felt like being in a scene from The Hunger Games. It comes only weeks after the university led a stadium-wide moment of silence for Charlie Kirk. If we’re pausing to honor divisive extremists, why aren’t we also taking moments of silence for the children lost in school shootings, for innocent Black people lynched, or for others killed in acts of political violence?
As an alumna and current graduate student at the university, I’m not coming to the football games in Laramie to watch any administration’s propaganda. I am coming to these games to support my state and my college’s football team, and to have a good time. Judging by the near-instant eruption of boos throughout the stadium, it’s clear I’m not alone in feeling this way. Although there were also plenty of people cheering, this kind of division is not what I expect — or want — at community events meant to bring Wyomingites together.
By playing videos like this, the university is signaling to students, faculty, staff, fans and the community that the university is not a neutral establishment where everyone belongs and is welcome. 
I am deeply disappointed and embarrassed to be a student at the University of Wyoming right now. It’s disheartening to see the university promote divisive, extremist messages at events meant to unite our community — especially at a time when division already runs deep across the country.

(Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — The Omaha Public Power District delayed a vote this month to move forward on a decade-old plan to transfer two coal units at a North Omaha power plant to natural gas. 
The delay came a week after Nebraska’s attorney general sued the public utility.

OPPD’s elected board of directors had scheduled an Oct. 15 vote on whether to restart negotiations on a contract to install natural gas burners at two North Omaha Station units currently using coal. Those coal units have been running since the 1960s, while three other natural gas units, which switched away from coal in 2016, have operated since the 1950s.
OPPD has planned to “modernize” North Omaha Station since 2014 by retiring its oldest remaining natural gas units in North Omaha and ending coal burning. North Omaha residents have long petitioned for the change, largely citing health concerns, including a higher prevalence of respiratory issues.
Nebraska is the only state with exclusively publicly owned utilities providing power.
‘Thoughtful deliberation, not indecision’
At the Oct. 15 meeting, OPPD Director Mary Spurgeon, board vice president, said the decision to delay the vote came after “due diligence” and as the elected representatives had evaluated “new information” related to the North Omaha power plant over several months.
“The decision to remove this item reflects thoughtful deliberation, not indecision,” Spurgeon said at the time.

Spurgeon explained some of the challenges OPPD has faced that “have changed the factual basis underlying earlier decisions” about the North Omaha transition. Among those were a “complex and evolving energy landscape,” such as rapid demand growth for electricity, new reliability requirements, extended infrastructure timelines and significant inflationary pressures.
OPPD in 2019 adopted a goal to achieve “net-zero” carbon emissions by 2050, at a time when electricity demand was growing fairly flat year over year. Since 2019, OPPD’s peak load has grown by more than 400 megawatts year-round, and the utility anticipates more than 2,000 megawatts of additional energy needs over the coming years, Spurgeon said. 
“We will continue to evaluate all options through the lens of reliability, affordability and the well-being of our customers and community,” Spurgeon said. “We remain committed to making decisions that maintain the long-term health of the system so we may continue to power the lives of those we serve.”
Pending lawsuit
Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers filed a lawsuit Oct. 9 seeking to stop OPPD’s planned North Omaha Station transition, as well as stop the utility from pursuing any “environmental justice” or other goals, including the net-zero ambitions, if such policies would jeopardize electricity affordability and reliability.

Hilgers pointed to state law that he argues mandates customer affordability and reliability as the chief goals of public utilities. He said environmental goals can still be managed, but only if affordability and reliability are prioritized.
“We should not be taking one electron off the grid,” Hilgers said when announcing the lawsuit.
Hilgers’ office declined to comment on OPPD’s delay. OPPD declined to comment for this story, citing the pending litigation. The case has been assigned to Douglas County District Court Judge Timothy Burns.
North Omaha residents respond
Some members of the public and one state lawmaker who attended the OPPD meeting argued that Hilgers overreached and that he seeks to interfere with a local government’s long-term promise to its community. Many who spoke said they thought the agreement was to make the change “by” 2026.
“We’re tired of being treated as expendable. We’re tired of having people not care about our health and the health of our neighbors,” said Mele Mason, who represents Florence on a North Omaha committee.

Multiple residents told the OPPD board that they were tired of what they felt were goal posts moving. In 2022, OPPD voted to delay the transition plan until 2026.
At that time, the North Omaha Station transition was made contingent on adding new power-producing plants to the OPPD grid. Those new plants could produce 600 megawatts, more than the units operating in North Omaha now, according to court records. Hilgers contended that the costs of adding such capacity, while shutting off other power, might help OPPD “tread water.”
‘Keep your promise’
OPPD and Hilgers cite local, state and federal data that the North Omaha power plant complies with emissions and health standards. Multiple residents, as well as State Sen. Terrell McKinney, one of two lawmakers whose districts cover North Omaha, told OPPD they’ve seen something different on the ground.
Terri Crawford, second vice president for the NAACP in Omaha, said she knows “far too well” the human cost in North Omaha as her son died from asthma. She said repeated assertions from OPPD and the state that data regarding environmental impacts of the power plant don’t exist or don’t show harms in North Omaha are “intellectually dishonest.”
“Keep your promise so that not one more child has to go to the emergency room and not one more child has to die from asthma,” Crawford said.

Alana Haynes Stein, an environmental sociology professor at Creighton University, said she teaches a class in which students map Omaha and statistics, finding higher rates of air pollution and asthma and lower life expectancies for North Omaha residents.
Haynes Stein said action could help prevent the case of her mother, who lost her father, a coal miner who suffered black lung, when she was nine years old. 
“The price is too high not to act,” she said.
Transition possible late 2026
According to most recent OPPD materials, the board’s plan for the North Omaha Station awaits a study from the “Southwest Power Pool” on how OPPD can add new generation to the regional electrical grid organization. Southwest Power Pool is the overarching regional transmission organization overseeing the electricity grid in the central part of the country.
OPPD board materials indicate the study should come before a contract is awarded to install the North Omaha plant’s new natural gas burners.

An estimated OPPD timeline put the study as being approved in the third quarter of 2025 — July through September — and a contract for the work awarded by the end of this year. Transitioning would not occur until the final three months of 2026 according to that timeline. 
Even in 2022, board materials suggested North Omaha Station might operate as-is through 2026.
The OPPD Board of Directors has two more monthly meetings scheduled this year. McKinney said he hopes North Omaha Station is back on the agenda in November.
‘Supply and demand issue’
McKinney led an Oct. 15 letter with nine other state senators urging Hilgers to withdraw his lawsuit. Progressive lawmakers described his actions as “inappropriate and politically motivated” and wrote that the lawsuit “threatens to derail years of public work, community engagement and hard-won progress toward environmental safety.”
“This lawsuit sends a chilling message to every Nebraskan fighting for healthy communities that when a community finally compels action from public institutions, the state’s top lawyer may step in to stop it,” the letter states.

Hilgers, who served as a state senator between 2017 and 2023, including as speaker of the Legislature in his final two years, has said it’s not the right time to shut off any power units with peak energy demands rising and risks to cost. His office had no comment on the lawmakers’ letter.
The state senators argued that consumer costs might increase regardless of North Omaha’s status and that other changes, including regulating data centers, might be more helpful.
State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, chair of the Legislature’s Natural Resources Committee, has joined Hilgers in voicing skepticism about the North Omaha transition, as has State Sen. Jared Storm of David City, who led a legislative study in September into net-zero energy plans. OPPD answered questions from Brandt and Storm as part of that study, which are included in the Hilgers-led lawsuit.
Gov. Jim Pillen praised Hilgers’ OPPD lawsuit after it was announced and urged OPPD not to cease coal power production in Omaha. Hilgers had hinted when he announced his lawsuit that if OPPD could prioritize affordability and reliability while ending coal burning in North Omaha, he might be able to support it. OPPD still burns coal at its separate Nebraska City Station, a 1,337.5-megawatt facility.
“Ultimately, it is a supply and demand issue,” Hilgers said previously. “It would defy reality and economics to suggest that taking 200-plus megawatts offline, given this demand environment we’re in, will do anything other than increase the cost to [OPPD] ratepayers.”

The commission developed the process for submitting the plans after the Idaho Legislature passed Senate Bill 1183, which created the Wildfire Standard of Care Act, earlier this year. 
The new law went into effect July 1 and requires investor-owned utility companies such as Idaho Power, Rocky Mountain Power, Avista Utilities and Atlanta Power to adopt and submit wildfire mitigation plans to the Idaho Public Utilities Commission for approval every year. 
Under the new state law, the plans must include prevention actions and programs the electric utility will carry out to reduce the risk of wildfire; identification of the areas where utilities have infrastructure or equipment that that may be subject to heightened risk of wildfire; public awareness efforts the utility will take before, during and after wildfire season to inform the public of wildfire risk; and more.
Under the new law, municipal-owned electric utilities and electric utility co-ops are allowed to voluntarily submit wildfire mitigation plans to the commission, but are not required to. The Idaho Public Utilities Commission regulates investor-owned utilities companies, but does not regulate municipal-owned electric utilities, like Idaho Falls Power, or electric utility co-ops, like Northern Lights Electric Cooperative. 
 Who pays for Idaho wildfires? Bill sponsor says law protects consumers

Sen. Jim Woodward, R-Sagle, who also serves as a board member of the Northern Lights Electric Cooperative, sponsored the Wildfire Standard of Care Act. Woodward said he sponsored the bill to help protect utility customers and members of small electric utility co-ops from having to pay wildfire damages or large court-ordered fines if the utility was not actually responsible for causing the wildfire.

“We all know wildfire is more prevalent, especially on the West Coast, and we need to make sure the bill for wildfire is being paid by those who are actually at fault,” Woodward said in a phone interview. 
Woodward said he had been talking with the Northern Lights Electric Cooperative’s board, municipalities and the Idaho Consumer Owned Utilities Association for years about a potential bill. 
“As a (utility co-op) board member, I had watched other areas where electric utilities – sometimes through their own fault causing a wildfire and sometimes not – but most of the time the electric utility is seen as the one with the deep pockets,” Woodward said. “So whether they were at fault or not, often when it ends up in court, the entity with the deep pockets is the one who has to pay.”
Issues with wildfires, utilities and liability have come up in Idaho in recent years. In 2024, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission denied a request from Rocky Mountain Power to limit its own liability, even in cases of gross negligence, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
In a separate incident, earlier this year, Idaho Power reportedly agreed to pay an $800,000 settlement to help pay to restore wildfire habitat that burned in the October 2024 Valley Fire that started in the foothills east of Boise. That fire started after a power line touched the ground, the Sun previously reported. 
 What needs to be included in utility company’s wildfire mitigation plans?

	 
The Idaho Public Utilities Commission, which has 44 full-time staff members, collaboratively developed the process for submitting wildfire mitigation plans after the Idaho Legislature passed the new law this year, Idaho Public Utilities Commission Public Information Officer Adam Rush said. 
“Staff developed the process for submitting wildfire mitigation plans based on the requirements of Senate Bill 1183 (Idaho Code Title 61, Chapter 18), which mandates that utilities include detailed information in their plans,” Rush said in an emailed statement. “These include how they will address geographical areas with heightened wildfire risk, the preventative actions and programs they will implement, community outreach and public awareness efforts and how line design methods will reduce ignition potential.”
The Idaho Capital Sun made several requests this month to interview Rush or Idaho Public Utilities Commission staff members about the new law and wildfire mitigation plans directly, either over the phone, via Zoom or in person. However, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission rejected those requests and only agreed to answer written questions via email. 
 What happens after utilities submit their wildfire mitigation plans?

Along with developing the process for submitting plans, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission also developed a rolling filing for utilities to submit their plans over the next six months. Once the plans are submitted, the commission’s staff has up to six months to evaluate and then approve or deny the plans, Rush said. 
“During the review, commission staff will assess whether each plan includes all required elements outlined in Idaho Code …” Rush wrote. “This includes evaluating geographical risk assessments, preventative measures, infrastructure inspections, vegetation management strategies, situational awareness tools, and community outreach efforts.”
Officials with Idaho Power already submitted their wildlife mitigation plan to the utilities commission on Oct. 10, spokesman Sven Berg said. 
“Safety is always a priority at Idaho Power, for our employees, our customers, and our communities,” Berg said. “Idaho’s Wildfire Standard of Care Act establishes a framework for us to work with the IPUC and the public to develop an approved wildfire mitigation plan. That plan establishes our responsibility to the public with respect to wildfire risk.”
“The act gives the (Idaho Public Utilities Commission) responsibility for setting clear standards for utilities, and the Commission has done that through a thoughtful public process that considers input from all stakeholders,” Berg added.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Children taken from their homes as a result of abuse and neglect continue to be forced to sleep in state office buildings four years after the practice first drew widespread public condemnation, the Department of Children’s Services chief acknowledged to lawmakers on Tuesday.
Margie Quin, the department’s commissioner, faced sharply worded questioning by lawmakers on the House Finance, Ways and Means Committee in a regularly scheduled review of state agencies.
“As recently as May 2025 there’ve been reports of children sleeping in DCS offices statewide and it never stopped,” Rep. David Hawk, a Republican from Greeneville said. 
“What care are they getting in DCS offices for their highly needy situations?” he asked.
Quin said children and teens with juvenile violations and those with higher medical and behavioral needs sometimes take days to assess for an appropriate placement, necessitating short stays in offices rather than foster homes or residential treatment facilities.
She defended the practice as providing similar levels of care to children taken into state custody as other settings.
“The services they are getting inside a DCS office are not dissimilar from what they are getting in a transitional home,” she said. “Obviously they’re not in a home. They’re not in a homelike setting and that is extraordinarily unfortunate.”
Quin said DCS made a decision three years ago to not put children in hotels and AirBnB’s are not an option, she said. “We don’t have any other houses, so they’re in an office.”
Kids in state custody forced to sleep on floors in state office building

“We do take them every day to shower. We do take them to school. They do receive their education. We do employ behavioral health specialists. In some cases we have to bring security in the offices,” she said. “And there are case managers — most of the time there are two case managers with that child or with that youth —while they’re in the office.”
The department drew scrutiny four years ago for the then-widespread practice of putting children to bed for the night on the floors in caseworkers’ offices when the Tennessee Lookout published video of children asleep in one Tennessee office. Some of the children slept on bare floors with no pillows, blankets or other bedding.
Data on the number of children who continue to sleep on office floors was not immediately available. 
Hawk, during Tuesday’s hearing, also demanded the department turn over information on the number of sexual assaults that have taken place in co-ed transitional settings such as the state offices and temporary homes that are operated by nonprofits, churches and other outside organizations. 
“I have numerous instances of anecdotal information about sexual assaults taking place,” Hawk said, requesting that Quin provide him with the total number of sexual assaults committed against children in DCS custody since she assumed office.
Quin told lawmakers that the agency had made progress since she took over in September 2022. 
More children have been placed with families and relatives over foster care with strangers thanks to a $32 million allocation from the legislature, she said. 
Caseloads have dropped, but remain high in areas like Davidson County, where social workers juggle about 20 cases at a time. The best practice is 12, she noted. 
Salary hikes approved for entry level caseworkers have curbed high turnover rates and staffing shortfalls. And the department is deploying more resources into homes to prevent the need for children coming into state custody.
“A successful turnaround is occurring at our agency,” she said.

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation is looking to the North Dakota Legislature to address a major “impediment” to health care access on the state’s tribal reservations. 
During a Friday State and Tribal Relations Committee meeting, Good Road Recovery Center Director Jasten Schock told lawmakers of his two years working at the Bismarck-based treatment facility, he’s spent the most time working around “IMD waivers.”
An Institution for Mental Diseases, or IMD, is defined by federal regulation as a facility with more than 16 beds that focuses on providing services for people with mental illnesses and substance abuse disorders. 
Facilities with more than 16 beds are not eligible for Medicaid reimbursements, a threshold Schock called an “archaic, outdated regulation.” 
States can seek such payments through an IMD waiver, which is available in 37 states — but not North Dakota. 
According to the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services, Medicaid members can receive payments in an IMD setting through other mechanisms, like the state’s Substance Use Disorder voucher, or through agreements available at Fargo-based mental health clinic Prairie St. John.

MHA Nation Chair Mark Fox said because North Dakota doesn’t have the waiver, the tribes are forced to send dozens of their members to other states for treatment services that cost them far more than the cost of care locally. 
“It’s really getting out of hand,” Fox said.
“We never asked for a dime to build our drug treatment facility in Bismarck. All we’re asking for is for the state to support Medicare and Medicaid giving us a waiver so that we can treat more than 16 people at a time,” he continued. “Because of these limitations, if we treat more, we don’t get reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid, but if the state agrees to support a waiver and it’s granted, we can treat the 60-some people we’ve invested to treat.”
Fox said he hopes Gov. Kelly Armstrong’s recent trip to the reservation puts momentum on the effort to get the waivers. 
Joy Froelich, a physician at the treatment facility, emphasized to the lawmakers that getting people into recovery saves a multitude of costs in the long-term, like money spent on law enforcement and the courts system. 
Indigenous North Dakotans consistently see the highest rates of substance use compared to their white counterparts, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. 
“If we could make sure we’re helping people get sober, we get them back to the workplace — they won’t need Medicaid,” Froelich said.  
MHA Councilwoman Monica Mayer, who is a medical doctor, told the committee that high rates of substance use disorders coupled with the 16-person threshold, make up a significant section on the long list of “impediments” to providing quality health care services on the reservations. 
“We pay $40 million in premiums annually. We’re trying to reduce that. And the way to reduce it is to get people on Medicaid and Medicare,” Mayer said of overall health care costs, not just substance use disorder treatment. 
“It’s gotten so bad, that we carry the burden of having to cover their insurance and their premiums. We’re not talking millions of dollars — we’re talking billions over the past decade,” she said. 
After a lengthy discussion on Friday afternoon, Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, opted to begin drafting a bill to establish North Dakota’s version of an IMD waiver. 
The draft legislation will be discussed at the next State Tribal Relations Committee meeting. That date has not been set.

Greg Cornett, company president (right) says Neronha is ""playing politics."" (Photos by Christopher Shea and Nancy Lavin/Rhode Island Current)Few could find fault with the prospect of hundreds of millions of dollars in winter energy bill credits for Rhode Islanders.
Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha can, and is, arguing that Rhode Island Energy is lowballing customers in the discounts required under the terms of its 2022 acquisition of the state’s gas and electric business. 
“Immediate relief for skyrocketing and unstable energy costs is desperately needed,” Neronha said in a statement Friday. “However, the discount rate that Rhode Island Energy used to calculate how much they owe ratepayers shortchanges Rhode Islanders by tens of millions. Rhode Island Energy needs to keep up their end of the bargain and provide the full value they owe to ratepayers, many of whom are struggling to make ends meet.”
The scathing rebuke comes as the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission kicks off its review of Rhode Island Energy’s proposed rollout of customer bill credits. Written testimony was due on Oct. 23, with a set of in-person hearings scheduled for next month.
Rhode Island Energy President Greg Cornett first unveiled the company’s plan to ease the pain of skyrocketing energy bills through bill credits at a July press conference. Cornett touted the $155 million in discounts on gas and electric bills, to be distributed across a three-month period at the start of 2026 and 2027, as a show of support for struggling customers. If approved, the proposal would slash customers’ electric bills by $20 to $30 per month, with a $40 to $50 cut to monthly gas bills, during the coldest and most expensive time of year.
But it’s not just good will behind the discounts. They were mandated under the terms of the 2022 sale of state gas and electric operations from National Grid to Rhode Island Energy’s parent company, PPL Corp. 
State utility regulators required the company to shield customers from shouldering the cost of tax and accounting changes associated with sale. Additional conditions and ratepayer protections were imposed by the Attorney General’s office under a separate settlement with PPL.
PPL initially estimated the dollar figure for its “hold harmless commitment” — sparing Rhode Island customers from tax expenses — at $240 million over 37 years. Adjusted to today’s numbers, the company arrived at a $149 million present-day value.
The dispute centers on the discount formula the company used to determine the worth of the electric lines and gas and electric distribution services today: weighted average cost of capital. The financial metric is commonly used by businesses to project rates of return based on company investments and debt.
 The wrong focus

Neronha’s office argued that customers — not the company — should be centered in the calculations.
“The use of the Company’s WACC as a discount rate to determine the value of money owed to ratepayers over time overlooks the obvious fact that Rhode Island Energy’s customers are differently positioned than the Company in terms of their ability to invest the money coming into their pockets today, instead of in the future,” Nicholas Vaz, special assistant attorney general, wrote in an Oct. 23 filing to state utility regulators.
Written testimony from Chiara Trabucchi, an economic and financial expert hired by Neronha’s office, explains why the weighted average capital cost is an inappropriate formula. 
“By the Company’s own admission, the WACC is a private discount rate that represents the rate at which it evaluates its own internal investment decisions,” Trabucchi wrote in her Oct. 23 testimony. “Use of the WACC to discount a public benefit to present value presupposes that the Company and the customer act with the same economic motivation, share the same  investment goals, and enjoy comparable access to capital markets. This simply is not the case. The Company and the customer are not equal market participants.”
Put another way: PPL is considering risks to its own operations and to its shareholders in its formula, but Rhode Island customers don’t stand to suffer or benefit from those same investment decisions.
Trabucchi, who works as a principal for a business consulting firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts, instead suggested using the customer-deposit rate or the 10-year fixed U.S. Treasury yield as alternatives.
The two risk-free discount rates generate $37 million and $39 million more, respectively, than the formula used by PPL Corp. 
“If Rhode Island Energy wants to front load some of the hundreds of millions of dollars secured for Rhode Island ratepayers at the time of the sale, that’s fine by me, but they better be coughing up every last penny that they owe,” Neronha said.
RI Energy responds 
Cornett accused Neronha of “playing politics” in response.
“This was an entirely voluntary effort that Rhode Island Energy and our parent company undertook to bring relief to customers during the upcoming colder winter months in 2026 and 2027,” Cornett said in a statement on Monday. “We are deeply disappointed with the Attorney General’s actions and rhetoric.”
Cornett also noted that the company’s proposal was backed by Gov. Dan McKee, and approved by the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, the administrative arm of the state utility agency, in September. However the Public Utilities Commission, the politically appointed, three-member panel, has not weighed in.
In an initial, written notice, the commission acknowledged the formula fight unfolding between the company and Neronha’s office. Its review and investigation will focus on the method for calculating the bill credits, as well as how the discount is distributed between residential, commercial and industrial customers of different sizes.
A final decision on the proposal has not been scheduled as of Tuesday. If approved, the discounts as proposed by Rhode Island Energy would be given in January through March of 2026, and again over the same three months in 2027.
The proposed discounts are unrelated to bill credits authorized by state regulators on Monday.

Every time there was even a hint of Idaho water being poached by another state, the entire Congressional delegation – Sens. Jordan and Frank Church and Reps. Orval Hansen and Jim McClure – spoke out loud and clear against it. When President Richard Nixon ended beef import quotas in June of 1972 so as to bring in more beef and lower prices, the delegation collectively raised hell. Jordan always vigorously opposed actions that would harm farmers in other states, figuring there was strength in numbers.
Len Jordan was the epitome of courage, having stood up to a president of his own party numerous times. He spoke out and voted against Nixon’s two segregationist U.S. Supreme Court nominees – Clement Haynsworth and G. Harrold Carswell. He led the Senate floor fight in 1972 to force Nixon to spend funds lawfully appropriated by Congress. He supported the president when he thought he was right and opposed him when he was wrong.
With Jordan’s example in mind, it is frightening to see the craven cowardice of Idaho’s top politicians – Sens. Jim Risch and Mike Crapo, Reps. Mike Simpson and Russ Fulcher and Gov. Brad Little. When Donald Trump acts against the interests of farmers, we don’t hear a peep from these officials who are supposed to represent our interests.
When Trump announced to Californians a year ago that he wanted to send them Columbia River waters, our politicos remained silent. His Jan. 24 executive order meddling with irrigation water in federal storage did not elicit a peep. We can only hope he doesn’t try that in Idaho, as it does not appear our elected heroes will push back.
Our congressional delegation is afraid of telling Trump that the constitutional power to set tariffs is theirs, not his, and that his tariffs are raising farmers’ costs for fertilizer, machine parts, lumber, chemicals and practically everything they buy. Sen. Crapo should take a particular interest in the tariff problem because he is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, which is responsible for setting tariffs. Somebody should probably wake him up and let him know that Trump tariffs are hurting folks on the farm.
Idaho is not big into soybeans, but Midwestern farmers are desperate for help on soybeans. China bought $12.6 billion in U.S. soybeans last year, but absolutely none this year, thanks to retaliation for Trump’s erratic tariffs. Trump admires Argentina’s nutty President, Javier Milei, and spent 20 billion U.S. taxpayer dollars to keep him in office. Milei won at the expense of Midwestern farmers. China bought more than one million tons of Argentinian soybeans to fill its need and will likely purchase Argentinian and Brazilian soybeans long into the future. U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said the Argentine bailout was “probably one of the grossest things” she’s ever seen. Idaho’s top elected officials could not crank up the courage to protest.
Closer to home, Trump is throwing a haymaker at Idaho’s beef producers. I grew up in the cattle business. For many years my father, Henry Jones, had the largest beef operation in southern Idaho. It is kind of a boom or bust business. It happens to be the one bright spot on the agricultural scene in Idaho and across the country, but there have been many bust years and producers finally have a chance to make up for them. 
But destroying the market of U.S. soybean farmers was not enough to help President Milei, so Trump now wants to quadruple beef imports from Argentina to knock down beef prices in the U.S. Trump claimed he had to help because Argentina was “dying, alright? They are dying.” Cattlemen in Idaho and across the country are justifiably outraged. Rep. Greene said, “honestly it’s a punch in the gut to all of our American cattle ranchers.” Senators representing South Dakota, Utah, Montana and Utah have publicly objected to Trump’s plan, but our congressional delegation and governor have remained silent, apparently frightened to stand up for our farm community.
That’s not really surprising because none of them will say anything about the thuggish tactics employed by ICE against Idaho’s undocumented workers who harvest our crops, milk our cows and do the important work that keeps Idaho’s agricultural sector operating. If our officials can’t muster the courage to do their jobs, they should either undergo spinal transplants or check themselves into retirement homes.

Andy Ogles of Tennessee's 5th Congressional District for the third consecutive election cycle. (Photo: U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles)President Donald Trump is supporting U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles in a third congressional race, this time in the Republican primary against former Tennessee Agriculture Commissioner Charlie Hatcher despite questions about the sitting congressman’s finances.
Trump gave out the endorsement last week even as Ogles took on more than $50,000 in debt during the latest reporting period for legal consulting with the law firm Holtzman Vogel, financial reports show.
Similarly to most Republican candidates, Hatcher, a veterinarian, linked his election effort to Trump by saying the president would have made a good farmer because of his work ethic.
Hatcher could not be reached for comment, but seemingly unperturbed, he said in a statement to the Tennessee Journal, “Never quit anything before, not quitting now. Looking forward to earning Trump’s support.”
On his website he also managed to take a dig at Ogles, who held up a House speaker vote early in his first term and sought an investigation of Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell for criticizing a federal sweep of Nolensville Road in South Nashville, a heavily immigrant residential area. 
“Think what President Trump could do if our congressman spent less time talking and more time doing,” Hatcher said on his website. 
Yet days after Hatcher entered the race, Ogles landed the endorsement because of his consistent support for the president.
Trump called Ogles a “conservative warrior” who is working to cut taxes, promote U.S.-made products, “safeguard” elections and secure the border.
U.S. House ethics board calls for more investigation of Tennessee 5th District congressman

Ogles avoided a criminal investigation into his finances early this year after introducing legislation to enable Trump to seek a third presidential term.
The congressman received approval last year to open a trust fund for donations to pay off nearly $120,500 in legal debts he owes to four firms. The Maury County Republican’s legal problems stem from a congressional investigation of reporting errors in his Federal Election Commission and financial disclosure reports.
The House Ethics Committee found Ogles likely violated federal campaign finance laws, mainly by reporting an inflated personal loan to make his bid for office look stronger in 2022. Ogles initially said he raised $450,000 for the race, yet his first FEC report showed he brought in only $250,000.
Ogles amended campaign finance reports in May 2024 and acknowledged making a $20,000 loan to his campaign and saying the additional $300,000 was in a joint account he shared with his wife.
Following the state legislature’s 2022 gerrymandering of House districts that split Nashville into three districts, Ogles vaulted to victory in the Republican primary over former House Speaker Beth Harwell and attorney Kurt Winstead, then staved off a challenge in last year’s primary from Metro Council member Courtney Johnston. In both 2022 and 2024, he has handily beaten his Democratic opponents in the general election.

Here, smoke plumes and hurricane clouds are visible at once. Credit: NASA Earth ObservatoryClimate change has become “that” topic – like evolution of species, plate tectonics, or AI – where the public has heard so much about it that many think they know everything they need to know. 
Such confidence is both a good and bad thing.  
The upside is the biggest global societal problem of our time, climate change, has become a part of the broader culture. The vast majority of the world  agrees that something must be done to mitigate global warming – 69% of the world population is willing to contribute 1% of their income to climate mitigation, and 89% demand climate action from their governments and politicians. 62% of Americans feel a personal duty to reduce the effects of climate change. 
However, the downside is that most lack a sufficient foundation in the science of climate change which creates misconceptions, a lack of ability to discern pseudoscience, and an ill-founded surety about the realities of global warming.  
Misconceptions get in the way of understanding the science behind the predictions of climate change to the point where mitigation efforts are derailed or stalled. The consequence is that anthropogenic climate change, a phrase used to describe the change in climate attributable to human activity, becomes a political “belief” rather than accepted as scientific discourse.  
The U.S. is among the most politically divided countries about anthropogenic climate change. Despite 61% of Americans regarding the scientific evidence supporting a warming Earth as solid, the current administration has successfully and systematically defunded most of its institutions providing the most scientifically sound information and educational materials about climate change. The damage to NASA, NOAA, NIH, and EPA is profound and is threatening the exalted status of the U.S. as a global leader in scientific research. 
Such misguidedness stems in part from “pluralistic ignorance” (the tendency of individuals to underestimate the willingness of others to want to mitigate climate change), and in greater part from “climate modeling ignorance.”  
One of the most pernicious misconceptions about climate change is the idea that climate models make projections for the next 100 years by simply extrapolating the globally averaged changes in weather patterns over the last 40 – 50 years into the future. This is an important misconception to correct because it goes to the core of the credibility of climate models in the mind of lay people who make political decisions about mitigating hazards of anthropogenic climate change.  
This misconception is an outgrowth from another one – that weather and climate are the same thing.  
Many lay people do not realize that both regional and global climate is determined by many factors beyond atmospheric chemistry and dynamics, including (but not limited to) ocean circulation, the thermal properties of both seawater and ice, the extent and volume of ice cover, as well as Earth’s orbital parameters – are all part and parcel of climate models .  
Schematic illustrating fields and topics contributing to creation, modification, and usage of climate models. Contributing topics and fields are not exhaustive. | Graphic provided by Figen Mekik
For example, “Will it snow tomorrow?” is a meteorological question, while “How will the El Nino event in the tropical Pacific Ocean affect winters in West Michigan?” is a Climate System Science question. This distinction matters for making decisions about mitigating climate change because it fosters the understanding that teleconnections affect both global and regional climate, and that a persistent change related to global warming in the natural cyclicity of a distant interaction between ocean and atmosphere (El Nino in the tropical Pacific) can change what to expect in West Michigan in the next 50 or 100 years. 
Another pervasive misconception is the confusion of Environmental Science with Climate Science.  
Two big questions arise: “What can a climatologist do that an environmental scientist cannot?” and “Why does developing Climate Science programs in colleges distinct from environmental science matter for the lay person, the broader public?”
Nationally, while both Environmental Science and Climate Science programs are broadly multidisciplinary and interrelated, they have important differences. Climate Science is a physical science focusing on the causes, direct effects, and changes in climate through all of Earth’s history including the Anthropocene (the “Human Era”) through computational models involving the chemistry and physics of climate change; while Environmental Science is a natural science broadly involving ecology, microbiology, soil science, conservation, restoration, natural resource management, entomology, pollution, water quality, and similar. 
For example, pollution of a river system is a massive environmental problem. So is recycling waste. But neither are problems directly related to climate change. Similarly, availability of food or clean water is a sustainability question related more to human population growth, economics, politics, and environmental change than climate change; though of course the greater the human population, the greater the amount of greenhouse gasses emitted to the atmosphere which leads to climate warming.  SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
So, climate change affects and informs environmental change and sustainability but is only one aspect of those fields. The change in duration of the annual growth season or warmer temperatures shifting to higher latitudes will affect the availability of food and water – these are sustainability issues.  
Unfortunately, only a handful of colleges and universities across the United States have developed college majors specifically in Climate Science, most recently Grand Valley State University. However, academic programs specifically dedicated to Climate System Science are a new national trend – so new in fact that it is difficult to find information about the number of students enrolled or graduates produced annually nationwide.  
What has this got to do with “climate modeling ignorance”? 
Creating academic programs specifically focused on Climate System Science with a bend toward climate modeling is crucial at these times of swift and dangerous climate change. Lay people (the voting public) need to better understand the scientific basis for the causes and predictions related to anthropogenic climate change so humanity can make better informed decisions about mitigation efforts.  
Everyone cannot dedicate resources and time to majoring in Climate Science, but growing a population of well-educated climate scientists will help create a more climate literate public. Individuals specialized in climate system science who understand the strengths and uncertainties associated with climate modeling will inform the broader public about anthropogenic climate change and more effective ways of countering and preventing its hazardous effects.  
A Communications major who is minoring in Climate Science may pursue a career as a climate journalist or spokesperson. In essence, a student minoring or majoring in Climate Science becomes a person who fosters climate literacy in their communities. 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average salary for climatologists is $94,570 annually, there were 10,500 people employed as climatologists in 2020, and the projected growth rate for climatologist jobs between 2020 and 2030 is 8%.  According to ZipRecruiter, the average earnings for a climate scientist or climate change specialist is $111,343.  
In summary, degrees in Climate Science and Environmental Science are distinct from one another by content and by job prospects they offer.  
The job prospects for climate scientists are numerous and varied because climatologists are urgently needed in a world where climate is changing fast and often unpredictably.

(Photo courtesy of Esteban Fernandez/Times WV)A Marion County judge has lifted a temporary restraining order that could have halted Gov. Patrick Morrisey’s sale of a Fairmont long-term care hospital. 
The governor is selling in total four long-term care hospitals in West Virginia, saying that the facilities have been operating at a $6 million yearly loss to the state. The sale is set to close Friday.
A 94-year-old resident of John Manchin Sr. Health Care Center in Fairmont sued Morrisey and Department of Health Facilities Secretary Michael Caruso last week seeking to stop the sale. 
Her attorney, Sen. Joey Garcia, argued that Morrisey and Caruso didn’t have the legal authority to sell the state-owned hospitals — which often serve elderly patients who have no other options — without the Legislature’s approval. 
The governor and secretary couldn’t “willy nilly, take this department and dismantle it,” Garcia said.
On Tuesday, Marion County Circuit Court Judge Matthew S. Delligatti sided with the state, saying, “The secretary does have the authority to proceed with the sale of the John Manchin Health Facility.”
New York-based Marx Development Group is buying the properties in Beckley, Fairmont, Terra Alta and West Columbia for $60 million. A subsidiary of the company, Majestic Care, will operate the hospitals. 
Delligatti issued a temporary restraining order stopping the sale of the John Manchin facility last week following Garcia’s lawsuit.  
The plaintiff, Mary DeVito, has dementia and requires help eating, bathing and more. Her mother, Cathie Metheny, acts as her power of attorney. 
Metheny said in court that her mom had always received excellent care for seven years at the John Manchin center and she worried about the change in ownership.
Majestic Care is contractually required to build at least three new hospitals on a set timeline, and they’ve committed $80 million to the project. But there is no requirement about where they build the hospitals, prompting concerns that the hospitals could leave the rural areas they serve. 
The John Manchin hospital needs $535,000 in maintenance; all the facilities combined need $3.9 million in deferred maintenance. 
Metheny, who said she visited her mother nearly every day, was very concerned about her mother potentially being moved outside of Fairmont to a new hospital. 
“I’m only 2.6 miles away,” she said. “It has kept her alive.”
Metheny shared other concerns about potential staff turnover and that her mother could be discriminated against.
Lawyers for the state laid out arguments to quell those concerns, saying that around 90% of employees are staying on to work with Majestic Care. Additionally, the company has committed to keeping current patients. 
Aaron Snodgrass, chief financial officer for the Department of Health Facilities, said in court that any potential delay to the closing this Friday could result in harm to hundreds of patients across the four facilities. The state’s contracts with vendors, including those providing food and pharmacy services to patients, are set to expire Friday, and there’s no guarantee that services could be renewed by the weekend. 
“It’s going to be very difficult because of the state purchasing rules,” Snodgrass said. “We cannot operate a facility without a contract in place.”
Some hospital employees’ insurance is set to expire this week as they’ll no longer receive state benefits. 
Garcia argued that the buyer had already delayed the closing last month, and the state could deal with contract extensions once again. 
The judge felt that pausing the sale days away from the closing would bring too much harm.
“ … Harm to patients, employers and others would be greater than the plaintiff’s,” Delligatti said.
While Garcia had argued that a 2023 bill creating the Department of Health Facilities didn’t give the secretary the authority to sell the hospitals, the judge noted that the “language in the statute is unambiguous.” 
As for whether it was a good practice for the governor or secretary to sell state-owned hospitals without the Legislature’s approval, Delligatti said that was not a policy for the court to decide. 
Metheny also stressed that she wished Morrisey and his administration had been more forthcoming about details of the sale, including their plans to keep staff and patients. Communication issues have been a central sticking point for lawmakers, many of whom found out about the sale minutes before it was announced or alongside the public. 
Ahead of the hearing on Tuesday, Morrisey told the media in Charleston that he felt it was “a clear case.”
“ … Sometimes you get courts in various areas that have different perspectives of the law, but ultimately when the cases get to their final resting place, the right decision gets made,” Morrisey said. “We are correct on the law here, and we’ve looked at this very closely, and I think it’s just a matter of when this gets upheld rather than whether it doesn’t.”
The governor added that, “This is a better deal for all the people that are getting care of those facilities. I’m excited about that.”

About 600,000 Coloradans receive money for groceries through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which amounts to about $120 million dollars in benefit money flowing through the state’s grocery stores and farmers markets each month. But the November payments will not come at their usual time — if at all — as the federal government shutdown approaches the one-month mark.
Food banks and their partners in Colorado are getting ready for an influx of people looking to their services instead.
“We know a tsunami is coming. We just don’t know how high the wave is, and so we’re trying to brace for whatever we can,” said Weston Edmunds, the director of marketing and communications at Weld Food Bank.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The organization put in a $250,000 order of meat products and pantry items, and Edmunds hopes the food arrives by the end of the week, despite a much shorter lead time than usual. On Tuesday afternoon, he showed volunteers how to cut about 5,000 pounds of donated mozzarella cheese from Leprino Foods Company — food he said will head out quickly to people who visit the food bank’s warehouse and community partners.
“We’ve tried to purchase more food to meet the immediate need,” he said. “We expect it to last us, hopefully, a couple of weeks, but we anticipate that if the government is still shut down into mid-November that we’ll need to spend another $500,000 to keep pushing through.”
Request for donations
There’s a similar rush in other parts of the state.
Community Food Share in Boulder County placed an order for over 165,000 pounds of food to prepare, CEO Kim Da Silva said. That should be enough for over 135,000 meals. At Food Bank For Larimer County, CEO Amy Pezzani said the organization sent $100,000 in emergency funding to its partners so they can directly purchase the food they need.
“At the end of the day, this is what we do every single day. As a food bank, we are responsible for ensuring that people in our community who need food have food. This is not different,” Pezzani said.
It is the first time, however, SNAP benefits will lapse. During a shutdown in 2019, the U.S. Department of Agriculture used a contingency fund to disperse benefits early. The Trump administration has said it will not use emergency money to pay for November SNAP benefits, though a coalition of states, including Colorado, sued over the issue Tuesday.
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis will also ask the state Legislature’s Joint Budget Committee on Thursday to approve $10 million for Feeding Colorado, which oversees the state’s Feeding America food banks and over 1,300 community partners, to purchase food. Colorado already faces a severe budget shortfall.










These are real people that are scared and stressed because they don't know how they're going to put food on the table ... Our lawmakers need to do their job and open the government back up.


– Amy Pezzani, CEO of Food Bank For Larimer County


Polis also appealed to Coloradans to donate money directly, since food banks have higher purchasing power with suppliers and can buy more food per dollar than the average person. Feeding Colorado Executive Director Mandy Nuku said that as of Tuesday the organization has received about $120,000 in donations. That is not inclusive of donations people have made to individual food banks through the Feeding Colorado website.
“This is a stopgap measure, and one that is not a solution. It will be largely inadequate” she said. “We can’t replace $120 million of SNAP benefits, but we do have the operational capacity and the logistical capacity to scale up to order food and direct it to communities.”
She said SNAP is by far more effective at reducing hunger than food banks. Food banks provide about one meal to every nine provided through SNAP, according to Feeding America.
Demand already high
Nuku said their focus has also been on the policy side, hosting members of Congress at local food banks to show them the real-life impact of benefit pauses. U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, a Lafayette Democrat, went to Community Food Share, while U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans, a Fort Lupton Republican, visited Weld Food Bank.
“Hunger is not partisan,” she said. “It’s not a political issue. This impacts everybody in rural communities, conservative communities, Democratic ones, urban centers. There isn’t one county in Colorado that is not experiencing food insecurity as an issue.”
Food banks were already feeling a heightened demand in recent years after SNAP emergency allotments during the COVID-19 pandemic ended in 2023. Community Food Share is seeing an increase in enrollment for the first time, from about 25 applications per week to around 80. Weld Food Bank had between 500 to 600 visitors for its emergency food program on an average day two years ago, Edmunds said. Now, it’s closer to 1,700 people every day.
Edmunds said the post-pandemic surge after expanded benefits ended made clear that “SNAP was keeping a lot of people from needing to come to food banks.”
“For some people, $50 or $100 a month was the difference between if they needed to use the food bank or if they could supplement their income,” he said.
‘Plan for the worst’
Weld Food Bank will set up three temporary mobile sites to lessen the impact on its primary warehouse location, and is in conversation with its community partners to extend their operating hours.
At Community Food Share, the goal is to remain nimble about how to respond to more visitors as they come, whether that means staying open later or establishing mobile food pantries. Da Silva noted the dual crisis as the shutdown pauses paychecks to federal workers, who might turn to food banks to fill gaps.
“This is new terrain for all of us to navigate. Our plan is to plan for the worst, which is to get truckloads of food in here and be very flexible with how we react to community needs,” she said.
Food Bank for Larimer County typically signs up about 150 new families per month. Last week, it got 179 new family applications.
“These are real people that are scared and stressed because they don’t know how they’re going to put food on the table,” Pezzani said. “Our lawmakers need to do their job and open the government back up.”
Democrats and Republicans are at a stalemate over how to end the shutdown, which is in its fourth week. Democrats say they will not vote for a spending bill to reopen the government until Republicans negotiate expiring health insurance subsides, but Republicans say they will not negotiate that issue until the government reopens.
Republicans hold majorities in both chambers of Congress but under current rules need a handful of Senate Democrats to vote with them to pass any legislation.

The first would change the required time frame for mental health providers to respond to a Child Protective Services, or CPS, records request from 14 to seven days, and the second would increase the amount of training on child abuse and neglect provided to mandatory reporters.

One case, the 2020 murder of an 11-year-old by his mother who then committed suicide, spurred legislators to create this legislation.
In that case, Pohutsky said, “Although there was one CPS investigation that had already been closed and another that was in process in time of the incident, intervention didn’t occur in time to prevent her from taking her own life and of her child.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Ryan Speidel, who serves as Michigan’s Child Advocate, elaborated on the details of the case, explaining that when investigators sought records from the mother’s mental health providers — which would have shown that she had expressed homicidal intent towards her son for months — they were blocked from accessing the records which, by law, the providers were required to give. 
One issue around this is a lack of awareness among providers as to what they have to provide to investigators, as well as a lack of knowledge by mandated reporters as to when they should be reporting potential child abuse or neglect. 
“In speaking with teachers, psychologists, school administrators and various other mandated reporters, it is clear a regular training is needed,” Speidel continued. “These mandated reporters consistently remind me that they want and need more training around the recognition of child abuse injuries. I do believe that if both these bills were signed into law, it will make Michigan that much safer for children.”
Rep. Carrie Rheingans (D-Ann Arbor) expressed concerns about the balance between protecting children while also protecting therapeutic relationships, citing her own husband’s experience as a trauma therapist. 
“To be clear, this changes nothing about when records are requested, when they’re required to be handed over, and although these two bills work hand in hand in terms of making sure that all mandatory reporters, including mental health professionals, have adequate information about their responsibilities,” Pohutsky said, “this doesn’t change anything about the responsibilities of mental health professionals, other than the timeline for turning over records they’re already required to turn over.”
The committee also passed a resolution put forth by State Rep. Douglas Wozniak (R-Shelby Twp.), the committee’s vice chair, calling on Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to direct “administrating agencies” to track their efforts to reduce Adverse Childhood Experiences, or ACEs. 
A substitute to that bill, proposed by Rep. Mai Xiong (D-Warren), which would have included “sudden and unexpected loss of family food assistance” as one of those adverse experiences, did not pass along party lines in the committee, with all seven Republicans passing on their vote. 
Wozniak’s resolution was sent to the full House also along party lines, with all four Democrats in the committee voting to pass on that vote. 
Another bill, HB 4959, put forth by committee chair Rep. Kathy Schmaltz (R-Jackson), which adds fees for anyone seeking a license to be a professional guardian or professional conservator, passed along the same party lines — seven votes in favor from the GOP members, and four Democrats passing on their votes.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Local officials and community organizations are uniting to provide families with food and basic necessities during the government shutdown. City and county governments together with  the Milwaukee Public School District, the Milwaukee Bucks and faith groups are organizing a food drive with Feeding America Western Wisconsin and Nourish MKE. The drive will begin immediately and continue until FoodShare benefits are restored. 
On Nov. 1, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits are expected to end amidst a government shutdown in Washington D.C.. Across the nation, there are over 42 million Americans who depend on the federal food assistance program. 
“The federal government shutdown needs to end,” said Mayor Cavalier Johnson. “This is not an abstract issue. It’s about whether families can afford to eat. While Washington debates, Milwaukee is stepping up. We’re coming together to keep each other fed, safe and cared for. That’s who we are as a city.” 
Food drive  donations will be accepted locations across the city including:

Milwaukee City Hall (200 E. Wells St)
Milwaukee County Courthouse (901 N. 9th St)
Zeidler Municipal Building (841 N. Broadway)
Marcia P. Coggs Health & Human Services Center (1230 W. Cherry St)
Hillview (1615 S. 22nd Street)
Fiserv Forum (1111 Vel R. Phillips Avenue)
All Milwaukee public schools 
All Milwaukee library branches
The Mason Temple Church (6058 N. 35th St)

“Food insecurity affects physical health, mental health and stability to entire households,” said Shakita LaGrant-McClain, director of the Milwaukee County Department of Health and Human Services. “I encourage everyone to consider donating to your local food pantry. This is a time where the community really needs to come together.”

Democrats have insisted that any resolution to continue funding the federal government must include renewing Affordable Care Act health insurance subsidies which are set to expire soon, causing health costs to skyrocket across the country, including for 310,000 Wisconsinites, many of whom will see their insurance payments rise by between 45 and 800%.  Milwaukee and surrounding counties  are also still reeling from the denial of FEMA disaster assistance to help repair damage left behind by the historic floods in August. 
“Milwaukee County is strong and resilient, but the health and wellbeing of our residents and families should never be casualties of political fights in Washington,” said Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley. “Until this federal shutdown ends, we will do what we always do: look out for our neighbors and step up to help in times of need. I’m grateful to all our community partners to encourage every resident who is able to join us in caring for our community.”

(Mechelle Hankerson/Virginia Mercury)After reframing a federal education grant program to align with President Donald Trump’s policies, the U.S. Department of Education awarded $10 million to five Virginia institutions to advance new and existing strategies to instruct students in American history, civic, government and geography to commemorate America’s 250th anniversary. 
The American History and Civics‑National Activities Grants program, from which the funds originate, existed before the Trump administration. However, it was later reshaped to align with Trump’s broader vision of “patriotic education.” The approach emphasizes teaching about the founding of America and the key ideas that the country was built upon. Educators have said the administration’s approach fails to provide a balanced telling of history and omits significant historical injustices, while others fear educators teaching anything that makes America infallible is not honest or responsible. 
Close Up Foundation in Arlington received the largest award of $2.9 million, followed by William and Mary ($2.8 million), James Madison University ($2.1 million), Christopher Newport ($1.3 million), and Regent University ($980,000), according to the U.S. Department of Education.
“The upcoming Semiquincentennial of America’s founding is more than a commemorative milestone—it is a call to reinvest in the education and cultivation of a citizenry capable of sustaining the American experiment in self-government,” the program’s description reads. 
In addition to improving seminars for educators or students, award recipients are required to create and execute innovative seminars commemorating the 250th anniversary of the founding of the U.S., with a focus on the principles of the nation’s founding fathers, and their development of the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, and the Declaration of Independence. 
The education department said that institutions sponsoring seminars that promote “a deeper understanding of our constitutional republic,” will empower educators or students with the knowledge and character needed to safeguard America’s freedoms.
James Madison announced earlier this month that the funding would help “deepen nonpartisan civic literacy and historical understanding” among students and educators. 
Virginia Secretary of Education Aimee Guidera congratulated the institution, adding that the “initiative will empower teachers and students to engage in thoughtful conversations about America’s past and its future,” ahead of the country’s 250th anniversary.
 Paradigm shift

One of the first steps the Trump administration took to reframe education in the U.S. was an executive order to end “radical indoctrination” in K-12 schooling. 
The “patriotic education” term, included in the order, is defined as an “accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring, and ennobling characterization of America’s founding and foundational principles.”
The term also involves exploring how the U.S. has progressively aligned itself with “noble principles,” and promotes commitment to America’s aspirations as “beneficial and justified,” while asserting that celebrating “America’s greatness and history is proper.”
Some educators say the term “patriotic education” has created a divide between the administration and educators, with government leaders suggesting educators don’t want to be patriotic, which they deny.
Recently, a study conducted by Education Next through the Harvard Kennedy School found that teachers are “more supportive” than the general public of teaching students about America’s strengths, its demographics and the importance of civic engagement. The study includes results from 1,032 K–12 teachers, 1,280 parents and 2,251 members of the general public collected in March and April 2025.
“Most Americans understand that loving what is good about America does not require endorsing any particular government act or political party,” the authors wrote. “It requires upholding the principles that define our democratic system.”
The U.S. Department of Education’s September announcement of its partner organizations for the 250th anniversary drew scrutiny, because some of the groups were involved in revising Virginia’s history standards two years ago, some of which initially excluded influential figures and events. Some experts said the standards, developed with input from representatives of organizations including conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation and Hillsdale College, reflected political bias and focused on European or Anglo-American ideas while downplaying the contributions of ethnic minorities in white countries.
As for the term “patriotic education,” leaders from the Virginia Social Studies Leaders Consortium (VSSLC) find the term and its suggestions “deeply offensive and wrong.”
Danyael Graham, VSSLC president, said she was concerned that “patriotic education” implies a lack of comprehensive history education and creates unnecessary divisions among educators.
“It’s about teaching the good and the bad, and that doesn’t make you less patriotic,” Graham said. “I think that implication is deeply offensive and if we are raising students to think critically about the world around them, then they need to be able to reflect on the good and the bad. It’s what helps them make better decisions as adults.”

(Photo by Graham Moomaw/Virginia Mercury)It’s been 20 years since Virginia voters elected a slate of three statewide officials from different parties. The gradual tribalization of state politics has translated into more and more Virginians coming to the polls thinking of themselves as members of team red or team blue.
Four years ago, Republicans swept the three statewide races with nearly identical percentages of the vote (50.6, 50.7 and 50.4) in races for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general. Furthermore, the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project found that 2001 House of Delegates elections were highly correlated with the gubernatorial results.
But recent polls ahead of the state’s pivotal elections on Nov. 4 suggest Virginia could expect a revival of ticket splitting, which used to be more common during the first four decades of competitive two-party statewide elections. 
Last week, the Washington Post and VCU released separate polls showing Democrat Abigail Spanberger leading Republican Winsome Earle-Sears in the governor’s race by 12 and seven percentage points, respectively. But the surveys suggested the down ballot races could be tighter, with the VCU poll showing Republican Jason Miyares, the incumbent attorney general, with a slight lead over Democratic challenger Jay Jones. A poll published this week by the Wason Center yielded similar results.
Below is a look – in reverse chronological order – of the dozen split tickets since 1969, which marked the advent of competitive two-party politics in the Old Dominion.

Now-U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine won the governor’s race by nearly 6 percentage points, but his two Democratic running mates both lost tight contests. The split outcome can be explained in part by how the mountain twang of GOP gubernatorial candidate Terry Kilgore failed to resonate with voters beyond the mountains of Southwest Virginia, as the Washington Post reported at the time. In affluent Fairfax County, for example, Kilgore was outperformed by his GOP ticket mates by more than 3 percentage points. Though it took a recount for Republican Bob McDonnell to be declared winner in the attorney general’s race, the GOP won a majority of the three statewide offices. 

Democrats today wouldn’t recognize the playbook that Mark Warner followed in his successful bid for governor. Warner, now Virginia’s other U.S. senator, remained silent on abortion and other hot-button issues. He invested considerable time and energy in rural Virginia, where he sponsored a NASCAR team, lined country roads with blaze-orange Sportsmen for Warner signs and hired a bluegrass band. His tack to the right left just enough coattails for Tim Kaine to win a slender majority in a three-way race for lieutenant governor. 
Jerry Kilgore, who served as Gov. Allen’s public safety secretary, ran a law-and-order campaign for attorney general that blasted Democrat Donald McEachin for opposing the death penalty and supporting gun control. Warner disavowed those two positions taken by McEachin, the Democrats’ first Black candidate for attorney general. McEachin, whose campaign funds were depleted in a bruising four-way Democratic primary, managed only 39.9% of the vote, an all-time low for a Democratic statewide candidate.

In the spring of 1993, George Allen was 30 percentage points down in the polls, but it turned out he was right where he wanted to be. Allen considered himself an insurgent who would topple the Democratic “elitist oligarchs” that had ruled Virginia for a dozen years. Attorney General Mary Sue Terry had been the Democrats’ top vote-getter in 1985 and 1989, but her cautious personality was ill  suited for the role of party standard bearer. 
By contrast, Allen threw himself into the hustings with gusto, pulling off an upset that included a Jim Gilmore victory in the race for attorney general. But the GOP fell short of a sweep as Democratic Lt. Gov. Don Beyer Jr. defeated Mike Farris, a homeschooling advocate associated with the Christian right. In the waning days of the campaign, Beyer accused Farris of censorship and book-banning with TV ads that featured characters from the Wizard of Oz. Beyer out-performed Terry by 14 percentage points.

After being locked out of the Executive Mansion for a century, Virginia Republicans won a third straight gubernatorial election in 1977. Lt. Gov. John Dalton won the office that had eluded his father, Ted, who had run twice for governor in the 1950s. Dalton carried eight of the state’s 10 congressional districts, ending his opponent Henry Howell’s decade-long populist crusade. 
The 1977 election also marked an assertive debut for Democrat Chuck Robb, the son-in-law of former President Lyndon B. Johnson. By drawing support from some conservatives and business leaders spooked by Howell, Robb brought together a coalition that would lead Democrats out of the wilderness. 

Virginia’s continuing political realignment resulted in an epic gubernatorial election that was later memorialized in “The Shad Treatment,” a lightly fictionalized novel by Garrett Epps. The 1973 race featured former Democratic  Gov. Mills Godwin running as a Republican and populist Democrat Henry Howell running as an independent. Democrats, who mostly backed Howell, did not nominate a candidate. Howell – who railed against the “big boys” – was opposed by every major newspaper and the collective force of the state’s business community. 
Voter turnout topped 1 million for the first time in Virginia history. Howell came within 15,000 votes of defeating Godwin. Democratic Attorney General Andrew Miller won re-election in a landslide, preventing a GOP sweep.

The splintering of the Virginia Democratic Party in the aftermath of the federal Voting Rights Act created an opportunity for Republicans to elect a governor for the first time in a century. In addition to a moderate Democrat, the ballot included three conservative Democrats running under various third-party banners. 
Republican Linwood Holton, a Roanoke lawyer, was bolstered by GOP unity and energy from President Richard Nixon’s victory the previous year. Holton attracted disaffected Democrats, both conservative White voters and a healthy share of recently franchised Black ones. Holton carried the core cities of Hampton, Newport News and Richmond, while capturing Alexandria, Arlington County and Fairfax County in the Washington suburbs. Democrats managed to hold the two down-ticket seats. J. Sargeant Reynolds  — a young, handsome leader that many considered Virginia’s answer to John F. Kennedy  — was sworn in as lieutenant governor in January 1970. Eighteen months later, Reynolds would be dead from an inoperable brain tumor.

Johnson Elementary School on Election Day 2020. (Ned Oliver/Virginia Mercury)If you are worried about American democracy, you have plenty of company. Who your company is, though, depends on your concern. 
Progressives worry that people who are entitled to vote might be prevented from doing so. Conservatives worry that some who do vote might not be entitled to. Both worry that the other side is looking for a way to game the counting. 
Fortunately, there is an easy cure for these anxieties: serve as an election officer. As I’ve learned from my own experience here in Virginia, volunteering in the service of democracy is both an education in the mechanics of elections and an antidote to conspiracy theories. When I hear rumors and speculation about ballot-stuffing or noncitizens and dead people voting, I know those fearmongers never spent a day working the polls from the inside.
Va. registrars share how they keep rolls accurate, reflect on their role in the democratic process

I got a start as an election officer in a roundabout way. In 2004, I joined hundreds of Virginia lawyers volunteering for election protection in that year’s presidential election, trying to ensure that everyone who registered to vote, regardless of party, had the opportunity to cast their ballot in the presidential race. Afterwards, a number of us convened to talk about the problems we’d seen and to draw up a wish list of state-level reforms that we took to the General Assembly.
We joined forces with a group of cybersecurity experts at Virginia Verified Voting who had a related mission to address the threat to election machines from computer hacking. At the time, most Virginia localities used what were called direct record electronic (DRE) machines. DREs were purpose-built computers with touchscreens. They were mostly easy to use but provided no paper trail, making recounts effectively impossible. 
Worse, national experts had shown how easily a malicious actor could access the DRE machines to change votes. A hacker would need to change only a small number of votes to alter the outcome of a close election. In the estimation of one expert, the DREs we were using were the worst voting machines in the country.
The solution offered by the reform coalition was to ditch the DREs in favor of paper ballots that voters feed into an optical-scan ballot counter, with the paper ballots securely stored in case a recount is required. Voting machines are a big investment, making many legislators hesitant, so the lobbying effort took years. Eventually, however, the General Assembly told local registrars they had to move to the paper ballots and scanners that our polling stations use today.
Since then, our legislature has strengthened security protections further to provide for regular audits. Virginia law now lays out precise instructions covering vote counting, ballot and machine security, data storage and routine audits.  As registrars from Norfolk, Henrico, the city of Richmond and Virginia Beach explained to the Virginia Mercury’s team recently, these layers of security measures, together with the presence of election officers from both parties at the polls and during the counting, makes it exceptionally difficult to tamper with vote tallies.  
Other elements of our reform coalition’s agenda also made it into law, though that, too, took several more years. Perhaps most important, absentee and early voting have expanded to allow more elderly and disabled citizens to vote, as well as to accommodate workers with inflexible or unpredictable schedules. On the other hand, the battle over whether citizens who lack a government-issued photo ID can vote may never be permanently resolved (currently the answer is yes). 
Inside Virginia’s elections: How local officials keep the vote secure and accessible

By that time, I had decided the best way I could help voters would be to serve as an election officer myself. Under state law, any registered voter can volunteer as a poll worker – and believe me, it is work. Election officers must undergo training, show up on Election Day by 5 a.m. and stay until 8 or 9 at night when the counting is over and the machines and ballots have been properly secured. Considering the demands, it is remarkable that the median age of poll workers nationwide is 64. 
Seeing the process from the inside is especially instructive for anyone convinced that nefarious actors on a mission to destroy American values might be engaged in illegal shenanigans in our precincts, abetted by insiders from the other party. Frankly, that would be hard. Registering to vote requires documentation including a Social Security number, precinct rules require participation from members of both major political parties, and voting procedures make it extremely difficult for anyone other than a registered voter to cast a ballot. 
The kinds of scenarios that most people worry about, typically involving imposters voting in place of dead people and non-citizens trying to cast votes, are vanishingly rare. That shouldn’t be a surprise: casting a fraudulent ballot or voting twice in the same election is a felony offense. The upside potential just isn’t worth jail time. 
This is not to say the system is perfect. Every year, citizens are prevented from voting because their names have been improperly purged from the rolls or they moved homes between elections or they didn’t learn that their precinct location changed. I continue to be disappointed by legislators who are more concerned about the theoretical possibility that one person might vote illegally than by the certainty that barriers imposed in the name of election integrity keep actual, legal U.S. citizens from participating. 
I’m also disappointed in my fellow citizens who don’t make the effort to vote, especially in the state and local elections where what’s at stake are the policies that most affect our day-to-day lives. 
Democracy has been a rare and precious privilege through much of human civilization, yet most Americans today have grown up taking our right to vote for granted. Some of our great-grandmothers won the battle for (most) women’s suffrage over a hundred years ago, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which finally gave teeth to the 15th Amendment, celebrated its 60th anniversary this year. 
The right that people marched, fought, were jailed, and even died for is now a bedrock American value. If anyone out there waxes nostalgic for the restrictions in place at our nation’s founding, when the franchise was restricted to white male landowners, they are just bright enough not to say it publicly. 
But rights, like muscles, atrophy when they aren’t exercised. In non-presidential elections such as the one coming up in Virginia on November 4th, turnout among registered voters typically averages below 50%. Even the last presidential election saw turnout in our state below 70%. Turnout in primary elections, which in heavily red or blue areas typically determines the winner of the general election, is usually in the single digits. And turnout numbers don’t take into account the more than 25% of voting-age citizens who are unable – or don’t bother – to register.
Secure elections and voting rights protections are both critical to our confidence in Election Day outcomes. Just as important, though, is that citizens take their own responsibility seriously. Preserving democracy doesn’t mean we all have to serve as election officers, though I recommend it. It does, however, require us to educate ourselves about the issues and the candidates – and then show up and vote.

Kelly Ayotte addresses attendees of the ""Progress & Momentum"" conference, speaking in favor of legislation intended to remove barriers to housing construction, on Oct. 27, 2025. (Photo by Ethan DeWitt | New Hampshire Bulletin)The roads are usually dirt, often pocked with holes, sometimes gated off. By law, they don’t need to be maintained by the town or city. Common to rural New Hampshire, they seldom draw attention. 
But this year, Class VI roads could play a new role in the push to reduce the state’s housing shortage. A law signed by Gov. Kelly Ayotte would remove local barriers to development on the roads. And not all rural lawmakers are pleased.
“My towns that I work in, they are not happy,” said Rep. Lucius Parshall, a Marlborough Democrat. “The idea that they will be held liable for keeping a Class VI road accessible if somebody should happen to want to build on it? That’s going to be an expense for the community. A lot of these communities are already strapped.” 
The new law is one of many this year intended to encourage more housing development in the state by removing local barriers. That includes a law stopping cities and towns from requiring a certain number of parking spaces for new housing units, a law expanding the number of accessory dwelling units available for property owners to build by right, and a law requiring cities and towns to allow housing development in commercial zones with exceptions for areas “incompatible with residential use.” 
Advocates for housing in both parties have hailed the new changes, pointing to climbing home prices, low rental vacancy rates, and noting polling suggesting housing availability is a key concern of Granite Staters. Removing the barriers will allow more development to ease the housing crunch, they say.
But as the new laws take effect, opponents of the state-led measures are predicting a backlash. And they’re hoping to overturn many of the bills, arguing the Legislature went too far. Lawmakers have filed more than a dozen bills for 2026 that seek to roll back the new zoning changes, presenting the matter as a necessity for local control.  
Some opponents, like Rep. Len Turcotte, a Barrington Republican, are traveling the state to speak to towns about the zoning laws and hear from people opposed. Turcotte, the former chairman of the House Municipal and County Government Committee, has argued for years that the state should not impose zoning directives. 
“The word got out that I would come and talk to people, because the towns and the citizens themselves almost 100% are against these,” Turcotte said in an interview. “I started getting calls (saying) ‘Hey, would you come up to Littleton?’, ‘Hey, would you come up to Keene?’”
Others, like Parshall, have received calls from select board members beyond their home district asking for action. Parshall has filed a bill that would repeal the law easing development on Class VI roads. 
“Once it was filed, I’ve been hearing from a lot of other towns who were facing the same problems with development,” he said. 
The backlash effort faces difficult odds. Ayotte has made her support for the housing bills clear and would likely veto any repeal bill in 2026. And housing affordability remains a top concern across the state: A poll conducted by St. Anselm College in August found that 78% of respondents believe their community “needs more affordable housing to be built.” 
But opponents of the zoning laws argue that while Granite Staters might be interested in more housing, they may be less enthusiastic about the state laws requiring their local planning boards to allow that housing. That feeling could grow as more become acquainted with the new changes, they say.
“I think the stuff that passed last year got the public’s attention to the point where they’re now in tune, and they hopefully will tell their legislators, ‘Hey, get on board with this,’” said Turcotte, who has co-sponsored many of the repeal bills. 
Just as support for zoning overhauls includes Republican and Democratic leaders, opposition has also crossed party lines. 
Rep. David Preece, a Manchester Democrat, says he believes the state has a serious housing crisis. But he says the current shortage should be addressed through increased state and federal investment, not through state mandates. 
And he says he is hearing from constituents who are concerned about the state’s approach. 
“I believe in mixed use (development), and I believe that multi-family housing is a way of addressing affordable housing. But not all communities have the infrastructure in place which would allow them to do that,” he said.
‘Franken-zoning’ fears
Preece is sponsoring many of the 2026 bills that would repeal the recent zoning law changes. One would undo the law barring municipalities from requiring more than one parking lot per unit; another would pull back the recently expanded law allowing accessory dwelling units by right.
Those and other bills are backed by the New Hampshire Municipal Association, which represents select boards and planning boards, and which has consistently opposed efforts in Concord to force zoning law changes.
The concern, argues Margaret Byrnes, executive director of the association, is that the new laws are both overly restrictive and overly vague. Cities and towns will struggle to know when they may lawfully block a development, she said in an interview. That uncertainty could increase legal costs to towns, and until courts can establish precedents for how to enforce the laws, it could create a patchwork system of enforcement, Byrnes argues.
“We’re moving to a very weird place where there’s going to be a patchwork Franken-zoning, where it’s a mix of municipal ordinances, state mandates that may or may not be reflected in the actual written ordinance but that they’re supposed to be complying with, and case decisions interpreting various local zoning ordinances and various state mandates,” Byrnes said. “It’s going to make for an increasingly inconsistent framework for land use and zoning in New Hampshire.”
The new law requiring housing development be allowed in commercial zones — with exceptions — is an example of that uncertainty, Byrnes said. According to the law, exceptions where homes would be incompatible include “air, noise, odor, or transportation impacts.” But without further definitions, Byrnes argued, those exceptions are hard to apply. 
One bill filed by Preece would allow municipalities to establish a more stringent siting review process to designate which areas of a commercial zone are suitable for housing.  
The Municipal Association has also taken issue with the law requiring detached accessory dwelling units to be allowed in single-family districts, arguing its parameters are also vague for municipalities. And it supports Parshall’s bill to repeal the Class VI road changes. Allowing development on unmaintained roads could be costly for towns due to the need to provide access for emergency vehicles on those roads.
“A lot of our more rural members with massive amounts of miles of these Class VI roads, they’re very much not at ease,” said Brodie Deshaies, legislative advocate for the Municipal Association.
Pushback to the pushback
Advocates for the housing bills argue the new laws are necessary to break logjams that have built up in communities across the state, in which town and city zoning codes all but prevent meaningful development from taking hold. 
But after a summer of legislative victories, some housing advocates have acknowledged that 2026 may require them to play defense. 
At a pro-housing convention Monday hosted by the Business and Industry Association, the statewide chamber of commerce, speakers praised the new laws but also warned of coming opposition. 
“I think when you’re successful in creating momentum and getting results, that sometimes creates a pushback from those who might disagree with you, and we are already seeing efforts and discussions around trying to roll back some of the progress we’ve made before it’s even had a chance to do its work,” said Michael Skelton, president and CEO of the BIA. “And that’s just simply unacceptable.” 
Advocating for more pro-housing legislation, Matt Mayberry, the CEO of the New Hampshire Homebuilders Association, put it simply: “You take your eye off the ball, they’re going to take the ball and run with it. We have to continue.”
Now, facing a slew of repeal bills, some housing advocates have expressed frustration with the Municipal Association itself. 
“The Municipal Association was given multiple opportunities to present language to the Housing Committee as these bills went through the legislative process, however no language was presented,” said Rep. Joe Alexander, a Goffstown Republican and the chairman of the House Housing Committee, in a statement. “This year it’s not surprising to me that they continue their ineffective strategy of obstruction instead of coming to the table with opportunities to address the housing shortage.”
Alexander added: “I encourage towns to use their taxpayer dollars on a more effective lobbying organization.” He said the bills would receive a fair hearing in his committee. 
Municipal Association representatives and lawmakers leading the backlash say they support solutions to the housing shortage that don’t involve zoning code overhauls.
Turcotte said the free market will create pressures for cities and towns to voluntarily increase housing. Preece agreed, adding he believes communities should be encouraged to do so with funding incentives. And Byrnes said more resources should be spent on reducing infrastructure costs for towns — like funds for increased water and sewer lines or upgrades to aging bridges.
“Zoning did not get us into the housing crisis, and it is not going to get us out of the housing crisis,” Byrnes said. 
“… We have not seen any conversation around the cost of construction, the cost of labor, the impacts of tariffs, the impacts of mortgage rates, or all of the other factors that are affecting how much housing actually costs.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_0656-1024x672.jpg,,,2025-10-29 05:21:11.760137

Republish photo only with original story.)An Ohio lawmaker wants to punish cities for passing local gun ordinances by forcing them to pay monetary damages to any citizens who successfully challenge them.
State Sen. Terry Johnson, R-McDermott, has filed legislation allowing private citizens to sue cities for “punitive or exemplary damages.”
The change applies to Ohio’s preemption statute — asserting state control over the right to regulate firearms.
The law already allows citizens to sue for damages, but Johnson’s proposal makes a five word amendment expanding the scope of what they can ask for.
The bill doesn’t explicitly define “punitive” or “exemplary” damages, but generally speaking, they’re monetary judgements meant to punish a wrongdoer and make an example of them to others.
‘The line must be drawn’
Johnson introduced Ohio Senate Bill 278 last week, portraying it as a way to level the playing field between citizens and government.

“Our citizens should feel emboldened if they are to overturn these unlawful regulations without having to face financial burden for doing what is right,” Johnson said.
“Municipalities, cities, that sort of thing, have deep pockets and lots of lawyers, and the average citizen does not.”
Ohio’s Constitution grants broad authority over local matters to local governments, and Johnson insists he’s a strong believer in that home rule principle.
“However, the line must be drawn at anything which violates the Constitution,” he said.
The state law preempting local gun ordinances, which Johnson’s bill would amend, is a statute — not part of the constitution.
By his own admission, Johnson’s bill is largely a response to local gun laws passed by the city of Columbus.
In 2022, the city approved ordinances prohibiting large capacity magazines and requiring safe storage of weapons at home.
The advocacy group Buckeye Firearms Association challenged those laws in court, and the case has made its way up to the state supreme court.
The Ohio Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case this March but has yet to issue a ruling.

“It is my hope that we impose potential financial repercussions for these cities who so frivolously trample on the rights of their residents,” Johnson said.
He added the prospect of monetary damages will give “vigilant defenders of freedom” the financial protection to challenge local laws.
Reactions
At its initial committee hearing, Johnson’s proposal got a warm welcome from his fellow Republicans.
State Sen. Kyle Koehler, R-Springfield, recalled worrying about bringing his gun on a cross-country road trip.
“My biggest fear was, what do I do when I go through Illinois? Because it’s like, do I have to disassemble this firearm?” Koehler said.
Koehler said he didn’t want to “suddenly be breaking a law that I didn’t know existed,” driving around Ohio, and asked if Johnson’s proposal is meant to avoid that problem.
In truth it doesn’t. Johnson’s legislation only allows aggrieved citizens to sue for greater damages. To the extent that Ohio’s gun laws aim at uniformity, those statutes are already on the books.
Across the aisle, state Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, pressed Johnson on extent of the problem he’s trying to address. N
odding to the Columbus lawsuit, he asked if Johnson had any other examples of local gun laws.
“We’ll be happy to do a scour and take a look,” Johnson said, before acknowledging, “Since (passing the preemption statute), it’s been primarily Columbus.”
Moving on, Smith asked what has happened to the gun-related death rate in Ohio since the preemption statute was enacted 15 years ago.
“I believe in the depths of COVID (they) went up, overall gun deaths, including gun homicides and gun suicides, and since 2021 it has been falling,” Johnson said.
But Smith drew him back to the initial question.
“The numbers have gone up about 50% from 2006 to 2024,” he said. “So yeah, they may have come down since 2021, but that was why I asked over the last 15 years since this section was enacted.”
Meanwhile Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein, the official who’s spent the past few years defending the ordinances Johnson wants to undo, was far more direct about his opposition.
“S.B. 278 is bad for cities, bad for public safety, bad for the majority of Ohioans who want real action on gun safety, and it’s just plain bad policy,” he said.
“I oppose this effort to make it harder for cities to take meaningful steps to protect the safety and well-being of residents from senseless gun violence, and we will be ready to testify against this bill when it comes up in committee.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)There’s no way his local government can fill the void created by a disruption in the federal food stamp program, but local official Gregg Wright says his Minnesota county had to do something.
“This is pretty much a crisis for families,” said Wright, a member of the Olmsted County Board of Commissioners.
Last week, the board unanimously voted to send up to $200,000 to a local food bank to help neighbors at risk of losing food assistance because of the federal government shutdown.
Olmsted County, which has a population of about 165,000 and is home to the renowned Mayo Clinic in Rochester, expects to lose about $1.7 million per month in benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP. It’s a predicament facing leaders across the country preparing for an unprecedented pause in the nation’s largest food assistance program as the shutdown drags on.
While attorneys general and governors from 25 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration on Tuesday to try to force it to pay SNAP benefits next month, the administration says it will not release funds until the congressional budget impasse is resolved.
That leaves food banks, food pantries and local governments scrambling to prepare for an onslaught of demand. States are declaring emergencies, deploying National Guard members and sending millions of taxpayer dollars to local food banks. Nonprofits are bracing for long lines, bare shelves and even panic or civic unrest as some 42 million Americans are expected to lose access to the safety net program in a matter of days.
Democratic AGs, governors sue Trump over SNAP benefits as shutdown hits day 28

“The enormity of this issue is almost hard to comprehend,” said Wright, who noted that his county is just one of the more than 3,000 across the country.
The local food bank estimated it could serve SNAP families for one month by spending about $400,000 on bulk food purchases. Rather than front that whole amount, the county board challenged community members to help raise another $200,000.
Wright said the county is unable to keep funding food assistance for long.
“We can’t continue to do this without raising taxes, because it isn’t in our budget,” he said. “ … Who could plan for this? Who would expect that this would come from the federal government?”
Minnesota is among 10 states where counties administer the food stamp program rather than state governments. Across the country, state and county governments have been redirecting local resources to try to fill the shutdown gap.
California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has set aside $80 million in state funds and deployed members of the National Guard to help food banks.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency, saying the commonwealth would use its own funds to temporarily help SNAP recipients.
In Louisiana, state leaders are preparing to use $150 million monthly to help continue SNAP aid, while Nevada plans to funnel $38.8 million toward local food banks.
Minnesota Democratic Gov. Tim Walz announced the state would divert $4 million to food shelves across the state.
“This is meant to be a bridge,” Walz said during a Monday news conference. “It will not make up and backfill everything.”
Food banks across the country are already facing increased demand.










Who could plan for this? Who would expect that this would come from the federal government?


– Gregg Wright, Olmsted County, Minn., commissioner


Virginia Witherspoon, executive director of Channel One Regional Food Bank in Rochester, Minnesota, said the phone was “ringing off the hook” last week. The nonprofit distributes food to partners across 14 counties and operates its own food shelf in Rochester. That pantry saw an average of about 450 families per day last month, but by last week was already averaging 550 per day, Witherspoon said.
“I don’t blame anyone who is rushing to their local food shelf and stocking up because they’re afraid they won’t be able to feed their families,” she told Stateline. “What I would say is that food shelves in Minnesota — we’re here, we’re open, we want to serve you. We’re doing our absolute best.”
Channel One and other operators, though, are concerned about the potential for panic by families scrambling for food.
Witherspoon told the Olmsted County Board of Commissioners her organization has considered asking for a police presence, but wants to be careful about what kind of message it sends to the public. She said even increasing food distribution from once to twice a week could cause people to rush in.
She said it reminds her of the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when she went on local television to tell people not to worry, though she was privately concerned about running out of food.
“It’s tough. On the one hand, I’m in public sounding the alarm to you, to our donors, to our government,” she told commissioners. “But on the other hand, we don’t want to make the public panic and all come shop at once. It’s really not a good situation, and we’ve never been here before.”
Debate over federal funds
The predicament facing nonprofits and local governments is unprecedented: Food stamps have not been disrupted during other government shutdowns. And even the Trump administration previously offered assurance that it would tap into a multiyear contingency fund to continue paying SNAP benefits.
The administration reversed that position on Friday, when the U.S. Department of Agriculture said it would not release funds in November and warned states they would not be reimbursed for spending their own revenues on the food program.
USDA won’t shuffle funds to extend SNAP during shutdown, in about-face from earlier plan

SNAP has about $6 billion in its contingency fund — short of the roughly $9 billion needed to cover a full month of the program.
It’s unclear what the administration’s position means for states that have already begun setting aside their own dollars.
Following Virginia’s emergency declaration, the newly created Virginia Emergency Nutrition Assistance program is expected to send money to SNAP beneficiaries starting on Nov. 3.
The governor estimates that about $37.5 million will be allocated per week to Virginia’s roughly 850,000 SNAP recipients, the Virginia Mercury reported.
Neither the governor’s office nor the Virginia Department of Social Services responded to Stateline requests for comment.
North Dakota officials said they had enough cash on hand to cover November SNAP benefits, but are unable to load the funds onto people’s electronic payment cards, the North Dakota Monitor reported.
State and federal lawmakers, advocates and attorneys general across the country have pushed the administration to release November SNAP funds.
Last week, the chief executive officer of the National Conference of State Legislatures asked the USDA to issue clear guidance on states’ ability to spend and be reimbursed for ongoing administrative costs.
North Carolina Democratic Attorney General Jeff Jackson, one of the officials who sued the Trump administration Tuesday, said 1.4 million people — including nearly 600,000 children — would lose SNAP aid in his state.
“They have emergency money to help feed children during this shutdown, and they’re refusing to spend it.”
Contingency plans
In New Hampshire, Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte announced a state “contingency plan” to help SNAP recipients. Pending approval from other state leaders, the plan would divert $2 million to the New Hampshire Food Bank to open up to 20 locations for SNAP recipients twice a week over the next five weeks.
Officials in Ayotte’s office and the state health department did not respond to Stateline requests for comment.
Veterans, rural residents, older adults may lose food stamps due to Trump work requirements

Elsy Cipriani, executive director of the New Hampshire Food Bank, said the organization is still working out details with the state. She said the group would likely ask to see people’s electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards — the debit cards people use to access SNAP benefits at grocery stores — to ensure the state-purchased food goes to SNAP recipients.
“While we don’t intend to replace SNAP benefits — because we can’t; there is no way that we can replace that — we are hoping to provide some relief,” she told Stateline.
In Minnesota, county leaders are working overtime in some areas to respond to questions from SNAP recipients and help find other food assistance.
That additional workload comes without any state or federal reimbursement, said Tina Schenk, the health and human services director in rural Meeker County.
“That’s just to respond to our community, because that’s our job,” she said. “But that’s very different work than we normally do.”
The reserve funds of Meeker County, home to about 23,000 people, aren’t large enough to cover even one month’s worth of SNAP benefits, Schenk said. So county staff are instead working with local nonprofits and reaching out to families who will be hardest hit by an interruption in benefits to connect them with other state grant programs.
The sole local food shelf is increasing its orders with a central food bank, Schenk said — but so is nearly every other operation in the state.
“Are they going to have enough to fulfill these orders? That’s a question that I don’t know the answer to.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-29 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"As CT cities weigh ICE policies, some residents want more action",Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/29/ct-cities-ice-interaction-policies/,"Following high-profile ICE detentions across Connecticut, several cities are evaluating how their employees interact with the federal agents.","With the prospect of increased federal immigration enforcement, towns and cities across Connecticut have been adopting guidelines for how their police departments and municipal employees should interact with the federal ICE agents. 
But as detentions increase, some citizens are calling for their towns to do more. 
Several Connecticut towns, including Bridgeport, New Haven, Hamden and Middletown, have approved or are discussing a variety of protocols, including prohibiting municipal employees from sharing residents’ data with ICE, requesting local police officers to ask ICE to remove their masks, and affirming the town’s commitment to follow the state’s law around immigration enforcement, known as the Trust Act. 
Connecticut’s Trust Act prohibits local and state law enforcement from arresting someone solely on the basis of a detainer — a request from ICE that police hold a person for up to 48 hours so federal agents can pick them up. 
There are some exceptions, such as when ICE presents a judicial warrant, if the person is on a terrorist watch list or if the person in their custody has been convicted or pleaded guilty to a class A or B felony — crimes like murder, sexual assault, kidnapping, robbery and first-degree manslaughter.
The Trust Act was the subject of intense debate in the state legislature last year, and an amended version of the law was eventually passed that expanded the list of crimes for which police officers could hand someone over to ICE and opened an avenue for people to sue cities and towns that cooperated with ICE in violation of state law. 
But in the wake of high-profile detentions by ICE, including enforcement activities in the courthouse in Stamford, in downtown Danbury and at a car wash in Newington, advocates have been calling on state lawmakers to further limit federal officials’ ability to access information or enter certain facilities.
In September, 92 organizations wrote a letter to Gov. Ned Lamont asking that the state limit the amount of personal data shared between state agencies and the federal government, prohibit ICE from making arrests at courthouses and continue to offer state health insurance to unauthorized migrant children and pregnant women. 
The group Good Trouble Norwalk, a local chapter of the larger Indivisible organization, penned a second letter to Lamont on Oct. 9, and Indivisible Stamford wrote a third letter dated Oct. 22.
In a letter dated Oct. 28 and addressed to immigrant advocates, Lamont wrote that his administration “stands firmly with our immigrant communities.” He said that while immigration enforcement is controlled by the federal government, the state would do everything legally possible to “uphold due process, protect privacy, and preserve trust between communities and local government.” 
“My administration is actively reviewing reports of destabilizing enforcement actions in several municipalities and working together with the judicial branch, legislators, and local leaders to ensure that state and local resources are focused on enforcing Connecticut law and upholding Connecticut values,” Lamont wrote. “We are also evaluating your recommendations regarding courthouse safety, data privacy, and health care coverage as part of our ongoing policy discussions with the General Assembly and relevant agencies.”
In the meantime, some local municipalities are attempting to strengthen protection for immigrants on their own. 
At a Legislative Council meeting in Hamden on Wednesday, citizens who spoke to the council members criticized the Hamden Police Department for its response to a raid on the local Optimo Car Wash on Oct. 15, when eight people were detained by ICE.
According to a statement from Hamden Police Lieutenant Robert Manfield, Homeland Security Investigations had informed a dispatcher in advance that they would be conducting an “enforcement action” that morning on Dixwell Avenue — although the agent did not give an exact location.  
Manfield noted that the agent who contacted the dispatcher hadn’t mentioned Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. 
“The Hamden Police Department complied with the State of Connecticut’s Trust Act. Hamden Police Officers were neither present nor involved in the event. The Hamden Police Department was not provided with details or specifics of the operation until after the event had taken place,” said Manfield. 
But some residents and advocates from nearby towns said that the police department’s actions violated the town’s “Welcoming City Ordinance,” which the town passed in April. Hamden resident Jennifer Paloma Rafferty told the council on Tuesday that she remembered her feelings when the ordinance passed. 
“I left feeling hopeful that Hamden was ready to stand up for its immigrant neighbors and become truly a welcoming community. But what we witnessed last Wednesday at the car wash on Dixwell Avenue broke that hope for me,” she said. “Families were torn apart. People who came here simply to work and build a better life were met instead with fear and violence. That’s not what a welcoming city looks like.” 
The “Welcoming City Ordinance” says that police officers should not ask residents about their immigration status and that they will not arrest anyone based on a civil detainer. It also prohibits town employees and people who work in the public schools from cooperating with ICE.
Hamden Mayor Lauren Garrett told CT Mirror that the ordinance was meant to apply the Trust Act to all municipal employees in Hamden. 
“ I think that it brings attention for our employees in the town to understand that we are also committed to this,” said Garrett. 
Garrett said municipal employees had been instructed to go to a supervisor if they come into contact with federal immigration authorities. 
“ They should not answer any questions. They should not hinder any investigation, but they should ask a supervisor to get involved. I think it’s really important that the people who have more responsibility and authority handle the situation,” said Garrett. 
Garrett said she does not believe that the dispatcher violated the Welcoming City Ordinance, since the ordinance simply says not to cooperate with federal immigration authorities, and does not give explicit instructions about what to do if someone receives information regarding federal immigration activity in town.  
Advocates, on the other hand, said that they wanted Hamden police, if notified about immigration activity in town, to inform community groups about the action.  
But New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker told CT Mirror that if local police officers were to share advance information about the actions of federal immigration authorities with the general public, those officers could be charged with obstructing justice. 
“ We are not allowed, if we are notified by federal law enforcement, that they’re conducting a raid, to notify the public, and it will put our employees at risk,” said Elicker. 
The incident is currently the subject of an internal investigation within the Hamden Police Department. 
At the Hamden Legislative Council meeting on Tuesday, Councilwoman Sarah Gallagher said she had drafted a policy order saying employees who are informed about federal immigration activity would be required to bring that information to the mayor and the legislative council. 
She said she had also drafted a letter to Lamont and Attorney General William Tong asking them to make every effort to have the people detained at the car wash returned to the community. She said the letter also requested that the state impose a ban on ICE agents wearing masks and allow towns to require ICE agents to register with the town and limit the agency’s access to certain places in town. 
Legislative Council President Dominique Baez told CT Mirror that the policy order drafted by Gallagher would have to be viewed by different town departments and the town administrators before it could come to the council for a vote. 
Baez said the reason the council had created the original Welcoming City Ordinance was to make residents feel comfortable but also to ensure that the town would not use its already limited resources to assist federal immigration enforcement efforts. 
“We’re saying to our residents, ‘We want you here. We need you here. You’re welcome here. We want you to be safe here,’” Baez said. 
New Haven
Hamden isn’t the first city to expand the Trust Act to include municipal employees. In New Haven, Elicker signed a Welcoming City Executive Order in July 2020. Under the order, city employees are forbidden to inquire about a person’s immigration status or to divulge certain types of “confidential information,” including someone’s immigration status, sexual orientation or status as a victim. 
Elicker said the executive order was drafted to make sure that residents weren’t afraid of interacting with city departments. He noted that the original purpose of the Trust Act was to make sure that witnesses and crime victims felt comfortable going to the police with information. 
“ That trust has enabled us to make sure that we keep our community safer. But there are many other departments that work with people in the community, and we need to make sure that community members also feel safe accessing other city services,” Elicker said. 
Employees who divulge confidential information can face disciplinary action. In fact, Elicker said, the city opened an investigation into an employee in the city’s Department of Vital Statistics who was sharing information with a federal employee. According to Elicker, the employee resigned.   
Bridgeport
On Oct. 20, Bridgeport’s Public Safety and Transportation Committee voted in favor of a resolution that would limit ICE agents from accessing city surveillance cameras, traffic cameras or license plate readers. It would also block the city from working with vendors that allow federal immigration agents to access city data. 
Councilman Jorge Cruz Sr, who authored the original resolution, told CT Mirror that he drafted the resolution after feeling “helpless” when he watched the news. 
“I feel that these people are terrorizing the community, terrorizing people, breaking families apart,” said Cruz. 
Sonia Hernandez, a Bridgeport resident and member of the immigrant advocacy organization Make the Road CT, said the resolution allowed people without legal status to feel safe while moving around the city. 
Hernandez said having a resolution was critical for immigrants without legal status to feel safe in the community and trust local officials. 
Cruz said he was aware of 12 people who had been detained by ICE in Bridgeport between Jan. 20 and mid-June; Hernandez said she knew of 25 people who had been detained in the city since President Donald Trump took office in January. Of those people, she said, none had criminal records and five had already been deported. 
Hernandez said one of the key provisions in the resolution had to do with transparency — according to the resolution, the Bridgeport Police Department is asked to disclose monthly any requests they receive from federal immigration authorities. 
For Hernandez, who said she is undocumented and has been in the U.S. for 23 years, the immigration enforcement actions across the state and the country have brought back bad memories of the first presidential administration of Donald Trump, when she said she was almost deported. She’s particularly concerned for her children — ages 20, 16 and 11. 
“I don’t know how to answer when they ask, ‘Mom, are you back [at] risk?’” she said. 
The resolution is scheduled to be discussed with the full Council on November 2. 
Middletown
In Middletown, residents have asked the Common Council to adopt a resolution affirming the city’s commitment to the Trust Act and requesting that ICE agents remove their masks and identify themselves when conducting enforcement operations in the city. 
The resolution was discussed at a meeting of the town’s Public Safety Committee in August.
Councilman Darnell Ford, who chairs the Public Safety Committee, told CT Mirror that the immigration enforcement actions were making local residents worried that there are “no boundaries” to what federal agents could do. He said that residents were concerned that people being detained by ICE were not being offered due process, and that it was possible for people posing as federal immigration agents to kidnap people.  
Police Chief Eric Costa said that police departments cannot require ICE agents to remove their masks, although they can request that they do so. Costa said the CT Police Chiefs Association had met with Immigration and Customs Enforcement a few weeks ago and said the agency was open to listening to the police chiefs’ concerns about ICE agents wearing masks and the need for detainers signed by a judge. 
“We’re trying to work with everyone. We want to be the best representation of our city,” Costa said.  
Costa and Ford said they were aware of several enforcement actions in Middletown outside the Superior Courthouse. Costa said the Middletown Police Department had not been notified in advance about these incidents.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Hamden-Pic-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-29 05:21:11.760137

The center is leveraging resources and support from community partners and other groups to address the surge in need that could extend beyond November as new Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) eligibility rules also take effect. Meanwhile, a group of neighbors have mobilized to fill gaps.
“We don’t want anyone to panic, but they are panicking,” said Otto.
 ‘It’s hurting everybody’

The federal government entered into a partial shutdown on Oct. 1 because Senate Democrats and Republican President Donald Trump failed to agree on spending. Pennsylvania, meanwhile, has been in a budget stalemate between Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro and state Senate Republicans. The twin budget impasses prompted the state Department of Human Services to announce on Oct. 17 that SNAP would stop “until the federal government shutdown ends and funds are released” to the state.
SNAP serves an estimated 41 million people nationally, including 2 million in Pennsylvania, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The Census Bureau estimates that 1 in 4 Ambridge households uses the program.


Ambridge by the numbers

Population: 6,912
Under age 18: 19%
Age 65 or over: 17%
Under poverty line: 16%
Households using SNAP: 25%
Housing units vacant: 17%

Note: Census Bureau American Community Survey, 2023.



The Center for Hope partly relies on donations, in addition to partnerships with local churches and other organizations. They’re also a network partner of the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, through which they receive federally-funded food items and grant money. The pantry is open weekly and provides non-perishable items, as well as fresh produce. They also offer emergency food bags that are prepared for people to pick up.
To be eligible for the food pantry and registered in the center’s system, individuals and families have to qualify based on federal household income guidelines under The Emergency Food Assistance Program. However, Otto said even if someone doesn’t qualify – which is rare – they provide them with food items.
On Thursday, Otto started pulling from the pantry’s back stock to put together dozens of “quick bags” containing cans of soup, pasta and fresh produce to give to new people who showed up.
“If it wasn’t for these centers, we’d be in trouble,” said Scott, an Ambridge resident who picked up an emergency food bag Thursday, and asked to withhold his last name.
He receives SNAP benefits and has come to the center for the last several years, preferring only to use the pantry for emergencies, he said, because he knows there are people who are more in need than he is.
“Our government is just a total wreck right now and it’s hurting everybody,” he said.

Dottie Trautman and her family have been coming to the center for five years. Her four grandchildren, for whom she’s the primary caregiver, have been involved with the center’s youth program, and they rely on the food pantry to fill gaps in SNAP benefits. She said even with food stamps, it isn’t always enough — especially as she tries to feed two teenage boys.
“I don’t know how I’m going to do it. I don’t know how,” said Trautman. “I feel bad because I think the food banks are probably going to get overrun. They’re going to start hopping from food bank to food bank. And this community alone has so much need.”
As surrounding areas grapple with the surge in need, Trautman is hesitant to go to pantries outside of her neighborhood because she doesn’t want to take away from other communities, she said.
“I guess there’d be a lot of potato soup and things that we can stretch in the meantime,” said Trautman.
There are also concerns among Ambridge’s growing Latin American immigrant community, who Otto said now make up about a third of the population that the center serves.
“I think whenever you come to America, you see it as a place that is strong. But a lot of people feel they’re uncertain of the future,” said Esmeralda Martinez, a translator for Spanish-speakers who started working at the center last year.
She said many members of this community are really worried about losing benefits, especially those with children.
“We just try to always let them know as long as we’re here, they’re going to be OK until this issue gets resolved,” said Martinez.
 ‘A huge network’ mobilizing

In addition to local organizations, more than a dozen Ambridge neighbors have mobilized to get food and other necessities out to the community. Jimmy Fabrizio, who helped organize the effort, said he responded quickly because he knew how dire the situation was for those relying on SNAP.
“As a former food stamp recipient myself, I was like, ‘Oh, that’s gonna really damage people’s lives,’” said Fabrizio, who has lived in Ambridge for 16 years and works as a technology consultant.
While there are organizations like the Center for Hope in the area, he said he’s heard that some people don’t feel comfortable going to a food pantry for various reasons, whether it’s due to personal beliefs, religious reasons or past experiences. Some people have mobility issues and can’t readily leave their homes, Fabrizio said.

On Tuesday, Fabrizio started coordinating with a network of neighbors and several local businesses to set up food and hygiene item distributions, along with direct deliveries. They’re spreading the word by putting flyers up around town and posting on social media, and while they’ve received several requests already, they’ve gotten even more offers to help.
He said the response from people in the area willing to help has been surprising, and gives him hope.
“There’s a huge network and a growing network of people that are kind of responding to this and donating, offering to deliver food, offering to make meals, offering to set up tables and hand out things,” said Fabrizio.
 Tightening eligibility adds to scarcity

As November approaches, Rev. Derek Davenport, chair of the center’s board, said the month ahead will be critical for the food pantry, but the need won’t end there.
“People are hungry all the time. It’s not just because of the government shutdown,” said Davenport. When the government gets right, he said, there “will still be people who need food and the center is still going to be here.”
As new SNAP eligibility requirements also take effect Nov. 1, Otto said some clients are unsure about what the changes mean for them, especially seniors.
“It’s complicated. You hear bits and pieces on the news, but everybody’s going, how’s it affect me?”
Regardless of SNAP eligibility, Otto said the center will continue to find ways – like “quick bags” – to provide food to anyone who needs it. In the meantime, Otto said they’ve continued to receive offers to help from the community, from local cheerleaders to retirement communities.
“A lot of people are pulling it together to make it all work, we don’t want anybody hungry.”

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)Almost a quarter of Ohio’s residents live in rural areas, and it’s no secret that many have been losing ground for a long time. Decades of federal trade policy and agribusiness consolidation have eroded economic opportunities, giving people who can an incentive to move away.
In the face of those problems, 40 organizations led by the Rural Democracy Initiative last week released their Rural Policy Action Report. It’s a set of policy prescriptions to address the ills confronting millions of Americans.
“Rural America must lead in building a more prosperous, sustainable, and just future for the entire country,” a written statement accompanying the report said. 
“Rural people demonstrate fundamental American values like defending working people, investing in locally driven solutions, protecting core freedoms, and respecting our close connection to the land. Yet our rural communities are often ignored or actively harmed by the policy choices of elected leaders and the unchecked power of corporations and the ultrawealthy.”
The report lists 26 policy priorities organized into four pillars. It also contains polling data indicating that the reforms are overwhelmingly popular with rural Americans in battleground states. 
For example, 88% supported cracking down on meat-processing monopolies and 92% wanted to see rural hospitals protected.
One pillar is to “Rein In Corporate Greed and Support Workers, Small Businesses and Farmers.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“Rural workers earn less, are less likely to have benefits like paid leave, and are more likely to be injured on the job,” it said. “But when workers are valued and have more money in their pockets, they can continue to drive demand, support businesses, and keep local economies strong.”
Among the fixes, it says workers should have more power to organize, workers should have a $17 minimum wage by 2030, and people should be able to “… work safely without fear of being targeted on the job because of their immigration status or the perception of their immigration status based on their race, ethnicity, culture, or industry.”
That pillar also calls for stronger antitrust enforcement so farmers can do things like repair their own equipment. It also called on the federal government to refocus federal trade policy and resources to support small businesses and make sure essentials like food are available and affordable in rural communities.
Another pillar listed in the report calls for investment in the “foundational infrastructure” of rural communities. 
It wants a more equitable tax system in which billionaires pay more and corporations don’t get tax breaks to move jobs overseas. It also calls for more investment in public education, rural housing, job training and improvements to credit and lending.
A third pillar is titled “Everyone Gets a Fair Deal.” 
It calls for better treatment of immigrants and for the creation of a viable path to citizenship instead of the outdated, patched-together system we have now.
The final pillar calls for the protection of land and other resources in rural communities. 
That includes safeguarding water and land, coming up with a rural energy plan, and protecting public lands.  
Fairness is the goal, the report said.
“We need to build an economy that respects hard-working people,” it said. “When we have what we need — like good-paying jobs with benefits — we are all better off. But for a generation, the federal government has supported big corporations to hoard profits and consolidate land ownership. Wages are too low, and costs keep rising, leaving families struggling.”
It added, “These harms aren’t random — they are business decisions, often with government permission. But if the federal government protected us from corporate abuse, then working people would have a safe and level playing field to grow the economy, support thriving local businesses, and drive demand so we can all have a good life.”

(picture alliance/Getty Images)When it comes to setting monetary policy for the world’s largest economy, what data drives decision-making?

In ordinary times, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and voting members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which usually meets eight times a year, have a wealth of information at their disposal, including key statistics such as monthly employment and extensive inflation data.
But with the federal shutdown that began Oct. 1, 2025, grinding on, government offices that publish such information are shuttered and data has been curtailed. Now, Powell and his Fed colleagues might be considering the price of gas or changes in the cost of coffee as they meet on Oct. 29 to make a judgment on the strength of the U.S. economy and decide where to take interest rates.
The Federal Reserve’s mandate is to implement monetary policy that stabilizes prices and promotes full employment, but there is a delicate balance to strike. Not only do Powell and the Fed have to weigh domestic inflation, jobs, and spending, but they must also respond to changes in President Donald Trump’s global tariff policy.
As an economist and finance professor at the University of Notre Dame, I know the Fed has a tough job of guiding the economy under even the most ideal circumstances. Now, imagine creating policy partially blindfolded, without access to key economic data.
But, fortunately, the Fed’s not flying blind — it still has a wide range of private, internal, and public data to help it read the pulse of the U.S. economy.
Key data is MIA
The Fed is data-dependent, as Powell likes to remind markets. But the cancellation of reports on employment, job openings and turnover, retail sales, and gross domestic product, along with a delay in the September consumer price information, will force the central bank to lean harder on private data to nail down the appropriate path for monetary policy.
Torsten Slok, chief economist for the Apollo asset management firm, recently released his set of “alternative data,” capturing information from a wide range of sources. This includes ISM PMI reports, which measure economic activity in the manufacturing and services sectors, and Bloomberg’s robust data on consumer spending habits.
“Generally, the private data, the alternative data that we look at is better used as a supplement for the underlying governmental data, which is the gold standard,” Powell said in mid-October. “It won’t be as effective as the main course as it would have been as a supplement.”
But at this crucial juncture, the Fed has also abruptly lost one important source of private data. Payroll processor ADP had previously shared private sector payroll information with the central bank, which considered it alongside government employment figures. Now, ADP has suspended the relationship, and Powell has reportedly asked the company to quickly reverse its decision.
Internal research
Fortunately for the Fed, it has its own sources for reliable information.
Even when government agencies are working and producing economic reports, the Federal Reserve utilizes internal research and its nationwide network of contacts to supplement data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Since the Fed is self-funded, the government shutdown didn’t stop it from publishing its Beige Book, which comes out eight times a year and provides insight into how various aspects of the economy are performing.
Its Oct. 15 report found that consumer spending had inched down, with lower- and middle-income households facing “rising prices and elevated economic uncertainty.” Manufacturing was also hit by challenges linked to higher tariffs.
Leading indicators
And though no data is being released on the unemployment rate, historical data shows that consumer sentiment can act as a leading indicator for joblessness in the U.S.
According to the most recent consumer confidence reports, Americans are significantly more worried about their jobs over the next six months, as compared to this time last year, and expect fewer employment opportunities during that period. This suggests the Fed will likely see an uptick in the unemployment rate, once the data resumes publishing.
And if you did notice an increase in the price of your morning coffee, you’re not mistaken — both private and market-based data suggest inflation is a pressing concern, with expectations that price increases will remain at about the 2% target set by the Fed.
It’s clear that there is no risk-free path for policy, and a wrong move by the Fed could stoke inflation or even send the U.S. economy spiraling into a recession.

Uncertain path ahead
At the Fed’s September monetary policy meeting, members voted to cut benchmark interest rates by 25 basis points, while one member advocated for a 50-point cut.
It was the first interest rate cut since December — one that Trump had been loudly demanding to help spur the U.S. economy and lower the cost of government debt. Markets expect the Fed to cut interest rates by another quarter of a percentage point at its Oct. 28-29 meeting and then again in December. That would lower rates to a range of 3.5% to 3.75%, from 4% to 4.25% currently, giving the labor market a much-needed boost.
After that, the near-certainty ends, as it’s anyone’s guess where interest rates will go from there. At quarterly meetings, members of the Federal Open Market Committee give projections of where they think the Fed’s benchmark interest rate will go over the next three years and beyond to provide forward guidance to financial markets and other observers.
The median projection from the September meeting suggests the benchmark rate will end 2026 a little lower than where it began, at 3.4%, and decline to 3.1% by the end of 2027. With inflation accelerating, Fed officials will continue to weigh the weakening labor market against the threat of inflation from tariffs, immigration reform and their own lower interest rates — not to mention the ongoing impact of the government shutdown.
Unfortunately, I believe these risks will be difficult to mitigate with just Fed intervention, even with perfect foresight into the economy, and will need help from government immigration, tax and spending policy to put the economy on the right path.

(Photos by Morgan Trau, WEWS.)Two of the top Ohio retired teachers’ pension fund leaders had their first day on civil trial Monday in a lawsuit from the state, defending themselves as the state accuses them of participating in a $65 billion corruption scheme.
Franklin County Court of Common Pleas will be the home of a week-long bench trial, with Judge Karen Held Phipps deciding whether or not to remove State Teachers Retirement System (STRS) board chair Rudy Fichtenbaum from his position and ban both him and former board member Wade Steen from ever returning to public pensions.
Attorney General Dave Yost’s civil lawsuit was filed a year and a half ago.
Assistant AG Chad Kohler, Steen’s attorney Norman Abood, and Fichtenbaum’s attorney Richard Kerger made their opening arguments in court Monday.
“The defendants breached their fiduciary duties,” Kohler claimed. “They did that by choosing secrecy over transparency, by deceiving their fellow board members, by embracing favoritism, by acting with extreme bias, by engaging in unprecedented conduct that raised serious questions.”
For the past year and a half, we have dug into — and exposed — the controversy swirling inside the more than $100 billion pension fund for more than 500,000 active and retired public educators in Ohio.
In summary, there has been constant fighting, two board resignations, and allegations of both a public corruption scheme and the mishandling of funds. There has been a senior staff dismissal and at least two senior staff resignations.
The scandal centers on Steen and Fichtenbaum and their relationship with startup investment firm QED Technologies, run by former Ohio Deputy Treasurer Seth Metcalf and Jonathan (JD) Tremmel.
How we got here
In May of 2024, the governor received a 14-page anonymous whistleblower memo alleging a massive public corruption scheme brewing and moving quickly within STRS. In 2020, Metcalf and Tremmel set their eyes on STRS, according to the document.
The documents claim that they — despite having no clients and no track record — tried to convince STRS members to partner with them and provide them with $65 billion.
They couldn’t impress the board members, mainly because of their lack of experience and also because QED was not registered as a broker-dealer or investment adviser. The men also didn’t own the technology to “facilitate the strategy,” the documents say.
So what exactly are Steen and Fichtenbaum trying to change, and what would QED allegedly attempt to do? Revise the investment structure.
The men are seen as the leaders of the “reform movement.”
This fight began from a debate on how STRS should invest money, through the current system of actively managed funds versus an index fund.
Active funds try to outperform the stock market, have more advisors, and typically cost more. Index funds perform with the stock market, are seen as more passive, and typically cost less.
In short, “reformers” want to switch to index funding, while “status quo” individuals want to keep actively managing the funds.
Recent elections have allowed the “reform-minded” members to have a majority of the board.
Despite Steen no longer being on the board, he still remains the face of the “reform” movement and is still seen as the leader in the eyes of many retirees.
The STRS memo claims QED and ORTA, the Ohio Retirement for Teachers Association, had worked together, specifically when it comes to elections, to get a more sympathetic — or willing — board.
Steen and Fichtenbaum had allegedly been bidding continuously, pitching QED’s direct documents to board members and proclaiming the company’s talking points to other staff.
Soon after, Yost filed a lawsuit to remove Steen and Fichtenbaum from the board, stating they were participating in a contract steering “scheme” that could benefit them.
Yost started the investigation after the memo, now known as being prepared by STRS employees, alleged that Steen and Fichtenbaum had been bidding on QED.
The AG states that the pair should be removed because they broke their fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, and trust when “colluding” with QED.
As we have continued the dozens of reports on the topic, our investigation in September 2024 revealed that STRS was, once again, moving to hire a firm that allegedly lacked experience and had personal ties to the board leaders, according to senior staff.
After our report, the board chose not to move forward with the firm.
Communications obtained via a records request of a court filing reveal that QED associates consistently told then-board member Steen what questions to ask, gave him documents to propose, and pushed him to follow its plan.
Texts between Steen, Metcalf, and Tremmel show that the pair consistently worked together. There are hundreds of text messages.

Trial
“You will see numerous instances where defendants passed off materials that they claim to have written themselves that were actually ghostwritten by Tremmal and Metcalf,” Kohler said.
“Tremmel and Metcalf were spoon-feeding the defendants and telling them exactly what to say during board meetings.”
Fichtenbaum and Steen say they didn’t do anything wrong.
Abood argued that evaluations of new proposals would help with financial struggles and provide more money to retirees.
“This whole case is about this claim that there was some secret deal to promote an investment solution proposed by QED,” Abood said during opening statements. “It’s not supported by the facts.
The texts tell a vastly different story, according to attorney Martin Cordero, who cross-examined Steen immediately after the opening statements.
Through hours of back-and-forth, Cordero showed all the legal and ethical documents Steen had signed, went through training slides on how to be a good fiduciary — ones Steen said he did not recall sitting through — and pressed him on his communication and alleged favoritism toward Metcalf and Tremmel.
Dozens of texts and emails were shown, including ones that showed QED wrote documents for Steen and gave him direct questions to ask.
As Steen told us after our DeWine interview in April, the defense said getting advice isn’t a crime.
“We were at that point in a conversation about benchmarks, I was not getting satisfactory answers from the staff, I couldn’t get clarification,” Steen said, so that is why he reached out for help on what to ask and how to gain insight.
Cordero pressed Steen on why he provided documents marked as confidential to Metcalf.
“You asked me, ‘Were they marked confidential?’ They were. But they were not confidential documents,” Steen responded.
Cordero pointed out the discrepancy with this, then brought up the fact that Steen asked Metcalf to discard the non-confidential-confidential documents after reviewing.
“I was asking him to craft questions I could look at; I was crafting questions, also, to try to understand the information in the documents,” Steen said, with his team adding that he never told anyone else that Metcalf and Tremmel wrote questions because there was “animosity” toward QED.
Steen said his goal was and has always been a better retirement for teachers.
“What I was trying to do was to provide benefits that were promised to planned beneficiaries — that were taken from them, like the cost of living adjustment — and reduce expenses when we had excessive investment costs,” Steen testified.
Along with Steen, Fichtenbaum, Metcalf and Tremmel are expected to take the stand during the trial.
During a 15-minute break during cross, Kohler spoke with us about how the state is just getting started.
“This case is straightforward,” the assistant AG said, adding that the state is trying to protect teachers’ money. “You’re going to see a lot of evidence; you’re going to see a lot of egregious conduct.”

The day helped many Black men define themselves by their aspirations, he writes, rather than by their circumstances. (Photo by Mark McCormick/Wichita Eagle)For many of the men who caravanned for hours in buses and cars to Washington, D.C., for the 1995 Million Man March, the event marked an attempt toward a modern Harlem Renaissance, also known as “the New Negro Movement.”
To view the renaissance only as an intellectual and cultural cause misses the point. It meant to burnish a new image for African Americans, a pivot from the vagabonds, pickaninny gator bait and washerwomen common in post-Reconstruction America. The 1990s produced new grotesqueries like the criminological theory of “super predators,” a small but growing population of Black youths supposedly committing violent acts without remorse. They joined the absent father and the incorrigible criminal in urban lore.
The nation ignored the swaths of Black men who tried lifting their quiet lives above the noisy images. They got married, raised children and worshipped on Sunday. Some were “neighborhood dads,” whom kids begged to play catch or join sandlot football games.
Thirty years ago this month, many of these upright men booked trips to D.C. in hopes of changing a narrative so powerful that despite their lives of uplift, doubt often overshadowed their belief in themselves.
Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan dreamed up the march, but Christian organizers helped. The event drew Christian men with little knowledge of Islam. I covered the event for the Wichita Eagle, following a group of local men making the voyage. They seemed cautiously optimistic that they would make history and introduce their true selves to the nation, and there on the National Mall, they found safe harbor.
An entire day free of the hideous images that had long defined them.
Literary icon Maya Angelou offered a poignant new etching of Black men with a verse from her “Million Man March Poem,” saying: “I look through the posture and past your disguise / And see your love for family in your big brown eyes.”
Rosa Parks, whose refusal to move from her seat on a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama, and who helped move segregation off its axis 1955, spoke. So did Martin Luther King III, some 27 years after his father’s towering words elevated civil rights to a moral endeavor. A boy with an afro and wearing a daishiki spoke powerfully, as did representatives from Africa and the Caribbean. Ivy League professor Cornel West also spoke.
The program lasted for more than 12 hours and included pledges of personal responsibility, protecting women and children, and building and supporting Black businesses back home.
The event likely remains the largest gathering of Black men in the history of this nation, a day of affirmation that inspired future President Barack Obama as well as generations of community advocates and political officials.
Professor Ron Walters, a native Wichitan and architect of the Congressional Black Caucus, attended and sat with event dignitaries. 
“The real test of the success of this march is going to be what the people do when they get home,” said Walters, then the head of Howard University’s political science department, to CNN.
Washington, D.C., authorities recorded no acts of violence, drunkenness, drugs, physical fights or acts of destruction. The love and brotherhood on the mall that day overwhelmed many of the participants, surpassing their fondest hopes.
Leaving, however, meant a return to the usual.
It began for a Wichita contingent the morning after the march. The bus buzzed about the experience. The men regarded the trip as a pilgrimage to self-acceptance and as a pivotal moment in their lives. But stopping in Ohio for a newspaper, eager to see their historic day memorialized, the gleeful chatter slid into silence as paper after paper reported a crowd of 400,000. A subsequent study by Boston University placed the count between 670,000 and 1.1 million, but the initial count took some sheen off the event.
Did the officials use the Three-Fifths Compromise to count the men on the mall? The National Park Service stopped issuing crowd counts after the criticism.
The low count plunged participants into the lives they had before the trip, but this felt different. The march had given them jolts of resolve. Undaunted, they returned to their communities. They joined existing organizations and started new ones. Nearly 2 million African American men registered to vote the year after the march.
Some of those new organizations withered. Some of the men who had traveled from Wichita, like Cyrel Foote Sr., my dear friend Jihad Muqtasid and Dr. Walters, have joined the ancestors. Yet that day helped many Black men achieve a measure of asset framing, defining themselves by their aspirations rather than by their circumstances.
Memories of the march linger, but under layers of time, like smudges on a nearly forgotten hand mirror.
The shiny image from that day slumbers under the years, but with scrubbing, the person we always knew existed surfaces again, gazing at us with big, brown eyes.

(Getty Images.)Ohio is witnessing the construction of an unprecedented amount of data centers in the state. 
Columbus is ranked the 10th largest data center region in North America. 
However, some communities are pushing back against these enormous facilities. 
Jerome Township Trustees voted in September for a nine-month moratorium on “receipt, processing, issuance, or approval of any application for a zoning certificate” for data centers.
Some of the concerns expressed by communities located close to data centers include: the noise, water usage, acres of land transformed into industrial centers, exposure to air pollution from power generation, high voltage transmission lines cutting through communities and farmlands, and probable increases in their utility bills due to the increases in power consumption. 
Data centers require an enormous amount of water for cooling purposes. 
“The Central Ohio Regional Water Study, an analysis of regional water needs by the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission and relevant state agencies, similarly showed water and wastewater demand will be on the rise in the coming decades due to the surging number of data centers,” a report from Gongwer noted.
Data centers can consume up to five million gallons per day; the equivalent of a town of 10,000 to 50,000 people. 
Columbus is one of many major cities across the nation that has been sinking due to water withdraws. 
Additionally, these data enters also use large quantities of PFAS-gas or f-gas chemicals.  
The compounds have been linked to cancer, birth defects, decreased immunity, high cholesterol, kidney disease, and a range of other serious health problems. 
They are dubbed “forever chemicals” because they do not naturally break down in the environment and they are also potent greenhouse gases. 
The compounds are used in the cooling phase and also to manufacture some semiconductors.  
Currently the Trump administration is moving to “fast-track” data centers by “expedited chemical review” for compounds used at data centers. 
The communities in central Ohio will certainly be affected by the explosion of data centers in the region, however, communities in SE Ohio will also be affected. 
Data centers require large amounts of electricity and 56 % of that energy will be from fossil fuels. 
According to a report from the Ohio River Valley Institute, “A 100 MW data center, assuming it operates at 70% max capacity over a year, will use 613,200 MWh of electricity. Producing that much electricity from natural gas will consume over 4.4 billion cubic feet of gas. This would emit roughly 300,000 tons of carbon dioxide, which is equivalent to the annual emissions of nearly 60,000 typical passenger cars.” 
It is estimated that U.S. data centers produced 105 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the past year.
The natural gas (methane) needed to power these centers will come from fracked gas. 
Appalachian counties will be facing more health and environmental impacts from fracking. 
These include; air and water pollution, more Class II injection wells, and excessive surface water withdraws. 
One fracked well can require from 2 to 16 million gallons of water depending on the length of the lateral drilled. 
The Ohio Department of Natural Resources keeps data on the amount of surface and groundwater used by fracking companies in Ohio. 
Harrison County saw 853,000,000 gallons of surface water withdrawn for fracking in 2023. That represents seventy-eight percent of the total water usage in the county. 
Carroll County saw seventy percent of its total water usage in 2023 go towards fracked wells, and Jefferson County had 421,000,000 gallons of surface water used for fracking in 2023. 
Ironically these same counties experienced record-breaking droughts in 2024 as well as 2025. 
Harrison County was in the exceptional drought range for most of the summer of 2024, yet we witnessed water being withdrawn from woodland streams and pumped to fracking well pads all across the county. 
More fracking means more radioactive brine wastes being produced and injected into Class II wells. 
The Ohio Department of Natural Resources oversees everything related to fracking including issuing permits for Class II wells. ODNR is being questioned about their ability to regulate the over 200 Class II radioactive brine injection wells, most of which are located in Washington, Athens, Meigs, and other Appalachian counties. 
The wastes from these wells have been known to migrate into areas far beyond the injection site into oil production wells and groundwater. 
The 2022 passage of HB 507 during a lame duck session opened up state lands to fracking. 
Ohioans have watched as their precious state parks are leased out to fracking companies. 
These data centers will only encourage more fracking resulting in more destruction of our parks. 
Wildlife sanctuaries like Jockey Hollow Wildlife Area and Salt Fork State Park will be sacrificed to power artificial intelligence. 
Ohio’s Appalachian region is no longer a bucolic setting of small rural communities; it is an industrial zone littered with wells pads and fracking infrastructure. 
Soon, communities in central Ohio will experience the same degradation as data centers transform their towns into industrial landscapes.

Read additional coverage of the November 2025 election in Maine here.

	As of the latest data from Tuesday afternoon, 121,366 Mainers have requested absentee ballots and 76,905 had already returned them. This is out of more than 1 million active voters in the state, based on February data. 
“The strong absentee voting indicates a high level of interest this year that bodes well for strong overall turnout,” Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said. 
Just under half (35,341) of all Mainers who returned ballots so far voted in a clerk’s presence, while others delivered ballots by mail (12,699), returned them in person themselves (25,579) or had an immediate family member return it for them (2,550), among other methods. 
Thursday is the last day Mainers can cast a ballot early at their municipal office, and the last day absentee ballots can be requested. Hours for in-person absentee voting vary by municipality.
After that, voters can either return their ballots via drop boxes or mail them in. All ballots have to be returned by 8 p.m. on Election Day to be counted. Once submitted, voters can track their ballots here. 
Maine has same-day voter registration, which means Mainers can register to vote through the close of the polls on Election Day. Voters must provide proof of residency and identity when registering, but not when casting their ballot. 
One of the two statewide referendums on the ballot seeks to change that. 
Question 1 asks whether Mainers want to require photo identification to be shown at polling places, in addition to limiting absentee voting and a multitude of other changes to the state’s election law. 
Current or former incarceration status doesn’t disqualify Mainers from casting their ballot, though legal experts, civil rights advocates and incarcerated people caution that the changes proposed in Question 1 could result in added barriers for that population.  
During the last comparable election in 2023, there were eight statewide ballot questions. This year there are two.  
Question 2 proposes a “red flag” law, which would allow people to directly petition a judge to remove someone’s firearms if they pose a threat to themselves or others.
More on the referendums can be found at Maine Morning Star’s voter guide.

The board voted Tuesday to solicit a second round of public comment on the regulations, which have been in the works for about a year. This final opportunity for comments — after the previous round led to some changes in the regulations — ends on December 12, putting the board on pace to take a final vote on whether to approve the measure about four to six weeks later, a department official said. 
The proposal aims to provide students with a faster, more affordable path to a degree. 
To earn a traditional four-year bachelor’s degree, students are required to take and pay for 120 credits. An associate’s degree, or a two-year degree, is 60 credits. The three-year bachelor’s programs, which some universities around the country are beginning to offer, are sub-120 credits. Students will graduate with the same degree as those who attend school for four years, but they’ll have completed fewer credit hours to do so.
Some higher education institutions in Massachusetts have expressed interest in creating these pathways. 
The New England Commission of Higher Education, an institutional accreditor for most of the private and public colleges in New England, gave a green light last year to Merrimack College in North Andover to pilot a three-year program focused on non-licensure majors, like business, health science, physics and liberal arts degrees. 
The regulations — should the board vote to approve them — would not automatically allow the programs, just enable colleges and universities to submit proposals for potential approval to the board, board chair Chris Gabrieli has previously said.
Among the changes the department made following the first round of public comment, the regulations now “ensure financially struggling institutions are not using the proposal for inappropriate reasons, such as to achieve financial stability,” said DHE Chief Legal Counsel Dena Papanikolaou. 
They also added language to ensure students have “informed consent” about the program they are signing up for, and require schools to be transparent about what they will call the degrees students receive. 
DHE lawyers also added a clause to make clear that there is nothing in the regulations to preclude the board from enforcing its existing authority to revoke or suspend an institution’s degree-granting authority if the board determines that “something inappropriate might be happening, or if there’s non-compliance with the way that the institution is proceeding,” Papanikolaou said. 
Johnson & Wales University in Rhode Island became the first university in the country to launch an in-person, three-year bachelor degree this fall.  
Students are only required to complete 90 to 96 credit hours, and take a regular semester load of courses during the academic year. The university is only offering the accelerated degree program in computer science, criminal justice, graphic design and hospitality management.
It’s not just in New England that interest in quicker and more affordable higher degrees is growing. 
Last year, the Utah Board of Higher Education created a new Bachelor of Applied studies degree that only requires 90 credits. Several universities have expressed interest in the accelerated programs, though none are underway yet in the state. 
In Indiana, former Gov. Eric Holcomb signed a law last spring requiring every state college and university to review their bachelor’s degree programs to determine if they could be completed in three years by a full-time student.",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/UMass-Amherst.webp?fit=1024%2C642&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-29 01:00:54.686254

In that moment, I made a promise — to God and to her — that every breath she took would be matched by my fight for her right to live fully and with dignity.
That promise drives me today as Executive Director of The Arc Connecticut, representing thousands of families like mine—families who know what it means to fight every day for inclusion, healthcare, and survival.
Now, almost one month into a federal government shutdown, those families are being pushed to the brink once again. And this time, it’s not just one child’s life at stake—it’s an entire community’s future.
The Crisis Behind the Headlines
For many, this shutdown may sound like another political fight in Washington. But for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) and the caregivers who support them, it has become a slow-motion disaster.

Shivonne McKay Annan
Federal funds that sustain vital programs are frozen or delayed. Medicaid reimbursements, which pay for therapies and home-based supports, are stalling. Direct-support professionals (DSPs)—the backbone of our care system—are missing paychecks and leaving the field. And SNAP and WIC benefits, lifelines for food security, are running out.
The Connecticut Department of Social Services warns that 36,000 residents could lose SNAP benefits under new federal rules. For many ALICE families—those Asset-Limited, Income-Constrained, Employed—this isn’t an inconvenience; it’s the difference between dinner and an empty plate.
According to United Way’s 2025 State of ALICE Report, nearly 38 percent of all Connecticut households cannot afford basic needs like housing, healthcare, and transportation. For households that include someone with a disability, the burden is far heavier. Almost half of people with disabilities in Connecticut live below the income needed for stability.
When SNAP payments are delayed, when paychecks are missed, when care workers leave—families from Bridgeport to Danbury, Norwich to New London, Hartford to Litchfield County all feel the ripple effects. Hunger deepens. Therapies stop. Progress erodes.
Real People, Real Pain Across the State
Every corner of Connecticut is feeling this strain.

In our cities, parents are skipping meals so their children can eat.
In small towns, adults with disabilities are losing access to transportation that gets them to work.
In our suburbs, caregivers are stretched beyond exhaustion as agencies cut hours or furlough staff.

These are the human consequences of a political stalemate. You can’t “pause” autism services. You can’t “furlough” cerebral palsy care. For people with IDD, consistency is life. Every missed therapy session, every lapse in nutrition, every broken support chain chips away at years of progress.
Connecticut Must Act While Washington Waits
We in Connecticut cannot afford to wait for Washington to remember its conscience. Even before this shutdown, provider agencies were struggling to recruit staff and stay solvent. Now, as federal dollars freeze, the pressure is unbearable.
I call on our Congressional Delegation—Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy, Representatives John Larson, Rosa DeLauro, Jahana Hayes, Joe Courtney, and Jim Himes—to demand immediate action. Pass a clean funding resolution. Protect Medicaid, SNAP, and home- and community-based services for the disability community.
I call on Governor Ned Lamont and state legislators to prepare emergency bridge funding and support providers who are holding the line. The Arc Connecticut and our partners are ready to help—but we cannot replace a federal lifeline with goodwill alone.
And I call on you—the public, employers, neighbors, and faith communities—to act. Support local food pantries. Donate to organizations serving the IDD community. Call your representatives. Ask them one question: Who will protect the most vulnerable when the government won’t?
We Must Not Normalize Suffering
Every shutdown is a moral test. Nearly a month in, our nation is failing . Behind every “budget impasse” are children missing meals, adults losing care, and caregivers giving up.
When Salome smiles, I am reminded that hope can survive anything—but only if we nurture it. We cannot allow political dysfunction to silence that hope for millions of Americans with disabilities.
The government may be shut down, but our humanity must never shut off. Connecticut has a choice: to stand idle or to stand up.
Let’s choose compassion over calculation, urgency over apathy, and justice over neglect—before another month passes and more lives unravel.

While we debate which party controls our Board of Education, America has fallen globally in math and reading standards. While we import federal political battles into local school board meetings, 20% of our teens struggle with mental health disorders. While we vote party lines without thinking, we’re preparing students for jobs that won’t exist.
And here’s what we’ve lost in the noise: our neighbors. Our shared commitment. Our ability to see past the letter next to someone’s name and ask the only question that matters—is this good for our children?
I’ve served on Ridgefield’s Board of Education. I’ve sat through budget meetings where party affiliation mattered more than outcomes and policy debates where ideology overshadowed evidence.
The Decision Fatigue Crisis
We are exhausted. Bombarded by information, polarized by algorithms, drowning in a 24/7 news cycle that profits from our outrage. We doom-scroll through problems we feel powerless to solve. We retreat into social media anonymity where cruelty feels consequence-free and nuance dies in 200+ characters.
Decision fatigue is real. When everything feels existential, we stop thinking critically. We default to shortcuts—party affiliation being the easiest. Democrat or Republican. Red or blue. Us or them.
Here’s what terrifies me: Our children are learning from us. They’re watching how we treat neighbors who disagree. They’re absorbing our quick judgments, our tribal loyalties, our willingness to dehumanize people because of political beliefs.
If we can’t model better behavior at the school board level—where we’re supposedly united by commitment to their future—what hope do they have of navigating the more complex political landscape ahead?
What Independent Thinking Actually Means
I’m running as an Independent because I refuse to outsource my thinking to party leadership.
Independent thinking means asking “Does this work?” before asking “Who proposed this?” It means building coalitions around outcomes, not ideology. Changing your mind when data contradicts assumptions. Prioritizing students over political positioning.
When was the last time you evaluated a school board candidate based on their understanding of workforce readiness in an AI-driven economy? Evidence-based mental health strategies? Budget efficiency and outcome measurement?
Instead, we ask: What party? Who endorsed them?
There’s a reason partisan politics thrives in opacity. When you don’t measure outcomes, you can claim anything. When you don’t explain your votes, party affiliation becomes the only information voters have.
This is why I’m committed to radical transparency: public dashboards showing student outcomes, clear explanations for every vote, regular office hours for parent questions.
When you shine light on outcomes, party affiliation loses its power. Either the program improves student achievement or it doesn’t. The data doesn’t care which party you belong to.
We Are Still Neighbors
I chair youth committees and serve on boards with people who voted differently than I did. I work with neighbors who disagree with me about federal policy. And we get things done. Because when you’re focused on making Ridgefield better, political affiliation becomes irrelevant.
I’ve seen what happens when we remember we’re neighbors first. When we prioritize children over party. When we measure success by outcomes, not ideology. We build better schools, create stronger communities, and model for our children what democracy actually looks like.
Ridgefield stands at a crossroads. We can continue importing federal battles into local school board races, treating every election like a proxy war, demanding ideological purity over competence.
Or we can wake up.
We can recognize that educating children in a rapidly changing world requires expertise, not just party loyalty. We can demand transparency and accountability regardless of which party is in power. We can remember that children in Ridgefield classrooms don’t care about our political affiliation. They care whether we’re preparing them for the future, supporting their mental health, recognizing their unique gifts, and measuring results.
What I’m Asking For
I’m asking you to be brave enough to think independently. To evaluate candidates on merit, not party. To model for your children what thoughtful civic engagement looks like.
I’m asking you to remember that we’re neighbors. That we share a community. That we all want our children to thrive, even if we disagree about how to get there.
Our children are competing in a global economy we’re barely preparing them for. They’re navigating a technological revolution we don’t fully understand. They need school board members with expertise in organizational development and strategic planning. Leaders who measure outcomes, not just good intentions. Adults willing to make difficult decisions based on data, not ideology.
They need us to be better than the political moment we’re living in.
The question is: Are we capable of it?
Right now, Ridgefield’s children are watching. And they’re learning whether we care more about winning political battles or building their future.
Let’s show them we still know the difference.

(Getty Images)LINCOLN — Public grocery benefits will pause starting Wednesday for roughly 150,000 low-income recipients across Nebraska due to the federal government shutdown, the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services announced.
DHHS issued a statement late Tuesday saying the pause of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits on Oct. 29 comes at the direction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Steve Corsi, DHHS CEO, said his agency has a plan in place to begin working with the USDA to process payments and get benefits to recipients as soon as possible when the government shutdown ends.
USDA won’t shuffle funds to extend SNAP during shutdown, in about-face from earlier plan

Current SNAP recipients can continue to use any remaining benefits on their grocery cards. Unspent SNAP funds remain accessible for nine months from the date of last use.
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, in the DHHS statement, lashed out at congressional Democrats, who have sought to extend health insurance subsidies in negotiations to reopen the government. 
“This federal shutdown is completely avoidable, but Senate Democrats continue to refuse to pass a clean funding extension,” he said, blaming “political games” for the SNAP cutoff.
Angie Lauritsen, state director for Nebraska For Us, turned up the heat on Republicans.
“Now, more than 150,000 Nebraskans on SNAP will have an even harder time paying for their groceries as Republicans in Congress have decided cutting off access to food is more important than lowering health care costs,”  she said.
Nebraska’s all-GOP federal delegation voted previously for SNAP changes that will squeeze out some Nebraskans, she noted, which put pressure on food pantries and organizations filling gaps. Congressional Republicans have argued they were trying to make the programs more accountable.
During the pause, DHHS staff members still are available to accept and process program applications, recertifications and changes, the agency said.
DHHS encouraged Nebraskans who need help to contact 211, a statewide resource and referral hotline. It also encouraged Nebraskans to visit https://uwm211.org/nebraska-programs, where individuals can connect with food, housing, financial assistance and other support services.
“During this difficult time for some Nebraskans, 211 is prepared and ready to help residents in need of services,” Matt Wallen, CEO of the United Way of the Midlands, said in a statement. 
DHHS said it is coordinating with food banks, nonprofit partners and community organizations across Nebraska, and offered contacts for resources:

Less than 2,300 votes were cast, about 3.38% of registered voters in the district. In the July primary, more than 4,300 votes (6.5%) were cast, followed by 5,200 (8.9%) in the primary runoff in August.
Glover campaigned on eliminating state sales tax on groceries, a lottery to fund public education and expanding Medicaid. The Legislature this spring approved a cut in the state grocery tax from 3% to 2%. 
Glover said in an interview Tuesday night that he was disappointed to fall below his personal goal of 20% of votes, but would not trade his experience campaigning for anything.

(Photo by Christine Condon/Maryland Matters)A revised agreement to restore the Chesapeake Bay is speeding toward final passage, after a key committee rejected Maryland attempts to strengthen parts of the plan and voted Tuesday to forward it to bay-area leaders for their OK.
The agreement approved by the Chesapeake Bay Program’s Principals’ Staff Committee will chart the future for the multiyear, multibillion-dollar effort to improve the bay. Final approval by bay leaders at their Dec. 2 meeting at the National Aquarium in Baltimore is considered a formality, since the principals’ staff committee includes representatives of the governors and other signatories of the agreement, including the federal government.
The document unanimously approved Tuesday looks a bit different than the proposal that was released for public comment earlier this year. That plan drew considerable criticism for rolling deadlines and weak goals.
The revised document includes a variety of goals, from forest conservation to wetland creation, oyster restoration and pollution reduction. And it sets 2040 as the deadline for jurisdictions surrounding the bay to meet those goals, instead of the earlier document’s multiple deadlines between 2030 and 2040,  depending on the goal.
Maryland officials had pushed for a 2035 deadline for the plan, but only Virginia supported that proposal when it was brought to a vote.
Maryland Department of Natural Resources Secretary Josh Kurtz, who chairs the principals’ committee, stressed Tuesday that the bay states should be sure to avoid dragging their feet, with 15 years to achieve their goals.
Revised Chesapeake Bay agreement is not ambitious enough, commenters say

“We’re really bullish, and we believe in the work of all of our jurisdictions, that we’re still going to meet a lot of these goals before that 2040 timeline,” Kurtz said. “I don’t think we should — in any way — say we should stretch things out for the sake of getting to 2040. And I hope that that is the way that everyone else reads it, as well.”
It wasn’t Maryland’s only failed attempt ro make the revised bay agreement more aggressive.
Maryland also proposed language that would have committed all of the Bay states to reduce stubborn nutrient and sediment pollution by 2035, in accordance with a “pollution diet” set for the bay by the Environmental Protection Agency under President Barack Obama. But Maryland couldn’t get support from any other state.
“Our language came out of an understanding that states are in very different places, but we wanted to demonstrate to the public the commitment,” Kurtz said.
The agreement is signed by Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia and West Virginia. It is also signed by federal agencies including the EPA and the Chesapeake Bay Commission, which represents state legislators in Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania.
EPA representatives were on hand Tuesday despite the ongoing federal government shutdown, and cast a vote to approve revised agreement — but other federal agencies were absent.
Maryland is one of the states that is on-track to meet its nutrient and sediment reduction goals as soon as this year. But several other states are not, including Pennsylvania.
Overall, the bay states were only 59% of the way toward their goal of reducing nitrogen pollution, though they met to goal for sediment and were 92% of the way there for phosphorus pollution.
But the gains in the bay haven’t been as significant as once hoped. Some 70.6% of the bay and its tributaries do not meet water quality standards, compared to 73.5% in the late 1980s.
Continued population growth and climate change have made the bay states’ efforts more challenging. States have also struggled to contain “non-point” pollution, which comes from more diffuse sources of runoff, such as farm fields and urban streets, as opposed to the discharge pipes for industrial facilities or sewage plants.
In the revised agreement, the bay states agreed to “continue to accelerate completion of all interim water quality planning targets” associated with the pollution diet from EPA, which is called the Total Maximum Daily Load.

The states agreed to update the target figures for nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment by Dec. 31, 2030, using an anticipated computer modeling update from the Chesapeake Bay Program.
The agreement states that the bay states will need to meet the new targets by 2040, and demonstrate their success using not only computer modeling, but water quality monitoring data from the bay.
Virginia Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources Stefanie Taillon said officials in the commonwealth supported a 2035 deadline for the agreement, except with regard to nutrient and sediment pollution.
“That is a very different and unique outcome as compared to the rest of the agreement,” Taillon said. “Each jurisdiction, each partner, is at a very different timeline in terms of reaching that outcome.”
During the public comment period, critics argued that the agreement did not contain sufficiently aggressive measures to control pollution and improve habitats. That document did not include a specific mention of the TMDL, and critics argued that it walked back other conservation goals so that they would be easier for the states to achieve.
The Principal’s Staff Committee also voted on whether the revised document should include a mention of waterbird conservation. Several states voted no, including Virginia, West Virginia and Delaware — as did the EPA.
“From Virginia’s perspective, it wasn’t about, ‘Should waterbirds be in the agreement or not?’ It was how they were included,” Taillon said.
She said the draft released for public comment did not include a “fully fleshed-out, measurable” target for waterbirds, so her state favored a planning period to develop the waterbirds outcome with more specificity.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Ultimately, the states agreed to mention waterbirds in the section committing the states to restore or create at least 3,000 acres and enhance 15,000 acres of both tidal and non-tidal wetlands by 2040. The states should focus “on habitats that support populations of waterbirds and represent healthy wetlands across the watershed,” according to Tuesday’s version of the document. Virginia supports this move, Taillon said.
“While everybody might not have gotten everything that they would have wanted to put in the agreement, that’s kind of the beauty of a consensus-driven process, and a partnership,” Kurtz said Tuesday.
After the committee approved the agreement, Kurtz and other officials broke into applause.
“The sheer amount of work that went into this is staggering, and is very, very much appreciated,” Kurtz said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC06024-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-29 04:56:25.092604

Our every click is treated […]","PERSONAL DATA HAS become the de facto currency of the digital age, and we’ve surrendered more control over our lives than we may have realized. 
Our every click is treated as a commodity, and our everyday comings and goings—including our visits to health care facilities, places of worship, political rallies, and more—are collected and shared with innumerable third parties, including shadowy data brokers, marketers, and even the government. It’s easy to see how the widespread availability of this sensitive information can be used against us. 
Recognizing the threat, the Massachusetts Senate recently passed legislation (S. 2619, the Massachusetts Data Privacy Act) that would strengthen privacy rights in the state. The legislation would create baseline restrictions on when our data can be collected in the first place, and would put enhanced guardrails around our most sensitive personal information. 
Upon the bill’s unanimous passage, Senate President Spilka hailed the legislation as “part of our ongoing effort to protect our residents, defend our values and lead Massachusetts during a time when those values are under attack.”
Now the debate turns to the House, and Big Tech is pulling out all the stops to fight the bill. To them, the notion that Massachusetts residents might gain real control over their personal data is cause for concern. To combat the legislation, they are pulling tricks from a well-worn playbook of opposition to strong privacy legislation in other states. 
What’s in the Big Tech playbook to kill data privacy proposals that protect our rights and safety as individuals? It’s simple: Spread misinterpretations about the bill. Fearmonger about its impact on small businesses. Hide behind them. And profess to support privacy protections — as long as they don’t meaningfully change what Big Tech does with our personal information.
The first thing to know is that the biggest tech companies rarely oppose strong privacy legislation publicly using their own brand names. They know that it would be unsympathetic for some of the richest companies in human history to complain that privacy rules would hurt their bottom line. So instead, they seek cover behind industry front groups with generic sounding names, to make it appear that small businesses agree with Big Tech’s talking points. 
One of their key arguments revolves around the idea that if companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta are subject to laws restricting their surveillance of consumers, the advertising tools they sell to small businesses will be less effective. But real world precedent suggests otherwise. For example, the vast majority of iPhone users chose to opt out of being tracked when Apple allowed them to do so in 2021, dramatically reducing the universe of personal data available to large surveillance advertising companies. But despite the large number of opt-outs (which, incidentally, shows how much consumers want strong privacy protections), the app marketplace remains strong and many businesses have found alternative ways to reach customers or otherwise monetize their products. 
The truth is that giant tech companies resist changes to their privacy practices because the absence of strong privacy laws allows them to dominate the market and make a fortune off of our personal data. In fact, Big Tech’s data domination harms small businesses too. For example, Google is currently being sued by the Department of Justice for cornering the market for advertising tools and abusing their power in a way that has been shown to increase costs for their small business customers. They are no friend to small business. 
Ultimately, the Massachusetts Data Privacy Act would simply require businesses to approach the collection and use of personal data with respect for the consumer. For one, the bill would require businesses to limit collection of personal information to that which is actually necessary to provide the consumer with the product or service they’ve requested.
For example, your flashlight app doesn’t need troves of personal information to function and certainly shouldn’t be collecting that information just so it can sell it behind your back. The bill would prevent this type of extraneous collection by default, instead of putting all the work on consumers to read dense privacy policies and decide whether they should opt in or out. 
Second, the bill would put restrictions around sensitive data, which includes information about your health, children, geolocation, DNA, religion, race, sex life, and more. Selling data about our precise location throughout the day poses an enormous danger to everybody, but especially children, seniors, women, the families of military, veterans and law enforcement, and victims of domestic violence. The bill would ban the sale of this sensitive data outright, and would prevent companies from using it unless it is strictly necessary to provide the service requested by consumers. While some companies say they would never sell sensitive data, enough do so to create significant risk for all of us — so a ban on the sale of our sensitive data is absolutely essential. 
The good news is that the Massachusetts Senate’s unanimous approval of the bill, and engagement from leaders in the House, has shown that these ideas are sensible and bipartisan. In some states, legislators have fallen for Big Tech’s exaggerations. We’re hopeful that Massachusetts lawmakers will chart a different course.
Massachusetts is a world leader in technology development, and the state can be a beacon of light on privacy, too.

Food banks have faced new pressures this year, with layoffs and furloughs, and expect more demand if SNAP benefits end Saturday. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)With funding expected to end in just days, LaMonika James doesn’t know what’s going to happen to the hundreds of thousands of vulnerable Marylanders who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to eat.
She does know that without federal funds, the state won’t be able to continue running SNAP for long — if at all. And she also knows that, without SNAP, the 680,000 people in Maryland who get the benefit may not be able to put food on the table.
“We’re running the risk of heading into a hunger cliff, especially ahead of the holidays where we will see increased rates of food insecurity,” said Jones, the director of Maryland Hunger Solutions.
Jones is just one of many advocates bracing for Nov. 1, when the Trump administration claims that at the government shutdown drags on it will run out of funding for the program that 42 million Americans rely on.
SNAP benefits are funded by the federal government, with states responsible for the cost of administering the program. In previous shutdowns, federal dollars continued to support SNAP to avoid a disruption in benefits, insuring that low-income households can still afford groceries in that time.
That was the plan for this shutdown as recently as September, when the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which operates SNAP, said it would dip into contingency funds to keep the program going. But last week, the USDA issued a memo that said it could not legally tap the contingency funds for SNAP during a shutdown, before blaming the shutdown on Democrats. The USDA told states that the “the well has run dry.”
State officials, advocates map out a grim future for food benefits under federal cuts to SNAP

Democratic leaders from 25 states and the District of Columbia, including Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown, filed suit in U.S. District Court in Masschusetts on Tuesday, claiming that that has never been the policy and asking the court to order the USDA to continue funding SNAP.
Jones said she is concerned about “the USDA’s decision not to utilize contingency funds or their authority to find additional funds within their wheelhouse to issue those benefits.”
“This will jeopardize millions of Americans across the country, but especially the more than 680,000  Maryland residents who are relying on their benefits to restart in November as well as to carry us through the holidays,” she said.
Those 680,000 SNAP recipients account for about 11% of the state’s population, or about 1 in 9 Marylanders, according to 2024 data from the USDA. The average monthly benefit in the state this year is about $180 per person, according to USDA data from May.
Among Maryland SNAP recipients are 262,248 under age 18. Another 121,615 SNAP recipients are 62 or older, while 128,705 people with disabilities and 28,843 people experiencing homelessness also benefited from SNAP, according to the attorney general’s press release about the lawsuit.
“We’re very concerned about our households,” Jones said, “especially our households with children, our older adults, those individuals who are disabled – we’re looking at their ability to continue having access to benefits to feed themselves.”
Maryland food banks were already stretched by the need from mass federal layoffs throughout the year, as well as from recently furloughed federal employees who are not paid while the government is shut down. Now they are bracing for another surge in demand if SNAP benefits end this weekend.
Jones says it’s up to the USDA to provide funding for SNAP benefits, and not doing so will put “a real strain on the entire food system.”
“It’s a decision to push households and families further into food insecurity, knowing that we have 42 million households that are relying on SNAP benefits,” Jones said. “And it removes the reassurance that they will be able to take care of themselves and be able to feed their families.
Not only will the federal government not be distributing SNAP funds during this shutdown, as it has before, it’s unclear if it will backfill any state dollars used to keep the program afloat.
How will Maryland respond?
Moore vows to keep some federal programs in Maryland operating – for now

The impact of the suspended SNAP funding, as well as what to do about it, will be the focus of a joint meeting Wednesday of the Maryland House Appropriations and the Senate Budget and Taxation committees. The hearing will assess the impacts of missing SNAP dollars and discuss whether it would be wise for the state to cover those funds with its own money.
In a Friday statement, Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that funding SNAP is the federal government’s responsibility, and Maryland will be unable to keep money flowing to the benefit long-term unless the Trump administration plans to reimburse those funds. He said Trump’s “reckless actions” have led to “grave fiscal uncertainty.”
“The Maryland Treasury holds roughly $3.5 billion in short-term cash to help bridge reimbursable federal expenses and myriad other State expenses, but we do not have confidence that the Trump Administration will reimburse us — not only for SNAP, but for any federal programs that may suffer for the duration of this senseless shutdown,” Moore’s statement said.
“As I have long said — there is​ no balance sheet to make up for when the federal government just decides to tell states, ‘You’re on your own,’” his statement said. “We will continue to do everything in our power to ensure the federal government follows the law and provides funding for the critical services that our families, our children, and our veterans rely on.”
It’s unclear from Friday’s statement whether the Moore administration plans to fund November SNAP benefits, or hold back until the Trump administration guarantees reimbursement.
At the start of the shutdown on Oct 1, Moore said that one of the state’s top priorities would be to “keep federal programs running” while the government was shut down. In talking to reporters at that time, Moore did caution that if federal agencies advise that reimbursements would not go out, it “may impact the state’s posture” on continuing to fund programs during the shutdown.
A handful of other states, both Republican and Democrat-led, have promised to keep SNAP funded during the shutdown. But Jones agrees that without federal funding, those states will likely be unable to keep dollars flowing for long.
“When this has happened previously (states covering benefits during a shutdown)… it has been done with the guarantee and reassurance from the USDA that those funds will be reimbursed when the government opens back up,” Jones said. “Not receiving that reimbursement will potentially put many states in a deficit – Maryland included.”

If that scenario unfolds, public input on the new boundaries will be limited after GOP legislators rejected two proposals Tuesday that their author said would inform debate on the maps. 
The Louisiana House and Governmental Affairs Committee killed both measures, which Rep. Edmond Jordan, D-Baton Rouge, said were aimed at increasing transparency in a possible upcoming legislative session for redistricting.
“Ultimately, we should not be legislating in the dark or rushing through the process,” said Jordan, who chairs the Legislative Black Caucus. 
House Bill 5 and House Concurrent Resolution 1 were voted down along party lines.

House Bill 5 would have required lawmakers to update an existing website on redistricting or create a new one where members of the public could locate materials on redistricting, such as  proposed maps, written testimony and other materials distributed by the legislature. It also would have required the publication of any third-party redistricting analyses conducted on the legislature’s behalf. 
Jordan’s resolution would have prohibited lawmakers from holding hearings on proposed maps within 72 hours of the proposal’s online publication. It would have also required each subsequent vote on a map to happen at least 24 hours apart. The provision similar to a constitutional amendment voters approved last year that requires the legislature to wait 48 hours before voting on changes to budget bills. 
The legislature is currently in a special session Republican Gov. Jeff Landry called to have lawmakers push back dates for next year’s congressional party primaries and runoffs. The calendar adjustment would give lawmakers more time to respond to a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court in the case Louisiana v. Callais. 
Though the outcome of the case could require lawmakers to redraw Louisiana’s congressional district boundaries, they would not have to do so in time for the 2026 election. Republican sponsors of the date changes have said they provide a window for them to tackle redistricting in time for the 2026 midterms. 
Though lawmakers hope the decision will come down before the end of the year, the court usually releases decisions several months after they hold arguments, typically in late spring of each year. After an initial hearing in March, justices called for a rare second round of arguments in Louisiana v. Callias that took place Oct. 15. 
The high court’s decision could trim back Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which would limit the extent to which states can consider race in the redistricting process. If that happens, Louisiana’s Republican supermajority legislature could use the extra time to enact a map with one or two fewer majority Black districts, potentially costing Democrats two seats in Congress. 
Democrats have argued next year midterms should be held using the existing map, which Republican lawmakers endorsed in early 2024, because there is no guarantee the Supreme Court will rule in time to allow for a redistricting session.   
In previous redistricting sessions – Louisiana has held three since fall 2022 – bills have moved very quickly. Lawmakers have suspended their own rules to hasten the process, meaning the public had little time to digest the changes or decide whether or not to visit the Capitol to testify.
The committee’s chairman, Rep. Beau Beaullieu, R-New Iberia, said there was too much “gray area” in Jordan’s bill regarding what materials must be posted online. Beaullieu is also co-author of the legislation that adjusts next year’s election calendar, which is expected to gain final approval Wednesday.
Beaullieu also suggested Jordan’s resolution could put lawmakers at risk of missing the Jan. 13 deadline the Secretary of State’s office has set to receive new congressional maps in time for the election qualifying period in February. 
Even if the committee had advanced Jordan’s proposals, it is unlikely they would have passed the legislature, as the body has signaled it will likely adjourn Wednesday, despite having more than two more weeks left to complete its work.

(Emily Previti/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Some state  lawmakers want to give grants to food assistance programs to help offset the potential loss of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) support. 
The Pennsylvania Food and Hunger Relief Grant Program would divert $50 million from interest earned on the commonwealth’s rainy day fund to food banks and $10 million to Meals on Wheels Pennsylvania, plus $2 million to the state Department of Agriculture. 
That’s a fraction of the $360-plus million in monthly SNAP benefits that two million Pennsylvanians receive – and will have to go without, starting in November due to the federal government shutdown. That’s more than 15 percent of the number of people who live in the commonwealth, a share that ranks ninth among the states. 
Put another way: the number of people losing food stamps rivals the combined populations of the commonwealth’s two largest cities: Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.  

“We must take care of our neighbors at this desperate time,” said state Sen. Art Haywood (D-Montgomery/Philadelphia). “Hunger does not discriminate based upon race or gender or zip code or any other way we might want to identify. We need to accept that on November the first, millions of Pennsylvanians will not have food assistance that they will be relying on.” 
“A perfect storm”
Haywood joined a few other Senate Democrats to announce the proposal Tuesday afternoon, alongside representatives from Feeding Pennsylvania and one of its nine member organizations — the Central Pennsylvania Food Bank. 
Only the commonwealth faces the loss of SNAP without having a state budget, which is nearly four months late.
Given that, “Pennsylvanians are going to be the hardest hit by these SNAP cuts,” said state Sen. Lindsey Williams (D-Allegheny).
Food assistance programs – including senior programs with food aid components typically financed by lottery funds being withheld amid the budget impasse – have gone without state funding. That’s on top of federal funds held back during the federal government shutdown that’s now approaching the one-month mark. Not to mention, there’s another nearly $20 million lost to federal program cuts since last year, according to Julie Bancroft, who’s the CEO of Feeding Pennsylvania. 










The SNAP program is nine times larger than all of the food banks combined in terms of the amount of food that we collectively distribute. So, to ask any social service nonprofit to fill in a gap of this size is just completely unrealistic.


– George Matysik, executive director of Share Food Program in Philadelphia


And providers already were seeing unprecedented demand even before the dual budget gridlocks affected not only their funding, but also much of the rest of the social safety net. They have resulted in furloughs, layoffs and reduced hours and pay for workers on the payroll at federal and county governments as well as contractors. 
All this, as new rules for SNAP take effect.
“We are facing a perfect storm,” Bancroft said.

Donation and volunteer opportunities are available at Feedingpa.org, which takes direct monetary contributions and links out to nine food banks around Pennsylvania. 
The food banks each accept financial donations, might have volunteer opportunities available, and provide contact information for smaller local food pantries. 

Pennsylvania is one of 22 states plus Washington, D.C., suing the federal government over its failure to fund SNAP after the United States Department of Agriculture scrapped a previous plan to tap into $6 billion in contingency funds to continue SNAP benefits during the shutdown.
“Eight of our nine food banks are accessing cash reserves to try to put money on account for pantries to keep their shelves stocked,” Bancroft said. “These backup resources are not infinite and will quickly dry up if we don’t get funding moving.”
Some other states have already granted tens of millions of dollars to food assistance and distribution networks. Virginia has committed to continue paying SNAP benefits in full using state funds, according to reporting by Newsweek.
Asked if the state Senate GOP would support the proposal, Majority Leader Joe Pittman said through a spokesman: “Art Haywood needs to tell Chuck Schumer to listen to John Fetterman.”
At last check, food assistance wasn’t among uses listed in applicants to the state Department of Treasury’s grant program, according to spokesman Steven Chizmar.

The state Department of Human Services has directed people losing benefits to food banks. But the commonwealth’s food assistance network can’t fill the void, even when funded as usual. 
“The SNAP program is nine times larger than all of the food banks combined in terms of the amount of food that we collectively distribute,” said George Matysik, executive director of Share Food Program in Philadelphia. “So, to ask any social service nonprofit to fill in a gap of this size is just completely unrealistic. We will all do what we can. But it’s going to be an immense challenge for any of us to keep up with that pace of demand.”

Share Food bought an extra half million dollars worth of food last week in preparation for SNAP’s cessation Nov. 1, Matysik said.
He  contrasted the current scenario to the demand inundating food banks during the COVID-19  pandemic. 
Back then, the U.S. Department of Agriculture sent additional resources to Share Food and similar programs promptly, he said. 
“The idea that reinforcements are coming, like they did in 2020, and [the recession] in 2008 is not there,” Matysik said. “It’s like the reinforcements have turned against us. Our own government is doing this to its people. That’s the disheartening part of all this.”
Pennsylvanians have started stepping in. 
Following news that SNAP benefits would cease absent federal lawmakers reaching an agreement, Feeding Pennsylvania’s donations jumped 2000% this month compared to last October, according to spokeswoman Lauren Duff. 
At least one food bank in its umbrella indicated a boost, Duff said, on top of WellSpan Health’s donation of $275,000 (equivalent to one million meals) to the Central Pennsylvania Food Bank last week. 
Nonprofit foundations in Chester County, meanwhile, are banding together for a $100,000 fundraising challenge to benefit the county’s food bank, according to Kevin Ressler, President & CEO of the The Alliance for Health Equity. Based in Coatesville, the Alliance is partnering with the Chester County United Way and Chester County Community Foundation.
While heartening, Ressler noted, “we cannot fund our way out of this through private philanthropy.” 
“The government provides so much support in this country,” Ressler said. “Foundations cannot replace the loss of government support for our hardworking neighbors – most of whom have jobs [or] are children or older adults who can’t just go out and get a job.”
Duff advised going to Feeding Pennsylvania’s website to support the statewide or local efforts through donations or to identify volunteer opportunities locally.

 “It’s inhumane”
The situation with SNAP echoes the recent funding crisis for the related Women, Infants & Children program that provides cash for groceries and other support to new and expecting mothers and their children.
 But there are major differences. 
To start, Pennsylvania’s WIC program gets $278 million annually in federal funding vs $4.4 billion for SNAP (i.e., more for SNAP in a single month than for WIC in an entire year). About two million people get benefits through SNAP versus about 186,000 through WIC.
WIC benefits also are loaded three months at a time – so, recipients have some buffer time if funding stops. With SNAP, that’s not the case – lending more urgency to the looming freeze.
The federal government’s recent approach has been different, too. The U.S. Department of Agriculture stayed relatively quiet as WIC money was drying up and released short-term funding at the last-minute.
But USDA officials ordered state DHS officials to stop new enrollments and draw-downs three weeks ahead of funding possibly drying up, in letter sent Oct. 10 – a move that “shocked” Tricia Fonzi, FHCCP’s president and CEO. 
Northampton County Commissioner Lori Vargo Heffner questioned the motivation behind the directive – and condemned it.
“We’re traumatizing these people by even threatening this,” she said. “It’s inhumane.”
Matysik agreed. 
“We entrust our federal government to assist the working class, not to use us as a negotiating chip,” Matysik said. “If you want to talk about why folks don’t trust the government, this is the reason. This is food on the table for 42 million Americans. And the political class has very [few] qualms about ripping that from their dining room table in the pursuit of some type of political negotiation.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SNAP-Pennsylvania-MAIN-PHOTO-ONLY.jpeg,,,2025-10-28 21:01:43.030828

In May, the most recent month for which federal data is available, over 905,000 Washingtonians received a total of $167 million in SNAP benefits.
Food banks are already seeing heightened demand and preparing for broader Republican-backed cuts to SNAP that are still to come.
Gov. Bob Ferguson on Tuesday directed the state Department of Social and Health Services to transfer nearly $2.2 million each week to the state’s Department of Agriculture for grants to food banks. The first infusion would come Monday, Nov. 3.
“If you’re able to support your local food bank, either with donations or volunteering, I encourage you to do so,” Ferguson, a first-term Democrat, said in a statement. “We’ll keep looking for innovative solutions at the state level.”
The Department of Social and Health Services administers SNAP in Washington, while the federal government funds the program for low-income residents.
Ferguson’s move comes as Democratic attorneys general and governors across the country, including Washington’s Nick Brown, sued the Trump administration Tuesday over its refusal to provide SNAP payments in November. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s announcement contradicts earlier statements that said the agency’s contingency fund would continue to provide SNAP benefits during the shutdown, which began Oct. 1.
“Trump is picking and choosing what gets funded and what doesn’t during the shutdown,” Brown said in a statement. 
The states involved in the lawsuit asked a federal judge in Massachusetts to rule by Friday on their motion to compel the Trump administration to pay SNAP benefits in November.

(Photo by Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas judge said during a Tuesday hearing that he planned to rule as early as Wednesday on a petition asking to set an earlier date for a special election to fill House District 70’s vacant seat.
The petition, filed last week by the Democratic Party of Arkansas in Pulaski County, seeks to force the state to move up a special election to replace the former Republican Rep. Carlton Wing, who resigned last month to become the new executive director and CEO of Arkansas PBS.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders scheduled the special primary and general elections for March 3 and June 9, respectively — the same dates as Senate District 26’s special election, which is facing a separate legal challenge.
The plaintiffs argued in legal filings and during the hearing that holding the special election after the Legislature’s 2026 fiscal session in April violated the constitutional rights of District 70’s voters as well as state law.
The 30-day fiscal session is scheduled to start on April 8, 2026.
Pulaski County Circuit Judge Shawn Johnson said he couldn’t issue a ruling from the bench, citing a need to study the complexities of the laws in question, but that he was “going to work on this very quickly … in honor of the right to vote.”
He said a decision would likely come by the end of the week.
The lawsuit says the proclamation issued by Sanders setting the special election dates “is unlawful, exceeds her constitutional and statutory powers, and fails to discharge her mandatory duty to set a special election for House District 70.”
“Since the focus of the Fiscal Session is how to spend the people’s tax dollars, the Proclamation imposes taxation without representation,” the petition states.
The party’s lawyers asked Johnson to issue a writ of mandamus ordering Sanders to schedule the special general election on March 3. Attorney Jess Askew III argued on the plaintiffs’ behalf Tuesday that March 3 was the earliest practicable date the special general election could be held.
A writ of mandamus is a court order compelling a government official to perform a duty they are already legally required to do.
Under Arkansas law, Sanders was required to schedule a special election date to fill the House District 70 seat within 150 days of Wing resigning, unless she found it was “impracticable or unduly burdensome” to do so. Further, if the election couldn’t be held within 150 days, it had to be held on the earliest practicable date after that statutory deadline.
Attorney General Tim Griffin’s office, which is representing Sanders and Secretary of State Cole Jester in the lawsuit, disputed that holding the general election on March 3 was practicable, citing testimony from State Board of Election Commissioners Director Chris Madison and state election coordinator Laura Wiles.
If Johnson issued the writ, Senior Assistant Attorney General Ryan Hale argued, would strip “the Governor of her discretionary authority to determine the soonest ‘practicable’ date for the election.”
Askew argued that once 150 days passed, Sanders no longer had discretion in setting the date — it had to be scheduled for the earliest feasible date. He said the election schedule set out in the complaint was practicable, because identical dates were used for a special election in House District 34 after Rep. John W. Walker of Little Rock died on Oct. 28, 2019 — exactly six years ago.

The judge asked both sides who they believed determined what was a practicable election date, while also saying the language of the law invited some consideration of what dates are reasonably accomplishable.
Hale said Sanders was the one who made that determination.
Askew said there was no longer any discretion after 150 days, repeatedly pointing to how the House District 34 special election, also in Pulaski County, was undertaken without issue.
Another Pulaski County judge ordered Sanders to move up Senate District 26’s special election last week following a challenge by a Franklin County voter. The judge ruled in favor of the voter, but that ruling is being appealed by the plaintiff and the defendants.
A June 9 election would be 252 days after Wing’s Sept. 30 resignation — or 152 days after the 150-day mark. The average number of days a special election has been held after the 150-day mark since 2011 is about 25 days, according to an unpublished Senate memo.
Four registered voters in District 70 are also plaintiffs in the case — Cordelia Smith-Johnson, Scott Perkins, Janie Ginocchio and Julie Rhodes.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia House Democrats on Tuesday afternoon released the long-awaited text of their proposed constitutional amendment that would allow the General Assembly to modify congressional districts mid-decade if another state redraws its own congressional map for political reasons.
The proposal, House Joint Resolution 6007, would amend Article II, Section 6 of the Virginia Constitution to authorize the legislature to “modify one or more congressional districts … in the event that any state … conducts a redistricting of such state’s congressional districts … for any purpose other than completion of the state’s decennial redistricting or as ordered by a court to remedy an unlawful or unconstitutional district map.”
Under a separate section added to the constitutional Schedule, that authority would apply only between Jan. 1, 2025, and Oct. 31, 2030, and only “in response to actions taken by another state” during that period.
Democrats call amendment a safeguard, not a power grab
Democrats say the measure preserves Virginia’s 2020 independent redistricting commission while giving the General Assembly a narrow option to respond if GOP-controlled states redraw their maps mid-decade and alter national representation.
Del. Rodney Willett (D-Henrico), who is sponsoring the amendment, said the goal is to ensure that Virginians aren’t left disadvantaged by partisan remapping elsewhere in the country.
Speaking to reporters Monday evening — nearly 24 hours before the proposal was released — Willett said Democrats were responding to a growing national pattern of Republican-led legislatures redrawing maps mid-decade.

“I think we were absolutely empowered to be here,” Willett said. “This is an attack on democracy, and our hand’s been forced here. This is not our choice to be here, but with this kind of attack, we’ve got to respond.”
He emphasized that the proposal does not dismantle the state’s independent redistricting system.
“We are still going to have a commission,” he said. “This is going to give us options, and an option that could or could not be exercised — that question’s actually going to be left to the voters to vote in a referendum as to whether we’ll have redistricting or not.”
Willett said the amendment would maintain the decennial redistricting schedule spelled out in the state constitution, while giving future lawmakers flexibility to revisit congressional boundaries.
“There’s a decennial process for that, so we will absolutely stick to that,” he said. “This is to create, again, not a mandate, but an option, in the interim, in between those decennial redistrictings to do something when there’s an extraordinary circumstance.”
GOP, Miyares say Democrats missed legal window for amendment
The amendment’s release followed hours of heated debate in the state Senate earlier Tuesday, where Democrats and Republicans clashed over the timing and legality of advancing the proposal, introduced after  more than a million Virginians have already voted early for next Tuesday’s elections.
Republicans have accused Democrats of trying to “ram through” a redistricting plan before voters go to the polls, while Democrats insist they are acting within their authority to safeguard fair representation.
Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares on Tuesday argued that the Democratic proposal violates the state constitution’s intent that voters have a meaningful say before such measures move forward.
In a written opinion released Tuesday afternoon, Miyares said the proposed redistricting amendment cannot legally advance during the current election, citing the Virginia Constitution’s requirement for an intervening general election before such measures proceed.
Miyares said Article XII of the constitution “clearly contemplates that there will be an intervening general election between the proposal of the amendment by one General Assembly and the referral of the amendment to the subsequent General Assembly.”
On Monday, Del. Bobby Orrock (R-Spotsylvania) made a similar case, arguing on the House floor that Democrats have already missed the legal window to advance a proposed redistricting amendment this year, pointing to a section of Virginia law that governs how constitutional changes must be made public before an election.

Under Code § 30-13, the clerk of the House of Delegates is required to distribute proposed constitutional amendments to local courthouses for public posting and inspection no later than three months before the next general election for the House of Delegates.
Orrock said that deadline has already passed, meaning the amendment could not be properly advertised in time for this November’s election.
Parties spar over Miyares’ opinion
Jay Jones, the Democratic nominee for attorney general, sharply criticized Miyares’ opinion in a statement Tuesday, casting it as a partisan effort aligned with the president and proof that “when Donald Trump said he could always count on Jason Miyares, this is what he meant.”
He accused the attorney general of “attempting to block a fair, legal process that would return power to Virginians,” adding that Miyares was “doubling down on his fealty to Donald Trump and his MAGA agenda.”
And Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell (D-Fairfax) slammed the attorney general’s opinion on social media, accusing him of politicizing his office. In a post on X, Surovell wrote that Miyares “has committed attorney general malpractice, abused his office for partisan gain and been wrong about dozens of other legal calls in the last four years — so why not add more to the list as he wraps up?”
In contrast, House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore (R-Scott) hailed the opinion as a clear validation of Republican concerns that Democrats are acting outside the bounds of Virginia law.
Kilgore, a seasoned lawyer and legislator, said Miyares’ analysis “gives legal weight to the obvious, common-sense reading of Virginia law.” He noted in a statement that “hundreds of thousands of Virginians have already cast their ballots in this election, as the 45-day early voting period sought by Democrats is ongoing.”
“The current general election began on Sept. 19 and will conclude on Nov. 4 at 7 p.m.,” Kilgore said. “The effort to ram through a constitutional amendment during an election flies in the face of Virginia’s constitutional and code-mandated public notice requirements.”
Spanberger backs keeping redistricting option open
The House Privileges and Elections Committee, chaired by Del. Cia Price (D-Newport News), is expected to take up the amendment Wednesday afternoon.
A second legal challenge to North Carolina’s congressional gerrymander

Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger said Monday she would not oppose the General Assembly’s effort to advance the proposed measure. In an interview on her campaign bus, Spanberger told the Associated Press that she supports Democrats “keeping alive the option” to respond to other states that redraw their congressional maps for partisan advantage.
“While I like to plan for everything, on this one, because I’m on the bus tour, because we are eight days away [from Election Day], I’m like, I will let the General Assembly take this step, and then we’ll talk calendar issues later,” she said.
Her stance marks a subtle shift from comments she made in August, when she said she had “no plans to redistrict Virginia.”
Republican gubernatorial candidate Winsome Earle-Sears denounced the proposed amendment outside the state Capitol Monday, lambasting it as an attempt to “dismantle the very independent redistricting commission that Virginia was voting for in a bipartisan majority.”
The issue has taken on new urgency for Democrats nationally. If the party were to gain just three more seats in the U.S. House, it could reclaim the majority, while Republican-led legislatures in states such as Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina have already approved new maps expanding GOP advantages.
If approved by both chambers, Virginia’s measure would still need to pass again in the next General Assembly session in 2026 and then win approval from voters in a statewide referendum before taking effect.
The Senate is scheduled to reconvene Wednesday at 11 a.m. to consider the procedural resolution that opened the door for redistricting-related measures during this special session.

Montana State University-Billings, which has conducted the annual Mountain States Poll on residents since 1989, released this year’s results which show few of Montana’s most familiar political faces with a majority of support, while a feeling of polarization persists, despite having common ground across party lines on some politically charged issues.
“It’s a little abnormal to see results this low, this early into a term,” said Hope Dewell Gentry, director of the Mountain States Poll and a political scientist who teaches at the university.
The poll surveyed 854 Montanans prior to the federal government shutdown with 55% saying they voted for Donald Trump in the 2024 Election. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 3.4%.
However, when it came time to rate the state and federal leaders, all of whom are Republican, the GOP faltered.
President Trump’s approval rating was deadlocked with his disapproval rating at 41%, with the remaining group remaining neutral. Meanwhile, 56% of the respondents said they disapproved of the job Congress is doing.
“Those are not quite as high as you might have expected,” Gentry said.
Those trend lines didn’t get much better for Montana-based politicians.
Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte showed the strongest results, albeit with 37% approving of his job. Republican Congressman Ryan Zinke, who also served as Trump’s Secretary of the Interior during the first term, had an approval rating of 26%
“Even Gianforte is not particularly popular,” Gentry said.
First-term Congressman Troy Downing’s approval rating hovered only at 16%, with the rest of the respondents having an opinion of neutral or disapproval, or said they didn’t know.
“With Downing, people are unsure — and really unsure,” Gentry said. “He doesn’t have the same media presence as others. It’s probably a message to his staff that a little PR (public relations) on the issues is needed in the district.”
Montana’s senior Sen. Steve Daines, who will run for re-election in 2026, showed only a 31% approval rating, while 28% said they disapproved. Those who identified as Republican gave Daines a higher than 50% approval rating at 53%. Gentry said that as a political scientist, Daines’ numbers suggest that he’s doing an adequate job of connecting to people in his own party, but that those who aren’t Republican aren’t certain about him.
Montana’s newly elected Sen. Tim Sheehy fared even worse, with 34% approving his job and 34% disapproving of his job so far.
“That’s not as high as I was expecting,” Gentry said. “That suggests that people don’t know what he’s doing.”
Montana’s political scene is dominated by Republicans, and more than 58% of the electorate voted for Trump in 2024. In addition, the four members of the state’s Congressional delegation are Republican as are the five “constitutional” or top elected state leaders. Both chambers of the state legislature are controlled by the GOP.
Gentry said that it was both surprising and telling that even though many Montanans identify with Republican or conservative politics, there’s a significant disparity about how residents feel about the politicians from that party, which represents a disconnect.
“There is a lot of dissatisfaction overall and how early this is,” Gentry said. “To already feel this dissatisfied with the people in power this early.”
She said that the numbers could be even more troubling for the incumbent Republicans. Gentry said many people who were Republican seemed more willing to be neutral or say they didn’t know about the GOP performance.
“They’re upset,” Gentry said. “Maybe they don’t like the way things are going, but they’re unwilling to go to the other side and say they disapprove.”
For all the dissatisfaction Montanans seem to be feeling about their elected officials, they’re also more unified on some social issues than the turmoil may suggest.
For example, when it comes to gun control or reproductive rights, Montanans have a lot more in common than different.
When it comes to reproductive rights, especially after the passage of a constitutional amendment to enshrine abortion in the state’s constitution, most Montanans told pollsters that their position hadn’t really changed on the issue of abortion, with 88% of respondents saying that abortion should be completely legal or available in certain circumstances. And, people who indicated they’d changed positions or modified their beliefs during the recent debates on reproductive rights said they tended to lean more toward a “pro-choice” position.
When it comes to gun control and the Second Amendment, Montana continues to express strong support for the right to bear arms. In fact, only 2% of respondents said they believed the Second Amendment should be abolished from the U.S. Constitution. However, 20% did say they believed it should be amended to include items like stricter regulations, weapon limitations or restrictions from owning certain firearms. Forty-one percent of respondents said they agreed with the Trump administration when it came to gun control while the remainder were either neutral or disapproved.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Gentry-MSUB-II-poll-102825-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-28 20:01:04.750218

Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul of Kentucky, along with Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, Maine’s Susan Collins and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, supported a joint resolution in a 52-48 vote.The measure’s passage in the Senate marks a shift from a previous effort in April, when Senate Republicans blocked a resolution to terminate Trump’s emergency tariffs on Canada. Murkowski, Collins and Paul also supported that measure.Coffee canister in the SenateSenate Democrats forced Tuesday’s floor vote just days after they filed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to find Trump’s unprecedented tariffs, triggered under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, unconstitutional. Murkowski was the lone Republican to join the brief.The bill’s sponsor, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., spoke on the floor ahead of the vote with a canister of Maxwell House coffee beside him. Kaine said Trump’s tariffs on Brazilian goods are an “abuse of presidential power that people are feeling every time they walk down a grocery store aisle to buy coffee for their families, to buy ground beef for their families.”“No president, Democrat or Republican, should be able to declare a national emergency justifying the imposition of 50% tariffs because a friend of theirs is being prosecuted for breaking the law in another country,” he said.Kaine used a decades-old law that allows the minority party to force a vote to terminate a national emergency.Trump declared a national emergency and imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports on July 30 after accusing Brazil’s government of “politically persecuting” its former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro for plotting a coup to remain in power in 2022.‘No taxation without representation’Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who cosponsored Kaine’s bill, said on the floor ahead of the vote Trump is using his emergency powers “to tax us without our consent.”“I, for one, still believe in the principle of no taxation without representation, and will vote to terminate this contrived emergency and end these unconstitutional import taxes,” Paul said.The vote to reverse Trump’s tariffs on Brazilian products was the first of three bipartisan resolutions this week protesting the administration’s emergency tariffs.Kentucky’s senior senator and former Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said, “Tariffs make both building and buying in America more expensive.”“The economic harms of trade wars are not the exception to history, but the rule. And no cross-eyed reading of Reagan will reveal otherwise. This week, I will vote in favor of resolutions to end emergency tariff authorities,” McConnell said, referring to Trump’s decision to add another 10% tariff on Canadian goods. That came after the Ontario province ran an anti-tariff ad featuring the words of President Ronald Reagan.Trump tariffs defendedSen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, criticized the joint resolution as “counterproductive to the progress already made by President Trump.”“The president's historic trade negotiations are bearing fruit. President Trump already announced new deals, trade deals with major trading partners, including, most recently, Cambodia and Malaysia. Other such announcements may still be forthcoming. I urge other trading partners to reach similar trading deals,” Crapo, chair of the Senate Committee on Finance, said on the floor ahead of the vote.Both tariffs and climate change are to blame for the recent spike in coffee prices, reports the Los Angeles Times.",,,,2025-10-28 20:01:04.750218

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Gov. Dan McKee plans to take $6 million from one pot of federal money to fund food benefits for a portion of the 145,000 Rhode Islanders whose monthly federal food subsidy is set to disappear on Nov. 1.
Joined by state, nonprofit and labor leaders at the Rhode Island Community Food Bank on Tuesday afternoon, McKee declared a state of emergency and said he is authorizing the money to be drawn from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) funds.
The loss of benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP has been a growing concern among area food banks. The program is a victim of the ongoing federal shutdown — even though it has been funded in previous shutdowns. In 2019, the U.S. Department of Agriculture frontloaded a month’s worth of benefits. This time around, President Donald Trump’s administration declined to pursue the same course of action.
The governor twice echoed the famous adage: “It’s the Trump administration version of, ‘Let them eat cake,’ and it’s cruel.” 
McKee acknowledged that Rhode Island receives $29 million a month in federal funds for food assistance — but said these are funds that taxpayers have already paid. 
“Rhode Islanders have already paid to the federal government to create a safety net for our neighbors, and the USDA has billions of dollars in contingency funds for such an emergency,” McKee said. “And they’re not sharing those dollars with the states. It’s unbelievable.”
Asked about the state’s authority to use the TANF money, McKee said the state is allowed, “Because it’s money that can be used towards families. … Even if it was a gray area, we’re going to do it.”
The state is also providing $200,000 for the Rhode Island Community Food Bank, which distributes food statewide across its 137 affiliated pantries and other agencies. The Rhode Island Foundation — the state’s largest philanthropic outfit — is matching that $200,000, and contributing an additional $800,000 to nonprofits across the state. 
The state has also launched a webpage, SNAPsupport.ri.gov, with instructions on how current beneficiaries can continue to access food as well as information on how people can donate to support the state’s food banks.
Displayed next to the governor was a pallet loaded with cartons of Canadian “fancy” grade apples, and on the shelves behind him were shrinkwrapped cans of diced tomatoes. SNAP subsidizes foods like these and most edible items in a grocery store barring hot, ready-to-eat options. Benefits vary by a household’s size and income, with subsidies maxing out at $298 for a single person and $994 for a family of four in the current fiscal year.

McKee’s plan cannot cushion all the state’s food stamp recipients from the federal shockwave. The Temporary Assistance money can only be used for families with children, which narrows the number of eligible recipients to an estimated 65,000 residents, or about 20,000 families. Two payments will go out twice, on Nov. 1 and Nov. 16, and amount to about half of what recipients usually receive.
Still, that leaves about 80,000 Rhode Islanders without access to food stamps in the immediate future, McKee noted. 
“While we’re continuing to pursue other options, we must prepare for the possibility that 80,000 Rhode Islanders may have to rely exclusively on food pantries and other nonprofit efforts,” McKee said.
The state of emergency gives McKee greater flexibility, he said, in restoring benefits for those thousands of Rhode Islanders if the state is able to “find a path” for those residents.
“I think it’s important to point out how complicated this issue is,” McKee said. “We don’t have the ability to use state funds to actually put the credits on those SNAP cards.”
 730,000 pounds of food

The emergency declaration follows public criticism from Helena Buonanno Foulkes, who is challenging McKee in the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial primary. On Monday, Foulkes issued a statement demanding that McKee take action before the food stamps’ expiration date, by declaring a state of emergency and mobilizing the National Guard for logistics if needed.
“While this crisis stems from decisions made in Congress and by the Trump administration, our state leaders must act now,” Foulkes said.
Asked by a reporter about Foulkes’ critique, McKee swatted it down: “It’s really disappointing that we have political grandstanding at a moment like this.”
McKee said his office received a letter from the federal administration on Oct. 10, and he was briefed on the situation on Oct. 16. The governor and his team then puzzled out possible solutions while waiting to see if the White House would tap into contingency funds for SNAP. 
“We were not notified until this weekend that that was not an option,” Mckee said. “So when you talk about the stress that is coming our way and the stress that’s coming to our families and the people in the state of Rhode Island, just think about that. We’re responding in a rapid way, where moment by moment, that whole scale gets shifted.”
Rhode Island food pantries slammed as SNAP beneficiaries brace for funding to run dry

The governor identified the true cause of the SNAP problems as President Donald Trump. “This is not about the government shutdown,” McKee said. “This is about a decision that the chief executive of this country had.” 
A notice posted to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s website reads, “Bottom line, the well has run dry.” It also blames Democrats for not voting for a stopgap funding bill.
Democrats have repeatedly voted against the stopgap funding bills because they want a guarantee that health care subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year will be extended and funded. Republicans don’t want those subsidies included.
McKee said his team has had to consider the possibility that the shutdown will stretch on. The state will need to keep planning in two-week blocks should the benefits not return soon — a prospect for which McKee saw no good omens.

“The behavior that’s coming from President Trump right now indicates to me that he has no intention of actually appropriating dollars or creating a strategy that would address this SNAP issue, which is the first time that there’s ever been a shutdown where the SNAP funds have not been appropriated,” McKee said.
For now, the Rhode Island Community Food Bank has roughly two weeks of food — 730,000 pounds — to meet current demand, CEO Melissa Cherney told the crowd on Tuesday. The warehouse has a capacity of two million pounds. Cherney, who came on board as head of the food bank in July, encouraged Rhode Islanders to donate to the food bank and local pantries. Monetary donations to the food bank can go further, as the organization can leverage its purchasing power to buy in bulk.
“This is all hands on deck, and in my short 12 weeks here in Rhode Island, I have seen the power of community,” Cherney said. “We can send a message to our neighbors that they are never alone, and we are here.”

Jared Polis speaks to policymakers and experts at an energy transmission policy workshop hosted by the Western Governors Association in Denver on Oct. 28, 2025. (Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)Rising electricity demand driven by power-hungry data centers was top of mind as policymakers, advocates and researchers gathered in Denver on Tuesday to begin a conference on how the Western U.S. can strengthen and modernize its regional grid.
“Energy from all sources needs to be moved,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in remarks that opened the two-day policy workshop on energy transmission hosted by the Western Governors’ Association at the Thompson Hotel. “We want a lower-cost grid, we want a more resilient and reliable grid, and transmission is absolutely critical to achieve that.”
The workshop is the second in a series of events in the WGA’s “Energy Superabundance” initiative, spearheaded by Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, who was named chair of the association in July. Founded in 1984 and headquartered in Denver, the bipartisan WGA facilitates regional policy development and collaboration between the chief executives of 22 Western states and U.S. territories.

Demand for electricity in the West is forecast to increase by more than 20% over the next decade, the Western Electricity Coordinating Council estimated in its most recent assessment of “resource adequacy.” That estimated demand growth has doubled over the last few years, and it’s more than quadruple the demand growth rate of 4.5% that the region saw between 2013 and 2022.
The vast majority of that demand growth is attributable to new and expanding data centers, which consume large amounts of power to serve artificial intelligence companies, cloud computing services and other related technologies.
“(Data centers) consume immense amounts of energy, can be constructed quickly, have different consumption patterns, and require changes or additions to infrastructure,” the WECC wrote in its 2024 assessment. “In some cases, large loads require a steady supply of power at all times, while in other cases, their demand can fluctuate, creating a need for large ramping capability.”










Energy abundance isn’t enough ... Superabundance — because we’re in the West, we like to do things a little bit bigger.


– Colorado Gov. Jared Polis


In the southwestern subregion that includes Arizona, home to the West’s largest concentration of data centers per capita, demand growth is projected at almost 35% by 2034, according to the WECC. Nationwide, a Carnegie Mellon University study published in July estimated that the demand surge could increase costs for residential ratepayers by 8% as electric utilities struggle to add enough generating capacity to keep up, with higher rate spikes in areas with high concentrations of data centers.
“If we want to meet demand growth and maintain reliability at lowest cost, we have to more than double our transmission system in the next 25 years,” Leah Rubin Shen, a managing director at trade group Advanced Energy United, said Tuesday during a panel on transmission needs.
Higher-capacity and more interconnected transmission grids allow loads to be “balanced” regionally as electricity usage and generation varies by time and place. But achieving those goals is especially challenging in the Western electricity market, which is made up of dozens of electricity providers, utilities and co-ops whose transmission infrastructure traverses vast geographical distances and is increasingly threatened by extreme weather conditions caused by climate change.
“The three keys of transmission — planning, paying and permitting — those are hard everywhere. I think they’re perhaps uniquely hard in the West,” Rubin Shen said. “It’s difficult to do all of those things out here.”
 ‘Abundance’ and ‘superabundance’
Cox’s “superabundance” initiative has more than a dozen corporate and nonprofit sponsors, including utilities, clean-energy and fossil-fuel trade groups, financial and consulting firms and Amazon Web Services, one of the world’s largest data center operators.
Another partner, Arnold Ventures, is a leading benefactor of causes associated with the “abundance” movement, a loose affiliation of pundits and politicians who aim to reduce regulatory barriers and speed up the development of energy resources, housing and other infrastructure. Cox was a headline speaker last month at the Abundance 2025 conference in Washington, D.C., and Polis has described his governing philosophy as an effort to bring the “abundance agenda” to Colorado.
“Energy abundance isn’t enough,” Polis joked at Tuesday’s event. “Superabundance — because we’re in the West, we like to do things a little bit bigger.”
The policy workshop featured panels on how states can reform permitting process to expedite transmission projects, lower financing costs, adopt “smart grid” technologies and encourage the “colocation” of transmission lines with other infrastructure like highways and pipelines.
The previous workshop in Cox’s initiative focused on nuclear energy and was held at the Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls in September.
“It’s been 50 years since we had a moment like this, where there was incredible demand for energy, increasing demand, where there was capital available to build new energy sources and new energy transmission, and a willingness amongst politicians to actually get the job done,” Cox said at that event.
Consumer advocates have raised concerns that the rapid construction of data centers, and the development of energy resources to power them, could come to a screeching halt in the event that what skeptics call the “A.I. bubble” bursts. But Chris Parker, director of the Utah Division of Public Utilities, said during a panel at Tuesday’s event that “overbuilding” shouldn’t be cause for concern.
“We might be building more than we strictly need — that’s OK,” he said. “That’s how we get a period of superabundance.”
“Everything is intended to benefit humans,” Parker added. “I come from a red state that’s very much into anti-socializing things, but energy is absolutely, 100%, a very socialized thing. It needs to be.”

A new poll released Tuesday shows Montanans, and Americans in general, agree that political spending, including dark money in politics, has a corrosive effect on government, and lessens the trust in government.
The poll comes as a Montana group proposes a different way to end dark money in political advertising that resulted from the Citizens United Supreme Court decision. Currently, a group, Transparent Election Initiative, is in the process of trying to float a constitutional amendment that would eliminate corporate and dark spending in politics by changing state law.
The poll, commissioned by Issue One and conducted by YouGov, showed two key findings: First, citizens broadly believe that dark money groups as well as corporate spending and money from wealthy donors “creates the appearance of corruption and reduces trust in government.” Secondly, voters seem to support changing the system by disallowing so much money in the races.
“This shows the frustration with politics and the frustration with both parties is universal,” said Liana Keesing, the policy lead of Issue One, a national organization dedicating to reducing the money in politics, and advocating reform.
“Money in politics is no longer a partisan issue. And, it shows that when voters see a path to change, they rally around it,” she said, speaking in particular of Montana’s attempt to amend the constitution by Transparent Election Initiative. “One of the most important things we can provide is transferring apathy into action.”
Montana’s proposed ballot measure would challenge the money spent in elections by attacking the Citizens United ruling in a different way. Individual states are allowed to control the operation of corporations and businesses through their charters. Montana’s new proposal would curb the power granted through the state charter system, limiting their ability to spend on political campaigns and candidates.
Though organizer Jeff Mangan said Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen has declared the initiative doesn’t pass state constitutional muster, he said his group expected that, and is prepared to take the fight to the state’s Supreme Court, which will have ultimate say on whether the proposal can get on the ballot if enough signatures are gathered.

The poll found that 79% of Americans agreed large independent expenditures, which often get labeled as “dark money” because of an inability to track where the money originates, give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. The polling included 84% of Democrats, 74% of Republicans and 79% of independents.
Nearly the same numbers also agree large wealthy donations are causing the public to lose faith in democracy, according to the poll.
“The findings fly in the face of two of the key assumptions that the U.S. Supreme Court made 15 years ago in Citizens United, namely that independent expenditures do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption, and secondly, that the appearance of influence or access would not cause the electorate to lose faith in democracy. These perceptions of corruption are corrosive to the foundation of our democracy,” said Issue One Senior Research Director Michael Beckel. “Our political system cannot function if the public assumes the government is for sale to the highest bidder.”
At a press conference announcing the polling results, advocates included Mangan, a former Montana Commissioner of Political Practices, who compared current election spending to an “arms race” where there’s more pressure to outspend and out-fundraise opponents.
The polling also shows that Montanans are generally supportive of the ballot measure with 3-in-4 saying they would amend state law to curb corporations and political spending by charter. Seventy-four percent of Montanas agreed, which includes 84% of Democrats, 69% of Republicans and 64% of independents.
Polling done through YouGov also shows that while campaign and dark-money spending on elections is not the only cause of frustration, it still appears as a concern along with cost of living, inflation, healthcare and the availability of jobs.
Montana’s proposal would prohibit corporations from spending money on political campaigns.
“It would just make Citizens United irrelevant,” Mangan said.
The poll also asked residents of other states whether they’d support such a measure in their state. Polling showed nearly the same results with 72% of Americans supporting the idea, including 81% of Democrats, 64% of Republicans and 60% of independents.
Only 13% of those polled by the group said that unlimited spending by people and organizations is acceptable and makes American democracy stronger. Sixty-three percent of those surveyed also said that they disagreed with the Citizens United Decision, which included more than half of Democrats, Republicans and Independents.
The national poll had a margin of error of +/- 3.3% and surveyed 1,036 voters from Oct. 7-15.
Some have suggested to the pollsters the issue of dark money in politics is related to other political topics, like housing.
“There is a housing crisis that has been exacerbated by wealthy individuals and corporations. They have a negative influence on the state,” said Theodore Landsman, a senior political analyst at YouGov, who studied Montana’s responses.
John Ray, Senior Director of Polling at YouGov, said that almost every issue has a significant partisan gap, but the idea of limiting or controlling money in politics crosses over party lines.
“Ordinary voters get how broken the system is. If politicians would take actions on these things, voters would reward them,” Beckel said.
Mangan stressed that although the issues and even solutions have varied, limiting the influence of money in politics is part of the state’s historical tradition, stretching back to 1912 when Montana voters demanded the “Corrupt Practices Act” which gave citizens more political power even at a time of Copper Kings and a notoriously weak first state constitution.
“There’s a consistency there because it treats everyone the same,” Mangan said. “No gimmicks, no loopholes.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Fundraising-1024x659.png,,,2025-10-28 19:17:45.452145

(USDA photo / Lance Cheung)A comment about buying more beef from Argentina made by President Donald Trump aboard Air Force One has rankled the cattle industry, upset members of his base and added fire to an effort to advance long-discussed meat packaging legislation.
The price of beef has skyrocketed 51% since 2020, though it’s mostly a demand for low-quality, imported meat, Montana ranchers have said. Legislation for improved “country-of-origin” labeling on beef is being discussed at the federal level, which advocates for ranchers and farmers say would help make the meat market more competitive.
Large packing companies sometimes combine and sell meat consumers think is American, advocates said, but in fact came from cattle not raised in the United States.
On Oct. 19, Trump suggested while flying back to Washington, D.C., that buying beef from Argentina would bring its price down. Trump and Argentinian President Javier Milei are close allies.
The impact from Trump’s announcement, along with a later policy proposal of increasing Argentinian meat imports and a tariff reduction conversation with Brazil, was cratering beef futures. Cash values of cattle remain up — meaning packers need meat to fill demand — but the plans for Argentina specifically will have little overall impact, Montana Farmers Union President Walter Schweitzer said. 
In addition, 85% of the U.S. beef market is controlled by four companies. One of the four, Brazilian meatpacking giant JBS, gave $5 million to the Trump–Vance Inaugural Committee. 
Schweitzer said in the previous 10 years, America has lost about 20% of family ranchers. 
“As a cattle producer, as a feeder, as a broker, you’re a little nervous because these packers will take advantage of a bunkhouse fire to crash a market,” Schweitzer said.
The Trump proposal would increase Argentinian beef imports from 20,000 metric tons to 80,000 metric tons, a small percentage of United States beef imports. Even so, a broad swath of agricultural interest groups are taking notice.
“We certainly want to make sure that we pay close attention, though, because we’re very proud of our product that we raised, not just here in Montana, but in the U.S.,” said Nicole Rolf, the director of governmental affairs for the Montana Farm Bureau Federation. “We don’t want our country to have to rely on other countries for food security, even at these small rates. It’s probably not a big worry, but it’s something that we’ll be keeping an eye on.”
Tariffs have hurt foreign markets for American companies, some ranchers have said, with those places now buying beef from other countries. That’s not everyone, though, and Rolf said she has not heard that complaint from her members. Beef demand is high, she added, and there’s hope that more European markets open soon.
“Once the Europeans get a bit more of a taste for great American corn-fed beef that they’ll want to open that up a lot more,” Rolf said.
Trump, meanwhile, has said American meat producers don’t know what they’re talking about.
“The cattle ranchers, who I love, don’t understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put tariffs on cattle coming into the United States, including a 50% tariff on Brazil,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “If it weren’t for me, they would be doing just as they’ve done for the past 20 years — Terrible!”

‘Created uncertainty’
However, Trump’s comments and the beef market shifts have reignited a meat-packing debate over what’s called “country-of-origin” labeling, or COOL, essentially meaning that if hamburger was brought to America from Brazil, it would have to say so.
U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has a bill called the American Beef Labeling Act, which would strengthen the labeling law. He’s said Trump’s comments have “created uncertainty” in the market.
A variety of interest groups and politicians have also been vocal on the issue, including Montana Republican U.S. Rep. Troy Downing, who has taken note and signed onto a letter to Trump, along with several other House reps from states with significant interest in the cattle industry.
“In recent days, we have heard strong concerns from producers regarding reports that the U.S.may import beef from Argentina,” the letter reads. “While we recognize the importance of strong trade relationships and diverse markets, our producers are seeking clarity on how this decision will be made, what safety and inspection standards will apply, and how this policy aligns with your administration’s commitment to strengthening American agriculture.”
American beef is sometimes blended with foreign beef and sold and labeled as an American product, which is what Thune’s legislation would seek to fix. This is especially true with hamburger, and it’s profitable — ground beef sales were $15.3 billion in 2024.
The current country-of-origin labeling fight dates back about a decade. In 2015 — under pressure from the four big packing companies, Schweitzer said — the World Trade Organization ruled labeling American beef as being from the United States was an unfair trade practice. 
This decision only applied to chicken and beef, and country-of-origin labeling is required on all other American products, whether it is a car part or a washing machine. The decision allowed Mexico and Canada to pursue retaliatory tariffs if they wanted to.
The problem there, Schweitzer said, is that the quality of American beef differs even within the country itself — Montana beef prices are usually higher than border states, because of genetics and the environment they’re raised in.
Packing companies then put pressure on Congress, and the rules were softened.
“And the fact is the U.S. cattle market dropped 50% when Congress repealed COOL,” Schweitzer said. “We could have paid those retaliatory tariffs and still made money as a nation.”
Schweitzer also reiterated a point he’s made consistently — American ranchers aren’t afraid of competition. They just want it to be fair and explained what would happen with country-of-origin labeling.
“What would happen is that you could go into the meat counters and you could find Brazilian burger, you could find Australian burger, you could find Canadian burger, you could find Mexican burger, and you could find U.S. beef, and the consumer would have a choice,” he said.
The Montana Cattleman’s Association, the Montana Farmers Union and the Northern Plains Resource Council are all in lockstep on beef labeling. There’s even a website — mtcool.org — devoted to the issue.
The Montana Farm Bureau Federation has no official position on Country-of-Origin Labeling, Rolf said.
This is for a couple reasons, one of them being a Biden-era executive order regarding the voluntary product of U.S.A. labeling on beef products. Those rules appear to be set to go into place next year, she added.
“That piece of the puzzle is coming on board soon,” Rolf said. “Our members are supportive of a voluntary country-of-origin labeling program, and that product of the USA label is just that. So we’d like to see that come into effect.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/49360032651_4f29c6784b_k-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 19:01:58.640573

The Alabama Department of Human Resources (DHR) announced Monday that benefits for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (SNAP) will be suspended for November. However, Alabama SNAP Director Brandon Hardin said in an interview Tuesday that everything will be “business as usual” on the administrative side.
“We know this is a trying time for all these individuals, and we’ll continue to press forward and react as soon as we can to any information that we get from USDA,” Hardin said.

The suspension of the 100% federally-funded program came on the 26th day of the government shutdown. DHR was notified of the suspension by the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service (USDA) on Friday evening. The 726,500 Alabamians affected represent nearly 15% of the state population. Of that, about 44% are children, according to DHR.
DHR encouraged SNAP recipients to reach out to local food banks for supplemental assistance. Hardin said Tuesday that it is not possible for food banks and other similar organizations to completely cover the $142 million monthly cost of SNAP.
“SNAP is meant to be supplemental, but there is no way that the food banks can cover this,” Hardin said. “There’s no way a food bank could cover that.”
Hardin and Kathryn Shoupe, the director of communications for DHR, said local DHR offices will be able to connect SNAP recipients with churches, charities and other organizations.
“That’s going to be the best avenue for them to to know those resources that are available. Our county DHR directors are going to know the organizations in their communities, the churches, the food pantries, things like that, that are going to be close to their home in their county,” Shoupe said. 
A SNAP recipient gets $6 per day per month to buy groceries. Hardin said that most recipients spend that money in the first half of the month. He encouraged recipients to use any leftover benefits they have in November. He said benefits are good to use for nine months after it is administered.
Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), Alabama officials were aware that federal funding for SNAP would reduce in fiscal year 2027, increasing the state’s share. According to estimates in August, the federal cuts to the program would increase DHR’s budget request by $35 million in FY27 and $208 million in FY28 when the state is responsible for 10% of SNAP benefits.

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)While the government shutdown is not set to impact the strike being considered by Starbucks unionized workers, organizers said the recent government action has affected the ability of some Starbucks employees across the country to form their own unions.
A group of Starbucks baristas and supporters rallied outside the Des Moines Starbucks location near the Merle Hay Mall Tuesday, holding signs saying, “No contract? No coffee!” and “Just practicing for a just contract” as they led chants and cheered with passing cars.
The protest was one of many in Iowa and across the country organized by Starbucks Workers United between Oct. 24 and Nov. 2 as the union is voting on a strike authorization on unfair labor practices heading into the holiday season.
Speaking at the event, Jacob Scroggins, a Starbucks employee, said among the demands made by union workers were “livable wages, employer-paid health benefits and consistent schedules.” Scroggins said the demands being made ahead of the strike are all issues that pushed the Des Moines store employees to vote in support of unionization in August.
“Today was about showing corporate that we are serious, and we want to come to the bargaining table,” Scroggins said. “They’ve stalled for eight months. We’ve been waiting. And when we joined this movement, we expected to fight, and we’re fighting today.”
The location near Merle Hay Mall is the only Starbucks in Des Moines to be unionized, though there are other unionized Iowa stores in Iowa City, Bettendorf and Davenport. While there are no other union Des Moines Starbucks locations, Scroggins said some employees at other local stores have shown an interest in participating in a strike.
“I have met a barista who works here primarily for health care for their children, and struggles to get (enough) hours to receive that health care benefit from the company,” Scroggins said. “So it is something that is affecting many baristas.”
Some of the affected employees are at stores that may be in the process of forming a union, but have had their efforts halted by the federal government shutdown. Sharie Denton, a union organizer, said across the Midwest, there are many locations that have been ready to file for a union election who have not been able to submit their request because of the shutdown, as well as shops with elections scheduled that were postponed.
Funding for the National Labor Relations Board, which oversees union elections, was halted as part of the federal government shutdown. The NLRB has stated elections, ballot counts, and representation case hearings scheduled for Oct. 1 onward were postponed indefinitely, with timelines contingent based on how long the shutdown lasts.
One of the postponed elections was for creating a nurses union at the four UnityPoint hospitals in the Des Moines metropolitan area. The “United Nurses of Iowa” effort, organized through the Teamsters Local 90, was supposed to have employees begin voting on whether to unionize Oct. 5. But UnityPoint and union organizers received notice Oct. 1 from the NLRB that the election was delayed indefinitely.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/starbucks.union_.1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-28 19:01:58.640573

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)A panel of child care experts on Tuesday recommended several steps the Arkansas Department of Education can implement by Saturday with the goal of preventing child care layoffs and closures throughout the state.
The emergency working group, formed last week by the state Early Childhood Commission, proposed readjusting both child care providers’ reimbursement rates and low-income families’ copayments and eligibility under the School Readiness Assistance Program.
The Department of Education can implement all the recommendations by Nov. 1 and prevent a wave of layoffs and closures that would leave thousands of Arkansans without child care, working group members Shahid Sheikh and Dawn Colyer said. The $28 million plan should sustain the program for eight weeks and forgo the need to ask the state Legislature for financial help, they said.
“We’ve come to a consensus that there’s a certain level of loss that each of us is willing to take so that we don’t have to shut down,” Sheikh said.
Colyer runs a child care center in Sheridan, and Sheikh runs four Northwest Arkansas centers.
The education department and Early Childhood Commission will discuss the recommendations and choose their next steps by the end of the week, said Ashelyn Abney, interim director of the department’s Office of Early Childhood.
Without imminent changes to the funding formula, 250 child care facilities in 50 of Arkansas’ 75 counties would see a total of 400 layoffs by next month, according to a survey presented to the commission Oct. 15. The federally funded program serves about 16,000 children and has a waitlist of 1,100, according to the education department.
Initial plan had been delayed
The department ruffled providers’ feathers in September when it announced changes to the financial aid program’s reimbursement and copayment structures, with the goal of reducing the child care waitlist and making the program more financially sustainable.
The agency delayed cuts to providers’ reimbursement rates until Nov. 1 but moved forward with participant copayments on Oct. 1 as planned. Those increased copayments have already forced some Arkansas child care centers to close because parents could not afford to pay more, Sheikh told the Early Childhood Commission earlier this month.
Arkansas child care providers ask state for help after changes to school readiness program

The federal Child Care and Development Fund supports the School Readiness Assistance Program but is mostly inaccessible due to the ongoing federal government shutdown, said Chris Barnes, a State Leadership Development Coach in the department’s Division of Elementary and Secondary Education.
Barnes said last week that the state had about $16.3 million in CCDF funds on hand. On Tuesday, he said that number is about $24.2 million, with $20.8 million funding direct services to families and $3.8 million in quality investment funds.
The working group used the $24.2 million as a basis for their proposal and said the education department should take another $4 million in CCDF funds from contract expenses. The agency would still meet the minimum federal requirements for using the funds even with the proposed contract spending reductions, Sheikh said.
Families who are working or enrolled in school with income at or below the state poverty level will not pay a copayment for children before kindergarten, and families above the poverty level will pay a copay scaled to income and the age of the child, according to the education department.
For families with multiple children, the working group proposed capping copayments at 7% of their household income and charging families the same percentage of their base rate for each child’s age group.
Provider reimbursement rates are higher for child care centers that have achieved higher quality ratings on a scale of one to six. The group suggested making reimbursement rates the same for the third and fourth levels and for the fifth and sixth levels. This would circumvent the problem of squeezing providers financially by lowering their base rates, and it would ensure continued quality care at each level, Colyer said in an interview.
Northwest Arkansas reimbursement rates would be higher than those in the rest of the state because of the region’s higher cost of living and because private child care providers in the region charge families more than in other areas, Colyer said.











We’ve come to a consensus that there’s a certain level of loss that each of us is willing to take so that we don’t have to shut down.


– Shahid Sheikh, owner of four Northwest Arkansas child care centers



The working group’s third recommendation was for the education department to remove the 72-month limit on low-income families’ access to the School Readiness Assistance Program.
“What sense does that make if you’ve got a family [whose] child’s been with you for four years, and Mom’s pregnant, she’s 12 months away from losing her benefits, and she’s got a baby coming?” Colyer said during the work session. “That doesn’t make sense to us at all, to do that to families.”
Besides Sheikh and Colyer, several other child care providers from throughout the state served on the working group, as did Lorraine McKelvey, a child development expert and researcher at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences.
Rep. Denise Garner, D-Fayetteville, and Sen. Jane English, R-North Little Rock, are members of the Early Childhood Commission and also served on the working group.
Sheikh said he hopes the group continues to be allowed to consult the commission on issues facing the child care industry once the current issues are resolved. The federal government shutdown began Oct. 1 with no end currently in sight.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Election Day next Tuesday will mark the first general election since the 2025 Utah Legislature passed sweeping changes to the state’s election laws — but for now, only one crucial vote-by-mail deadline has changed. 
Previously, county clerks have been allowed to count a by-mail ballot as long as it’s been postmarked on or before Election Day, even if it arrives at clerks’ offices days later. But now, Utah law requires ballots to be in clerks’ possession no later than 8 p.m. on election night, regardless of their postmark. 
That means Utahns wanting to vote by mail now have a shorter timeframe to mail their ballots in on time — and run a higher risk of their ballots not being counted if they mail them too close to Election Day. 
To be safe, county clerks are encouraging Utah voters — if they have any doubt that the post office might not deliver them on time — to instead drop their ballots at a designated drop box or directly at their county clerks’ offices on or before Election Day. 
Utah Legislature approves bill to require voter ID, phase out automatic voting by mail by 2029

Voters can use the state’s election website or their county clerks’ websites to look up drop box locations or in-person voting locations. Salt Lake County, for example, has posted a list of Election Day vote centers that will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. where people can drop off their by-mail ballot or vote in person with a valid ID. 
The moved up vote-by-mail deadline is just one of many changes included in HB300, a bill passed by Utah lawmakers earlier this year enacting a long list of changes, including more restrictions to voting by mail. 
However, it’s important to note that most of the new law’s changes have a delayed effective date — with the most substantial changes not scheduled to become law until 2026 or, in some cases, until 2029. 
In addition to moving up the voting-by-mail deadline, here’s a breakdown of HB300’s most important changes and when they take effect (unless lawmakers make any additional changes between now and 2029):  

Starting in 2026, voters with a valid state ID will be required to include the last four digits of their state ID or Social Security number on their by-mail ballot. However, for registered voters who cast their ballot without an ID number, clerks can still use signature verification to verify ballots — but only until 2029. That year, clerks will then be required to move away from signature verification and instead rely on ID number ballot verification. 
Utah’s current automatic vote-by-mail system will be phased out by 2029. Starting Jan. 1 of that year, in order to vote by mail, Utahns will be required to obtain a valid state ID and opt in to have a ballot mailed to them. They’ll also be required to continue to opt in every eight years. 
Beginning in 2029, voters who vote in person must present a valid ID, except in certain circumstances, in which a voter could sign an affidavit and present two forms of alternative ID (like a Social Security card, bank statement or paystub). 

Confusion over four-digit requirement
Though most of HB300’s provisions won’t take effect until years later, the new law has caused some confusion — particularly in one county where a clerk decided to “test” the four-digit ID requirement early. 
For the 2025 municipal primaries in August, Utah County Clerk Aaron Davidson included a space for those four digits on that county’s ballot envelopes — but he told KSLTV that he opted against doing it again for the November municipal elections after his office found some problems with that verification method.  
“We identified 790 ballots where the signature did not match, but the four digits did,” Davidson told the outlet. 
So for the 2025 general election next week, Davidson decided to remove the four-digit space off of the ballot envelope. However, county officials included the same instructions from the primaries instructing voters to write the four digits, even though there was no longer a space to do so. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
That meant for the November election his county’s voting instructions included inaccurate information — but Davidson told ABC4 he decided against re-printing the instructions because it would have cost more taxpayer money.  
“We just didn’t feel it was physically fiscally prudent to throw those instructions out and have them reprinted,” he told the TV station. “So we sent out the instructions from the primary (in the general election) and it does say to put the four digits on, but we figured we’d just address those issues with voters, as they call — (and) just let them know you can add the four digits if you want to at the end of your signature.”
It’s more likely than not that Utah lawmakers between now and 2029 will make more changes to the state’s election laws — so it’s possible the four-digit ID requirement could be tweaked or changed entirely. 
But for Election Day next week, the most important thing voters need to know is that the only change enacted so far is that by-mail ballots have to be in county clerks’ hands by 8 p.m. on Election Day. There are no requirements — yet — to write four-digit ID numbers on ballot envelopes.

(Photo by Jessica Kourkounis for the Pennsylvania Capital-Star)Pennsylvania Treasurer Stacy Garrity said Tuesday her office has provided more than $21 million in loans to four dozen organizations to continue operating during the state budget impasse.
The office started the $500 million Budget Bridge Loan Program in September to support county governments and Head Start local agencies, which provide education, health and social services to families with children aged 3 to 5. 
Earlier this month, it expanded the program to support organizations that contract with county governments to provide services for rape survivors and pre-k children, as well as domestic violence prevention support.

Garrity, who is also running in the Republican primary for governor next year, announced that her office approved 24 new organizations to bring the total number  to 48.
“Pennsylvanians, especially the most vulnerable, should never have to pay the price for a budget stalemate,” Garrity said in a statement. “Treasury is committed to working diligently with applicants so funds can be delivered as quickly as possible.”
Meanwhile on Monday and Tuesday, House and Senate leaders from both parties met with Gov. Josh Shapiro in his office as both chambers returned to session this week. 
Top lawmakers including Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana), Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland), House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) and House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D-Philadelphia) were tight lipped about the negotiations leaving the governor’s office Tuesday afternoon. 
A spokesperson for Shapiro said it had no updates on the budget process..
Shapiro introduced a $51.5 billion spending plan in February that included increases in state funding for education and transit but also proposed new revenue from taxes on legalized adult-use recreational marijuana and Skill Games. 
In July, the House passed a pared-down version of Shapiro’s plan without the new revenue and about a $900 million reduction in overall spending. The Senate responded in August by passing a budget bill that would keep spending at 2024-2025 levels. 
On Oct. 8, the 100th day after the June 30 budget deadline, the House passed a second Democratic-led proposal that further reduced spending to $50.25 billion, as House and Senate leaders traded barbs in Capitol news conferences.
Last week, the Senate passed a second budget proposal with a modest spending increase over last fiscal year. At $47.9 billion, however, it struck most of Shapiro’s new spending and Democrats warned of the consequences of not fully funding schools and social safety net programs.
As the budget deadline passed without an agreement this summer, county and school officials across the commonwealth warned that their available funding would start to dry up by September. As a result counties and school districts have been forced to spend reserves, take out revenue anticipation loans or cut services. Those that take out loans will be responsible for interest that cannot be recouped.
In the case of county governments, the cuts affected social safety net services provided by private agencies under contract.
The Treasury loans must be repaid with 4.5% interest within 10 days of receiving state funding after a budget is approved. The Senate passed a bill this month to allow Garrity’s office to waive the interest and it awaits consideration in the House.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Inside-the-Pennsylvania-Capitol-4-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-10-28 19:01:58.640573

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)Furloughed federal workers received nearly $1 million in emergency relief loans for missed paychecks from North Dakota banks since the start of the federal government shutdown. 
The Furloughed Federal Employee Relief Program, administered by the Bank of North Dakota, along with other loan programs from community banks were established earlier this month to help federal workers affected by the shutdown meet their financial obligations. 
Don Morgan, president of the Bank of North Dakota, said the bank has received 77 applications for the state’s loan program as of Oct. 27, totaling about $480,000, with many of the requests centered around the Air Force bases at Minot and Grand Forks, as well as Cass and Morton counties.
“We’re actually glad it’s starting out a little bit slower,” Morgan said in an interview. “It’s allowing us to work some of the kinks out of the first of its kind program.”
Morgan said the bank was anticipating between 500 to 1,000 furloughed North Dakota federal workers would take advantage of the program. The Industrial Commission estimates there are about 9,200 federal workers in North Dakota, including members of the military.
“I think it’s just too early to tell with so many unknowns,” he said. “I think the longer the federal shutdown goes on, I think the demand kind of builds.”
One looming question on the program, Morgan said, is a push by congressional leaders to pay military members and essential workers currently working without pay during the shutdown.
North Dakota rolls out low-interest loans to aid federal workers during shutdown

Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., introduced the Shutdown Fairness Act that would pay military members, essential federal employees and contractors that support those exempted federal workers during the shutdown. The bill failed 54-45 on the Senate floor on Thursday.
“We think that could be affecting it and really affect it moving forward,” Morgan said.
He said another factor for the program are other banks, such as Gate City Bank and USAA, providing their own programs for furloughed federal workers.
Kim Settel, chief retail banking officer for Gate City Bank in Fargo, said her bank’s furloughed federal worker loan program offers six-month, 0% interest loans for up to $5,000 per furloughed employee. The program has accepted 121 applications, totaling about $500,000, as of Tuesday. 
“I think people thought this would get resolved sooner rather than later,” Settel said. “We are here to help and we want to be a partner for these community members throughout this, when they need it.”
She added furloughed federal workers don’t need to be members of Gate City Bank to participate in their six-month loan program, but they do need to live within their lending areas across 45 locations in North Dakota and Minnesota.
Gate City Bank is also participating in the state’s Furloughed Federal Employee Relief Program, but applicants cannot use both relief programs, Settel said.
“This is a great illustration of why a community bank is so wonderful because you have some place to go in the event of a crisis,” she said.
Morgan said any furloughed federal worker or military member living in North Dakota qualifies for the 2% interest loan program and should reach out to their local bank or credit union to start the application process. He added workers that use a bank outside of North Dakota would need to open an account with a local, North Dakota bank for the funds to be deposited.

“We didn’t spend that money thinking we would get that money back. We spent that money thinking we would get housing and recreation,” said Councilor Cary Brown.

This story by Carla Occaso was first published in The Bridge on Oct. 27, 2025
The wheels have been set in motion to find a developer to create housing on a 20-acre buildable parcel at the Country Club Road property in Montpelier for the land price of $1. The Montpelier City Council met on Oct. 22 and, after lengthy discussion, voted to authorize Acting City Manager Kelly Murphy to issue the request for qualifications on Monday, instead of immediately.
The choice to delay the issuance by a few days came from Councilor Adrienne Gil, in order to allow a few days for city staff members to communicate the proposal to the public.
Discussion on the proposal, led by Stephanie Clarke, vice president of White + Burke Real Estate Advisors, centered on process and purchase price. The recommendation was to start with an RFQ before issuing a request for proposals in order to capture interest and vet qualifications. This would move the process along and open the door for more partners, according to Clarke.
The Country Club Road subcommittee would then vet the group, discuss how to clearly communicate details within the RFQ to residents, and create a short list of developers to be invited to submit detailed proposals, which would then come back to the full city council. The primary goal is to make housing doable in Montpelier while recognizing that statewide it’s nearly impossible to build without subsidies, Clarke said.
$1 land price controversy
A significant part of the discussion revolved around the proposal to sell the approximately 20 buildable acres for $1 to a potential development partner. The arguments in favor of the plan came from Clarke and councilors Cary Brown, Ben Doyle and Sal Alfano. 
Selling land for $1 acts as an investment or subsidy for the housing project, making it financially viable for developers. If they can’t get this incentive, they’ll build where rents are higher, such as in Chittenden County, Clarke said. Montpelier residents voted to purchase the land for $3 million with the purpose of improving and expanding housing and recreation, not to recoup the money directly from the sale, Councilor Cary Brown said.
“We didn’t spend that money thinking we would get that money back. We spent that money thinking we would get housing and recreation,” Brown said, adding that the “incredible cost” of construction now makes it almost impossible to build something that could have been built 30 years ago. 
Councilor Ben Doyle said charging $1 for the land sends a signal that the city is “going to partner with you,” versus “we are going to recoup the cost.” Doyle reminded those present of the former M&M Beverage property between Shaw’s supermarket and The Drawing Board that has had two requests for proposals issued with no takers. Doyle said the $1 land offer would create a catalyst to create other development. Councilor Sal Alfano said “it is a shock to see we are selling 20 acres for $1,” but by doing so, it would allow the city to pay for infrastructure through the tax base and create new tax revenue going into the future. 
“And we also would have housing that we desperately need and will nourish economic development,” Alfano said. “We are trying to attract as many developers as we possibly can.”
Those against the $1 land price included Councilor Jim Sheridan, who said he was “bothered” by the $1 price, noting the city paid about $20,000 per acre. He worried about giving away 20 acres with “no clue how much this is going to bring in for our tax base.” Councilor Gil expressed caution and emphasized the need to project scenarios and obtain a cost-benefit analysis, for example, “if we build X houses, it results in XYZ tax revenue” to justify the subsidy to the public.
The RFQ document specifies the city will partner to develop a subdivision plan, build infrastructure and transfer ownership for $1. Water and wastewater allocation fees will be waived. The objective is to increase market rate housing, workforce housing or both outside the floodplain, the document states.

Commissioner Jeff Welborn will lead the Montana Public Service Commission after the commissioners voted on Tuesday for him to replace ousted President Brad Molnar.
Welborn, a former legislator in his first term as a commissioner, said until recently, he wasn’t expecting the role to become open, but he would accept the challenge.
Earlier this summer, Molnar announced he was under investigation internally for professional misconduct.

The PSC has been operating under duress at least since then, with a combative-at-times Molnar and an internal committee requesting his suspension by Gov. Greg Gianforte.
Last week, the Public Service Commission voted to vacate the office of president, unseating Molnar from the leadership post he took in January.
In accepting the nomination for president this week, Welborn, the sole nominee, said respect is a two-way street, as is communication.
“I do believe that the only way any organization can move forward is keep both of those lines open in both directions,” said Welborn, of Dillon. “It’s perfectly fine to disagree with somebody, but I would always try to promote an environment that you can disagree without being disagreeable, and I think there’s a difference.”
The all-Republican Public Service Commission voted 3-2 in favor of seating Welborn as president, with Molnar and ally Commissioner Randy Pinocci voting no.
Molnar tried to restart discussion after voting was underway, but Vice President Jennifer Fielder, who chaired the meeting, said doing so was contrary to Robert’s Rules of Order, a format for parliamentary procedure.
Molnar retorted: “Well, maybe Robert should speak for himself.”
Fielder nominated Welborn, with whom she served in the Montana Legislature, and Commissioner Annie Bukacek seconded the nomination.
Fielder said when she and Welborn served together as legislators, they often disagreed on policy. However, she said she found her colleague to be well-reasoned, respectful and “never vindictive.”
Fielder said he developed chairmanship skills as a lawmaker, is a good listener, and represents the “positive change” needed by the agency regulating monopoly utilities.
“He’s been able to work respectfully with others, whether he agrees with them or not,” Fielder said.
Bukacek said Welborn would be “a natural” in the role given his respect for others and capacity to listen. She said he also would promote a “positive environment with civil decorum,” as the job requires.
“He has the temperament, character and life experience well-suited for the role of president for the good of the order of the Public Service Commission and the public we serve,” Bukacek said.
The internal investigation into professional misconduct against Molnar is pending.
In his own defense, Molnar has described himself as a “redneck in a white shirt,” and he has said he may have made a joke that he didn’t realize had sexual overtones until he was told.
However, Molnar is not averse to conflict, and he has openly criticized staff and commissioners, especially when he believes the agency has been deferential to NorthWestern Energy, the largest public utility in the state, at the expense of consumers.
Staff and commissioners have said they appreciate Molnar’s dedication and experience, but they also opposed a move to rescind the earlier complaint and suspension request made to Gianforte by the internal PSC “response team.”
In September, commissioners voted 3-2 against taking back the letter, with Pinocci siding with Molnar.
Last week, Molnar’s lawyer argued the request to the governor was moot given the PSC removed leadership responsibilities from Molnar, so he no longer had the authority that allowed him to interfere with the investigation, as the internal committee alleged.
Molnar has admitted to taking advantage of his right to free speech in speaking out against the investigation but denied interference.
The Governor’s Office has not responded to questions about the status of the complaint against Molnar.
In other business Tuesday, the Public Service Commission voted unanimously to accept a staff recommendation to extend negotiations with the North Star utility for 30 days over its failures to provide adequate water service to roughly 270 residents in a subdivision near Helena.
A potential $86,700 fine has been pending against the utility, but it’s an amount the utility likely can’t afford to pay, according to an earlier PSC staff memo.
Negotiations had been underway for 60 days.
At a meeting in August, the PSC said the fine was a step toward negotiating infrastructure improvements, and Tuesday, commissioners learned negotiations had been productive, and PSC staff requested more time to continue them.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/600x200-PSC.jpg,,,2025-10-28 18:17:02.800112

On Nov. 5, the Alaska Judicial Council will take public testimony and vote on a list of finalists for candidates to replace longtime Judge Bethany Harbison. 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy will then have 45 days to make the final pick. That person will complete the four-judge body that hears most criminal appeals short of the Alaska Supreme Court. 
The list of applicants, previously announced in June, includes prosecutor RuthAnne Beach, deputy chief of the Office of Criminal Appeals in Anchorage; Lacey Jane Brewster, an assistant public defender in Anchorage; Fairbanks Superior Court Judge Patricia Haines; and Juneau private-practice attorney Chris Peloso.
In a survey of practicing attorneys, Haines was rated as the most qualified candidate, having received a score of 4.6 out of a possible 5. Beach received a rating of 4.2, Brewster a rating of 2.9, and Peloso, a rating of 2.6.
The survey, conducted for all judicial vacancies, considers a score of 3 to be “acceptable,” and a score below that mark is considered “insufficient.”
The council must forward at least two candidates to the governor for final selection; if it cannot do so, the hiring process will restart. 
The Alaska Judicial Council includes three attorneys and three members of the public appointed by the governor. In the event of a tie, the chief justice of the Alaska Supreme Court casts the tiebreaking vote.
Public testimony on the four candidates will be taken by Zoom and in person in Anchorage. Candidates may be interviewed by the council in public or in private; Peloso was the only candidate willing to be interviewed in public.
A public vote on the final candidates is expected no earlier than 4:30 p.m. Nov. 5.

Too many in Washington are ignoring the urgent need for a Farm Bill that improves and funds U.S. Department of Agriculture conservation programs, like the Conservation Reserve Program.
Everyone saw the government shut its doors at midnight on Oct. 1, but few realize the Farm Bill expired at the same moment, halting the vital programs it supports.
This bureaucratic paralysis now threatens more than 2.6 million acres enrolled in CRP across South Dakota, impacting over 14,000 farms and ranches and jeopardizing $145 million in conservation payments annually. With CRP unable to enroll new acres or pay landowners, rural livelihoods and our state’s hunting economy hang in the balance. Every fall, hunters drive $680 million into South Dakota’s economy, an investment built on strong partnerships between private landowners and USDA programs.
What the government shutdown means for agriculture agencies

Yes, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act boosted long-term USDA funding, and leaders like Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota, deserve thanks for advancing conservation. But these gains mean nothing if Congress fails to act now. This shutdown only compounds what was already a tough year for agriculture: Corn prices have dropped to their lowest level since 2020, and farmers face mounting uncertainty with every day of delay.
Farmers and ranchers need a resolution to the shutdown and a Farm Bill that strengthens voluntary conservation, maintains local input on conservation decisions and rewards stewardship. They also need reinstated contract payments to prevent further economic damage.
Washington could prioritize farmers, ranchers and the future of conservation by:

Reinstating mandatory CRP and conservation program payments.
Passing a Farm Bill that funds and improves voluntary, incentive-based conservation programs.
Ensuring CRP is reauthorized, expanded and enhanced for the benefit of wildlife, rural communities, and agricultural producers statewide.

South Dakota’s agricultural producers and sporting tradition cannot afford more empty promises. They need Congress to do its job.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island’s first community of tiny shelters for the homeless will remain in operation for at least through the end of September 2026.
The State Properties Committee on Tuesday unanimously approved a new lease with the nonprofit responsible for managing ECHO Village, the Pallet shelter village near Route 146 in Providence that opened in February after sitting vacant for more than a year.
Committee members spent about 10 minutes discussing the lease, with their main question focused on the structural lifespan of the tiny cabins, which were assembled on the 4-acre site on Victor Street in 2024. That also appeared to be an open question for the Office of Executive Housing staffer presenting to the panel.
“People have only been living in them since February,” Peter Asen, director of housing production and preservation, told the committee. “I think they’re going to last as long as we hope to have a need for this type of project — we don’t have any indication at this point that they aren’t lasting.”
But that information should be made clear under provisions of the new lease, which call for House of Hope to conduct routine maintenance and inspections of shelters’ HVAC and fire suppression systems, along with maintaining records of those activities.
There are 45 cabins in all, each measuring 70 square feet. 
An update Asen could provide the committee was that since ECHO Village opened, no major issues have arisen — save for a “small number of participants” who were asked to leave because of behavior issues.
Police were called twice to ECHO Village, Kristy dosReis, spokesperson for the Providence Police Department, wrote in an email to Rhode Island Current. One visit was for a well-being check and another time for a reported overdose. 
“In the case of the overdose, officers were cancelled while en route,” dosReis said.
Laura Jaworski, executive director of House of Hope, acknowledged some “growing pains” during ECHO Village’s first eight months, including clarifying who’s responsible for damages, establishing relationships with first responders, and speeding up the turnaround time to prepare cabins for new residents.
The expected length of the stay for residents is around nine months, but could vary depending on each individual’s health and other circumstances and whether there is a more permanent place for them to stay, Jaworski previously told Rhode Island Current.
While staff continue to adjust, Jaworski said she believes ECHO Village has been a quick success, noting that seven individuals have since moved into permanent housing. As of mid-October, she said 70 people have spent time inside a cabin.
“These are folks who have been homeless for very long periods of time, with multiple challenges that they’re handling,” she said. “All in all, I think for a new program, a new model, we are successful.”

The developer, J.W. McCurdy, announced this change after residents and the owners of a nearby farm vocally opposed the plans, and fought rezoning efforts before the Lafayette County Board of Supervisors. 
“Our (original) site on (Mississippi) 328 is an outstanding industrial node, and that’s not changing, but I’m also happy to change for the sake of peace,” McCurdy said in a press release, adding, “We’re going to make this work, just in a new location.”
During public meetings over the last month, locals showed up in droves to protest the proposal to rezone the land from agricultural to heavy industrial use, arguing the plant would threaten the sanctity of neighboring Falkner Farms and the “bucolic” nature of Taylor. 
The Lafayette County Board of Supervisors was slated to vote on the proposal on Monday. During an Oct. 20 meeting, the board had tabled its decision after hours of public comments. 
Agriculture Commissioner Andy Gipson visited the Falkner family last week and shared photos of the visit on social media. In a letter to the Lafayette County Board of Supervisors, Gipson asked the Board “to consider the agricultural impact the zoning change could have.”
A letter from Commissioner of Agriculture & Commerce Andy Gipson to Lafayette County officials.
McCurdy maintains the site on Mississippi 328 is “still superior,” and that there are increased costs and risks to the new location. He and others have stated that the utility capacity of the industrial park has been a challenge. 
McCurdy, whose company JWM Development LLC owns the land along the highway, said he’s still planning projects there.
“Our neighbors all along said that all they objected to was an asphalt plant, not development in general,” he said. “So we are full speed ahead to bring new commercial, manufacturing, and industrial tenants to the county.” 
Taylor residents were concerned the development would increase runoff into the Yocona River, produce air pollution and increase noise and traffic in the quiet area.
 They’ve also spoken to how recent expansion around Oxford has started to erode the rural identity of surrounding areas.
But McCurdy and some county officials said the area’s recent growth has caused a higher demand for asphalt to pave roads and build subdivisions.
District 5 Supervisor Greg Bynum said, “(McCurdy) has been patient and professional throughout all this, and, knowing him, I’m not at all surprised that he would sacrifice all his work for the betterment of the county.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/22103752/MG_8906.jpg,,,2025-10-28 18:01:51.280483

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)A U.S. Supreme Court case scrutinized for its potential impact on Black voters and congressional redistricting could also have consequences for the voting rights of Native Americans, according to advocates in South Dakota.
The pending case, Louisiana v. Callais, is a challenge to the legality of a majority-Black congressional district. The court is using the case to determine whether Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act remains constitutional. The section prohibits voting laws or procedures that result in a denial or abridgement of voting rights due to a person’s “race or color” or membership in a language minority.

Supreme Court seems open to limiting key voting protections in Louisiana redistricting case
Voting Rights Act supporters rally outside Supreme Court as justices hear Louisiana case



During arguments earlier this month, lawyers for Louisiana and the Trump administration said the consideration of race in the redistricting process violates constitutional requirements to treat all people equally.
Rosebud Sioux Tribe member OJ Semans, co-executive director of the South Dakota-based Four Directions voting rights group, said advocates for Native American voters would not have won any voting rights lawsuits in South Dakota without Section 2. They’ve used its protections to win better registration services in closer proximity to Native American voters, and to force redrawn county and state voting districts with more equitable representation for Native Americans (Section 2 doesn’t impact congressional districts in South Dakota, because its low population means it has only one member of the U.S. House who represents the entire state). 
“In the past 10 years, I think Native Americans have filed more civil rights lawsuits on voting than any other organization or race,” Semans said. “And they have continually been able to win victories that would provide equality for Natives throughout Indian Country.” 
Four Directions consultant Bret Healy, a former executive director of the South Dakota Democratic Party, warned that if the court undermines the law, Republican lawmakers could redraw legislative districts in South Dakota to disadvantage Native American voters, who’ve traditionally leaned Democratic. He said lawmakers “can go back to just making at-large districts where the white vote totally overwhelms by 70 to 30, 80 to 20 margins.”

(Photo courtesy of PAcast)On Monday evening, over a dozen Pennsylvanians were recognized at the Governor’s Residence for their contributions to their respective communities.
The honorees, eight people and two groups, were awarded the Governor’s Keystone Awards during the second State Dinner.
Gov. Josh Shapiro, who delivered remarks at the event, said the dinner was “very special.”
“This is the first dinner we are hosting here at the Governor’s Residence since the attack in April, and we wanted to be purposeful about all of you being the first guests that we invited back for this event,” Shapiro said. “We wanted this night to be special, and we are so honored that you are gracing us with your presence.”

In April, the Governor’s Residence was firebombed as Shapiro, his family and guests slept inside, hours after celebrating Passover. Cody Balmer, the Harrisburg man accused of the attack, pleaded guilty earlier this month to attempted murder with a sentencing enhancement for terrorism.
“You know, after the attack, the First Lady and I really wanted to get this building repaired as quickly as possible, so that we could open it back up to be a place that all Pennsylvanians could come,” Shapiro said. “We want this place to be warm and welcoming for all.”
The recipients of the Keystone Award were from a wide array of backgrounds.
They included Jared Quinteros of Pittsburgh. He’s an artist who teaches art therapy workshops to newly-injured patients at UPMC Mercy and works with the Rebuild Together Foundation. In the summer of 2021, Quinteros and his wife, Kara Leo, were walking a trail when a tree limb fell on them. His wife was killed in the accident.

 After the tragedy, Jared Quinteros, who now uses a wheelchair, created the KARA program, named after his wife, which helps individuals returning home after spinal cord injuries make essential accessibility improvements and rebuild their lives.
Dr. Rebecca Ahrens-Nicklas and Dr. Kiran Musunuru were also honored for co-developing the first-ever personalized gene editing therapy for a child with severe carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
“The collaborative, multidisciplinary work that originated here in the state of Pennsylvania allowed us to translate this novel approach to rare disease therapy into the clinic,” Aherns-Nicklas said. “We now have the incredible responsibility of expanding this work to benefit as many other patients with rare, complex and difficult-to-treat diseases as possible.”
This finding, according to Penn Medicine, could “provide a pathway for gene editing technology to be successfully adapted to treat individuals with rare diseases for whom no medical treatments are available.”
Several students from Kensington Health Sciences Academy in Philadelphia were among those recognized, for their effort teaming up with their teachers to create the DreamEscape Library, a student-run lending library and mobile book cart.
“Look in these times of chaos and of darkness and challenges, I think each and every one of you are the people who are bringing light into our communities,” Shapiro said. “You are the people who are inspiring me, inspiring Lori, inspiring our fellow Pennsylvanians, and that is why we wanted to honor you here this evening.”

Shapiro says he thinks the governor’s residence is secure, following renovations and security upgrades
The Governor’s Residence has hosted some events since the arson attack, but the administration pointed to Monday’s dinner as a milestone as the first dinner event hosted following the attack.
“It’s really emotional,” Shapiro told the Capital-Star. “This space exists, in my mind, to bring different Pennsylvanians together to find common ground and to celebrate one another in our Commonwealth, and the way Lori reimagined the state dinner, not as some insidery thing, but a place to bring people who are making a difference in their community together.”
The State Dining Room and Reception Area have been fully restored, according to a release from the governor’s office.

“There’s a few items that have yet to come back in, but I would say that the inside is probably 98% there,” he said.
Outside of the residence, Shapiro said, they have included a lot of security updates and said “hopefully by the end of the calendar year” everything will be complete.
The changes Shapiro highlighted with the Capital-Star include adding a Pennsylvania State Police (PSP) unit patrolling the grounds of the residence, as well as a 10-foot brick wall surrounding the property. Prior to the attack, there was only a 6-foot iron fence.
“And there’s a significant amount of technology that’s been installed,” Shapiro said. “Obviously not going to get into the specifics there, but I think the facility is secure now, not just for our family, but for the staff and the visitors that come here.”
Spotlight PA reported on Friday that State Police Commissioner Christopher Paris and Department of General Services Secretary Reggie McNeill wrote a letter to legislative leaders and administration officials that said the safety upgrades at the governor’s official residence totaled $32.3 million, including $8 million with windows that are bullet-and-shatterproof. The letter also mentioned that roughly $1 million in security upgrades, also paid by taxpayers, are for Shapiro’s private home in Montgomery County.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/28539_gov_stateDinner_JF_027-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 18:01:51.280483

Photo by Jill WilliamsThe Georgia Board of Natural Resources has voted in favor of a plan to increase parking pass rates at state parks, and the Department of Natural Resources could be considering further cost hikes.
The new changes, which include surge pricing for campsites, cabins and yurts as well as golf courses, could go into effect next year without a board vote. The agency’s external affairs manager Haley Chafin said Tuesday that leadership does not currently have a timeline to implement the price changes.
Parking fee bump approved
Under the plan the board approved Tuesday, the daily per vehicle fee would increase from $5 to $10 and an annual pass would go from $50 to $70. It is the first parking fee price increase since 2009.
Veterans would see a daily pass increase from $3.75 to $7.50 and an annual pass go from $37.50 to $52.50.
Sherman Neal II, deputy director of the Sierra Club of Georgia’s Military Outdoors program, criticized the fee increase for servicemembers.
Neal said Georgia should join states like Alabama in offering free admission to veterans and active duty military. He said half of the servicemembers in Georgia earn less than $33,000 per year and that making it easier for them to visit state parks would honor their commitment to the country.
“I understand the necessity to address deferred maintenance and steward the land,” Neal said. “However, we must reject shifting the burden onto Georgians. Access to nature saves lives – we should dedicate resources towards studying the positive health outcomes associated with time spent outdoors and maintain focus on removing barriers to enjoying public lands – not emplacing new obstacles.”
Fayette Democratic state Sen. Kenya Wicks introduced a bill this year that would waive park fees for service members. That bill did not move forward, but it remains in play for next year’s legislative session.
Damon Kirkpatrick, president and CEO of Friends of Georgia State Parks and Historic Sites, said raising park prices isn’t comfortable, but maintenance isn’t free and money doesn’t go as far as it did in 2009.
“At Friends, we understand how important it is to keep our parks affordable and accessible for everyone, but we also recognize that the cost of caring for them has risen dramatically in the past 16 years,” he said. “The park pass remains the only dedicated source of funding for maintenance and repair in our park system, and while new capital projects like the beautiful visitor center at Vogel State Park are changing the landscape of our parks, the backlog of maintenance and repair continues to grow.”
Before the unanimous vote, board member Duncan Johnson praised the state parks for operating for so many years without a fee increase.
“I have been here 11 years, and out of those 11 years, I have always fought increases in any fees because I don’t like imposing them, but I also think we’ve gone 16 years without any increase, and I’d like to propose a motion for this, but I’d also like to consider going another 16 years after this,” he said.
Accommodations and golf
But it could be a little sooner than that for Georgia parkgoers to start paying more for camping spots or golfing.
In a recent audit of the Department of Natural Resources State Parks and Historic Sites Division the state auditor’s office found the division could take steps to increase revenue, including by increasing parking fees as well as charging more for campsites or tee times based on demand.
The department agreed to those recommendations with a proposed implementation date of Jan. 1, but prices are not expected to change that day, Chafin said.
Georgia’s parks already charge different rates based on demand to a limited extent, but the auditors pointed to states like South Carolina and Alabama, which use reservation systems that automatically increase rates based on occupancy.
The auditors gave examples including charging more for cottages during the summer, when demand is high, and less in the winter when occupancy drops. Campers looking for a primo site, like one on the water, should prepare for the possibility of forking over more money as the auditors recommend increasing the variation between campsites based on desirability as well as demand.
The parks division agreed with the auditors’ recommendation to increase pricing variation but noted that “there is a desire to maintain consistency in prices across the system and ensure that the parks are accessible to the public,” according to the report. “As a result, any methodology used to create variation in accommodation pricing should balance revenue maximization with the division’s mission of serving the public good.”
The auditors also recommended fee increases at state park golf courses, including raising the price of annual memberships and boosting the cost of green fees for busier times like weekend mornings to be closer to other public golf courses, as well as instituting no-show fees for golfers who book a tee time but don’t show.

On Oct. 28, 2025, the New Mexico Foundation for Open Government sued the New Mexico Department of Public Safety, which includes State Police, alleging a pattern of delays or denials in media requests for public records. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)The New Mexico Foundation for Open Government announced Tuesday it is suing the state Department of Public Safety for what it calls a “pattern and practice” of delaying or denying news organizations’ access to public records.
In a suit filed in the First Judicial District court in Santa Fe, NMFOG alleges the department regularly deems simple requests “broad and burdensome,” a designation that enables the department to unnecessarily prolong production of the records far beyond the 15-day deadline that the state Inspection of Public Records Act imposes. 
The lawsuit details records requests to the agency that went unfulfilled for months, often related to records for pending criminal investigations, from news organizations including Searchlight New Mexico, Source New Mexico, the Rio Grande Sun and the Santa Fe New Mexican. NMFOG filed duplicate requests in most instances and reported that NM DPS offered various, allegedly illegal, reasons not to fulfill them, including claiming that the records NMFOG sought did not exist. 
In a response to Source New Mexico’s request for comment on the lawsuit, NM DPS spokesperson John Heil said Tuesday afternoon that the “department has not yet been served and cannot comment on pending litigation.”

Some of the records the news organizations requested included ones relating to an alleged assault at a state Children, Youth and Families Department facility. Other records related to the death of Rio Arriba County Sheriff Billy Merrifield. 
Based on the agency’s response to one of NMFOG’s IPRA requests, the foundation alleges, “DPS has a practice of claiming the request is overly broad and burdensome, so that it may continue to delay disclosure of records related to ongoing investigations.” Doing so circumvents a 2020 New Mexico Supreme Court, “Jones v. City of Albuquerque Police Department,” which established that an ongoing criminal investigation is not a reason to withhold public records.
In a statement accompanying the lawsuit, NMFOG Executive Director Christine Barber said DPS took 10 months to respond to the CYFD records request. 
“Without intervention by the Court, DPS will continue to violate the public’s right to access records of the state,” Barber said. 
The lawsuit asks a judge to order DPS to immediately satisfy any of the IPRA requests “in full,” as well as award any applicable damages and fees that IPRA allows.

The Kentucky Court of Appeals has rejected efforts by former Gov. Matt Bevin and his ex-wife, Glenna Bevin, to block their estranged son, Jonah Bevin, from intervening in the court case where their divorce agreement is pending.
The Bevins had appealed a  judge’s ruling in May that Jonah may intervene in their divorce settlement proceedings but an appeals court panel on Monday dismissed their claim as having been filed too soon.
The appeal may only be filed after the pending case in Jefferson Family Court is resolved, the appeals court said.
The decision means Jonah, 18, who was adopted by the Bevins at age 5 along with three other children from Ethiopia, may proceed with his claims in family court, said John Helmers Jr., one of his lawyers.
“We’re pleased that we’re going to have our day in court,” he said.
Jesse Mudd, Matt Bevin’s lawyer, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mark Dobbins, Glenna Bevins lawyer, declined to comment.

Jefferson Family Court Judge Angela Johnson also had rejected the Bevins’ efforts to keep their divorce settlement confidential, an order which was not appealed and remains in force, Helmers said.
Jonah has alleged his adoptive parents abandoned him at age 17 in a brutally abusive and now-closed Jamaican facility. He is seeking support and the right to protect his interests in any financial settlement by his wealthy adoptive parents as part of their divorce.
Conditions at Atlantis Leadership Academy, first reported last year in the Sunday Times of London, attracted international headlines after celebrity hotel heiress Paris Hilton flew to Jamaica in April to aid the youths as part of her advocacy work to reform what she calls the “troubled teen” industry that she says also victimized her. Jonah was among eight youths removed from the facility.
Dawn J. Post, a New York lawyer and child advocate who helped relocate Jonah and several other youths from the former Atlantis Leadership Academy  after it was closed by Jamaican child welfare authorities in 2024, said she was pleased by the appeals court ruling.
“However, we are deeply surprised and disappointed by how long it took to reach even this procedural step,” Post said in an email. “This case represents more than a legal delay; it reflects the ongoing failures of accountability that have defined the experience of too many abandoned adoptees, from adoptive parents to public agencies, that continues to cause profound harm, not just to one young man, but to many others like him who were and are left without support, oversight, or belonging.”
Even now, Post said, more than 160 youths remain housed in a different facility in Jamaica with little oversight and in the midst of a major hurricane that struck the island Tuesday.
Adopted. Abandoned. But not forgotten.

Jonah’s case had been “on hold” while the appeal was pending but Jonah is asking the judge to schedule a hearing now that the appeals court has ruled, his lawyers said in a court filing.
The Bevins have five biological children as well as four adoptees; all are adults except the youngest adopted child. Bevin, a conservative Christian and one-term Republican governor elected in 2015, ran on a campaign of promoting adoption and foster care, often citing his own family’s experience.
But Jonah, who has said he suffers from significant learning disabilities, has told the Kentucky Lantern he was mistreated by the Bevins and was sent to several out-of-state residential programs, starting at age 13. The last was the Jamaican facility where he said he and other youths were routinely beaten and abused.
For a time, he was placed in the custody of Jamaican child welfare authorities after the Bevins declined to arrange his return to the United States, his lawyers have alleged in court.
His lawyers also have argued he is entitled to educational support for help with learning disabilities and efforts to obtain a valid high school degree. Jonah has said he received no education at the Jamaican facility and his lawyers have said his online degree from an unaccredited program is a “sham.”
Post said she remains concerned about Jonah and the many other youths she has worked with from failed adoptions, often winding up in loosely regulated facilities.
“Jonah has been working to find his footing amid years of abandonment and instability,” she said in an email. “Each delay in the legal process makes that work harder. The absence of timely accountability sends a painful message.”

DemasRight to Life of Michigan, alongside several parents, have filed an appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit to their lawsuit against Gov. Whitmer, Attorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. 
The suit in the appellate court seeks to argue that Proposal 3, which was a ballot initiative in 2022 that enshrined reproductive freedoms, including the right to an abortion, in the Michigan State Constitution, “threatens parental rights related to a minor child’s decision to seek an abortion,” according to a press release from Right to Life of Michigan. 
The case was first filed in November 2023 in federal district court in the Western District of Michigan, where Judge Paul Maloney dismissed the case on Sept. 30, stating in his opinion that “The court finds that Plaintiffs lack standing.”
The initial lawsuit sought to completely overturn Proposal 3, arguing that it violated multiple clauses of the U.S. Constitution, including the First and Fourteenth Amendments. 
The full text of the appeal has not yet been filed with the court, but Right to Life characterized it as a “narrow appeal” specifically centered on the issue of parental rights. They cite the Fourteenth Amendment specifically as protecting parental rights. 
The parents joining the appeal are identified as Celina Asberg, Grace Fisher, John Hubbard and Andrea Smith, all of whom were plaintiffs in the initial case. Not all of the parties in the initial case have joined the appeal. 
“Today’s appeal seeks to protect parental rights, which are now at unprecedented risk due to Proposal 3’s broad language,” said said Amber Roseboom, the president of Right to Life of Michigan in the group’s press release. “It shocks the conscience to see the rampant disregard for the role of parents in helping guide their children through decisions that will impact their mental and physical wellbeing, which is undeniably the case with abortion.” 
“The threat to parental consent for abortion would jeopardize a critical, long-standing safeguard in protecting children from harm,” Roseboom continued.

Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderIt continues to be a busy year for off-cycle state legislative races in Georgia.
An Athens-area Georgia lawmaker announced Tuesday that he is stepping down from the seat he has held since 2018, creating a new vacancy in the state House.
State Rep. Marcus Wiedower, a Watkinsville Republican, said he is stepping down to focus more on his expanding work as vice president of external affairs at Hillpointe, a real estate development and investment management firm.
“This decision has been incredibly difficult. Serving in the Georgia General Assembly has been one of the greatest honors of my life,” Wiedower said in a statement. “I’m deeply grateful for the trust placed in me by my constituents and colleagues.”
Wiedower served as chairman of a budget subcommittee focused on general government spending. He is also currently leading a study committee that is looking at the impacts of expanding gambling in Georgia, which is a thorny issue that has eluded proponents for years. 
A special election for House District 121 has not yet been called. It’s a conservative-leaning district that backed Wiedower over his Democratic opponent last year with 61% of the vote. The Democrat who ran last year, Eric Gisler, announced in August that he planned to run again.
The district includes parts of Oconee and Clarke counties.
Special election called after the death of a Cherokee County lawmaker
A special election to elect a new state representative for a House seat in a northern exurb of Atlanta has been set for Dec. 9. If a runoff is needed, it will happen on Jan. 6.
The vacancy for the Cherokee County-based district was created after Canton Republican Rep. Mandi Ballinger died earlier this month following a long battle with cancer. Ballinger, who chaired the House Judiciary Juvenile Committee, had represented the district for more than a decade.
Candidates can qualify to run for the House District 23 election from Nov. 3 – 5.
The election was set as early voting is underway for two other special elections in metro Atlanta.
Voters in Gwinnett County are electing a replacement for state Rep. Shelly Hutchinson, a Snellville Democrat who stepped down last month. Two Democrats, Muhammad Akbar Ali and Marqus A. Cole, and one Republican, Jamie Parker, are running for the seat. The race is on the Nov. 4 ballot alongside a pair of closely watched contests for the Georgia Public Service Commission.
Another special election is being held to fill an Atlanta-based Senate seat. Former state Sen. Jason Esteves stepped down after one term to run for governor next year. Six candidates are competing for that seat.
In August, a special election grabbed national headlines when a Democrat was the top vote-getter in a race to replace former Alpharetta Republican Sen. Brandon Beach, who is now serving as U.S. Treasurer. Republican Sen. Jason Dickerson emerged the winner of a hard-fought September runoff.
Next year, all House and Senate seats, including those won in this year’s special elections, will be on the ballot.

(Getty Images)Premiums for health insurance plans purchased through the New Jersey marketplace will rise 174% next year because of the expiration of enhanced federal subsidies, according to the state Department of Banking and Insurance.
The staggering price hikes, which would come alongside market-driven rate increases of 17%, would kick in after the enhanced premium tax credits approved during the pandemic expire at the start of 2026.
“Consumers will soon be shopping and comparing health plans, and without these enhanced tax credits, they will be confronted by startlingly higher prices for coverage. We are significantly concerned that many households will be forced to choose plans with lesser coverage or choose no coverage at all as a result,” said the department’s commissioner, Justine Zimmerman.
Andy Kim likens Donald Trump’s shutdown behavior to ‘mafia tactics’

The news comes as the federal government shutdown stretched into its 28th day on Tuesday, with congressional leaders at odds over whether the tax credits should continue. Democrats have sought to use a continuing resolution that would restore funding to the government to extend the credits. Republican officials have so far largely declined to negotiate, though they lack the Senate votes to advance a funding measure on their own absent changes to the chamber’s rules, which require a 60-vote majority for continuing resolutions.
The Department of Banking and Insurance said new analysis showed the subsidies’ expiration would spike premiums for all individuals enrolled in plans traded on Get Covered NJ, New Jersey’s health insurance exchange, by 174%, adding more than $2,780 to premiums annually.
Individuals receiving financial assistance to subscribe to an exchange-traded plan — that’s 91% of enrollees who purchase health insurance through Get Covered NJ — would see a 163% increase, with rates rising by $1,850 on average.
“For the upcoming plan year, it is essential for all consumers to carefully shop and compare health plans to secure coverage that best meets their needs and budgets,” Zimmerman said.
The impact will be broad. More than 510,000 New Jerseyans are enrolled in plans obtained through the state’s marketplace, and more than 466,000 of those receive the enhanced subsidies, the department said.
Overall, New Jersey expects to lose more than $500 million in federal premium assistance, state officials said. New Jersey will still provide $215 million in state assistance.
The increases could be far greater for families and individuals who are risky to insure.
Rates for a family of four in Ocean County with an annual income of $131,000 could see their premiums rise by $26,000 annually as a result of the expiring subsidies, the department said.
A Middlesex County couple in their early 60s with $94,000 in income could see an increase of more than $22,000, the department said.
At 28 days, the shutdown is already the second-longest in U.S. history. The only shutdown to last longer occurred during President Donald Trump’s first term in 2018 and 2019, and lasted for 35 days.

(Photo by Preston Keres/USDA)U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley called for the end of countervailing duties on phosphate fertilizer during a Senate committee hearing Tuesday on competition in fertilizer and seed industries. 
Farmers, retailers and politicians from both sides of the aisle agreed that consolidation in the agricultural industry is making it more difficult for farmers to make ends meet, especially when they are also faced with global trade opposition. 
Grassley, chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, said farmers  “don’t have a real choice, let alone a fair price” in the seed and fertilizer industries.                      
Grassley said one solution would be to pass the Fertilizer Research Act he proposed with Sen. Joni Ernst, also a Republican from Iowa, and Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis. The bill would require the U.S. Department of Agriculture to conduct a study on competition and pricing in the fertilizer industry. 
“Nobody here wants to punish innovation,” Grassley said. “We want better yields, healthier soils, quality products, and we’ve been vastly improving in that area for the last 40 years. But we also want competition that’s fair, transparent and local competition that a farmer can actually express when he or she sits down to make a purchase.” 
While the hearing focused on consolidation in the seed, fertilizer and pesticide industries, Grassley said the Trump administration could do something “right now” to ease the burden on farmers by lowering the import tariffs imposed on Moroccan phosphate. 
These tariffs were raised in 2024 during the Biden administration. Grassley said the tariffs on the key farming inputs have “hurt farmers.”
“I’m calling on the Trump administration to help American farmers and get rid of that phosphate duty,” Grassley said. 
Sen. Cory Booker, a Democratic committee member from New Jersey, said farmers are in a “crisis” that has led to “a loss of American family farmers in a way that could be described as an extinction-level event.” 
Booker said the commercial seed industry has prohibited farmers from the “fundamental right” of saving seeds. He said the consolidated industry instead locks them into buying “patented seeds” that are “bundled with their own pesticides by corporations.” 
“This is corporate capture of the very first link in our food chain, and when you control the seed, you have unjust control over farmers, and ultimately you control the food,” Booker said. 
Seeds are often modified to be resistant to certain pesticides. For example, “Roundup ready” seeds, produced by Monsanto, now Bayer, were resistant to the herbicide Roundup, which Bayer also manufactures. The product allowed farmers to plant a crop and spray for weed without harming the crop. It also meant that farmers bought both seeds and pesticides from the company.
Consolidation 
According to Diana Moss, the vice president and director of competition policy for the Progressive Policy Institute, who spoke as a panelist at the hearing, seed and fertilizer markets are consolidated to just a few big players. 
A USDA study on concentration in the agricultural marketplace found that from 2018-2020, two seed companies accounted for 72% of planted corn acres and 66% of planted soybean acres. A Texas A&M University study found that the four-firm concentration for nitrogen fertilizer in the U.S. was 77%, while potash and phosphate fertilizer markets are 100% controlled by the top four companies. 
“These are big numbers,” Moss said. “Highly concentrated markets are far more conducive to anticompetitive coordination, rather than the hard-nosed competition that lowers prices, lowers licensing fees, tech fees and royalty rates.” 
Moss said “all of this puts the squeeze on farmers’ margins” and said the role of antitrust laws has been “less than exemplary” in regulating ag biotech. 
Iowa farmers like Noah Coppess, another panelist at hearing, are feeling that squeeze. Coppess said phosphate, for example, has become a “bare minimum usage” fertilizer on his farm. The fertilizer is so costly, it’s close to a negative return on Coppess’ farm.
FTC commissioner talks consolidation, right to repair with Iowa farmers

Coppess has implemented tools like advanced tractor imaging that helps to reduce the use of fertilizer and pesticide inputs by specifically targeting the areas of a field that need it most. But, he said, that same technology charges him a usage fee on the fields that he doesn’t use it on, which almost equates to what he saves in inputs. 
Coppess said the consolidation in the seed market has meant his farm has planted the same soybean variety for the past five years, “due to lack of competitive options.” 
“It’s time to take a look into these areas and assess what bargaining strength the farmer has,” Coppess said. 
The U.S. accounts for less than 10% of total global fertilizer production, according to USDA data. 
Corey Rosenbusch, president of The Fertilizer Institute, said “fertilizer is a globally traded commodity subject to fierce global competition and supply and demand.” 
Rosenbusch went on to say the nature of the fertilizer market, and the U.S.’s small role in production, means that current geopolitics create difficulties and high costs for importing fertilizer. At the same time, he said demand for fertilizer has increased as crops, like corn, which have a high fertilizer demand, have been planted more.
“We recognize how challenging and frustrating that this must be for our customer partners at a time when they’re experiencing very low prices for the crops that they grow,” Rosenbusch said. 
He said while the fertilizer industry cannot “directly influence prices” of a globally traded commodity, a bolstered domestic fertilizer supply would help U.S. farmers. 
John Latham, president of Latham Hi-Tech Seeds, an independent seed company in Alexander, Iowa, said operations like his have been priced out of the market by the big seed companies. 
Latham said seed technology costs are increasing not just on the “newest and latest” seed technologies, but also on older seed technologies, some of which have already come off of their patents. 
Latham said the seed royalties, or the amount a seller has to pay for the seed technology, has increased significantly over the past five years. According to Latham, about 70% of the cost of a seed bag goes to royalties now, compared to 42% of the bag five years prior. 
“Imagine being in a business where the technology royalty continues to increase even after it goes off patent, seed prices increase even when commodity prices are low and farmers can’t even break even,” Latham said. “These are the unfortunate realities of an independent seed company in an industry without competition or oversight.”
Iowa delegates urge administration to prioritize trade deal for soybean farmers 

Seed companies research and create seeds that will be resistant to certain pesticides, or be more resilient to pests like soybean cyst nematodes or plant diseases. 
Andrew LaVigne, president and CEO of the American Seed Trade Association, said plant breeding and seed creation can take close to a decade.
LaVigne said through this process, a seed may cross six or seven different borders, and be subject to individual tariffs, before it makes it to a farmer. He said this increases the cost and time it takes to bring new seed technology to the market. 
He suggested Congress reform some regulations to ensure the “rapid pace of scientific innovation is not hampered.” LaVigne also said increased investment in agricultural research at land grant institutions and other research institutions would help lower the costs of seed technologies. 
“We know that farmers are taking this economic challenge head on to continue feeding, fueling and clothing the world,” LaVigne said. “Seed producers are weathering it alongside them while working to deliver the high quality, professionally produced seed U.S. farmers expect, season after season.” 
High inputs alongside trade disruptions 
Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, ranking member on the committee, spoke about the “overall state of the farm economy” as China turns away from the U.S. and instead to Brazil and Argentina for soybeans in response to U.S. tariffs. 
Durbin said China is “playing the long game at the expense of American farmers” at the same time that farmers are grappling with the increasing cost of doing business. 
“All farmers need help but no amount of financial relief can replace lost markets, especially if relief payments simply go from farmers straight to the handful of seed, fertilizer and equipment companies,” Durbin said. 
Durbin said to Rosenbusch during questioning that the prices in the consolidated fertilizer industry are “killing” farmers. 
“We need the farmers to succeed,” Rosenbusch responded. “They need access to fertilizer and those are all driven by global supply and demand. A lot of these geopolitical events and reliance on some of that foreign supply coming in has a huge impact on that.” 
American Soybean Association President Caleb Ragland said the significant challenges facing agriculture are evident by farmers’ “rapidly plunging margins.”
“The high cost of farm production has eroded the financial safety net of soybean farmers and has made it harder to weather trade related market losses this year,” Ragland said.
Ragland called for finalization of key renewable fuel tax credits, which the industry believes will help boost domestic soybean demand, and for the removal of tariffs with China that are currently impacting soybean farmers’ largest market.
President Donald Trump has said he expects to reach a trade agreement with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on Thursday. The agreement is expected to include trade deals for soybeans, among other agricultural commodities.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-28 21:16:45+00:00,CT Mirror,Towing companies say DMV proposed rate increases aren’t enough,Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/28/ct-towing-costs-dmv-proposal/,The cost of having a car towed from a private lot or by police for a parking violation would rise 4.5% annually for the next thee years.,"The cost of having a car towed from a private parking lot or by police for a parking violation will increase by 13.5% over the next three years under rates proposed Tuesday by the state Department of Motor Vehicles, but towing company officials say it’s not enough.
An 87-page proposal calls for a 4.5% flat rate increase in each of the next three years for any nonconsensual tows, which includes tows from private property or for trespass, and for police-ordered tows such as for a parking violation or an abandoned vehicle on the highway.
The hearing Tuesday at the state Capitol was before attorney Steven Baron, a per diem contractor hired by the state. It was expected to last all day but was over after only about two hours. Several towing companies complained they had no notice of the hearing or a chance to prepare for it. Baron said written testimony can be submitted for two more weeks.
While the DMV proposed raising the flat fee for towing, it again recommended that storage rates or the daily amount towing companies can charge to keep the vehicles on their lots will remain unchanged, an issue that angered several towing company officials.
“I can tell you we don’t want the cars. We’re willing to work with people to give their cars back, but the scales can’t be tipped too far,” said Paul Hilario, owner of Hilario’s towing based in Danbury.
“The problem is, if you don’t strike a balance between protecting the public and protecting the towers that do the work and protecting the property owners, you’re not going to have participation,” Hilario said, adding towing companies “will focus their business efforts on other things.”
Several towing officials also complained that they weren’t aware of the agency’s proposed rate increases until DMV staff attorney David Cardone made his presentation.  
During the hearing, several people mentioned the new law passed last session overhauling the state’s more than 100-year-old towing statute. Legislators passed the new law after a series of stories by The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica that revealed that towing companies could seek permission from the DMV to sell someone’s vehicle after 15 days, one of the shortest time periods in the country.
The series highlighted how predatory towing companies doing private property or trespass tows were affecting low-income residents who in many cases couldn’t afford the fees to get their cars back.
Cardone testified that the new rates focused on “light duty” vehicles under 20 feet long because that’s what most consumers are driving.
“Since the cost of the nonconsensual trespass tow is borne by the consumer, an increase in storage rates may have the greatest  impact on a segment of the population that can least afford to absorb an increase,” Cardone said.
The only person to speak who was not affiliated with a towing company was attorney Rafie Podolsky, a consumer advocate who is also a member of a task force created by the new law that is currently reviewing a wide range of towing proposals.
Podolsky told Baron that the statute “is to protect consumers, and so it’s important in any rate analysis that the department does, that it approaches it from that angle.”
“Storage rates continue to rise and rise and rise so that if you don’t have quick cash in order to bail your car out, that dollar amount is going to keep going up while you’re scrounging around trying to find more money,” Podolsky said.
The new law extends the time before a towing company can sell a car to 30 days. It also requires them to accept other forms of payment besides cash, to accommodate people who want to get their cars back after-hours, especially on weekends, and requires them to allow people to pay a drop fee to get their car back if they arrive before it is towed from a property.
Under the flat rate increase, the cost of having a car towed would increase to $130.63 in the first year, $136.51 for the second year, and $142.56 for the third year, Cardone said.
The DMV is also proposing include a drop fee of $50, a new charge implemented because of the new legislation. Cardone said towing companies previously were not required to release the vehicle should someone arrive on scene was it was being “hooked up,” but under the new law they must release the vehicle.
The DMV also proposes an after-hours redemption fee of $50 to cover labor costs. The new statute requires tow companies to be available at all times with proper notice to allow someone to get their car back, especially on weekends. The new fee would cover the costs of an employee having to go to the tow yard to release the vehicle.
Another proposal would increase mileage charges to $6.65 per mile to tow the vehicle back to their lots. The previous rate was $5.65 a mile. The new statute only allows towing companies to charge for a maximum of 13 miles, capping mileage costs at $86.45 under the new plan.
Several towing company officials said the agency needs to do a better job of making a distinction between police tows or highway accident tows, which are also considered nonconsensual tows and private property tows. 
They argued the accident tows or highway tows can be extremely expensive and require large equipment in cases of vehicle fires or accidents involving tractor trailers. 
One official proposed a far higher rate increase than DMV.
Michael Festa, owner of MyHoopty of Watertown, said his new organization called ACT or Association of Connecticut Towers was seeking a 75% increase in towing fees. Festa said ACT represents more than 250 towing companies across the state.
“It seems over the last two and a half years, people that own towing companies are actually paying to be towers,” Festa said. “The cost of doing business for nonconsensual tows, whether it’s private property or police tows, has quadrupled since our last rate increase.”
Festa cited skyrocketing insurance costs, workmen’s compensation costs, wage increases and equipment costs all rising as well as having to deal with more high technology cars that need special handling as reasons the 75% rate increase was justified.",,,,2025-10-28 17:17:02.061758

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) Virginia House Democrats on Tuesday afternoon released the long-awaited text of their proposed constitutional amendment that would allow the General Assembly to modify congressional districts mid-decade if another state redraws its own congressional map for political reasons.
The proposal, House Joint Resolution 6007, would amend Article II, Section 6 of the Virginia Constitution to authorize the legislature to “modify one or more congressional districts … in the event that any state … conducts a redistricting of such state’s congressional districts … for any purpose other than completion of the state’s decennial redistricting or as ordered by a court to remedy an unlawful or unconstitutional district map.”
Under a separate section added to the constitutional Schedule, that authority would apply only between Jan. 1, 2025, and Oct. 31, 2030, and only “in response to actions taken by another state” during that same period.
 Democrats call amendment a safeguard, not a power grab

Democrats say the measure preserves Virginia’s 2020 independent redistricting commission while giving the General Assembly a narrow option to respond if GOP-controlled states redraw their maps mid-decade and alter national representation.
Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, who is sponsoring the amendment, said the goal is to ensure that Virginians aren’t left disadvantaged by partisan remapping elsewhere in the country. 
Speaking to reporters Monday evening — nearly 24 hours before the fleshed out proposal was released — Willett said Democrats were responding to a growing national pattern of Republican-led legislatures redrawing maps mid-decade.
“I think we were absolutely empowered to be here,” Willett said. “This is an attack on democracy, and our hand’s been forced here. This is not our choice to be here, but with this kind of attack, we’ve got to respond.”
He emphasized that the proposal does not dismantle the state’s independent redistricting system.
“We are still going to have a commission,” he said. “This is going to give us options, and an option that could or could not be exercised — that question’s actually going to be left to the voters to vote in a referendum as to whether we’ll have redistricting or not.”
Willett said the amendment would maintain the decennial redistricting schedule spelled out in the state Constitution, while giving future lawmakers flexibility to revisit congressional boundaries.
“There’s a decennial process for that, so we will absolutely stick to that,” he said. “This is to create, again, not a mandate, but an option, in the interim, in between those decennial redistrictings to do something when there’s an extraordinary circumstance.”
 GOP, Miyares say Democrats missed the legal window for amendment

The amendment’s release followed hours of heated debate in the state Senate earlier on Tuesday, where Democrats and Republicans clashed over the timing and legality of advancing the proposal, introduced after  more than a million Virginians have already voted. 
Republicans have accused Democrats of trying to “ram through” a redistricting plan before voters go to the polls, while Democrats insist they are acting within their authority to safeguard fair representation.
Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares on Tuesday argued that the Democratic proposal violates the state Constitution’s intent that voters have a meaningful say before such measures move forward.
In a written opinion released Tuesday afternoon, Miyares said the proposed redistricting amendment cannot legally advance during the current election, citing the Virginia Constitution’s requirement for an intervening general election before such measures proceed.
Miyares said Article XII of the Constitution “clearly contemplates that there will be an intervening general election between the proposal of the amendment by one General Assembly and the referral of the amendment to the subsequent General Assembly.” 
On Monday, Del. Bobby Orrock, R-Spotsylvania, had made a similar case as Miyares, arguing on the House floor that Democrats have already missed the legal window to advance a proposed redistricting amendment this year, pointing to a section of Virginia law that governs how constitutional changes must be made public before an election.
Under Code § 30-13, the clerk of the House of Delegates is required to distribute proposed constitutional amendments to local courthouses for public posting and inspection no later than three months before the next general election for the House of Delegates. 
Orrock said that deadline has already passed, meaning the amendment could not be properly advertised in time for this November’s election.
 Parties trade blows over Miyares opinion

Democratic attorney general nominee Jay Jones sharply criticized Miyares’ opinion in a statement Tuesday, casting it as a partisan effort aligned with the president and proof that “when Donald Trump said he could always count on Jason Miyares, this is what he meant.” 
He accused the attorney general of “attempting to block a fair, legal process that would return power to Virginians,” adding that Miyares was “doubling down on his fealty to Donald Trump and his MAGA agenda.”
And Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, slammed the attorney general’s opinion on social media, accusing him of politicizing his office. 
In a post on X, Surovell wrote that Miyares “has committed attorney general malpractice, abused his office for partisan gain and been wrong about dozens of other legal calls in the last four years — so why not add more to the list as he wraps up?”
In contrast, House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, hailed the opinion as a clear validation of Republican concerns that Democrats are acting outside the bounds of Virginia law.
Kilgore, a seasoned lawyer and legislator, said that Miyares’ analysis “gives legal weight to the obvious, common-sense reading of Virginia law.” He noted in a statement that “hundreds of thousands of Virginians have already cast their ballots in this election, as the 45-day early voting period sought by Democrats is ongoing.”
“The current general election began on September 19 and will conclude on November 4 at 7 p.m.,” Kilgore said. “The effort to ram through a constitutional amendment during an election flies in the face of Virginia’s constitutional and code-mandated public notice requirements.”
 Spanberger backs keeping redistricting option open

The House Privileges and Elections Committee, chaired by Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, is expected to take up the amendment Wednesday afternoon. 
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger said Monday she would not oppose the General Assembly’s effort to advance the proposed measure.
In an interview aboard her campaign bus, Spanberger told The Associated Press that she supports Democrats “keeping alive the option” to respond to other states that redraw their congressional maps for partisan advantage. 
“While I like to plan for everything, on this one, because I’m on the bus tour, because we are eight days away (from Election Day), I’m like, I will let the General Assembly take this step, and then we’ll talk calendar issues later,” she said.
Her stance marks a subtle shift from comments she made in August, when she said she had “no plans to redistrict Virginia.”
Republican candidate for governor Winsome Earle-Sears denounced the proposed amendment outside the state Capitol Monday, lambasting it as an attempt to “dismantle the very independent redistricting commission that Virginia was voting for in a bipartisan majority.”
The issue has taken on new urgency for Democrats nationally. If the party were to gain just three more seats in the U.S. House, it could reclaim the majority, while Republican-led legislatures in states such as Texas, Missouri, and North Carolina have already approved new maps expanding GOP advantages.
If approved by both chambers, Virginia’s measure would still need to pass again in the next General Assembly session in 2026 and then win approval from voters in a statewide referendum before taking effect.
The Senate is scheduled to reconvene Wednesday at 11 a.m. to consider the procedural resolution that opened the door for redistricting-related measures during this special session.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-28 21:09:17+00:00,CT Mirror,"CT, other states sue Trump administration over SNAP suspension",Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/28/ct-snap-benefits-lawsuit/,"The plaintiffs, including CT, say the Trump administration’s suspension of SNAP benefits during the government shutdown is ‘contrary to law.’","Connecticut was among two dozen plaintiffs to sue the Trump administration Tuesday, asking a federal judge to order the administration to use $6 billion in available contingency funds to continue paying SNAP food assistance benefits during the partial shutdown of the federal government.
In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Boston, three governors and 22 attorneys general from blue states said the Trump administration’s suspension of SNAP ignores congressional directives and is “contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and an abuse of discretion.”
Unless the U.S. Department of Agriculture relents, or the court intercedes, the program that provides $72 million in monthly benefits to more than 360,000 recipients in Connecticut will be suspended Saturday. The lawsuit says the unprecedented suspension of SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, was a choice, not a necessity.
“They are weaponizing hunger to serve their political priorities. It is so wrong, unconscionable,” Attorney General William Tong said. “It is wrong to starve people so you can bring your political opponents to heel. It is wrong to starve people into submission, and that is what this president is doing.”
Tong, a Democrat, has now sued the Trump administration 38 times on behalf of Connecticut since the president returned to office in January and repeatedly asserted the ability to remake federal government and withhold spending, often at variance with congressional appropriations.
Quoting the nonpartisan watchdog agency, the Government Accountability Office, the latest lawsuit said, “SNAP is considered an appropriated entitlement, meaning that the government is legally required to make payments to those who meet the program requirements.”
On its web site, the USDA disagreed.
“Senate Democrats have now voted 12 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry. At this time, there will be no benefits issued November 01,” the USDA statement read.
The statement repeated the false assertion that the Democrats’ insistence on a budget deal that would continue tax credits that lower premiums for health policies under the Affordable Care Act is aimed at benefitting “illegal aliens.”
Immigrants in the country without legal status are barred from health coverage under the ACA.
U.S. Rep. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, joined Tong at the press conference announcing the lawsuit, where she underscored that the administration has the legal authority to keep alive a program that provides food to the working poor and struggling seniors.
“It is laughable to me that the president is resting on the premise that he can’t do this or he doesn’t have the authority, that it’s up to Congress to fix it,” Hayes said. “For the last 10 months, we’ve experienced a president running roughshod, doing whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted.”
Tong said his claim that starvation would result by the SNAP suspension was not hyperbole.
“I do mean starvation. I do mean that people will not be able to eat on a reliable basis. And if you’re sick, if you’re a child, if you’re a toddler, that has immediate and draconian implications for you and your health,” Tong said.
State Rep. Eleni Kavros DeGraw, D-Avon, who leads a General Assembly caucus on hunger issues, likened SNAP to a piece in the tabletop game, Jenga, where players try to remove blocks from a tower without causing its collapse.
“That is our food system. Our food system is like a game of Jenga,” she said. The removal of SNAP can cascade, harming grocers by taking billions out of the economy, she said.
Gov. Ned Lamont was not one of the three governors who joined the lawsuit as plaintiffs. All three are Democrats in states with Republican attorneys general. In Connecticut, Tong does not need gubernatorial authority to sue, but he said he consulted with Lamont and the governor supports the lawsuit.
On Monday, Lamont announced that Connecticut’s first steps to mitigate the SNAP suspension would be a $3 million emergency grant to the nonprofit Connecticut Foodshare and an outreach campaign informing recipients of their nearest food pantry.
The emergency step will not match the reach or efficiency of SNAP, which normally pays $72 million in monthly benefits through Electronic Benefit Transfer cards that can be used to purchase food at chain supermarkets and many corner stores and farmers’ markets.
The state is unable to simply put more money on the EBT cards already in the hands of SNAP recipients. The state screens for eligibility, but a federal vendor actually uses the state data to reload the cards.
Emily Byrne, executive director of the research and advocacy group, Connecticut Voices for Children, said she hoped Connecticut would use other benefit programs, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families to get food aid to those who need it.

Poop analysis shows huge variation in the diets of 16 western herds that include Wyoming’s Adobe Town, Green Mountain and McCullough Peaks herds.
The post Wyoming and the West’s wild horses are fleshy, opportunistic eaters, study finds appeared first on WyoFile .","Touring the West during the height of the COVID pandemic, Courtney Buchanan lived out of her truck, slept wherever she ended up and lived off propone-stove-cooked meals.
The then-University of Wyoming researcher was a nomad with a purpose, combing Western rangelands for free-roaming horses and the dung they left behind in search of clues about what they were eating and how they were faring. During surveys across seven Western states, she was struck by how the animals were consistently in good shape. She found the fattest horses in the Bighorn Basin, not far from home.
“The McCullough Peaks horses were in the best condition out of any of the horses I visited,” Buchanan told WyoFile. “It was wild to me, being out on the range, seeing them. Some of them are actually overweight — fat, chunky horses.”

The findings of Buchanan’s recently completed study help explain why. The University of Wyoming Ph.D. graduate examined the composition of horses’ diet, how much it varied by season, and how much it varied from one reach of the equines’ Western range to another. She found great variation on all fronts. 
“Our big takeaway was that in different environments and different places and in different seasons, they can really switch up what they’re doing and still be successful,” Buchanan said. “If they’re able to vary their diet that much and still maintain body condition, that sets them up for success.” 
The dietary flexibility, she said, could help explain why rangewide free-roaming horse and burro populations are “so high” — at roughly 73,000, they number nearly three times land managers’ goal.
Buchanan studied under UW ecology professor Jeff Beck, who’s researched free-roaming horses for a decade, including how the large herbivores are negatively influencing sage grouse survival rates. 
The study on diet and body condition, which looked at 16 herds in seven states, was recently published in the journal of Rangeland Ecology and Management. In their concluding remarks, Buchanan and Beck suggested that range managers could use their findings to help strike a balance between free-roaming horses, livestock and wildlife. 
“While studies in individual locations and a meta-analysis of western North America have indicated low potential for direct dietary competition with free-roaming horses and wild ungulates that consume woody species such as mule deer and pronghorn, our findings indicate that there may be more potential for dietary overlap and competition during winter,” they wrote.
Going into the study, the ecologists sought to test the common view that horses are true grazers. Old research from the 1970s had found that horses in most herds ate predominantly grass, Buchanan said, though there were some exceptions and herds that also concentrated on other plant families.

In the lab a half century later, Wyoming researchers tested the horse manure Buchanan collected using a technology called DNA metabarcoding. That technique narrowed the contents of the feces down to the plant family level, though results weren’t accurate enough to reliably predict the species, Beck said. 
Buchanan found that some herds fit the horses-are-grazers reputation. For example, the Adobe Town Herd — part of the historic “checkerboard” horse dispute — ate predominantly Poacae, the grass family, regardless of the season. But diets varied wildly and, in many places, grasses were less than half of horse diets, especially in the winter. 
“Each herd’s kind of doing a different thing,” Buchanan said. 
What wild horses eat varies dramatically, both seasonally and across their range, as illustrated in this graph of 16 herds’ diet composition. Summer is up top, winter is down low and the scientific names of plant families are on the legend at right. (Rangeland Ecology and Management)

The plump McCullough Peaks horses, for example, homed in on legumes in the summer, but come winter switched to eating more from the Chenopodiaceae family — spinach-adjacent plants — than anything else. 
The most slender horses that Buchanan encountered were in southern Utah’s North Hills Herd. There, animals ate mostly species from the grass family in the summer and winter, the study shows.
One limitation of the research, Buchanan said, was that the manure was collected over the course of a few days in any given herd. Findings about diet, in other words, are a snapshot in time. 
Regardless, that doesn’t detract from the UW researchers’ overall finding: “They’re eating lots of different stuff,” Buchanan said, “but staying in pretty good condition.”

(Courtesy image)Montana’s junior Sen. Tim Sheehy is the co-chair of a new bipartisan caucus launched this week focused on protecting the nation’s public lands. 
The Senate Stewardship Caucus has six inaugural members and is co-chaired by New Mexico Democrat Sen. Martin Heinrich. The caucus’ mission is to drive efforts to expand and protect access to public lands, “promote commonsense land management policies, and support economic growth in rural communities,” according to a news release from Sheehy’s office. 
“Public lands are a purely American institution, and all Americans can find common ground in working together to better manage, conserve, and steward these treasured landscapes while driving economic growth and supporting our resource and agricultural economies,” Sheehy said in a statement. “I’m proud to launch the Senate Stewardship Caucus with Senator Heinrich to safeguard the rights of Americans to hunt, fish, and recreate on our public lands and ensure we protect them for generations to come.”
The formation of the Stewardship Caucus follows a similar move in the House where earlier this year Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke launched the Public Lands Caucus, which Montana Rep. Troy Downing is a member of. All four members of Montana’s federal delegation are Republicans.  
Public lands have been a flashpoint in federal politics this year as resolutions and budget riders have included proposed sales and exchanges of public lands. 
Zinke, a former Secretary of the Interior during President Donald Trump’s first term, has positioned himself as a public lands champion. 
Sheehy drew on his professional work as CEO of Bridger Aerospace, a private aerial firefighting company, during his 2024 election against incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester to tout his own land management bona fides. He also previously served on the board of the The Property and Environment Research Center, a self-described property rights and environmental organization and focuses on what it calls “free market environmentalism.” 
The Stewardship Caucus launch event on Monday was hosted by Nature is Nonpartisan, a nonprofit organization that seeks environmental solutions that span the political rift. 
“Even when America feels more divided than ever, conservation is a place of consensus,” Nature is Nonpartisan CEO Benji Backer said in a statement “The most durable solutions come from bipartisanship, and we look forward to supporting the important work of the Senate Stewardship Caucus.”  
Caucus co-chairman Heinrich said in his remarks that the caucus came together on an important day — Teddy Roosevelt’s birthday, and the publication day of the Sand County Almanac, by Aldo Leopold, a giant in the annals of American conservation. 
“As a young person, I had the privilege of serving as an outfitter guide in the very landscapes that Aldo Leopold wrote of in that book. It was seminal in creating what he called a ‘Land Ethic’ — the relationship that our communities have with place, with land — public and private — with streams, with wildlife,” Heinrich said. “Putting together this Stewardship Caucus is an opportunity for all of us to work on these issues together to protect and conserve the places we know and love for this generation and the next.”
The other inaugural members of the caucus include Montana’s senior Sen. Steve Daines, and Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nevada, Thom Tillis, R-North Caroline., John Hickenlooper, D-Colorado, Chris Coons, D-Delaware, and Katie Britt , R-Alabama.
“America is home to the most pristine natural beauty in the world, and it’s our job to be good stewards of the land we’re blessed to live in,” Daines said. “As a lifelong outdoorsman, I’m proud to join Senator Sheehy and Senator Heinrich in founding the Senate Stewardship Caucus, so that we can protect and manage our lands for generations to come.”

TOPEKA — El presidente del Senado de Kansas dijo el lunes que un número suficiente de republicanos del Senado ha firmado una petición para convocar una sesión especial de la Legislatura para considerar nuevos límites de los distritos del Congreso para mejorar las probabilidades de derrotar a la representante demócrata Sharice Davids.
El presidente del Senado, Ty Masterson, quien busca la nominación republicana a gobernador, afirmó que se había logrado el mínimo de 27 firmas, equivalente a una mayoría de dos tercios del Senado. Los republicanos tienen una ventaja de 31 a 9 sobre los demócratas en la Cámara.
“El bloque republicano del Senado de Kansas ha conseguido las firmas necesarias para superar el umbral constitucional, lo que demuestra un fuerte apoyo a esta convocatoria de una sesión especial”, declaró Masterson. “Alcanzar este umbral marca un paso crucial para la convocatoria de la sesión, a la espera de la aprobación necesaria de dos tercios de la Cámara de Representantes”.
Para cumplir con los requisitos de la Constitución de Kansas para convocar una sesión especial, los líderes republicanos de la Cámara de Representantes necesitan obtener 84 firmas para su petición. En la Cámara, el Partido Republicano tiene una ventaja de 88 a 37 sobre los demócratas.
A pesar de enviar una carta a los republicanos de la Cámara de Representantes para presionar a favor de una sesión especial, el presidente de la Cámara, Dan Hawkins, no ha anunciado haber conseguido el apoyo de suficientes colegas republicanos. En un comunicado, Hawkins promovió la idea de una sesión especial.
“Hay muchos asuntos cruciales en proceso de debate que requieren una sesión especial”, dijo. “A diferencia de los demócratas en el Congreso, los republicanos de Kansas están comprometidos a hacer su trabajo sin importar la época del año”.
El presidente Donald Trump, en un esfuerzo por mantener el control republicano de la Cámara de Representantes de Estados Unidos, instó a los estados liderados por republicanos a participar en una manipulación de los distritos electorales de los escaños de las Cámaras de Representantes de Estados Unidos a mediados de la década para evitar que los demócratas obtengan una mayoría en noviembre de 2026.
Normalmente, la redistribución de distritos en Kansas se ha realizado cada década con base en los cambios de población documentados en el Censo. En Kansas, esto significaba que, por lo general, el mapeo no se volvería a realizar hasta 2032.
“No se pueden cambiar las reglas en medio de una pelea solo por miedo a no poder ganar, pero eso es precisamente lo que están haciendo los republicanos extremistas de Topeka”, dijo Davids tras el anuncio de Masterson. “Este es un intento descarado de silenciar a los votantes de Kansas y proteger su propio poder político. Los ciudadanos de Kansas merecen justicia, no acuerdos secretos influenciados por Washington D. C. para perjudicarlos”.
Actualmente, Davids sirve en todo el condado de Johnson, la mitad sur del condado de Wyandotte y en todos los condados de Anderson, Franklin y Miami. Fue reelegida para su escaño del 3.er Distrito en 2022 y 2024, a pesar de la modificación previa de su distrito para favorecer a los candidatos republicanos.
El objetivo de la redistribución de distritos de Kansas en 2025 sería distribuir a los votantes moderados del condado de Johnson en dos o tres distritos del Congreso que probablemente estarían representados por republicanos.
En respuesta al debate sobre una sesión especial, Davids planteó la posibilidad de postularse para el Senado de Estados Unidos el próximo año contra el senador Roger Marshall, un republicano de Kansas.
Un premio de redistribución de distritos disponible para los republicanos sería el apoyo de Trump en la contienda por la gobernación. El exgobernador Jeff Colyer, el secretario de Estado Scott Schwab, Masterson y otros aspirantes a la nominación codiciarían una alianza con el presidente.
“Estamos enviando un mensaje claro: estamos listos para lograrlo. Esperamos trabajar en nuestra agenda para que Kansas y Estados Unidos vuelvan a ser grandes”, declaró Masterson sobre la petición republicana al Senado.
Además de la redistribución de distritos, los líderes legislativos republicanos dijeron que una sesión especial en noviembre podría incluir la consideración de proyectos de ley sobre los derechos de las personas transgénero y los impuestos a la propiedad.
El 13 de octubre, el Consejo de Coordinación Legislativa controlado por el Partido Republicano aprobó gastar hasta 460,000 dólares en una sesión especial.
“Está claro que los republicanos no se centran en los problemas cotidianos que preocupan a los habitantes de Kansas”, dijo la líder de la minoría del Senado, Dinah Sykes.
La gobernadora Laura Kelly se opuso a una redistribución de distritos a mediados de la década porque dicha labor se basaría en conteos de población obsoletos de 2020. Ella instó a la Legislatura a celebrar audiencias públicas antes de votar sobre un nuevo mapa del Congreso. Además, advirtió que la Corte Suprema de Kansas podría declarar inconstitucionales los nuevos mapas.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Masterson-9-Senate-3.26.25-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-10-28 17:17:02.061758

Free.,"Trump claims immunity, seeks to erase felon status with appeal in NY court",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-claims-immunity-seeks-erase-felon-status-appeal-ny-court,,"President Donald Trump sought to remove his status as the only felon to be elected president by appealing his conviction on 34 New York state charges just before midnight Tuesday, arguing, in part, that the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2024 ruling giving the president broad immunity invalidated the conviction.In a 96-page appeal nearly 18 months after his state court conviction that he falsified business records by disguising hush money payments over an alleged affair with adult film star Stormy Daniels as legitimate legal payments, Trump’s attorneys recited a list of complaints over his prosecution.  Among those complaints were that New York District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, targeted the then-former president, and that the presiding Democratic judge created at least the appearance of partiality, the appeal said.“This is the most politically charged prosecution in our Nation’s history,” the lengthy brief began. “After years of fruitless investigation into decade-old, baseless allegations — and under immense political pressure to criminally charge President Donald J. Trump for something — New York’s district attorney manufactured felony charges against a once-former and now-sitting President of the United States.”Bragg’s office declined to comment on the appeal Tuesday. Hush moneyThe case centered on payments Michael Cohen, Trump’s former personal attorney, made to Daniels in the run up to the 2016 election. Trump wanted to keep her from telling the tabloid National Enquirer about a tryst she said she had with the married Trump years earlier. After Trump won the White House, his private business reimbursed Cohen for the payment to Daniels, according to the 2023 indictment.Federal prosecutors had explored whether the payment to Daniels could have violated campaign finance laws. Cohen paid Daniels to keep her from publicizing her account during Trump’s 2016 race against Hillary Clinton. They ultimately declined to bring charges.Trump’s appeal this week said New York prosecutors impermissibly depended on campaign finance violations to charge him with felony business record falsification. To be charged as a felony, the business records must be falsified in service of another crime, but Trump argued Monday those allegations could not have been charged because federal law preempts state law.The New York law also requires prosecutors to show the defendant had “intent to defraud” to win a conviction for falsifying business records. Bragg and his team did not do that at trial, Trump’s attorneys said.SCOTUS immunity rulingTrump’s attorneys also said the trial court admitted evidence that should have been protected by presidential immunity, citing a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year that established broad protections for sitting presidents.The Supreme Court opinion said the president was not only protected from criminal charges based on official actions, but that any official action could not be used as evidence to prove an allegation that centered on an unofficial act.The prosecution did include some official acts Trump took while in office, his lawyers said.Prosecutors examined Hope Hicks, a former Trump White House communications director, Trump’s statements on social media, communications with former Attorney General Jeff Sessions — which Trump denies took place — and the president’s general work habits while in office. Those examples should all be considered official actions that are immune from being used in a criminal case, Trump’s attorneys wrote.Lack of recusal broachedTrump’s attorneys also argued Judge Juan Merchan, who oversaw the trial, should have recused himself.Merchan donated a total of $25 to Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign and to a political action committee called “Stop Republicans.” The nominal contributions violated a “clear bar on sitting judges making political contributions,” Trump’s attorneys wrote.His daughter also worked for a political organization that opposed Trump in 2020, the brief noted.Trump had asked Merchan to recuse himself during the trial phase, but the judge declined. Trump’s attorneys said Monday that was a “clear ground for reversal” of the conviction.“In the face of all these undisputed and damaging facts, Justice Merchan’s refusal to recuse created, at the very least, ‘the appearance of bias,’” they wrote.Elected felon Whatever problems arose from Trump’s prosecution in New York, it had the political effect of elevating his stagnant comeback campaign.At the nadir of his popularity following his 2020 election loss and the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, several credible challengers entered the Republican presidential field for the 2024 cycle and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis led in some early polls.But four criminal prosecutions, of which the New York hush money case was the first, had the effect of galvanizing Republicans and other voters who believed the former president was the victim of a political prosecution, and he easily won the GOP nomination. The prosecutions played out amid the 2024 campaign, and a New York jury convicted Trump of 34 felony counts on May 30, making him the first former president to be convicted of a felony.He won that November’s election and became the first felon to be elected president. He successfully delayed sentencing until after the 2024 election. Merchan imposed a sentence of unconditional discharge on Jan. 10, 2025, allowing Trump to avoid prison time.",,,,2025-10-28 17:17:02.061758

(Photo by Verite News)NEW ORLEANS – The state of Louisiana has begun the process for a potential takeover of the city of New Orleans’ finances. The news came Tuesday in an agenda posted for a meeting of the state’s Fiscal Review Committee.

The little-known entity is responsible for reviewing and, on occasion, intervening in the financial stability of cities and parishes through the appointment of fiscal administrators, officials empowered to formulate local budgets, hire and fire personnel and approve contracts unilaterally, without the consent of elected officials.
The committee meeting, the first step in the process that could end with a fiscal administrator running Louisiana’s largest city, will be held 4:30 p.m. Wednesday.
The meeting comes after Gov. Jeff Landry posted online, urging Attorney General Liz Murrill, Treasurer John Fleming and state auditor Michael Waguespack — the three members of the committee — to convene an emergency meeting and to “utilize all necessary measures to thoroughly review the city’s affairs and, if deemed necessary, appoint a fiscal administrator.”
Landry also called on the state Bond Commission, which meets Thursday, to reject the city’s request for a $125 million loan to shore up its troubled finances.
New Orleans is facing a projected $160 million budget deficit coupled with a cash shortfall, threatening its ability to continue payroll throughout the end of the year. It is not yet evident the full extent of the deficit and its causes, but Director of Finance Romy Samuel called the city’s tough financial position the consequence of a “perfect storm” of reduced revenue and increased expenditures — the bulk of which can be attributed to increases in personnel and overtime spending.

Murrill previously told Axios that her office was considering using a state law to impose fiscal administration on the city, as it did earlier this year in Bogalusa. The fiscal administrator law was recently amended to make it easier to trigger a fiscal review. If a political subdivision fails to meet any of ten listed conditions, including having insufficient revenue to cover a year’s worth of operating expenditures, it can be subject to takeover.
The meeting is just the first step toward the appointment of an administrator. If the members of the committee agree that a fiscal takeover is necessary, Murrill then must file a motion in Orleans Parish Civil District Court to appoint an administrator, which the city can either agree to or fight the state. If the latter, a judge must determine whether the city meets the criteria outlined in the fiscal administrator law. If the judge finds with the state — and the state is successful in any appeal — a fiscal administrator will be appointed.
“Appointing a fiscal administrator is unnecessary and not in the city’s best interest but we look forward to discussing other ways we can work together to increase transparency and oversight while preventing deficit spending in New Orleans,” Council President JP Morrell told Verite News via text message. “I look forward to presenting to the Fiscal Review Committee tomorrow with Mayor-Elect Moreno to discuss the plans for addressing the short term and long term plans to address the current budget crisis.”
“The City of New Orleans will not survive a financial administrator, and it sets the stage for even more graft, cronyism, and patronage, but legally sanctioned,” Amanda Fallis, a librarian at the New Orleans Public Library and the president of the union that represents city employees, told Verite News via text. “Everyone who cares about saving New Orleans should be at the emergency Fiscal Review Committee in the state capitol tomorrow at 4:30 [p.m.].”
Representatives for Landry, Murrill, Mayor LaToya Cantrell and Mayor-elect Helena Moreno did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-28 20:55:22+00:00,CT Mirror,PURA approves $66M rate hike for United Illuminating customers,John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/28/pura-united-illuminating-rate-hike/,The first major decision since former chair Marissa Gillett resigned will cause monthly electric bills to rise by an estimated $10-$13.,"The Public Utilities Regulatory Authority approved a rate hike for United Illuminating’s electric customers on Tuesday in its first major decision following the resignation of the authority’s former chair, Marissa Gillett.
The decision will allow the company to collect more than $450 million in revenues over the next year, an increase of about 17% — or $66 million over its currently-authorized revenues. Those revenues will be collected through new distribution rates, which will go into effect beginning Nov. 1.
While the additional $66 million is less than the original $105 million increase the company sought in this case, it’s also a sharp increase from the $28.6 million increase recommended by PURA before Gillett stepped down earlier this month amid a wave of scrutiny from utility officials and state lawmakers.
Officials for the Orange-based utility had publicly threatened to sue PURA over the earlier proposal, which they argued would have weakened the company’s financial footing and forced dozens of layoffs. Prior to Tuesday’s ruling, UI had offered a resolution that would have increased the company’s revenues by $63.7 million — slightly less than the $66 million PURA approved Tuesday.
A spokesperson for UI declined to comment on the ruling.
According to estimates released by PURA on Tuesday, the decision will increase the average UI customer’s electric bill by about $10 a month.
The Office of Consumer Counsel, which represents the interests of utility customers before PURA, estimated a slightly higher bill impact, around $13 a month. In a statement on Tuesday, Consumer Counsel Claire Coleman expressed disappointment in the the decision — which she said comes at “particularly challenging” time for the authority. 
“Given that the final decision gives UI more revenue than the company’s own stated bottom line for providing safe and adequate service, I hope that UI will accept the decision rendered by its regulator and cease its practice of filing a battery of appeals,” Coleman said in an emailed statement. “This should allow the Company to turn its focus toward improvements and efficiencies that can still be achieved in the delivery of electricity to customers.”
The decision allows UI to achieve a 9.25% return on its investments in Connecticut.  PURA trimmed that amount by a fraction of a percentage point, citing several issues including the company’s failure to complete its remediation of the abandoned English Station power plant in New Haven.
That cleanup effort was required as part of UI’s 2015 merger with Spanish power company Iberdrola. To date, however, PURA said the company has spent only slightly more than half of the $30 million it originally promised as part of the effort.
“Time is thus of the essence in this endeavor, yet the remediation of English Station lingers nearly a decade after the Authority approved the Merger Decision with remediation as an express condition thereof,” the decision states. 
Regulators did give UI credit — and reduced the company’s existing penalty related to the English Station cleanup — for improving security measures at the site and removing 1,120 tons of contaminated soil from underneath a boiler at the plant. New Haven is currently considering purchasing the property with the hope of transforming it into a waterfront park.
Regulators also docked UI’s potential profits for noncompliance with PURA’s orders regarding the rollout of so-called “smart meters” aimed at helping customers reduce their electricity usage.
John Erlingheuser, an advocacy director for AARP Connecticut, said in a statement Tuesday that the decision offered a “mixed outcome” for consumers. 
“While PURA set the return on equity at 9.25%, a figure below the national average and significantly less than UI’s original request, the decision still results in an average increase of approximately $10 per month in distribution charges on customer bills,” Erlingheuser said. “This added cost comes at a time when many residents are already grappling with the pressures of inflation and rising living expenses.”
The final decision was approved Tuesday by PURA Vice Chair David Arconti and Commissioner Michael Caron.
The newly-appointed chair of the authority, Thomas Wiehl, recused himself from the vote as he had previously weighed in on UI’s application while serving as a staff attorney for OCC. Commissioner Janice Beecher also did not participate in the vote as her first day at PURA was Tuesday, and she said she did not have enough time to prepare.
Wiehl was appointed this month by Gov. Ned Lamont to replace Gillett, who stepped down following a long and bitter dispute with the utilities, who have filed lawsuits accusing her of bias and boxing out her fellow commissioners to issue decisions that harmed the company’s financial reputation. Those lawsuits remained pending as on Tuesday.
“After months of relentless legal attacks, United Illuminating succeeded in running off its chief regulator,” Attorney General William Tong said in a statement responding to PURA’s decision Tuesday. 
“For those who spent these last months fixated on personalities and politics, this decision is a stark reminder of what this fight was always about. It was about millions upon millions of dollars that Connecticut families will now pay to increase United Illuminating’s bottom line. We cannot lose sight of that, and we must redouble our efforts to address the crisis of affordability in our state,” Tong said. 
In a legal filing earlier this week, attorneys in Tong’s office conceded that some of Gillett’s actions while serving as chair violated state law.
Lamont’s office declined to comment on the decision.
Caron defended the outcome during Tuesday’s meeting, noting that he and Arconti had allowed time for the OCC and other interested parties to attempt to reach a settlement with UI following Gillett’s resignation.
Those negotiations, however, failed to produce an agreement. In the meantime, Caron said PURA staff were put to work revising the earlier draft in response to comments it received from stakeholders.
“This isn’t perfect by any means, but I fully believe it gets the rates right with the revenue that is sufficient, but no more than sufficient, to prudently manage the system,” Caron said.
Tom Swan, executive director of the Connecticut Citizens Action Group, called the decision “overly-friendly” to UI, and expressed concern that Arconti — who worked briefly as a lobbyist for the utility — was one of two votes to approve it.
Arconti did not address his prior work for UI in his remarks on Tuesday. He left the company in mid-2024, before the latest rate case was filed in November. 
“The revenue requirement we are approving today will support continued reliability of essential services and help with addressing aging infrastructure while striking a balance between affordability and the need for ongoing system improvements,” Arconti said.
UI serves about 341,000 customers in south-central Connecticut. Its last rate case was decided by PURA in 2023. 
This year’s rate case was the first of three major decisions expected by PURA in the aftermath of Gillett’s departure.
The authority is scheduled to rule on the pending rate case for the Yankee Gas Company on Nov. 5, followed by the proposed sale of Eversource’s Aquarion Water Company to the South Central Regional Water Authority on Nov. 19.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1027_SR_Pura_025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 16:57:06.061721

Karla García, the girl’s mother, and her ex-boyfriend, Jonatan Nanita, face multiple charges including murder with special circumstances, risk of injury to a minor, unlawful restraint and intentional cruelty to a child.
Torres-García’s aunt, Jackelyn García, was also charged for her participation in the girl’s abuse.
According to the warrants, two people told police that they had contacted the Department of Children and Families in 2024 and 2025 to express concerns about abuse of the children in the household and the whereabouts of Torres-García. 
According to DCF, Torres-García attended medical appointments in November 2022, November 2023 and May 2024. 
“During that two-year period, the Department did not receive any reports of child abuse or neglect regarding the family,” according to a DCF statement.
“This is an unspeakable tragedy and one that has impacted Jacqueline’s family, friends, and her entire community,” DCF officials said on Tuesday. “This remains an active and evolving criminal investigation and we will continue to be as transparent as possible following the completion of our review. We continue to ask anyone who has information about this matter to contact law enforcement.”
Torres-García was dead for more than a year before her remains were found in a plastic container in New Britain, the warrants state. 
Lawmakers and advocates have demanded answers from DCF about the nature of the department’s involvement in the life of Torres-García and her family and how a DCF employee could have been fooled by a 2025 Zoom call in which the agency said a girl posed as Torres-García during a welfare check.
The case of abuse has also renewed calls for reform of Connecticut’s homeschooling laws, since the lack of required monitoring of homeschooled children made it possible the girl’s mother to cover for her absence from public school during the 2024-2025 school year. 
According to the warrants, Karla García admitted to police that during the early weeks of September 2024, when Torres-García would have been attending school, she was being starved and abused until she died. A medical examiner told police that because of ammonia put on the girl’s body to lessen the smell of decomposition, as well as the “lack of subcutaneous fat on the body,” due to severe malnourishment, it was difficult to determine how long Torres-García had been deceased. Her remains weighed only 26 to 27 pounds, according to the warrant.
The arrest warrants include multiple interviews with the girl’s mother, Karla García, aunt, Jackelyn García, and her mother’s ex-boyfriend Jonatan Nanita, who is also the father of Torres-García’s three youngest siblings. 
The warrants include an interview with Torres-García’s father, Victor Torres, who told police he’d grown concerned about his eldest daughter’s absence from phone calls and visits he had with her sibling. Torres told police that since June 2024, when he asked to speak with Torres-García, her mother “told him she was not home, or at a Friends, or another excuse.” Torres told police he had moved to Florida in the summer of 2025 but had made trips to New Britain and “every time he tried to visit or talk with his daughters, and/or drop of presents,” and he was allowed to talk to Torres-García’s sibling but not with Torres-García.
A person who lived next door to the family in Farmington in 2024 told police she also called DCF because of concerns about abuse heard through a shared wall. She said that she believed at the time that there was an older boy living in the household but now believes that child was Torres-García after seeing photos of her complexion and curly hair — which she said was short during the time the family lived in Farmington. In a separate interview, the girl’s aunt, Jackelyn García, told police she had cut Torres-García’s hair short after Karla García told her to.
Karla García initially acted surprised during interviews with police that her eldest daughter was not with her four siblings, then told several versions of a violent episode in which her ex-boyfriend Jonatan Nanita was responsible for her death. In a third interview, she admitted to not feeding her eldest daughter for two weeks until she died in bed. During that interview, police confronted García with a report by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, which concluded that malnourishment was the likely cause of death. Then García told police that she and Nanita had zip-tied the girl, abused her and starved her before she died.
According to the warrant, “Garcia admitted that Jacqueline died sometime in her bed, but she wasn’t sure exactly when. She stated Nanita came downstairs one day and told her (Karla) that Jacqueline was not breathing anymore. Garcia stated Jonatan moved Jacqueline’s body to the basement, but she never went down there to see what hedid with it.”
García also told police that she and Nanita mistreated the girl together “because Jacqueline was ‘bad, she didn’t listen, she didn’t respect them,'” according to the warrant. “García ultimately admitted that they stopped giving Jacqueline food for about two weeks prior to her death.”
Torres-García lived with her paternal grandmother until she was 9 years old, and García and the girl’s father, Victor Torres, had sought guardianship. García eventually got sole custody of the girl, Torres told police.
In the warrants, García told police that “she was hurt from her daughter not wanting her so she would stop talking to her, stop feeding her, and restrain her in zip-ties.”
Jackelyn García, who went to prison in late 2024 for separate child abuse convictions, initially told police that Torres-García and her siblings were “well fed and well dressed,” attended school regularly, and she would get up with them to do their hair and take them to the bus. She said she had seen Torres-García the morning of the interview. 
But during that interview, she was so intoxicated, according to the warrant, that she “stated her pants were wet and that she thought she peed herself.” When confronted with information from García’s former roommate about a photograph that García had shown her of the girl “zip tied, severely malnourished, and laying on dog pee pads to use as a bathroom,” García admitted to the abuse and acknowledged that she had helped zip-tie the girl and was aware that “she suffered malnutrition for a long time.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jacqueline-22Mimi22-Torres-Garcia-Memorial-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 16:57:06.061721

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – Lawmakers are studying ways to reduce the long waits early voters experienced during the last presidential election.
At least three county election boards – Oklahoma, Tulsa and Cleveland – plan to open additional locations, a legislative panel was told Tuesday.
Sen. Mary Boren, D-Norman, oversaw a Tuesday interim study on the issue. Interim studies often help lawmakers craft legislation for the upcoming session.
Boren said knew of two instances during the 2024 presidential election in which some Cleveland County voters were told early voting had closed when time still remained to cast ballots.
She blamed the issue on inadequate training.
Each county is required to have one early voting site, said State Election Board Secretary Paul Ziriax.
Counties with 25,000 or more voters or that have an area of 1,500 square miles or more can have more than one site, he said.
During the last general election, about 15 counties had more than one early voting site, he said.
A record 293,206 voters voted early during the 2024 general election, an increase from 167,185 four years earlier, he said.
In Tulsa County, 10% of registered voters cast ballots early, double the percentage in 2020, said Election Board Secretary Gwen Freeman.
The average wait time to vote early in Tulsa County during the last presidential election was an hour and a half, but some waited two hours, she said.
In Oklahoma City, the longest early voting wait was two to three hours, but at the Edmond location, voters waited as long as six hours, said Oklahoma County Assistant Election Board Secretary Tuesday Sanders.
“It didn’t start off that way, but people kept coming and coming,” she said.
She said a third location will take the pressure off the other two early voting locations.
“You really had county election boards across the state dealing with unprecedented levels of early voting turnout, and I think that drove some of the lines that you were hearing about, because there was no way to anticipate that there was going to be that kind of shift,” Ziriax said.
County election officials did the best with the hand they were dealt, he said. Ziriax said he doesn’t want people to wait in long lines, but it comes down to resources, time, money, people and locations.
While some of the resources can come from the Legislature, a lot has to come from the county government, he said.
Cleveland County is adding additional sites to bring the total to six from four since the last general election, said Cleveland County Election Board Secretary Bryant Rains.
The initial cost for Cleveland County to add an additional early voting site is about $15,000, he said.

The lawsuit, filed in the Eastern District of Massachusetts, alleges that the suspension of benefits was done unlawfully, specifically due to SNAP-specific contingency funds appropriated in budgets for Fiscal Years 2024 and 2025 by Congress that would at least partially cover the expenses of the program for November. 
The suspension of benefits violates the Administrative Procedure Act, the attorneys general and governors claim.
“Emergency funding exists for exactly this kind of crisis,” Nessel said in a press release from her office regarding the lawsuit. “If the reality of 42 million Americans going hungry, including 1.4 million Michiganders, isn’t an emergency, I don’t know what is. It is cruel, inhumane, and illegal to hold back emergency reserves while families struggle to put food on the table.” 
SNAP is, according to the lawsuit, an appropriated entitlement, citing the Government Accountability Office, “‘meaning that the government is legally required to make payments to those who meet the program requirements’” and that “‘USDA’s liability [extends to] the availability of appropriations for these payments’.”
The cancellation of those benefits will lead states to be “irreparably harmed,” the attorneys general and governors state. 
“Plaintiff States are thus being forced to spend their limited resources to operate a benefits program while USDA fails to provide the underlying benefits,” the suit reads. “Plaintiff States have already spent millions in October to administer SNAP benefits, a significant portion of which is dedicated to developing accurate benefit issuance files to ensure November benefits are issued promptly and accurately. When those benefits do not go out on time (or at all), that investment will have been for naught.”
“Because of USDA’s actions, SNAP benefits will be delayed for the first time since the program’s inception,” the lawsuit reads. 
“We are approaching an inflection point for Senate Democrats,” a Department of Agriculture spokesperson wrote to States Newsroom regarding the suit. “Continue to hold out for the Far-Left wing of the party or reopen the government so mothers, babies, and the most vulnerable among us can receive timely WIC and SNAP allotments.”
Nessel has also joined a group of state attorneys general in a letter asking Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins for further answers on why the contingency funding is not being used and whether this is a “suspension” or a “cancellation” of benefits. She will also host a press conference on Wednesday alongside Lansing Mayor Andy Schor to address the lawsuit.

The letter, written by Alex Adams, assistant secretary of the Administration for Children and Families, suggested federal funding could be at stake.

Phil Scott’s weekly press conference at the Statehouse in Montpelier on Wednesday, Feb. 12. Photo by Glenn Russell/VTDigger
President Donald Trump’s administration has warned Vermont that its policies meant to support LGBTQ foster youth may violate federal law, potentially threatening federal funding.
The Oct. 16 letter, written by Alex Adams, assistant secretary of the federal Administration for Children and Families, directed Vermont Secretary of Human Services Jenney Samuelson to provide a written response explaining how the state would address Adams’ concerns. 
“It has been brought to my attention that certain policies and procedures in Vermont deny qualified foster and adoptive parents the opportunity to provide children a loving home solely because they cannot, in good conscience, commit to affirming a hypothetical child’s gender identity,” Adams wrote. “Such policies are contrary to the purpose of child welfare programs and inconsistent with our interpretation of federal diligent recruitment plans and constitutional protections, including the First Amendment.”
Other states, including Massachusetts, New York and California, have received similar letters. Vermont’s involvement was first reported by The Imprint, a nonprofit news publication focused on vulnerable children and families. About a third of foster youth identify as LGBTQ, according to multiple studies.
While Adams’ letter does not reference specific Vermont policies, in 2024, two Vermont couples sued the Department for Children and Families, arguing that policies requiring foster parents to affirm a foster child’s sexual orientation or gender identity are unconstitutional and discriminate against Christians. A second lawsuit related to foster parent policies was later brought by a separate family that year.
The prominent conservative legal firm Alliance Defending Freedom represented the couples in the first suit. Similar lawsuits have cropped up across the country, including in Oregon, where a federal appeals court eventually ruled the state’s policies intended to protect LGBTQ foster youth violated free speech. The Vermont lawsuits now sit with the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals after the families appealed a lower court’s ruling against them. 
Per Vermont’s Department for Children and Families policy, “discrimination and bias based on a child or youth’s real or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression” is prohibited.
A department spokesperson said no one was available Tuesday for an interview regarding the letter from the federal government and instead requested questions in writing. 
In a statement, Aryka Radke, a Department for Children and Families deputy commissioner, wrote that the department “is committed to ensuring that young people in our custody are safe and supported. We are currently reviewing the letter with our legal team.”
Radke did not respond to questions about what funding could be at risk. 
While Adams, in the letter, did not explicitly threaten to withhold federal funding from Vermont, he did allude to the possibility. 
“Please provide a written response outlining how you will review and, where necessary, amend policies to bring them into alignment with these values and applicable law,” he wrote. “As you know, my responsibilities include monitoring the use of relevant federal funds and ensuring compliance with federal law.”
The Administration for Children and Families did not respond to a request for comment.

(Photo provided by Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources)Kentucky is banning the use of aircraft or unmanned aircraft, like drones, in hunting and fishing.
The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources said the new regulation, which went into effect earlier this month, bans people from using aircraft or unmanned aircraft systems “to fish, hunt or take wildlife or to drive or herd any wildlife for the purpose of fishing, hunting or taking” or “to harass any wildlife.” 
Lawmakers on the Interim Joint Committee on Natural Resources and Energy approved the regulation on Oct. 16. 
The department’s definition of “take” means to “pursue, shoot, hunt, wound, catch, kill, trap, snare or capture wildlife in any way and any lesser act designed to lure, attract or entice for these purposes; and to place, set, aim, or use any device, animal, substance or agency which may reasonably be expected to accomplish these acts; or to attempt to do these acts or to assist any other person in the doing of or the attempt to do these acts.” 
“This regulation will provide guidance regarding the use of aircraft, including drones, while hunting, fishing or participating in other outdoor activities,” Maj. David Marques, of the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources Law Enforcement Division, in a statement. “It will also provide a framework for our wardens to work within when investigating and enforcing potential violations. This regulation has been needed for some time, and we are happy to finally have it in place.”
Aircraft or unmanned aircraft systems can still be used in some situations, like by Kentucky Fish and Wildlife employees and contractors or agents who are acting on behalf of the agency or by commercial fishers who are locating or removing invasive carp. 
Asked about more clarity on the regulation, like for wildlife photographers who use drones to take images, Public Information Officer Lisa Jackson told the Kentucky Lantern that: “Each situation will be up to the officer to evaluate in the field, but someone flying a drone just to get photographs should not be in violation of any of the language above.”
“Additionally, drone operators are required to follow appropriate FAA (Federal Aviation Agency) guidelines, and be mindful of the location they are visiting as some state and federal properties may have separate and additional restrictions,” she added. 
Across the country, states have different laws about using drones while hunting. Such unmanned aircrafts are illegal for hunting in states including Wisconsin and Colorado. The FAA oversees general federal laws and rules about flying drones.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image.png,,,2025-10-28 16:57:06.061721

(Photo by Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)One of the state officials responsible for overseeing the Bank of North Dakota is urging caution as the financial institution begins developing the state’s first stablecoin. 
The state-owned bank announced earlier this month it is developing a stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency, that will be named the Roughrider coin. The digital currency will be able to facilitate instant money transfers, streamline bank-to-bank transactions and, potentially, be used by North Dakotans in daily life, though that is likely years away. 
Unlike bitcoin, stablecoin is not subject to volatile price swings because it’s backed by conventional financial assets, overwhelmingly the U.S. dollar. But Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring still wants the bank to be cautious.
“That’s an area we’ve got to be a little more cautious how we’re proceeding, how it’s perceived, and how we manage it,” Goehring said during Monday’s North Dakota Industrial Commission meeting. “Whether it’s media or a whole group of constituents, there’s a lot of questions and a lot of concern.”
Goehring is a member of the three-person North Dakota Industrial Commission, alongside Gov. Kelly Armstrong and Attorney General Drew Wrigley, that oversees the Bank of North Dakota. 
Goehring said he’d like monthly updates on the bank’s process.
“There could be some pitfalls, there could be little things that trip us up,” Goehring said. 
Don Morgan, CEO of the Bank of North Dakota, said the state’s banks face a strategic question about what poses more risk: Doing nothing and potentially losing customers down the road, or carefully exploring new financial technologies and laying the groundwork for the future.

“We’d rather move and step forward in diligent, thoughtful ways to maintain not only our relevancy, but the relevancy of our community banking and credit union industry, as this world continues to change with things like stablecoin,” Morgan said.
The Roughrider coin has the support of the Bank of North Dakota advisory board, said chair Karl Bollingberg. There’s little downside to educating local banks and credit unions on the new technologies that are gaining steam, he said. 
“The level of risk taken to do a Roughrider coin, at this point, very low,” he said. “If you can get into those spaces, be a leader and not have to take high levels of risk, I think that’s viewed pretty well.
Armstrong said new technologies like artificial intelligence and digital banking are advancing “whether we do nothing or whether we do something.”
Armstrong advised finding the “sweet spot” of moving forward without having “the accelerator stuck down to the floor so fast that we’re breaking every rule of the road on the way there.”

The owner of a gun store and shooting range in Great Falls who was indicted on five counts of submitting false tax returns and failing to report nearly $1.4 million in sales to the Internal Revenue Service agreed to a plea deal with the federal government.
At a change of plea hearing on Oct. 23 at the federal courthouse in Great Falls, Thomas VanHoose pleaded guilty to one count of subscribing to a false return. The charge carries a potential penalty of as many as three years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and as long as a year of supervised release.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office did not issue a press release or statement on the change of plea hearing, due to the government shutdown.
According to court documents, VanHoose’s sentencing is set for Feb. 18, 2026.
 Undercover investigation leads to federal indictment

In 2023, VanHoose listed his business, Highwood Creek Outfitters, for sale. A federal indictment did not indicate why the IRS was interested in VanHoose and his business, but an undercover agent posed as a buyer and contacted the real estate agent and VanHoose.
During the course of telephone and in-person conversations, the undercover agent was told that VanHoose skimmed roughly $450,000 in cash from the business and underreported his sales to the IRS by about 20%, according to the indictment. The five years VanHoose allegedly underreported his income amounted to nearly $500,000 in taxes he did not pay to the federal government.
A subsequent warrant executed at VanHoose’s business drew criticism from members of Montana’s federal delegation.
In August, 2024, VanHoose was indicted by a federal grand jury on five counts of submitting a false tax return.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/7468312536_89549c1b78_o-1024x731.jpg,,,2025-10-28 16:57:06.061721

Northfield’s longtime town manager Jeff Schulz plans to step down next year — the latest departure announcement signaling upheaval among town officials.
Selectboard Chair Charlie Morse confirmed Tuesday that the board received Schulz’s letter last week announcing his intent to retire around March.

Schulz has been with the town for more than a decade and has “a lot of institutional knowledge,”  said Morse, who was town manager himself from 2000 to 2005.
Schulz and the volunteer selectboard members did not immediately respond to questions surrounding his planned departure but said the matter would be discussed at the board’s regular meeting Tuesday night.
Schulz’s decision comes two weeks after the town’s police chief, Pierre Gomez, announced his decision to leave effective Nov. 1. But Gomez has since moved his resignation up, effective Tuesday, due to “an ongoing medical issue” that has progressively gotten worse over the past two years, he said. He was hired in September 2023.
One of three police chiefs of color in Vermont — he identifies as a Black Latino — Gomez has reported facing racial harassment since he moved to Northfield. He said he moved back to Philadelphia last week.
This leaves the small Washington County town of about 5,900 with two new vacancies to fill in the near future.

The board has discussed filling Schulz’s position with an interim manager with help from the Vermont League Of Cities & Towns but has yet to figure out a path forward to fill the police chief position, both being “key positions in town,” Morse said.
“The town of Northfield has voted to have a manager form of government so that is one of our priorities: to find a competent and qualified individual for manager, hopefully with experience,” he said. 
The five-member board held two special meetings last week, on Oct. 20 and Oct. 24, discussing “personnel issues.” Town attorney John Klesch attended the Oct. 20 meeting. The minutes indicate the board went into executive session both times but took no action.
Northfield is also looking to hire a highway equipment operator and laborer and a finance manager. The town’s accounting manager retired at the end of the last fiscal year and has been filling in as finance manager part-time, according to Morse.
“We’re looking at all our options,” he said, adding that they are considering remote work options for the finance job.
Residents in recent months have asked the selectboard about the town not fulfilling public records requests and town employees allegedly violating Northfield’s code of ethics.
The selectboard’s Tuesday agenda includes discussions of the town manager’s retirement/resignation and the code of ethics and enforcement ordinance.

Earlier this year, the town hired a consultant for about $17,000 to “evaluate ethics violations,” Morse said last month. The original complaint and the results of the investigation have been withheld due to legal requirements that protect personnel information as confidential.
Morse declined to comment Tuesday on ethics conflicts and investigations involving town employees. He said he has questions of his own and will rely on the town’s legal counsel to respond appropriately. He also said he plans to release a statement soon to let the public know “we are functional and we’re going to employ all the resources to fill in the holes that have been created.”

That’s standard practice, public health and infectious disease experts told NPR and KFF Health News. The goal is to keep as many other vulnerable people as possible from getting sick and to remind the public about the benefits of vaccinations.
But in Louisiana this year, public health officials appeared not to have followed that playbook during the state’s worst whooping cough outbreak in 35 years.
Whooping cough, also called pertussis, is a highly contagious vaccine-preventable disease that’s particularly dangerous for the youngest infants. It can cause vomiting and trouble breathing, and serious infections can lead to pneumonia, seizures and, rarely, death.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Dr. Madison Flake, a pediatric resident in Baton Rouge, cared for a baby who was hospitalized during this year’s outbreak. At less than 2 months old, he was sent to the intensive care unit.
“He would have these bouts of very dramatic coughing spells,” Flake said. “He would stop breathing for several seconds to almost a minute.”
Infants are not eligible for their first pertussis vaccine until they’re 2 months old, but they can acquire immunity if their mother was immunized while pregnant.
By late January 2025, two babies had died in Louisiana.
But the Louisiana Department of Health waited two months to send out a social media post suggesting people talk to their doctors about getting vaccinated.
The department took even longer to issue a statewide health alert to physicians, send out a press release or hold a press conference.
Those delays are not typical, according to Dr. Georges Benjamin, the executive director of the American Public Health Association.
“Particularly for these childhood diseases, we usually jump all over these,” said Benjamin, who has led health departments in Maryland and the District of Columbia. “These are preventable diseases and preventable deaths.”
Because infectious diseases spread exponentially, if officials don’t alert the public quickly, they lose a key chance to prevent further infections, said Dr. Abraar Karan, an instructor on infectious diseases at Stanford University who has worked on COVID-19 and mpox outbreaks.
“Time is perhaps one of the most important currencies that you have,” he added.
Amid outbreak, surgeon general stops state vaccine promotion
Because pertussis vaccine immunity wanes over time, cases can ebb and flow over time. But in September 2024, Louisiana health officials started seeing a “substantial” increase in whooping cough cases, part of a national increase in cases.
In late January 2025, physicians inside one Louisiana hospital warned their colleagues that two infants had died in the outbreak.
On Feb. 13, the state’s surgeon general, Ralph Abraham, sent a memo to staff ending the general promotion of vaccines and community vaccine events.
He sent that email a few hours after Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an anti-vaccine activist, won Senate confirmation as the new U.S. health and human services secretary.
Also that day, Abraham posted a public memo on the Louisiana Department of Health’s website. In it, he said public health had overstepped with vaccine recommendations, which, he said, are driven by “a one-size-fits-all, collectivist mentality.” Abraham has called COVID-19 vaccines “dangerous” and has been a vocal supporter of Kennedy.
Four days later, in response to a request from a TV news station in New Orleans, the Louisiana Department of Health confirmed the deaths of two infants from whooping cough for the first time, in an email. WVUE Fox 8 then published the news.
But the Louisiana Department of Health sent out no alerts, according to a review of external and internal communications by NPR and KFF Health News.
Over the next month, two more infants were hospitalized for whooping cough, according to internal health department emails, obtained through a public records request. 
In March, after inquiries from NPR and KFF Health News about the growing number of pertussis cases, the health department put out its first social media communications about the outbreak and offered interviews to other journalists.
Then in May — at least three months after the second infant death — the health department issued what appears to be its first and so far only official alert to physicians. It put out its first press release, and it then held a press conference about pertussis on May 14.
By then, 42 people, three-quarters of whom were not up to date on their whooping cough immunizations, had been hospitalized for whooping cough since the outbreak began, according to the Louisiana Department of Health.
More than two-thirds of those hospitalized were babies under age 1.
For the second year in a row, Louisiana won’t promote the flu vaccine

Throughout the summer, cases of pertussis continued to climb in Louisiana. But there were no further public communications from the Louisiana Department of Health.
NPR and KFF contacted the department for comment on Sept. 25. A spokeswoman did not answer specific questions about the lack of communications but referred to a Sept. 30 post on X by the state surgeon general.
In the post, Abraham said the department “consistently reported cases of pertussis and provided guidance to help residents stay protected” in 2025. He called the pertussis vaccine “one of the least controversial” and said he recommends it to his patients.
The post on X included a year-by-year graphic of pertussis cases that omitted 2024 and 2025. The post also acknowledged for the first time that one of the infant deaths occurred in late 2024.
A ‘train wreck’ of cases and hospitalizations
Louisiana should have started warning the public within days or a week of the first infant’s death, instead of waiting months, said Stanford’s Karan.
“At minimum, it should be like heavy promotion of, ‘Hey, infants are at high risk. They get infected by people who have waning immunity. If you haven’t gotten vaccinated, get vaccinated. If you have these symptoms, get tested,'” Karan said.
While deaths from a vaccine-preventable illness are tragic, they can also serve as an opportunity to educate the public about the benefits of vaccines and try to save lives, according to Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, a former health secretary for Maryland, and a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
“The risk of pertussis is always there, but when you have two infant deaths it’s a really good opportunity to communicate that this is a real threat to the health of children,” Sharfstein said.
By not acting more quickly, Karan said he believes the department may have set itself up for a worse outbreak.
“Because then what we see is this train wreck thereafter, of like an insanely large outbreak, a lot of hospitalizations,” Karan said.
The outbreak continued
As of Sept. 20, Louisiana had counted 387 cases of whooping cough in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The previous 35-year high was 214 cases, in 2013.
Until the Sept. 30 post on X, the Louisiana Department of Health did not appear to put out any public communications about pertussis over the preceding four months, as hospitalizations continued and case levels surpassed the 2013 levels.
The health department should be responding aggressively and consistently, said Dr. Joseph Bocchini, the president of the Louisiana Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
“Where people are updated on a regular basis and reminded of what needs to be done,” he said. “Get your vaccines. Moms, if you’re pregnant, get vaccinated. And if you have a cough illness, see your doctor.”

State Ports Authority, detailed his plans for aggressive growth during his first State of the Port speech before roughly 1,100 members of South Carolina's maritime industry Tuesday in North Charleston. (Photo by English Hurteau, Courtesy of SC Ports)NORTH CHARLESTON – Seeking to rein in costs while at the same time boost cargo in a market roiled by tariffs and global economic shifts, Micah Mallace said Tuesday the S.C. State Ports Authority will sharpen its focus toward those things that can make a rapid positive impact.
“Our capital investments will be tied exclusively to revenue-generating opportunities,” said Mallace, who took over as the authority’s president and CEO on Oct. 13.
Speaking to roughly 1,100 statewide maritime leaders during his first State of the Port speech, Mallace said the authority’s “focus now turns to achieving immediate growth.”
It’s a stark reversal from previous years in which the authority, owner and operator of the Port of Charleston, laid out plans and money for long-term projects without the promise of a quick return, such as a second berth at the Leatherman Terminal and an adjacent rail yard that’s far over budget and well behind schedule.
Mallace said the rail yard, once slated for a July 1 debut, will now open “at the right time,” declining to put a specific date on its completion.
“We will expand to meet the needs of our customer base,” he said. “We’re not shy about investments, but we might tweak a little bit or delay investments.”
He said the agency’s budget, cargo and other goals going forward “must be achievable, not hopes and dreams.”
Mallace played a key role in convincing Walmart to build an import distribution center on authority-owned land when he was the agency’s top sales executive in 2022, and he told industry leaders he wants to see more deals like that.
“We will monetize our real estate as an incubator for growth projects,” he said, adding “we will use our heft in the market to back momentum-changing projects, whether that’s our balance sheets, operational considerations, special pricing or whatever it may be.”
The transition Mallace outlined will take “a couple years of work to get where we are today to where I want to be,” he said.
The U.S. maritime industry is in the midst of a downturn, with imports forecasted to drop by nearly 3 percent nationwide this year and by double digits in the early months of 2026.
“Ongoing volatility in U.S. tariff policy is creating significant economic uncertainty, with trade volumes expected to see unpredictable shifts over the next four to six months,” Ben Hackett, founder of maritime analyst Hackett Associates, said in a statement.
Mallace agrees “volatility is really the expectation going forward,” but he thinks Charleston’s port has advantages others around the country don’t have. For example, South Carolina is in the center of the nation’s fastest-growing region and the state ranks No. 1 in job growth and No. 2 in growth of gross domestic product in the Southeast.
Businesses invested nearly $8.2 billion in South Carolina over the past year, and port customers invested more than $786 million into new and expanded manufacturing facilities and distribution centers that created 1,200 jobs.
Ocean carriers also added service to the Port of Charleston – growing weekly container services from 26 to 29 – including first-in calls from key markets in Asia and Europe and expanding trade in the growing India market.
“We are exceptionally fortunate to be in a position where our port’s terminals run exceedingly well and our infrastructure offers ample opportunity for the foreseeable future,” Mallace said.
But he added he’s not satisfied with the 2.8 percent growth in containerized cargo the authority netted in fiscal 2025, which ended on June 30.
“There is work to be done, but there is also opportunity and cause for optimism,” he said. “There will be challenges, but they are surmountable … Generating growth necessitates a momentum change, and momentum change requires bold initiatives. This is a region where one can engineer above-market growth, and that is exactly what we intend to do.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/micah-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 16:57:06.061721

Old Knox County Courthouse. Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee LookoutThe Knox County Commission voted to temporarily shelve a pair of proposed ordinances that would compel nonprofits receiving county grants to pledge not to serve immigrants without legal status.
The vote on Monday paused consideration of the ordinances for six months. It came after a procession of clergy, nonprofit workers, activists and citizens stood before the panel of commissioners to deliver impassioned pleas against them. No one expressed support for the measures during a public comment period.
“You are proposing to penalize Knoxvillians for being good. You would turn food pantries, clinics and shelters into checkpoints and faithful servants into informants,” said Matthew Nance, a Knox County resident. 
Nance was among the majority of speakers who cited scripture in opposing the measures.
“You would threaten directors for refusing to betray what Christ commands: to feed the hungry, welcome the stranger and heal the wounded,” he said. 
But Commissioner Andy Fox, a cosponsor of the measures, chided many of the members of the public who spoke by name, telling one, “you do not rightly divine the Bible.”
“The people that like to bring up the Bible and say what would Jesus do …first of all the Bible, as I like to put it, is a book of personal piety not public policy,” Fox said. 
“Now you can derive values from the Bible that you apply in public situations, but primarily the Bible is the book that is the Gospel message to the world and its primary focus is to draw attention to the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ and the need for repentance,” he said. 
The two ordinances were initially introduced by Commissioner Angela Russell, an accountant who said the county should more strictly monitor nonprofits that receive county funds. The ordinances require more stringent audits and detailed reporting of expenditures.
One ordinance would attach the new requirements to nonprofits receiving funding via the county’s hotel tax; the other applies to general funds distributed to nonprofits. 
Fox subsequently added a clause to the ordinances requiring nonprofit executive directors to provide sworn statements, subject to penalty of perjury, that no county funding is used to provide services to “any person or persons residing in, staying in, or visiting Knox County while in violation of U.S. immigration laws.”
Knox County issued $1.9 million in grants to charitable foundations through its general fund. The amount distributed to charitable funds through its hotel tax was not immediately available. Altogether, public officials said that the total amount granted to nonprofits is less than 1% of the county’s budget.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Facebook’s parent company is asking Washington’s high court to overturn what the state’s attorney general has called the largest campaign finance penalty in the nation’s history.
Meta argues the Washington campaign finance law used to justify the $35 million fine violates the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The company also argues that the punishment, for not providing required records for digital campaign advertisements hosted on its platform, is excessive and misguided. 
The state attorney general’s office, which sued Meta in 2020, says provisions of the law are necessary to inform voters about who is spending money to influence Washington elections. Gov. Bob Ferguson was leading the attorney general’s office when the case was filed. 
“This purpose is even more urgent today, given the targeted and ephemeral nature of digital media, yet Meta has repeatedly and intentionally violated our law,” said deputy solicitor general Cristina Sepe, as the state and Meta argued their cases before state Supreme Court justices Tuesday.
Meta was represented in court by Rob McKenna, the former two-term Republican state attorney general and 2012 gubernatorial candidate.
It could be months before the court issues a ruling. 
Washington’s Fair Campaign Practices Act, first enacted in 1973, now requires advertisers like Meta to maintain records related to campaign ads they run, including the cost of the ad, its sponsor, the targeted audience and other information. The advertisers must make this information available for inspection upon request.
In 2020, Ferguson sued Meta, known at the time as Facebook, alleging the social media conglomerate intentionally violated the state’s campaign finance law hundreds of times by not disclosing some of this information. Meta has an Ad Library that includes some but not all of the records required under Washington’s statute, judges have found.
A King County Superior Court judge sided with the attorney general, ordering Meta to pay $35 million for its violations. Two-thirds of that penalty would go to a state account dedicated to transparency and the other third to the state for attorney fees. 
Finding nothing stopped Meta from complying with the law, a panel of state appeals judges upheld the lower court’s ruling last December, leading the company to appeal to the state Supreme Court. 
The state’s legal saga with Meta over not including some of these records dates back to 2018, when Washington first sued the company over the issue. Meta agreed to pay about $200,000 in damages at the time. 
Later that year, Meta announced it would no longer accept campaign advertisements in Washington. However, the ads still appeared. 
Google has also voluntarily announced a moratorium on selling ads for state and local elections in Washington, following similar legal action from the state. Yahoo also doesn’t permit political ads in Washington, either.
Meta says this indicates Washington’s law runs afoul of the First Amendment, arguing it has basically banned some political speech. 
In 2019, a federal appeals court struck down a similar law in Maryland as a “content-based regulation on speech,” in a lawsuit brought by news outlets. The state attorney general argues the Maryland case doesn’t apply here because it focused on burdens on the media.
The company believes the burden of disclosure should lie with the sponsors of these advertisements themselves.
The Facebook parent also argues the companies’ prohibitions on selling campaign advertisements especially disenfranchise political outsiders who can buy digital ads for cheap but still reach a lot of voters.
Still, digital campaign advertising has more than doubled over the past few years, from $7 million in 2020 to $15 million in 2024, according to a legal filing from the League of Women Voters of Washington and other civic advocacy groups. 
Meta argues the courts have wrongfully fined the company $35 million, as the penalty is based on the number of advertisements in question, not the number of requests it received to inspect the ad records — 12 from three requesters. 
The state said in court filings that Meta can afford it, noting the $25 million it agreed to pay President Donald Trump earlier this year for suspending his Facebook and Instagram accounts.
Meanwhile, the company says it may make as little as $1 per ad, while facing steep compliance costs or fines.
“It just isn’t worth it for these neutral platforms to accept the ads,” McKenna said.

Justice Sheryl Gordon McCloud said the punishment raises “significant Eighth Amendment issues about the disproportionality between the penalty and the transgression.” 
Sepe said this way of calculating the punishment promotes transparency.

Patrick Morrisey announced Tuesday the state would contribute “up to $13 million” to the state’s two food banks — Facing Hunger in Huntington and Mountaineer Food Bank in Gassaway. 
He called on West Virginians to match the state’s contribution. 
“West Virginians in the past have shown that they come together during times like this,” Morrisey said. “We take care of our neighbors. We roll up our sleeves. We get things done. So today, I’m calling on all of us across West Virginia — individuals, families, businesses, people who care about the needy in our state, to step up. 
“We want to come together, and we want to help the people who might need that assistance or not be able to gain access to their SNAP benefits,” Morrisey said. 


To donate to Facing Hunger, visit the agency’s website. Donations can be made to Mountaineer Foodbank here. 
Families who need assistance finding local pantries may call 211 or visit wv211.org.


As the federal government marked nearly 30 days of being shut down, the U.S. Department of Agriculture — which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — posted over the weekend “there will be no benefits issued” Nov. 1.
The SNAP program, formerly known as food stamps, helps feed about 275,000 West Virginians, or one in six state residents. 
Mountaineer Food Bank serves 48 counties in West Virginia. Facing Hunger serves 12 counties in the state as well as parts of Ohio and Kentucky. All donations to the organizations through this donation drive will be split 50/50 to each organization, Morrisey said.
Morrisey said that money paid by the state to support the food banks is from funds that “had come in from the COVID era and that had been sitting there.” He did not specify what fund exactly, saying only that it was one of the state’s contingency funds.
A portion of the money coming from the state will be paid out as soon as Wednesday, Morrisey said. He did not know exactly how much would be made immediately available, but said it would be at least “millions of dollars up front to each of the food banks.”
“[That’s] just to make sure that they’re having the resources to begin to buy the food and do those things, and then we’re going to evaluate based upon the [individual] donations,” Morrisey said. “We’re going to be communicating in real time, but we want to get the upfront monies out to start the process.”
To help handle the expected influx of need across West Virginia over the next few days and weeks, Morrisey said that the state’s National Guard was also going to be activated. State Adjutant General James Seward said that activation would be for up to 200 members of the National Guard. Depending on what the needs are, it’s likely that all 200 won’t be working at the same time.
Seward said the Guard’s role will be meeting needs as they arise from both the food banks and the state’s 211 help line. It could include doing meal deliveries or holding mobile food pantries in communities that don’t have existing feeding organizations.
Caitlin Cook, the director of Advocacy and Public Policy at Mountaineer Food Bank, said individuals at her organization have already been in discussions with the Guard. It’s likely, she said, that the partnership will prove helpful when it comes to supporting smaller community partners who are often short on staff, but exist in places with high need.
Morrisey’s announcement Tuesday came after Democrats in the state House of Delegates called on him to use contingency funds to make the SNAP payments for the month of November, as families prepare for Thanksgiving. 
Last week the governor expedited $1.1 million in funding that was already headed for feeding programs in the state and urged people to donate to food banks. In the letter, the Democrats called Morrisey’s moves “Band-Aids” that will help momentarily. “Systematic change and monumental assistance are crucial at this moment,” they wrote. “And we must act now.”
That $1.1 million for the food banks was allocated during the state Legislative session and, according to Cook, was meant to support their work throughout a full fiscal year. Now, though, the most pressing need is buying food for immediate distribution, meaning the funds won’t be available for future needs.
“Obviously the most important thing that food banks and food pantries can have access to right now is purchasing power for food,” Cook said. “And that’s what Gov. Morrissey has done with these two actions.”
But factors are compounding and the purchasing power of that food could be difficult to exercise since the increased need is existing nationwide. Feeding organizations have already voiced concerns over challenges in accessing protein-rich, healthy foods for their clients in normal times.
Now, as all 50 states see food insecurity increase due to the pause on SNAP, that could become even more difficult.
“We’re talking about several different groups of people right now that we’re responsible for feeding and, hopefully, feeding nutritious, healthy meals,” Cook said. “You have federal employees not being paid, you have people who [won’t] receive their SNAP benefits, but you also have people where their main access point to food assistance all the time is food banks and pantries — they don’t get SNAP. So now the system they rely on exclusively is facing additional pressure.”
Earlier Tuesday, more than two dozen Democrat-controlled states sued the Trump administration for refusing to fund SNAP during the government shutdown. The food stamp program helps feed roughly 42 million people nationwide. The states are asking a federal judge to require Trump to fund the program with emergency reserve funding. 
Meanwhile, West Virginia Attorney General J.B. McCuskey joined a coalition of 18 Republican attorneys general who are calling on Democrats in the U.S. Senate to pass a clean continuing resolution to “save SNAP benefits.” The AGs sent a letter to U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-NY.
“It is time for Democrats to step up to the plate and join Republicans to pass a clean continuing resolution to help those who need help most,” McCuskey said in the news release. “The American people should not be pawns in this game that has gone on for far too long. The time to act is now.”

The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts, has more than two dozen Democratic attorneys general on board. It also names U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Booke Rollins and U.S. Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought as defendants.
“It is clear President Trump and his USDA are making a deliberate, illegal, and inhumane choice to not fund the SNAP program during the federal government shutdown despite the availability of contingency funds,” Weiser said in a statement, referring to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. “The government is legally required to make payments to those who meet the program requirements.”

SNAP is a federal safety net program that provides about $120 million in direct benefits to 600,000 Coloradans per month. Money for the program comes from annual congressional appropriations, which lapsed at the beginning of the month as a result of the ongoing federal government shutdown.
SNAP benefits cost about $8.3 billion per month in the previous fiscal year.
The lawsuit alleges that a USDA memo from the end of September acknowledges the existence of multi-year contingency funds “available to fund participant benefits in the event that a lapse occurs in the middle of the fiscal year.”
Those funds include $3 billion appropriated in 2024 and another $3 billion appropriated in 2025. There is also over $23 billion in the department’s so-called Section 32 account, which is funded in part by customs duties. The federal government drew money from that account earlier this month to partially fund the Women, Infants and Children program, or WIC.
On Oct. 10, however, USDA then advised SNAP agencies that there would not be enough money to cover November benefits if the shutdown continues. Last week, USDA issued a memo saying it could use the available money only when there is an insufficient appropriation and that currently an appropriate for SNAP does not exist.
“USDA’s claim that the SNAP contingency funds cannot be used to fund SNAP benefits during an appropriation lapse is contrary to the plain text of the congressional appropriations law, which states that the reserves are for use ‘in such amounts and at such times as may become necessary to carry out program operations,’” the lawsuit reads.
Republicans continue to blame Democrats for the shutdown. A banner at the top of the USDA website reads “Senate Democrats have now voted 12 times to not fund the food stamp program, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Bottom line, the well has run dry.” It is one of many politicized messages across the federal government released recently.
Republicans hold the majority in both chambers of Congress, but need Democratic support in the Senate under current rules to pass a government funding deal. Democrats oppose the funding bill, primarily because it does not extend enhanced tax credits for people who buy health insurance on individual marketplaces.

Michelle Lujan Grisham speaks Sept. 2, 2025 at an event announcing a $120 million quantum computing partnership with a federal agency, part of her effort to make the state the “home of quantum computing.” Her economic adviser asked a legislative committee on Oct. 27, 2025 to consider legislation approving $150 million in tax credits for new quantum investment. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)Seeking to cement New Mexico’s place as the home of quantum computing, a top state economic development official told a legislative committee Monday that he hopes the Legislature will approve up to $150 million in tax credits for individuals and companies who come here to work in the burgeoning field.
Quantum computing refers to an emergent technology that uses elements of quantum mechanics to process complicated information more quickly than current technology can.
As Alex Greenberg, the governor’s economic development adviser explained it, unlike regular computer bits that are either a “zero” or a “one,” quantum computing uses “quantum bits” or “qubits” that can be a “one or zero simultaneously, or anywhere between a one and zero. And so each qubit is exponentially more powerful than its parallel in the classic computing realm.”
The increased computing power could mean rapid advances in cybersecurity and medicine, Greenberg said. 
“You can imagine the opportunities, in terms of breakthroughs of novel pharmaceuticals that are for a full range of ailments, which is really exciting,” he said. 
The technology is likely years away from maturing, Greenberg said, but he listed off multiple companies that have put down roots in New Mexico, along with state universities that are beginning partnerships with those companies, to train a future workforce. 
New Mexico Governor announces new federal quantum computing partnership

Like companies that made picks and shovels to enable the 20th century Gold Rush, the burgeoning quantum industry is hiring now, Greenberg said, to build the necessary tools for quantum development. One of those tools is “dilution refrigeration,” he said, which creates conditions colder than outer space.  
“People project that quantum computing won’t become a reality until maybe the end of this decade, maybe midway through the next decade, but there’s a lot of picks and shovels, companies that are already profitable and already creating meaningful economic development opportunities,” he said.
This year, the company Quantinuum opened a research and development facility in New Mexico. It joins other private sector and government quantum startup efforts in the state, including the state-funded Roadrunner Quantum Venture Studio and the federally funded Quantum Tech Hub. 
In early September, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced a $120 million partnership with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency — the research and development wing of the U.S. Department of Defense — to ensure companies can deliver on their proofs of concept for quantum computing.
But Greenberg said the Legislature needs to add incentives to ensure highly skilled researchers and highly profitable companies don’t leave the state. He asked lawmakers to re-introduce legislation that died during the legislative session earlier this year. 
Legislation like Senate Bill 211 would offer companies and individuals who invest at least $3 million in quantum facilities the opportunity to receive up to 30% of their investments back via tax credits, up to $50 million per facility. 
The bill died without being heard in the Senate Tax, Business and Transportation Committee. 
In total, the bill would have allowed for tax expenditures of at least $75 million and up to $150 million if the state had received a National Science Foundation grant called the Regional Innovation Engine award grant. 
The grant provides states or regions up to $160 million to spur research and development of new technologies. According to the NSF’s September announcement, New Mexico was not among 15 finalists for the grant. 
Greenberg on  Monday attributed New Mexico missing out to federal cuts to the NSF. But he still said the full $150 million is necessary to spur innovation, retain talent and beat out other states that are trying to create their own quantum industries. 
“The [intellectual property] that has driven these tens of billions dollars worth of valuation was created here in New Mexico,” he said, mentioning Sandia National Laboratories and University of New Mexico quantum innovations. “But we’ve captured almost none of that economic development.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MLG-at-Quantum-Annoucement-DP-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-10-28 16:23:36.951557

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice) OKLAHOMA CITY — Oklahoma’s hospitals will be required to post prices for procedures and services online beginning Saturday as part of a new law that could also prohibit them from collecting some outstanding medical debt.
Gov. Kevin Stitt celebrated Senate Bill 889 at a press conference Tuesday and said it was “common sense” legislation working to lower Oklahoma’s health care costs by putting the “power back in the consumer’s hands.” 
“So now, as a patient, you can see the cost of services upfront before you actually go into the hospital,” he said. “You have the opportunity to shop around to find the best service, the best price possible. And we think that’s really, really good. It happens in every other industry, but somehow, the health care industry has done a really good job of hiding the prices and not letting it be transparent with the consumers, but we do it with whether you’re buying a car or going to the grocery store.”
The law, authored by Rep. Mark Lepak, R-Claremore, and Sen. Casey Murdock, R-Felt, requires all Oklahoma hospitals to post the prices of their services on their website, and it authorizes the Oklahoma State Department of Health to oversee compliance and enforcement. 
Hospitals are required to publish prices for at least 300 services, prioritizing their “frequently used” services. 
“While this bill isn’t specifically about health insurance, I think it provides a better informed consumer of those services,” Lepak said. “And over the long run, we want to get control of health care costs and still be the best in the world at delivering services. We’ve got to have a better educated patient population.”
Hospitals that fail to comply with the price transparency law will not be able to collect on a patient’s medical debt. If a patient believes the hospital is noncompliant, they can sue, Lepak said. 
If the Health Department identifies a hospital as noncompliant, the agency will issue a written notice and the hospital must submit a corrective action plan. If the hospital fails to do so, an “administrative penalty” will be imposed and the penalty will be publicized on the department’s website. 
The bill codifies a February executive order from President Donald Trump requiring hospital price transparency. 
The Oklahoma Health Department is charged with overseeing compliance. An agency spokesperson previously said there were no anticipated additional costs for the Health Department to comply with the law. 
A spokesperson for the Oklahoma Hospital Association could not offer comment by the time of publication but the group’s CEO previously told Oklahoma Voice that while the association supports greater transparency, he was concerned about overburdensome government regulation.

Free.,"Judge blocks Trump shutdown layoffs, citing political retribution",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/judge-blocks-trump-shutdown-layoffs-citing-political-retribution,,"WASHINGTON —  The Trump administration cannot carry out layoffs that it announced after the government shutdown began Oct. 1 and is barred from issuing any new layoff notices under a court order issued Tuesday. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston said at the end of an hour-long hearing in the Northern District of California she granted the preliminary injunction because the reductions in force are unlawful and “intended for the purpose of political retribution.”Illston referenced a social media post by President Donald Trump that said, “I can’t believe the radical left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity.”Michael Velchik, a Justice Department attorney representing the government, argued against the judge issuing a preliminary injunction. Velchik said statements from Trump and other administration officials were an expression of policy differences with Democrats and were not evidence of attempted political retribution. The hearing was the latest step in a lawsuit filed in late September. In the month since, attorneys for labor unions have contended the Trump administration’s actions violate federal law, while lawyers for the government have said it’s well within the scope of their authority. Illston, who was nominated to the bench by President Bill Clinton, granted a temporary restraining order in mid-October that she clarified and expanded days later amid a misunderstanding within the administration about its impact.Some layoffs planned pre-shutdown, government saysIllston said during Tuesday’s hearing that she’s likely to schedule an evidentiary hearing over claims that some layoff notices that have gone out during the shutdown were planned before it began, and shouldn’t be subject to any court orders in this lawsuit. Danielle Leonard, an attorney representing the labor unions that brought the case, said she believed that type of hearing could help all involved “get to the heart of” the disagreement. Leonard requested the preliminary injunction cover employees at the Interior Department, Commerce Department’s patent office and the Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights from layoffs until after the judge scheduled that evidentiary hearing. Illston didn’t respond directly to that proposal, but said she planned to release a written version of the preliminary injunction she issued from the bench as soon as Tuesday. Illston said the injunction didn’t apply to employees at the Small Business Administration who received layoff notices in late September, before the shutdown began. Velchik contended that layoff notices issued since the shutdown began were well within the administration’s authority, saying the country does not “have a fossilized executive branch where we cannot reduce the size.”Velchik also told the judge that efforts to lay off federal employees during the shutdown were “the right thing to do, morally. And it’s the democratic thing to do.”",,,,2025-10-28 16:23:36.951557

(Source NM file photo)As New Mexico maintains the highest rate of deaths from alcohol misuse, lawmakers are again considering changes to state liquor tax policy to redirect revenue to treatment options.
Prior bills attempting to do so have failed in the last three legislative sessions, and lawmakers this week continued to express skepticism that changes to tax policy could impact the problem.
In a presentation Monday before the interim Revenue Stabilization and Tax Policy Committee meeting in Santa Fe, state Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez and Rep. Cristina Parajón, both Albuquerque Democrats, noted that for nearly 30 years, New Mexico has had the highest rate of deaths from alcohol use in the United States. During that time, the state’s liquor taxes have remained mostly stagnant.
Currently, the state collects about $50 million annually from taxes from alcohol distributors. Of that, half goes to the general fund to be spent as state revenue. Of the remaining tax revenue, 45% benefits a local DWI grant fund, while another 5% helps fund the state’s drug courts. A final 0.05% — or about $20,000 per year — goes to Farmington for “alcohol treatment and rehabilitation services for street inebriates,” according to state law.
In last year’s legislative session, Sedillo Lopez and Parajón co-sponsored House Bill 417, which would have established higher taxes for distributors along with a new sales tax, but the bill did not advance to a floor vote.  Instead, a small per-glass tax on alcohol, which critics called an industry-friendly bill, passed.
Sedillo Lopez said seeing the patterns of alcohol misuse in her family “replicated in New Mexico over and over again” persuaded her to push for a policy fix.
“I do not believe that we are going to move the needle in this state until we get a handle on the misuse of alcohol in this state, and that’s why I got on board,” Sedillo Lopez told the committee. “It also didn’t seem fair to me that the alcohol tax, which is extremely regressive, hasn’t been changed in 33 years.”
Rep. Micaela Lara Cadena (D-Mesilla), said she “remains quite dubious about where the research lands on the ways our tax policy single-handedly can change behavior,” but said sending tax revenues to impacted communities rather than the state’s coffers was a better policy move.
“There seems to be that one point of agreement, that if we’re collecting tax on alcohol, we don’t need it in the general fund,” Lara Cadena said.
Parajón said that taxation is only a first step, and the Legislature needs to also invest in treatment, behavioral health and housing.
“This is part of the solution, this is not the whole solution,” she said.

Republicans in the legislature last week redrew boundaries for two of North Carolina’s 14 congressional districts — the 1st District and the 3rd District — to create another GOP seat at the behest of President Donald Trump. 
The North Carolina NAACP, Common Cause, and individual voters asked federal judges who are deciding whether the 1st District boundaries used in 2024 are proper to amend their complaint to take into account the new district lines. The district is part of an ongoing lawsuit that includes other congressional districts and some state Senate districts where opponents have claimed boundaries were set to dilute the power of Black voters. A three-judge panel heard arguments in the lawsuit last summer but have not issued an opinion. 
The updated complaint claims that Republicans retaliated against some of the lawsuit’s plaintiffs by drawing them out of the 1st District, where they voted for incumbent U.S. Rep. Don Davis. 
“Construing plaintiffs’ civil rights lawsuit as a ‘sue-until-blue’ tactic, legislative leaders responded to plaintiffs’ lawsuit by targeting Congressional District 1 and plaintiffs for even more extreme vote dilution,” the amended complaint says. 
Another set of voters who sued over the plans asked the judges last week to amend their complaint to include the new 1st District. 
As of Tuesday morning, the judges have not said whether they would allow the amendments. 
In a filing Monday, lawyers for Republican legislative leaders said they did not object to the first plaintiffs’ request to amend their complaint. 
“Legislative defendants do not oppose the Court’s consideration of these new claims and will defend them on the merits,” the Republicans’ lawyers wrote. The Republicans’ lawyers learned that the NAACP plaintiffs also planned to amend their complaint. “Pending further review, legislative defendants do not presently anticipate opposing such a request,” they wrote. 
North Carolina is part of a wave of mid-decade redistricting triggered by Trump’s effort to keep a Republican majority in the U.S. House after next year’s midterm elections. Republicans have a slim hold on the majority and the president’s party typically loses ground in the midterms. 
Texas redrew its congressional districts when Trump asked. California voters will be asked to change that state’s district map to add as many as five Democratic districts. 
Missouri redrew its lines in September to add another Republican seat. Virginia and Indiana joined the redistricting wars this week. 
State legislatures draw new election district boundaries after they receive census population data and usually only draw new lines mid-decade when they’re under court order. 
The 1st District was North Carolina’s only toss-up in 2024. Davis narrowly won a second term last year.
On Tuesday, Davis introduced a bill that would retroactively ban mid-decade redistricting unless a court orders it or a statewide referendum is conducted to comply with the Constitution or the federal Voting Rights Act. 
“The only solution to prevent this ongoing domino-redistricting effect and power struggle between different states is to immediately hit reset.

It’s infuriating for our newsroom, but mostly for Davis, whose reputation and livelihood depend on being a trusted source of factual, nonpartisan information. 
After several angry emails from me, it seems the ads are down, though there are others still circulating that are falsely attributed to WGME.
This episode underscores that, whether we like it or not, the 2026 election is upon us. For the next year, Mainers are going to be subject to an avalanche of deceptive advertising and other dirty political tactics. 
Mainers have already gotten a taste of this with the Democratic Senate primary. Graham Platner’s past statements dismissing military sexual assaults, questioning Black patrons’ tipping habits, demeaning LGBTQ+ people, and criticizing police officers and rural Americans are not only going to haunt him for months, but they’ll be repeated at full volume ad nauseum until the primary on June 9. And if he’s successful, the full weight of the Republican National Senatorial Committee is going to make sure every Maine voter will be picturing that Nazi-affiliated skull and crossbones tattoo in their sleep.
I say this not to undercut the severity of his words or their impact, but because their amplification is evidence that a multimillion dollar political apparatus is fired up, and the 2026 election in Maine is well underway.
Party leaders have estimated Maine’s U.S. Senate election alone could bring in as much as $600 million in political spending. To compare, all three congressional races in 2020 (for Collins’ seat, as well Maine’s two U.S. House districts) totaled about a third of that, roughly $197 million. The bulk of it went to the Senate race between Collins and Democrat Sara Gideon, who lost by 8 points but still had more than $15 million in unspent campaign funds in the bank, which means the airwaves were so saturated that her campaign struggled to spend it all.
Think back to all the mailers, commercials, radio ads, and turn the dial up real loud. Campaigns have now found ways to insert their talking points into every corner of digital life. Thank God Maine has no billboards.
And in the era of AI and deepfakes, a lot of it is going to be misleading, if not outright false, and probably pretty ugly. 
All this noise, vitriol and fake news are sure to drown out real reporting on pressing issues, like the skyrocketing cost of health care, growing food insecurity, rising inflation — the list goes on.
For the next year, we’ll be doing our best to break through this din to make sure our readers get information about what’s happening in their state and communities. Yes, there will be election reporting, but it will be focused on the candidates’ policy positions, records and promises, with an emphasis on what Mainers say they want from their future leaders. 
If you have thoughts about the 2026 election, particularly stories that aren’t being told, please drop me a note — unless you work for Majority Forward. Then we need to talk.

(Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Angelina Leo, an Exeter High School senior, said that without the special education services she received throughout her time in school, she wouldn’t even be able to speak.
Leo, who has physical and learning disabilities, sees herself as an example of why special education works. She can now read and write. She also has siblings who have benefited from special education. That’s why when she heard about cuts and changes to the federal Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, she was “peeved.”
“And then I was scared,” she said Monday at a demonstration in Concord opposing the changes. “Because what does that mean for me going into college, and what does that mean for my younger siblings, some of which need more help than I needed?”
Earlier this month, the Trump administration laid off 466 employees within the Department of Education office responsible for ensuring states are complying with the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The layoffs at the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, which administers roughly $15 billion in federal special education funding, are the latest in a series of cuts to the Department of Education that President Donald Trump and Education Secretary Linda McMahon say is part of their promise to return education policy and governance to the states. Ultimately, the administration says it hopes to shutter the Department of Education entirely. 
Leo said that in elementary school, her teachers told her mother she’d never graduate high school. Now, she’s on pace to graduate and hopes to attend a community college for a few years before going to the University of New Hampshire to study biomedical engineering. She would like to one day create mobility and accessibility devices for people with disabilities.
Louis Esposito, executive director of ABLE NH, the disability rights organization that organized the rally, said IDEA exists because the states weren’t doing their job to begin with.
“Kids were excluded from the classrooms,” he said. “They weren’t even allowed to go to school. And now we’re just going to trust the states to do a good job with it.”
Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have publicly discussed moving special education into the Department of Health and Human Services, a move ABLE NH opposes. Esposito worries that’ll treat special education “like a medical factory.”
“Students with disabilities are students,” he said. “They’re not just people with disabilities. They are students first.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/leospecialeducation-1024x685.jpg,,,2025-10-28 15:57:36.140338

Nearly two dozen Michigan House Republicans have signed on to a resolution calling for Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to share the state’s complete voter rolls with the Trump administration, without redactions of potentially sensitive identifying information.
Michigan is one of several states being sued by the U.S. Justice Department over their refusal to share unredacted voter rolls in response to requests from the agency. Benson shared some of Michigan’s voter roll — the parts accessible to any member of the public — but withheld personal identifying information, such as Social Security numbers.
The GOP-backed resolution, which was debated at a hearing Tuesday in the House Election Integrity Committee, calls for the secretary of state to share an unredacted copy of Michigan’s computerized statewide voter registration list, also known as the qualified voter file, with federal officials.
“It is inconceivable, in fact unconscionable, that the chief election officer in Michigan refuses to comply with our nation’s top law enforcement official,” Rep. Joe Fox, a Republican from Fremont and the sponsor of the resolution, said at the hearing. “Who does she think she is?”
When questioned by Rep. Stephen Wooden, D-Grand Rapids, Fox appeared unaware that the state had already submitted a redacted voter roll to the Justice Department, saying he was “maybe one of the most confused.” After Wooden provided the date that the file was submitted, Fox said he’d look into it.
The committee approved the resolution 6-3 along party lines.
Rep. Rachelle Smit, a Republican from Martin and chair of the committee, said she appreciated the resolution, as Benson “has been obstructing the work of this committee, the work of this legislature.” Smit and the House GOP have been in a fight with Benson’s agency for months over access to election manuals and whether the Department of State is providing information as required by law to the Legislature.
In total, 23 Michigan House Republicans signed on to the resolution.
The resolution was first introduced on Oct. 23. Early the next day, the Michigan Department of State put out a video and a news release arguing that both state and federal law forbids Benson from sharing personal information.
“Why do they want access to your personal information?” Benson asks in the video. “Well, I’ve asked them that. Other secretaries of state, both Democrats and Republicans, have asked them that. They won’t tell us. Nobody — not the president, the DOJ or any other federal agency — has the right to your sensitive, private voter information.”
Benson, who is in her final term as secretary of state, is running for governor. Both polling and fundraising indicate she’s the likely frontrunner for the Democratic nomination.
The Privacy Act of 1974 requires the federal government to provide adequate notice for the collection of public information as well as an explanation for how that information will be used. Other state and federal laws may also prevent the release of such information.
The House resolution acknowledges that concern and says the Justice Department has indicated the data will be kept secure. It also points to several other federal laws — the Civil Rights Act of 1960, the Help America Vote Act and the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 — cited by the Justice Department as reasons that Michigan could be obligated to share the data.
Other states have also refused the Trump administration’s requests for complete, unredacted voter rolls, and have been sued by the Justice Department. Al Schmidt, Pennsylvania’s secretary of the commonwealth, called the request “a concerning attempt to expand the federal government’s role in our country’s electoral process.” In Maine, the state’s secretary of state told the administration to “go jump in the Gulf of Maine,” an allusion to a similar rebuff years earlier by Mississippi’s then-secretary of state.
The federal lawsuit against Michigan is ongoing, according to court records, with next steps expected in mid-November.

Smart Tech for Caregivers should empower people, provide peace of mind, help people stay safe and protect their privacy… and never overwhelm them.
 
By George D. Rotsch, Editor and Publisher of Delaware LIVE
WILMINGTON, Del. — Across Delaware, a new generation of caregiving leaders is using Smart Tech for Caregivers that combines compassion with innovation to help older adults live safely and comfortably at home.
At Easterseals in New Castle, Nancy Ranalli gives caregivers hands-on access to assistive technology that promotes independence. At Griswold Home Care, Patrick Gray integrates AI-based systems that support safety and peace of mind. And through the Alzheimer’s Association, Kristina Fransel connects families with a powerful new mobile app that puts expert guidance right at their fingertips.
Together, they represent a growing movement that blends human care and smart technology — giving families the tools to keep loved ones safe, connected, and independent, while supporting caregivers who shoulder the daily responsibility of care.
“This is where independence and dignity meet technology,” said Ranalli, Director of Community Outreach & Assistive Technology for Easterseals Delaware & Maryland’s Eastern Shore. “These devices can help Mom or Dad be safer and more independent at home — and give the caregiver peace of mind.”
A Hands-On Hub for Independence
At Easterseals’ Caregivers Resource & Technology Center on Corporate Circle in New Castle, Ranalli leads tours that showcase more than 200 devices — everything from low-tech tools to AI-enabled systems that redefine caregiving.
Visitors can see:• an inflatable bathtub for bed-bound care;• easy-grip toothbrush holders and plates designed for one-handed use;• mats that alert caregivers when someone gets out of bed;• sensors connected to refrigerators, microwaves, or doors that confirm when meals or medication have been taken;• a walker that converts to a wheelchair;• large-button phones and voice-activated smart speakers;• a robotic pet that mimics human interaction;• clothing with magnetic fasteners instead of buttons; and• gardening tools adapted for older hands.
“These devices can enable the caregiver to help Mom or Dad be more independent, have dignity, and be safer at home — while giving the caregiver some peace of mind,” Ranalli said.
She and her team also help families compare features, explain funding options, and learn how to integrate each tool into daily routines. Ranalli has expanded the program statewide, including a growing assistive-tech resource site at the Milford Wellness Village.
“The right device can change a person’s daily life,” she added. “Something as simple as a smart light or automatic stove shut-off can prevent an accident. These aren’t luxuries — they’re lifelines.”

AI Technology Extends the Reach of Care
Across New Castle, Patrick Gray, owner and director of Griswold Home Care for New Castle County, is taking those same principles into clients’ homes — blending professional caregiving with AI and smart technology that reduce stress for families and staff alike.
Gray, a Certified Dementia Practitioner with more than 15 years in senior-care leadership, is integrating technologies that complement human caregivers rather than replace them.
“We use AI to help people stay connected and to help caregivers manage smarter,” Gray said. “The goal is always more personal time and less paperwork.”
Among the innovations his agency employs or recommends:


Remote care platforms that let families check schedules, communicate with aides, and receive real-time updates.


AI companions, such as interactive voice assistants that engage clients with dementia, track mood, and notify caregivers of changes.


Smart-home devices — fall detectors, medication dispensers, and emergency alert systems — coordinated through Griswold’s care dashboard.


Predictive scheduling tools that use AI to match caregivers with clients, preventing burnout.


TV-based virtual-visit systems that make telehealth simple for older adults.


Newer AI-enabled systems can even “listen” for signs of trouble without using cameras — protecting privacy while improving safety. These devices can distinguish the sound of a television from a cry for help, or the clatter of a dropped dish from the crash of a broken window. They can tell the difference between a basket of laundry hitting the floor and a fall in the bathroom — and instantly alert a caregiver or neighbor.
“Technology is evolving quickly, but the human need isn’t changing,” Gray said. “Seniors need technology to enable and protect them — not to rob them of privacy and dignity. At the same time, caregivers don’t need technology to replace human care; they need it to provide peace of mind — a little assurance that if they can’t be there, Mom is still going to be okay.”
“These tools strengthen the human side of care,” he added. “They help us notice changes sooner and give families reassurance that Mom or Dad is doing well.”

An App for Knowledge and Support
While Ranalli and Gray focus on hands-on and in-home technology, Kristina Fransel, Executive Director of the Alzheimer’s Association Delaware Valley Chapter, highlights the importance of information access — and how the organization’s new My ALZ Journey app empowers caregivers in a different way.
“This app is all about putting trusted guidance and resources directly into the hands of caregivers — anytime, anywhere,” Fransel said.
The My ALZ Journey app offers:


Personalized Support: Tailored content based on whether you’re a caregiver or someone living with dementia, your age, and your location.


Step-by-Step Guidance: Tools to navigate early-stage planning, daily independence, and care routines.


Local Resources: Connections to nearby Alzheimer’s Association chapters, support groups, and programs.


Interactive Tools: Checklists, planning templates, and activities to stay engaged and organized.


Privacy-First Design: No account required, no tracking — just easy access to help when it’s needed most.


“Access to information about all kinds of challenges that caregivers face, right at your fingertips, can make the difference between protecting someone or improving the quality of life for a loved one,” Fransel said.
The app complements the hands-on tech demonstrated at Easterseals and the in-home AI tools that Patrick Gray’s team uses — forming a trio of support for Delaware families navigating dementia and elder care.

Partners in the Future of Aging
Together, leaders like Ranalli, Gray, and Fransel are redefining what it means for Delawareans to age where they wish to be — combining compassion, design, and smart innovation.
At Easterseals, the focus begins with understanding how small devices restore confidence. At Griswold, the emphasis is on leveraging AI and smart systems to support caregivers and anticipate needs. And at the Alzheimer’s Association, technology connects caregivers with education, planning tools, and community in real time.
All agree that technology must serve people, not the other way around.
“Technology should empower people, not overwhelm them,” Ranalli said. “When caregivers and families feel supported, everyone benefits.”

See the Technology Firsthand
The Easterseals Caregivers Resource & Technology Center is open to the public, and families are encouraged to explore the tools in person or take a virtual tour online. Caregivers in Sussex and Kent counties can schedule a virtual visit to see how these devices can fit into their homes.
“Seeing the devices in action makes all the difference,” Ranalli said. “Call us, come in, and we’ll help you find what works for your life.”
Meanwhile, Patrick Gray welcomes families, caregivers, and healthcare partners to schedule private consultations about integrating AI-based caregiving tools, safety monitoring, and smart-home systems.
“These aren’t gadgets,” Gray said. “They’re practical tools designed to protect seniors, support caregivers, and make life a little easier for everyone.”
And for families managing memory care, Fransel encourages caregivers to download the My ALZ Journey app or contact the Alzheimer’s Association’s 24/7 Helpline for immediate support and local resources.

(Getty Images)Anthony, one of my 5th graders, told me often that he hated school. I knew he didn’t hate learning.  He focused intensely on the things he was interested in, like maps, flags, and musical instruments. But when Anthony’s attention wandered in class, his teachers would take away his flag art and gas station maps  and turn off his music. He would leave his classroom to escape frustration. Why even come to school at all? He’d ask me. 
Anthony is not the only one. In Arkansas, chronic absenteeism, defined as missing  10 percent or more of the school year, has been on the rise since the Covid-19 pandemic. The number of chronically absent public school students in our state is a staggering 23%.  Chronic absenteeism disproportionately affects at-risk and minority students like Anthony for whom long-term consequences include delays in reading and math proficiency. 
Luckily, Anthony found a refuge: Our music room. When things got overwhelming, he’d hide under the piano. One day, he told me: “I only come to school on time on Tuesdays, because that’s when we have music. I wish I could have music on other days too.”
I needed Anthony to come to school every day so I made that happen. I started a before-school music practice time. There was no sign-up sheet, no requirements — just an open door. Students could come in as soon as the building opened and practice whatever we were learning in class. At first, that meant keyboards. Later, we added more instruments. One day, my own child asked, “Why can’t we be a band?” And just like that, the Ukulele Band was born.
The impact was immediate. More and more students showed up early, not just Anthony. Within a few years, 60 out of the 100 4th and 5th graders I taught were starting their day in the music room instead of lingering in hallways or staying home. Attendance improved. Tardiness declined. Behavior issues diminished. And most importantly, Anthony and many other students started their days with joy, confidence, and a sense of belonging. Anthony now plays multiple instruments and was recently accepted into an arts middle school.
If we want students to show up, we need to offer meaningful and engaging experiences that start with their interests.  The data is clear:  Breakfast clubs, school music clubs, school music programming, or any school related extracurricular activities all create positive effects on school attendance.  School clubs and programs rooted in genuine student interest, not just remediation or extra academics, are a powerful tool to combat absenteeism, tardiness, and disengagement.  
 Harnessing that power


Build before-school programs around student passion. Not every student loves music, but every student loves something. Whether it’s robotics, poetry, drawing, dance, or coding, schools in Arkansas should invest in before-school programs that reflect student interests. These don’t have to be expensive or formal. Instead, they should be student-centered, consistent, and joyful. For me and my school, it meant opening my door twenty minutes before the first bell. Poll the parents and students at your school and find willing teachers and activities to start the day off with excitement.
Remove barriers to participation. No sign-ups. No permission slips. No fees. Just open doors. Students with chaotic home lives or unreliable transportation shouldn’t be excluded from participation. Flexible, inclusive programs ensure that every student, not just well-resourced students, can benefit.  Have multiple re-entry points so that students who have a late running bus can still benefit from five minutes. I had many students who were daily or occasional bus riders, including Anthony.  On one particularly late day he said, “Thanks for keeping the door open for me. I thought I missed the best part.”
Redefine “learning time.” We talk a lot about “bell-to-bell instruction,” but learning doesn’t only happen during official class periods. When students start their day in a safe, creative space, they’re more emotionally regulated, socially connected, and ready to learn. We must recognize the value of this time, not as “extra,” but essential. Even on days Anthony came late, we were able to have a few moments to center him before he entered the classroom.

One in four students in Arkansas Schools are struggling with chronic absenteeism, and we often look for high-tech solutions or academic interventions. But sometimes the answer is simple: let’s make school a place kids want to be. Anthony is now at school every day on time, and he is one among many who no longer struggle with truancy because of their experience in a before-school music club.  School is where he wants to be.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kid-playing-keyboard-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-28 15:57:36.140338

Glenn Youngkin announces the creation of the Virginia Emergency Nutrition Assistance program, a state-level food assistance program that can operate amid an ongoing federal government shutdown that's placed the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program on pause, on Oct. 28, 2025 in Richmond. (Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/ Virginia Mercury)Virginia’s budget surplus will fund a state-level replacement for the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program should the federal government shutdown continue into November, Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced Tuesday. 
Dubbed Virginia Emergency Nutrition Assistance, or VENA, the newly-created program is expected to send money to SNAP beneficiaries’ Electronic Benefit Transfer cards starting on Nov. 3. 
SNAP typically helps low-income earners and people who can’t work  afford groceries. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the program, has told states to pause payments until further notice, starting Nov. 1. The federal government has been shut down since the beginning of October as members of Congress failed to agree on annual appropriations bills and several attempts at a short-term spending bill that could end the shutdown. 
 VENA’s payments will roll out in weekly waves every Monday, Wednesday and Friday and follow SNAP’s model of disbursing funds to a third of beneficiaries  each time. With SNAP, a third of people are paid on the first of each month, another third gets paid on the fourth and the last group gets their benefits on the 7th. 
Unlike SNAP, however, people can expect VENA money weekly rather than their month’s allotment all at once.
‘It goes quick’: Virginians stretch dollars and hope as SNAP funding freezes

Youngkin estimates that about $37.5 million will be allocated per week to Virginia’s roughly 850,000 SNAP recipients. 
“Because we are designing this in real time, we need to pay the first benefits on a Monday,” Gov. Glenn Youngkin said as he announced details of the new program at the state Capitol on Tuesday afternoon. 
Youngkin acknowledged the “hardship” recipients may face if they had expected their normal SNAP payments on the first of the month, which is a Saturday. To remedy that problem, he directed  $1 million to the state’s network of food banks to help bolster their support. Last week, Virginia’s food banks had cautioned that they could not fully absorb the spike of Virginia’s SNAP beneficiaries that would flock to them for help. 
Youngkin said that he anticipates Virginia can operate the program through the end of next month, but he hopes that Congress can end the shutdown before then. 
 Partisan tensions simmer amid shutdown, social programs held ‘hostage’

The governor cast the blame for the shutdown and impending SNAP freeze on Democrats in Congress, where Republicans hold the majority. 
“To be honest, I think our nation will be in a state of complete disarray if the Democrats in the Senate continue to drag out this complete shutdown and hostage-taking that they have engineered,” Younkgin said. 
He suggested that Democrats in Congress are essentially putting programs like SNAP at risk, which “continues to just absolutely defy any sense of morality.”
His remarks echo that of politicians nationwide, who have played a blame game about who’s at fault for the federal shutdown and its effect on states.
President Donald Trump is on an out-of-country trip to Asia while the U.S. House of Representatives has not gaveled into session in more than a month. The U.S. Senate has continued to meet but has also failed to agree on continuing resolutions. 
A key sticking point for Democrats, has been an attempt to extend expiring Affordable Care Act subsidies that the Republican-controlled Congress left out of their reconciliation bill this summer. 
Those subsidies help low-income people who don’t qualify for Medicaid be able to purchase health insurance on their own. The matter has taken on fresh salience as the reconciliation bill entails forthcoming changes to health care that would cause millions of Americans to lose Medicaid insurance and funding losses to hospitals. The bill took aim at Medicaid in order to boost funding for the U.S. military, U.S. Customs and Immigration and to extend tax cuts that primarily benefit high-income earners. 
“Republicans still control the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. They have, quite literally, the power to stop this,” Virginia’s U.S. senators Tim Kaine and Mark Warner said in a statement provided to The Mercury. “They also had the power to defend nutrition benefits earlier this year, but chose to sell out working families as part of the Big Ugly Law in order to offset the cost of tax breaks for billionaires.”
U.S. Rep. Jen Kiggans, R-Virginia Beach, has agreed with her Democratic colleagues that the ACA subsidies should be extended and  urged her fellow Republicans to address the matter — but she suggested in a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson that Congress take up the matter after ending the shutdown. 
Kaine, Warner and others have also urged the USDA to tap into its $6 billion contingency funding in the interim to support SNAP nationwide. 
 SNAP recipients will have relief for now

The political back-and-forth over the past month has caused stress for local SNAP recipients, including  Richmond resident Asia Broadie, a single mother balancing work, parenting and schooling to become a nursing assistant. 
On a recent trip to the grocery store with The Mercury, she explained which bulk purchases get her through each month and how she’s able to tap into a state program to buy discounted produce. 
“They’re growing and they’re eating — it goes quick,” she said of her children. 
While Virginia’s budget surplus has allowed Youngkin to get creative with short-term solutions, he emphasized Tuesday that each state is different and not all can absorb issues that stem from the federal fallout.
“The National Governors Association has called us to ask us how we are doing this,” Youngkin explained. “We’re leading different states in different circumstances, and I think we have decided that we’re just going to get this done.”

The Jackson City Council voted last week to end a contract with Atlanta-based Flock Safety, the company that provides the gunshot detection devices. Flock must now remove the devices that were installed in south Jackson as part of the city’s 180-day trial period.
The Jackson Police Department requested the council terminate the contract out of concern the city would be charged $250,000 for further use of the devices, according to documents in the city’s meeting agenda packet. 
But several snafus prevented the department from fully testing Flock’s devices, designed to use acoustic sensors and machine learning to detect the sound of gunshots and provide the police with an exact location of the shots in under 60 seconds. 
“We were told that they did not have any data,” Ward 7 Councilman Kevin Parkinson said.
A Flock representative referred all questions to JPD. In a statement, JPD spokesperson Tommie Brown said the technology performed as intended but that some devices had to be removed in response to resident concerns. 
“We were never able to deploy all the devices, so we were never able to get a full evaluation,” Brown said. 
Brown said 57 devices were installed, covering 1.5 square miles, out of a planned 216. He added that the devices were live and Flock collected the data, but he did not respond to a question about whether the company shared the data with the city.
The company and JPD had sought to install the devices on light poles, but Entergy wanted to charge the city $500 a pop, which JPD did not want to pay, multiple council members told Mississippi Today.
“We ought to be able to use those poles for listening devices if the city wanted to,” Ward 1 Councilman Ashby Foote told Mississippi Today. 
An Entergy spokesperson told Mississippi Today in an email that the utility may require cities to pay an upfront fee to install public safety equipment, such as cameras, license plate readers and gunshot detection systems, “to cover administrative and engineering costs, such as site visits and inspections to ensure the proposed location can accommodate the device.” 
Some devices, then, were placed on freestanding poles in residents’ lawns without their permission, several council members told Mississippi Today. They said they learned this from JPD Capt. Michael Outland during last week’s work session. Outland did not respond to an inquiry from Mississippi Today, and the council’s work sessions generally are not recorded. 
Foote said he thought the technology could be useful for south Jackson, a more sprawling part of the city where residents say they often hear gunshots and experience slow police response times. 
“You could drive around for hours,” he said.  
The city of Jackson also has a contract with Flock for license plate readers, as do other cities around the state, including Ocean Springs and Pontotoc. 
Similar crime-detecting technology has been criticized for violating civil liberties and for the accuracy of the machines, with some failing to distinguish between gunshots and fireworks. Cities across the country have recently cancelled contracts with similar companies, outlets have reported, citing the recording devices as a “Band-Aid,” not a solution, to crime. 
As part of the “Project Prove It” trial period, an order form in the council’s agenda packet shows the department had requested “Raven” devices to cover 3.5 miles of the city. When the council initially OK’d the contract with Flock earlier this year under the previous mayoral administration, then-Chief Joseph Wade said the devices would be installed in south Jackson, WLBT reported.
A picture of Flock’s “deployment tracker” that was included in the council’s agenda packet depicts seven south Jackson addresses where devices were placed near the McDowell Square Shopping Center, including the Fourth Episcopal District CME Church on Robinson Road. On Monday, a black pole carrying Flock’s Raven device was still stuck into the grass in front of the church’s street sign.

A few months ago, Beverly Dixon, the church secretary, said she pulled into work to see a man who did not appear to be a police officer installing the black pole. She didn’t know what it was until speaking to a Mississippi Today reporter. 
“I don’t ask any questions, because I consider this part dangerous,” she said. 
It’s not gunshots that worry Dixon, though – she says she never hears them. Instead, it is the homeless people who sleep on the church’s steps. Dixon said she calls the police, but the last time she did, she was stuck in her car on a rainy day for an hour waiting for them to respond. 
“They take their time,” she said. 
The Flock test period was supposed to begin at the date the first device was installed, which was Aug. 4, but JPD counted the 180-day grace period from the date the city signed the contract, April 23.
JPD said its partnership with Flock remains and the department will continue to evaluate the company’s devices for future use. 
“Our decision to pause the Flock Raven project reflects our commitment to balancing technological advancement with the concerns and expectations of our residents,” JPD interim Chief-Sheriff Tyree Jones said in a statement. “We look forward to continuing our partnership with Flock Safety and will evaluate this system in the future as we work toward sustainable, community-driven public safety solutions.”
The Jackson City Council wants to try again with a different company when a new police chief is put in place, multiple council members told Mississippi Today. 
“Going forward, I think they got lessons learned,” Ward 5 Councilman Vernon Hartley said of JPD. “We’ll still be dead set on getting those things in place.”
Lashia Brown-Thomas, the Ward 6 councilwoman and a former JPD officer, said in her experience, the police have a 50-50 chance of catching the perpetrators when they respond to a “shots fired” call. 
“By the time the officers get there, (the shooters) will be gone,” she said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/27172100/DSC_0579.jpg,,,2025-10-28 15:17:05.271496

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — The state’s emergency relief fund is accepting donations to help stock food banks ahead of the impending halt of federal grocery assistance amid the ongoing federal government shutdown.
Benefits in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly called food stamps, will stop Nov. 1. More than 556,000 low-income people in South Carolina rely on the aid, uploaded to debit cards, to help them pay for groceries each month, according to the Department of Social Services.
If there’s any money remaining on SNAP debit cards from previous monthly allotments, the credit won’t disappear. People can continue to spend any unused money from October or previous months, according to DSS. But no money will show up for November unless Congress approves some sort of spending.

Those who can’t afford groceries are turning to food banks, which are already struggling to keep up with the increased demand.
November and December are already busy months because of Thanksgiving and Christmas, the heads of two large food banks said Tuesday. Add to that the loss of SNAP and federal workers who are going without pay, and the food banks are hitting a crisis point, said the leaders of Harvest Hope in the Midlands and Lowcountry Food Bank along the coast.
Donations to the One SC Fund, a statewide philanthropic effort activated in response to disasters, will buy food to help pantries keep their shelves stocked. The State Guard, a volunteer corps, will help volunteers unload truckloads of food, stock shelves and work with law enforcement to make sure everyone stays safe and orderly, said Leon Lott, the guard’s commander and the Richland County sheriff.
Officials acknowledged Tuesday that activating the fund and the State Guard will likely not be enough to feed everyone who uses SNAP. Without the federal money, the fund was the state’s best option to help, Gov. Henry McMaster said during a Tuesday news conference.
“There are very few mechanisms that we have other than the agencies that are already in place, but we have no agency that gives out food,” McMaster said. “That is what the SNAP program is there for.”
Around 70% of SNAP recipients are children or elderly, said DSS Director Tony Catone. No state-level program can fill the gap the program leaves, he said.
“There is nothing that substitutes for SNAP,” Catone said.
Every time One SC Fund is activated, it starts with nothing in the bank, said Georgia Mjartan, president of Central Carolina Community Foundation, which runs the effort. The statewide fund raised a record $6 million in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Helene. That’s a small portion of the $104 million SNAP pays to South Carolinians each month.
Major companies that donated following Helene may be stretched too thin to help out, making individual donations even more important, Mjartan said.


Find a food bank
South Carolina has four regional food pantries that cover the state:

Golden Harvest Food Bank
Harvest Hope Food Bank
Lowcountry Food Bank
Second Harvest Food Bank of Metrolina

The fund will not be an immediate fix. Food banks often require about two weeks to make and receive food orders. Bringing food directly to community members in need or churches that hand out free meals can help get food right to people who need it, Mjartan said.
The One SC Fund is simply a way of coordinating that effort at a state level, she said.
Food banks overrun
Harvest Hope Food Pantry started turning people away from the door at 2 p.m. Monday. A line of hungry families started around 6 a.m., but eight hours later, the shelves at the Columbia food bank were completely empty, CEO Erinn Rowe told the SC Daily Gazette.
“When it’s gone, it’s gone,” Rowe said of the food.
Typically, the food bank serves between 150 and 175 families from its emergency food pantry, which is open daily. That number has grown to around 250 families per day over the past two weeks because of the federal shutdown, Rowe said.

The growing number of families needing food is not sustainable for the food bank, which typically feeds 687,000 people from 20 counties each year, Rowe said.
Last month, 266,000 households received food aid through SNAP.
The region served by Harvest Hope, the state’s largest food bank, includes counties with some of the highest need. In Richland County alone, more than 23,000 families receive grocery aid through SNAP. That’s the most of any county statewide.
Harvest Hope doesn’t have the capacity to provide additional help to everyone receiving SNAP, Rowe said.
“There’s no way we can logistically cover SNAP,” Rowe said. “We’ve never been able to fully meet the need. There are still hungry people, and now it’s going to be 100 times worse.
“I don’t think people fully understand the impact this is going to have,” Rowe added. “It’s going to cause a health crisis.”
Harvest Hope, which typically relies on donations and overstock from local grocery stores, has ordered several extra tractor trailers full of food to replenish its now-sparse shelves, Rowe said. She expects those shipments to be gone as soon as they arrive, she added.
Nick Osborne, president of Lowcountry Food Bank, echoed Rowe’s concerns. For every single meal a food bank provides, SNAP benefits cover nine meals, he said.
“With robust support, food banks can provide only a fraction of the nutritional assistance that feeding programs like SNAP provide,” Osborne said Tuesday.
Other options
Without any promise of Congress stepping in to fund SNAP before the end of the week, South Carolina is among states evaluating their options to keep people from going hungry.
Getting state money to the people who typically use federal funds is not a simple fix, said Catone, the DSS director.
Although South Carolina has a surplus of funds it could potentially use to help fill in the gaps, the federal government would not reimburse the state for anything spent on SNAP, according to a Friday memo from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That could put the state out about $104 million, according to DSS.
Any sort of decision on funding must come from legislators, who are not scheduled to return to the Statehouse until January. Sen. Deon Tedder, D-Charleston, sent McMaster a letter Monday asking him to call legislators back to the Statehouse to come up with a solution.
“There’s something that certainly we can do to figure out how to ensure that people don’t go hungry,” Tedder told the Gazette.

usda-memo-102425 
McMaster said it’s up to legislators to decide whether they will come back and have that debate. Even if legislators decided to come back early, any decisions they made would not offer an immediate fix, McMaster said.
“That is a long, tedious process that may produce nothing,” McMaster said.
Other states have questioned whether state agencies can even load money onto SNAP debit cards without the help of the federal government.
DSS, which administers the program for the state, does not touch SNAP funds, which go straight from the federal government’s coffers to cards distributed by a third-party vendor, Catone said. The USDA instructed states not to send any information about SNAP to those vendors for the month of November, which made officials question whether that applied to state funding as well.
Some states, including Alaska and New Mexico, have determined that directive meant no state money could go toward supplementing SNAP funds.
Rep. Hamilton Grant, D-Columbia, called on McMaster in a separate Monday letter to declare a state of emergency. Grant wanted to see the state Department of Agriculture send more money to food banks and deploy the National Guard at the state’s expense to distribute food in communities and allow state agencies to work with nonprofits to distribute food, according to the letter.
“This is a disaster,” Grant told the Gazette. “We are in an emergency.”
A state of emergency would not solve the monetary issue food banks are facing, McMaster said.
Activating the One SC Fund and the State Guard will give food banks what they need most: money and manpower, he said.
“We have a great network, but what we must have is volunteers and money,” McMaster said. “We must have those two things in order to help out. But I’m confident that we can do it.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/DSC_0408-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 15:17:05.271496

(Courtesy of Malcolm X Memorial Foundation)OMAHA — The Malcolm X Cultural Center redevelopment project in North Omaha has taken a key step forward with the selection of a San Francisco-based architecture and design firm to lead planning and transformation of the 17-acre site that marks the birthplace of the slain human rights leader.
Gensler, a global company with about 6,000 professionals, developed its proposal in partnership with Omaha’s Alley Poyner Macchietto Architecture and Practice of Democracy, based in Trenton, New Jersey, according to the Malcolm X Memorial Foundation, which announced the selection this week.
Buoyed by a $20 million state grant awarded in 2024, the redevelopment site is envisioned to be a national cultural and civic tourist destination.
JoAnna LeFlore-Ejike, executive director of the foundation, said the choice of the design team represents commitment to cultural preservation and an equity-focused process that honors the legacy of Earl and Louise Little and their son Malcolm X, a national human rights leader who in 2024 became the first African American inducted into Nebraska’s Hall of Fame.
“We are excited to move forward with a team that understands the importance of healing spaces, intergenerational exchange and long-term sustainability for our community,” LeFlore-Ejike said.
Influential leader of 20th century
Andre Brumfield, principal and global cities sector leader at Gensler, said the firm, founded in 1965, was honored to work on a project that recognizes “one of the most influential leaders of the 20th century.”

“As we begin the design process, we are committed to building on the Foundation’s long-range vision and ensuring that Malcolm X’s life, legacy and this community’s voice guide our work,” Brumfield said.
Gensler’s approach to elevating underrepresented histories and voices focuses on “regenerative ecology, socio-spatial justice and co-authorship with community stakeholders,” according to a statement. 
Previous museum and cultural projects designed by the firm include the Ford Foundation for Social Justice in New York, the Newark Community Museum in New Jersey, the Black Ensemble Theater in Chicago and the Debbie Allen Dance Academy in Los Angeles.
The design team’s work in North Omaha will include a master site plan that integrates public spaces, gardens and new facilities, including an anchor museum and exhibition space component. Foundation representatives said the overall Cultural Center campus is to proceed in phases and will involve community engagement.
Listening sessions
The foundation earlier this month held community listening sessions where local residents provided input. The design team will conduct a comprehensive assessment of the site’s existing conditions.

Originally, the foundation had requested state funding through the competitive process set up to dole out economic development grants to North and South Omaha from the state’s federal American Rescue Plan Act dollars. The Malcolm X memorial site was not recommended for funding by a consultant, however. 
Amended legislation led by State Sen. Terrell McKinney and then-State Sen. Justin Wayne, both of North Omaha, carved out funds for the campus renovation project that marks Malcolm X’s early childhood home near 35th and Evans Streets. The public dollars are to help activate key parts of a grand plan that’s been in draft form for more than a decade.
Foundation officials said the final master plan led by the Gensler group will inform future fundraising efforts and programming. Houston-based MX Development Group, which has team members in Omaha, is serving as the foundation’s representative and general contractor, managing the overall project execution. 
“It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to design for cultural equity, civic healing and global impact,” said MX founder and Omaha native Jonathan Spellman.

(Photo by Christohper Shea/Rhode Island Current)Nine months after progressive advocates were barred from holding a rally in the State House rotunda ahead of Gov. Dan McKee’s State of the State address, the ACLU of Rhode Island is suing the governor to ensure the area is never roped off from the public again.
The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, claims the governor violated protesters’ First Amendment rights when his office, without notice, reserved the rotunda just 30 minutes before their planned “People’s State of the State” rally on Jan. 14.
Advocates organized by the now-dissolved Black Lives Matter RI PAC had intended to gather in the rotunda to call on McKee to declare a public health emergency to shelter the state’s growing homeless population over the winter.
Blocked from State House Rotunda, ‘People’s State of the State’ moves one story down

But when people started to arrive around 5 p.m., they were met by State and Capitol Police, along with stanchions cordoning off the rotunda stating the space was “reserved for the State of the State through the Department of Administration” from 4:30 to 10 p.m. 
The ACLU’s lawsuit claims protesters were threatened with arrest and told that McKee’s office had instructed police to prevent them from accessing the rotunda and upper floors of the State House.
Eric Hirsch, executive director of the Rhode Island Homeless Advocacy Project and one of the lead plaintiffs in the suit, said he was shocked to see a space routinely used for demonstrations and rallies closed to the public.
“This is unacceptable,” Hirsch said in a statement Tuesday. “We have a right to express our view of the governor’s policies toward people experiencing homelessness.”
McKee’s office did not immediately respond to request for comment. A spokesperson told WPRI in February that the space was needed as an “an overflow area” and “safe, alternative means of egress” for the governor’s speech.
The rotunda remained vacant throughout the 2025 State of the State.
“Upon information and belief, the governor and his staff never intended to use the rotunda for any purpose on January 14, 2025, other than to silence any expressive activity,” the lawsuit states.
Advocates were instead told to gather in the “Bell Room” on the first floor, tucked away from the State House’s main entrance and elevators. The ACLU’s lawsuit claims the relocation had undermined demonstrators’ ability to convey their message as intended.
But the relegation to the back only emboldened the demonstrators, whose chanting could be heard within the House chambers during the first hour of McKee’s speech, as they marched around the first floor of the capitol building.
“The more you try to silence us the louder we will be,” they chanted at one point.
The ACLU is asking Chief Judge John McConnell to issue a permanent injunction prohibiting the governor and others from restricting the right of the people to peacefully gather in the State House rotunda based on the content of their speech, along with asking the State and Capitol Police to pay for damages and attorneys’ fees.
To prevent a recurrence, the suit seeks a ruling before the next State of the State address in January 2026.
“Over 50 years ago, an ACLU lawsuit led to a court decision unequivocally declaring the State House rotunda to be an open public forum for the expression of political speech,” Steven Brown, executive director for the ACLU of Rhode Island, said in a statement. “Since that time, the rotunda has served as the epicenter for Rhode Islanders to peacefully express their views to state leaders and the public. This lawsuit is designed to ensure that it remains that way.”

Overdoses decreased across all drug categories. Greater Minnesota saw a steeper decline in overdose deaths — 31% — than the seven-county metro, where they dropped by 23%. 
The state data mirror national trends. Overdose deaths have trended up over the past 20 years due to explosion in use of opioids; the pandemic and proliferation of fentanyl caused a major spike in 2021. The trend reversed in 2023, and last year’s deaths dropped to the lowest levels since 2019.

Both fatal and nonfatal overdoses declined last year — for every one overdose death, there are 15 nonfatal overdoses, according to the state data. Nonfatal overdoses decreased 19% in 2024.
The decrease in overdoses “(is) substantial and consistent with the impact of prevention and harm reduction efforts,” the MDH report states. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention attributed the decline in deaths to a number of factors in a February report, including more widespread distribution of the overdose reversal drug naloxone; better access to substance abuse treatment; shifts in the illegal drug supply; the resumption of prevention and response efforts after the pandemic; and better data collection practices.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GettyImages-2152068591.jpg,,,2025-10-28 14:57:43.202246

The Burlington children’s hospital within the University of Vermont Medical Center will change its name and join a nationwide alliance of pediatric hospitals after receiving a $25 million gift.
Billionaire Thomas Golisano announced the gift on Tuesday morning at a press conference in Rochester, New York, along with similar pledges to five other children’s hospitals that together total $253 million.
The donation, to be paid out in $5 million increments over five years, is the largest that the state’s only pediatric hospital has received to date. As part of the donation, the UVM Children’s Hospital will officially change its name to Golisano Children’s Hospital at University of Vermont Health. 
The children’s hospital will put the money toward hiring more staff and expanding the number of children it can serve in its complex care program, which is designed for patients with unique health needs and overlapping diagnoses, UVM Health spokesperson Annie Mackin said.

The gifted funds will also go toward broadening subspecialty services outside of Burlington to reduce patient travel time and will be invested in the Vermont Child Health Improvement Program, a public health effort also called V-CHIP, out of UVM’s medical school, she added.
The donation comes at a time when hospitals in Vermont have been facing severe solvency crises, with several hospitals having limited days’ cash on hand, and as many individuals in Vermont stare down commercial insurance premium prices that have doubled and tripled, beyond the realm of affordability for many. University of Vermont Medical Center’s operating profit margins and reserves are healthier than those of the state’s other general service hospitals. 
Golisano built his fortune through Paychex, the payroll company he founded. Forbes estimates his net worth at $6 billion. He is a native of Rochester, New York, and has a history of philanthropy with the University of Rochester Children’s Hospital. 
The UVM Health children’s hospital will join the Golisano Hospital Alliance, a consortium of the children’s hospitals that have received donations from Golisano. The group includes hospitals in Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.

Led by Senate Democratic Leader Lori Berman, D-Boynton Beach, and her House counterpart Fentrice Driskell, D-Tampa, legislative Democrats sent DeSantis a letter Tuesday asking him to use his emergency powers to ensure the millions of Floridians who rely on the Supplemental Assistance Nutrition Program don’t go hungry when their benefits expire Saturday as a result of the federal government shutdown.
The letter also asks DeSantis to direct the Department of Children and Families, which administers the SNAP program, to coordinate with local food banks and their community partners to distribute the food immediately.
“For families already struggling under record food and housing costs, the loss of this critical support would be catastrophic,” the letter reads. “Local food banks and pantries have already reported overwhelming demand and depleted supplies. … We are days away from a full-blown hunger emergency that will leave families without food during the holiday season. The state cannot stand by.”
SNAP provides nutritional support for low-income seniors, people with disabilities living on fixed incomes, and other individuals and families with low incomes. Florida has the fourth largest SNAP enrollment nationwide with 2.94 million relying on the assistance for their food security, behind California, Texas, and New York. Nationwide, 41.7 million people rely on SNAP benefits, August 2025 data show.
The governor’s office didn’t immediately respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for comment.

The Democrats’ letter comes after the DeSantis administration posted a notice that SNAP benefits are about to expire.
The state notice was put up after the U.S. Department of Agriculture posted Friday that it would not tap into $6 billion in contingency funds to keep benefits intact for the coming month. It would take $9 billion to cover the costs of the SNAP program through November. But the federal memo, first reported by Axios, claims that SNAP contingency funds cannot be used to float the program during the shutdown, an assertion that has been disputed.
Contingency funds “are only available to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover, benefits. The contingency fund is not available to support FY 2026 regular benefits, because the appropriation for regular benefits no longer exists,” the memo says.
The partisan impasse has resulted in a 28-day government shutdown, which began Oct. 1, the start of the federal fiscal year.
“SNAP is one of the most effective programs for addressing hunger and food insecurity in the state,” the letter from the Democrats stated. 
“Especially after the recent cuts stemming from President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, Floridians cannot afford another day without action by the state. Florida has the fiscal strength to respond. What’s needed now is the moral will to act. No parent should have to choose between paying rent and feeding their kids. No child should go hungry because politicians in Washington can’t agree. We urge you to act immediately.”
“Heartless”
Berman said in prepared remarks that Florida has $5 billion in its “rainy day” fund that DeSantis could use to avert the food cliff  low-income families face.
“The sudden loss of those benefits would be an economic and humanitarian nightmare,” she said. “With the stroke of a pen, the Governor can keep food on peoples’ tables. He has a responsibility to the people of this state to put partisanship aside and lead. Refusing to act would be truly heartless.”
Driskell said in her prepared remarks that the governor “brags” about “maxing out” the amount of savings in the state’s “rainy day” fund.
“If millions of hungry Floridians isn’t an economic storm, I don’t know what is,” she said, adding, “This is a crisis but an entirely solvable one. We can make sure Floridians do not go hungry. It costs a little more than $6 a day to feed someone. Isn’t every Floridian worth that?”
The letter also asks the governor to request the state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to implement the universal school meals programs for the duration of the emergency.

(Photo by Getty Images)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun on Tuesday filled a high-profile vacancy at the state’s economic development agency — months after lawmakers mandated its top leadership role be split in two — and announced Indiana will reassume its “Crossroads of America” branding.
The governor tapped Department of Workforce Development Commissioner Josh Richardson to serve as the IEDC’s president.
“Josh brings a rare combination of economic insight and workforce experience,” Braun said in a news release. “He understands that growth starts with people — and that the best way to strengthen Indiana’s economy is to make sure our employers, universities, and regional leaders are all moving in the same direction. I have full confidence in his ability to continue driving the state’s momentum and to create lasting opportunity for Hoosiers.”
Until Braun’s May 1 signature, Commerce Secretary David Adams was required to be the agency’s CEO and president. But legislators separated the role. The edits were effective immediately.
Redefined Indiana economic development roles coming, months after legislative mandate

The law’s author — Sen. Brian Buchanan, R-Lebanon — told the Capital Chronicle that the idea came out of collaboration with Braun’s fledgling administration, and was intended to “set up the best structure for IEDC to be successful.”
Six months later, the administration has made good on those edits. Adams will stay CEO.
“Indiana’s success has always come from its regions — from leaders who know their communities best and who build growth from the ground up,” Adams said in the release. “Josh understands the direct connection between talent and industry growth better than anyone. His leadership will ensure that the IEDC continues to support region-led partnerships that grow wages, strengthen productivity, and attract people and investment to Indiana.”
Richardson is a Blackford County native with an undergraduate degree from Ball State University and his law degree from the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law.
DWD’s chief financial officer, Mike Smith, will step up as interim commissioner.
Branding shakeup
Braun also announced that Indiana will “embrace” its “Crossroads of America” motto.
His predecessor, Gov. Eric Holcomb, unveiled a new tourism marketing campaign — “IN Indiana” — in 2022. As part of that effort, in 2023, he put up “More to discover IN Indiana” roadway welcome signs that replaced the old crossroads signage. Also that year, IEDC got a new motto — “Indiana for the bold” — in place of the agency’s previous “A state that works” slogan.
“Indiana is proud to be the geographic Crossroads of America, and we are also proud to be at the crossroads of the nation’s leading industries, such as advanced manufacturing, life sciences, motorsports, and defense,” Braun said. “We will look for opportunities to lean into this identity and incorporate it into our work.”
A Braun spokesperson said the new branding is expected to be integrated throughout state government, including the IEDC and the state’s transportation and tourism agencies. It may look different than previous iterations.

Jermaine Johnson during the Association of Counties' annual conference on Feb. 21, 2024, in Columbia, S.C. (Photo by Travis Bell/Special to the SC Gazette)COLUMBIA — Three-term state Rep. Jermaine Johnson is officially making a bid for the Governor’s Mansion.
The Richland County Democrat is expected to formally announce his candidacy Tuesday evening on the Statehouse steps.
The 40-year-old father of four is the second Democrat to enter the race, following an announcement by Charleston lawyer Mullins McLeod in August.
McLeod remains in the race despite a high-profile arrest for disorderly conduct near the tip of Charleston’s peninsula in May and subsequent calls from the state Democratic Party to suspend his campaign.
The winner of the Democratic primary in June will face off against the victor of a five-way GOP contest.
The announced Republicans are Lt. Gov. Pam Evette, state Sen. Josh Kimbrell of Spartanburg County, U.S. House Reps. Nancy Mace and Ralph Norman, and Attorney General Alan Wilson.
Johnson has said he recognizes it’s a long shot for any Democrat in a statewide race in South Carolina.
“I stand before you with humility, conviction, and what I call fearless faith — the kind of faith that does not shrink from the challenges before us but rises to meet them with courage and purpose,” Johnson said in a statement ahead of his official announcement event.
‘Is this pork?’ SC Democrat highlights what won’t get aid due to earmark refusal

No Democrat has won the Governor’s office since Jim Hodges in 1998. The last Democrat to win any statewide office was Jim Rex in 2006, when he became state superintendent of education by fewer than 500 votes.
Gov. Henry McMaster soundly defeated the last Democrat to seek the job, former U.S. Rep. Joe Cunningham, by more than 17 percentage points in 2022.
That victory led to McMaster becoming the longest-serving elected governor in state history, having taken over the second half of former Gov. Nikki Haley’s term in 2017 when she left to become President Donald Trump’s first United Nations ambassador.
McMaster is ineligible to run again in 2026.
A Winthrop Poll released Tuesday puts Mace and Evette in a statistical tie for the lead among likely Republican voters. Norman and Wilson tied for second, with Kimbrell in a distant fifth place. Still, it’s early in the contest and more than 46% of the registered voters responding were undecided.
More than 40% of those surveyed said an endorsement from Trump will be “very important” to them when choosing a candidate. Another 30% called a Trump endorsement “somewhat important.” The poll results reflect the answers of 1,331 registered voters reached Oct. 2-19.
As for Johnson, he first won a seat in the Statehouse in 2020 after ousting 22-year veteran Rep. Jimmy Bales, a former Richland County Councilman and longtime principal of Lower Richland High School who oversaw the school’s desegregation.
Two years later, after the post-census redrawing of voting lines put Johnson in the same House district as fellow Hopkins Democrat Wendy Brawley, he ousted her from the seat she’d held since 2017.
That year, Republicans gained a supermajority in the House.
A 2022 settlement over the voting lines required the Legislature to redraw district maps in Richland and Kershaw counties, putting Johnson in a new district that stretches from Lower Richland north to Elgin. Johnson had no opposition for that seat in 2024.

Johnson, born in Los Angeles, overcame childhood struggles. He lost his brother to gun violence when Johnson was 5 years old. And his family was homeless during Johnson’s teenage years, living in motels.
In 2004, a basketball scholarship brought Johnson to the College of Charleston, where his 1,276 points still rank 21st in program history. He went on to earn a spot in a developmental league for NBA prospects before stints playing professionally in Canada, Portugal, Mexico and Brazil.
After his basketball career, he returned to South Carolina, starting New Economic Beginnings Foundation, a nonprofit aimed to aid troubled children and military veterans.

Andy Beshear is one of more than two dozen Democratic state officials who sued  the Trump administration Tuesday over its decision to halt food assistance to around 42 million Americans during the government shutdown. 
“There are emergency funds sitting around that the president could use to fund the SNAP program,” Beshear said in a Tuesday press conference. “All he has to do is be willing to do it.”

Federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program will run out  on Nov. 1, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has told states, leaving around 563,080 Kentuckians facing even worse food insecurity. 
Kentucky food banks, meanwhile, are bracing for a “catastrophic” hit. 
The lawsuit Beshear is part of, filed Tuesday in federal court in Massachusetts, asks for “a declaration that USDA is required to furnish the SNAP benefits that have already been calculated and determined.” 
The suit says the USDA acknowledged as recently as last month that SNAP benefits should continue during a government shutdown with billions of dollars appropriated by Congress for such contingencies. During earlier shutdowns, SNAP benefits continued, the lawsuit says.
Upcoming federal food assistance pause intensifies shutdown fight

A USDA memo published by NPR said that “there is no provision or allowance under current law for states to cover the cost of benefits and be reimbursed” and that “SNAP contingency funds are only available to supplement regular monthly benefits when amounts have been appropriated for, but are insufficient to cover, benefits.” 
This position is not in line with the USDA’s previous shutdown plan, which said it would use contingency funds for SNAP benefits during the shutdown, News from the States has reported. 
Meanwhile, Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman signed a letter from other Republican attorneys general addressed to Minority Leader Chuck Schumer asking for support of a Republican-backed bill to end the shutdown. That letter says that “keeping the government open requires cooperation, not partisanship.” 
Coleman posted the letter on X Tuesday, saying “We don’t need a partisan lawsuit. We just need to pass this bipartisan bill.” 
Democrats in Congress want the Republican majority to restore subsidies that help Americans afford health insurance. 
“For millions of Americans, these subsidies are the only reason health insurance is within reach as the cost of living keeps going up. If these credits aren’t extended, nearly 100,000 Kentuckians with insurance plans through our state marketplace, called Kynect, could see up to 37% higher premiums for 2026 coverage,” Beshear said during his Tuesday press conference. “That’s thousands of hard earned dollars leaving the pockets of our families just to afford health insurance coverage, which I believe is a basic human right.”

Alexus Richardson, the director of communications for the Louisville-based Dare to Care, said food banks in the state have already struggled this year to meet the needs of many food-insecure Kentuckians. In the Louisville area, about 1 in 7 people need help feeding themselves, she said, an increase from last year, when it was 1 in 8. 
“Right now, across Kentuckiana, we’re seeing nearly 200,000 individuals who are experiencing food insecurity, and that is before any pauses to SNAP, any cancellations of paychecks,” Richardson said. “That’s before any of the shutdown things that have happened.” 
This is due to several factors, she said, including inflation in food prices and the end of COVID-era assistance. 
“At the same time that we are seeing more people, we are also seeing less food,” she said, referring to a decrease in federal food commodities. “We have less food and more people coming to visit us right now, which is scary.”

Many people visiting food banks right now are working families — and many are coming for the first time, Richardson said. 
“There is a misconception about who is using SNAP or who is visiting the food bank,” she said. “But these are working families, people who are getting a paycheck and they still can’t afford their most basic need, which is food.” 
Meanwhile, the Nov. 1 expiration of SNAP benefits will be “catastrophic for food banks” who simply cannot meet the needs on their own, Richardson said. 
On Monday, Bluegrass Community & Technical College said there are more students in need of food this year than in the past. 
In announcing its Thanksgiving Food Drive, the college said it “has seen a significant increase in student need” already this year  and the college food pantry has served 358 students, “a substantial rise compared to this time last year.” 
Meanwhile, the Salvation Army launched an emergency food drive on Monday, saying there has been “a dramatic rise in local food-assistance requests — some three to five times higher than usual levels in recent weeks” in the Louisville area. 
“With grocery and utility prices continuing to strain family budgets, we’re seeing many of our neighbors turning to us for the first time,” Major Mark Hunter, the area commander of The Salvation Army of Louisville, said in a statement. 
Melissa McDonald, the executive director of Feeding Kentucky, said that “thousands of Kentuckians will face heightened hunger at the start of November if SNAP funding is not preserved. Food banks are stretched to their limits.”
“SNAP helps working families stretch their grocery budgets, ensures seniors don’t have to choose between food and medicine, and gives children access to the nutrition they need to grow and learn,” McDonald said in a statement. “Without immediate action, Kentuckians could be left wondering how they’ll put food on the table next week. We urge Congress to work together to fund SNAPfor the millions of Americans, and thousands of Kentuckians, who rely on it.”
Dare to Care has not yet had to turn people away, Richardson said, but some shelves are lighter than they’ve been in past years. She said people wanting to help can donate money, food or time. 
“Food banks are trusted community partners, and we’ve continued to show up for our neighbors, but right now, it’s going to take more than just food banks and food pantries coming together,” Richardson said. “It’s going to take our entire community gathering to call on our lawmakers to say, ‘open the government so that our families can put food on the table for their children; so that our seniors can have access to the foods that they need to eat.’”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson sued the Trump administration Tuesday, seeking to force continued funding for food assistance ahead of an expected pause in benefits Friday.
Jackson, a Democrat, filed suit in Massachusetts alongside a coalition of Democratic-led states against the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Office of Management and Budget. Their suit argues that the Trump administration should dip into reserve funds to continue funding SNAP benefits, rather than pausing them — which Jackson called “unprecedented.”
“The truth is, the department is choosing not to use the emergency money they’ve been given,” Jackson told reporters Tuesday. “I believe the reason they’re doing that is to play shutdown politics. They are looking to ratchet up the pain in an already painful moment.”
USDA had initially planned to use its $6 billion contingency fund to continue sending out food assistance as the federal government shutdown drags toward one month. But it reversed course last week, informing states that it would not tap into that money.
SNAP helps feed about 1.4 million North Carolinians monthly. The state’s Department of Health and Human Services said Monday that November benefits would not arrive on schedule.
“The USDA must take immediate action to keep families from going hungry as it is required to do by law, and I thank Attorney General Jackson for standing up to secure these critical resources,” Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, said in a statement.
USDA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Jackson and Democratic states’ suit alleges that the administration is violating federal law by pausing benefits, arguing that “USDA has historically funded SNAP benefits during prior lapses in appropriations.” The lawsuit is asking the court to act as quickly as possible to resume benefits, but it is not yet known if action will be taken before Friday.
Other states have begun moving to continue funding food assistance on their own as the pause approaches. In Louisiana, state leaders are using $150 million monthly to cover benefits. Nevada is funneling $38.8 million toward local food banks.
North Carolina does not appear poised to pursue a similar solution.
State lawmakers were in session as recently as last week, redrawing the state’s congressional voting districts and passing a stopgap spending bill for some state needs. But emergency funding for food aid was not included in that bill or even publicly discussed.
The offices of both General Assembly leaders — House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) and Senate leader Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) — did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In other states, governors have ordered the release of emergency funds. Stein on Monday issued a statement requesting USDA to release contingency funds, but Stein’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether there were other avenues the state could seek ahead of the Friday pause.
DHHS is not able to cover the gap in funding, said Jonathan Kappler, deputy secretary at the department.
“Unfortunately, the size and scope of this program is one that that avenue was not really available to us,” he told reporters Tuesday.
The looming pause in food aid would have an outsized impact on families — over 580,000 children and 40,000 babies in North Carolina rely on SNAP. Similarly, rural counties would take a hit, with one in six residents in those counties depending on the program, according to Kappler. More than 80% of those on SNAP in North Carolina are currently working, according to state officials.
Food banks and nonprofits can provide some aid, but cannot come close to filling the gap that a pause in SNAP would create. For every nine meals provided through SNAP, food banks provide one, one food bank leader told NC Newsline on Monday.
The CEO of Interfaith Food Shuttle, Ron Pringle, joined Jackson on Tuesday and warned that nonprofits and food banks would be forced to make “tough choices” without the “safety net” of SNAP.
“Nobody wants to make a decision on whose child gets to eat,” Pringle said.
The federal nutrition program that helps pay for baby formula could also see a future pause.
State health officials said Monday that benefits for more than 262,000 women, infants and children will continue through early November, but did not give an exact end date. Wake County said WIC benefits will continue through Nov. 15.

Theo Wells-Spackman is a Report for America corps member who reports for VTDigger.org.
Vermont is part of a multi-state federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Massachusetts district court against the U.S. Department of Agriculture, seeking to force the federal government to release contingency funding for its nutrition assistance program, Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark has announced.
Vermont officials are preparing state-funded stopgap measures, but Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday that he would support multi-state litigation that attempts to force the federal government to use that contingency funding.
“We don’t want any Vermonter to go hungry,” Clark said in an interview, adding that federal nutrition assistance is crucial both to individual households and to the state’s food economy as a whole. Over 65,000 Vermonters receive food assistance through 3SquaresVT, Vermont’s version of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
President Donald Trump’s administration indicated Friday that the USDA would not be able to use contingency funding to continue dispersing SNAP payments during the federal government shutdown, which is nearing the end of  its fourth week. 
“The president has created a new crisis,” Clark said. “The best case scenario is that (he) comes to his senses … and does what Congress asked him to do.”
Clark’s office joins attorneys general and governors in 23 states and the District of Columbia in filing Tuesday’s lawsuit. In Kansas, Pennsylvania and Kentucky, governors themselves are representing their states in the suit.
The joint lawsuit cites the Administrative Procedure Act, with states alleging that the USDA’s actions are “both contrary to law, and arbitrary and capricious.”
Clark and her colleagues are filing a motion for a preliminary injunction in the case, seeking to speed along the timeline on which federal SNAP funding resumes for states.
The suit comes a day after U.S. Sen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., co-sponsored a bill that seeks to release funds for the USDA to continue operating SNAP without interruption.
The Keep SNAP Funded Act, introduced by U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., would appropriate both current and retroactive funding as necessary to maintain full operations for the program. The bill has been referred to the Senate Appropriations Committee.

“Vermonters can be really proud that their elected leaders are doing just what they should do,” Clark said. “Each of us … in our own lane is trying really hard to ensure that the SNAP benefits continue and that no Vermonter goes hungry.”
Clark said that while efforts from all political sides are important, it would be most “appropriate” for Vermont not to have to bear the burden of funding food assistance at the state level. The funds that would be directed toward a state-funded stopgap are needed elsewhere, she said.
“I think our lane is the most promising,” Clark said in reference to Tuesday’s lawsuit.

(Photo by Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)WICHITA — Kansas Immigration Coalition cofounder Yeni Silva-Renteria says trauma of arrests, deportations and family separations amid President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown raise fear even among immigrants who long ago earned U.S. citizenship.
Silva-Renteria said anxiety among holders of citizenship papers or a cherished green card, as well as those in the United States without lawful status, was growing.
“It’s very, very difficult to just see how separation is happening, the cruelty that is happening,” she said. “There’s just this fear that is happening across the board. The fear that we’re facing … it’s not only for the undocumented population.”
During a gathering of Kansas Democrats on Saturday in Wichita, Silva-Renteria said advocacy on behalf of immigrant communities might in the future be labeled subversive by the federal government and lead to legal challenges to her naturalization. She is executive director of the International Rescue Committee in Wichita.
“I think what I’m doing right now, it can be seen as me fighting against the government,” Silva-Renteria said. “It is a fear, even for someone like me who has been a naturalized citizen for more than 20 years. Before, it was never a question. I could share my story all over the place and I could feel safe. But now, I don’t.”
Silva-Renteria walked across the border from Mexico with her mother at age 10, received permanent resident status in the United States as a teenager and earned a master’s degree in social work at Wichita State University. She is a cofounder, with Wichita immigration attorney Sarah Balderas, of the Kansas Immigration Coalition. Its mission is to safeguard the dignity and well-being of immigrants statewide.

Risk of assumptions
Balderas, who teaches immigration law at Washburn University, said the political climate in regard to immigration could prompt people to insert themselves into enforcement activities by mistakenly alleging people were in the United States without legal authority.
“You see someone who is from another country speaking a different language, you can’t automatically assume they don’t have status,” she said.
She said general public knowledge of immigration law was so deficient that most people didn’t appreciate a person could hold a temporary visa, be part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program or hold permanent residency status without being proficient in English.
Reading and writing ability enters the picture in a federal regulatory sense when applying for citizenship, she said.
“There are so many misconceptions about immigration, and it’s simply because of a lack of education. Nobody talks about this stuff. We just hear what we hear in the news or we hear what we hear from friends, and it’s really complicated,” Balderas said.
She said the reality was there were millions of people in the United States who would never qualify for lawful permanent resident status, a prerequisite for applying for U.S. citizenship.
“You have a typical situation where you have mom and dad entering the country illegally together,” she said. “They came over 21 years ago because — guess what — their U.S. citizen-born kid is turning 21 and they’re like, ‘Hell, yes, our 21-year-old kid is going to apply for us.’ The problem is that they both, mom and dad, entered illegally. If each of them do not have a spouse or a parent with lawful permanent resident status or U.S. citizenship, they will never be eligible to become a lawful permanent resident.”
 
Politics of reform
Balderas said U.S. immigration law was designed to keep people out of the country. She said Congress, which is responsible for formation of immigration law, failed to make modest changes that could unclog the immigration system to better accommodate people in the United States without legal status who worked hard, paid taxes and avoided criminal entanglement.
She said the answer in the United States wasn’t debate about a politically fraught amnesty program.
“Everyone’s angry at President Trump. I get it. He is enforcing the immigration laws to the fullest extent possible,” Balderas said. “But we are going to be in this situation every four years if Congress doesn’t make changes in the immigration law. Politics is what’s holding these people hostage.”
U.S. Rep. Ron Estes, a Republican serving the Wichita area, has repeatedly praised the Trump administration for securing the southern border with Mexico. He said U.S. Border Patrol data indicated illegal crossing was at the lowest level since 1970s.
“President Trump promised to secure our southern border, and he has delivered on his promise,” Estes said. “In fiscal year 2025, Border Patrol captured 238,000 illegal immigrants. When Joe Biden was president, 2.2 million illegal immigrants were apprehended at the southern border.”
In September, the Trump administration reported elevated enforcement actions had led to deportation of 400,000 people and the voluntary departure of an estimated 1.6 million people from the United States.
Silva-Renteria said she worked primarily with people from Mexico, India, Vietnam, China, Republic of Congo, Afghanistan and Latin American nations.
In Kansas, an estimated 116,000 people had at least one immigrant parent and 74,000 of these individuals earned the right to vote in elections.

What they don’t mention is Anson County’s official tier designation as one of North Carolina’s most economically distressed counties — a cloud that’s been hanging over county officials’ heads since 2007.
That label is intended to help the county. More often, it does the exact opposite.
North Carolina’s attempt to promote economic growth in its poorest, most rural communities is rife with perversities like this one. In counties rich and poor across the state, officials wrestle with the state’s unique and inflexible approach to economic development.
North Carolina has been steadily adding both jobs and population for more than a decade, with the exception of during the COVID-19 pandemic. The problem, however, is that parts of the state are left out of that promising economic picture — with no way to join the fray.
Jane Winik Sartwell / Carolina Public Press
This is the first article in Trapped By Tiers, a three-part Carolina Public Press investigative series examining North Carolina’s economic distress tiers, a system intended to promote economic mobility across the state. CPP analyzed state data and found that this system is ineffective, stagnant, and at times, counterproductive.
This article focuses on our findings and their consequences for North Carolina communities across the economic spectrum. The second article focuses on the root causes of the system’s failures, while the third article will explore possible improvements and alternatives.
What are distress tiers?
State law requires North Carolina’s Department of Commerce to sort the state’s 100 counties into three tiers each year.
In theory, Tier 1 is home to the most distressed counties. Tier 2 represents medium distress, and Tier 3 the least distressed. But Department of Commerce officials apply just four criteria on a countywide basis to determine which counties are placed in which tier:

Unemployment rate
Population growth
Median household income
Property tax base per capita.

Each year, there must be 40 Tier 1 counties, 40 Tier 2 counties and 20 Tier 3 counties — regardless of overall progress or decline in the state or local economies. This is a central assumption from which many of the system’s issues stem.
The state uses the tiers in order to more prudently distribute its limited money to the counties that need it most. Or at least, that’s the idea.
Jane Winik Sartwell / Carolina Public Press
The funding that is officially impacted by tier designations includes public infrastructure grants, competitive business incentive programs and building redevelopment funds. However, many more state programs now rely on the tier system — including several noneconomic programs. Some private foundations and nonprofit organizations use it to deal with counties as well.
Tier 1 counties are given preference in their economic development grant applications and often receive higher state matches for local dollars. The One North Carolina Fund, a job incentive program, divvies it up like this:

In a Tier 1 county, the local government must provide no less than one dollar for every three dollars provided by One NC.
In a Tier 2 county, the local government must provide no less than one dollar for every two dollars provided by One NC.
In a Tier 3 county, the local government must provide no less than one dollar for every one dollar provided by One NC.

The idea is that Tier 1 counties, like Anson, need the money more but have less resources to compete for it. They need the extra help. In some counties, however, that one-to-three requirement may still be too steep of a challenge for the county to take advantage of the program.
Although annual tier designations are usually announced late in the year, late changes in the data cannot always be captured, so a lag occurs between tier designations and potentially major shifts. The 2025 tier designations were announced in late 2024 and did not account for the economic disruption of Tropical Storm Helene, which hit the state in late September. The 2026 tiers will likely be announced in early December.
Key findings
Carolina Public Press analyzed publicly available state economic records on distress tier assignments, economic indicators and demographic information between 2014 and 2025, finding that:

20 of the 40 Tier 1 counties have held that same status for more than a decade. Even though the system was originally intended to promote economic growth, it has failed to move the state’s most disadvantaged communities forward.
19 counties operate in a kind of permanent recession, posting unemployment rates 20 to 55% higher than the state average for decades.

13 of the 20 Tier 3 counties have held that same status for more than a decade. Many counties have become stuck, unable to progress to Tier 2, with Tier 3 completely out of reach for them.
In Eastern North Carolina, two distinct clusters of counties have remained in the most distressed tier since the system’s inception, pointing to a regional economic issue that the system has been unable to address. The northeastern cluster maps onto the counties with the highest percentage of Black North Carolinians, revealing deep socioeconomic problems spurred by inequity and systemic disadvantages based on race, often with long historical roots. The tier system obscures these kinds of issues and has not led to economic progress for these counties.
It is possible for a county to improve in nearly every indicator and still shift down to a more distressed tier. This happens because counties are judged against other counties, not on their own, and a fixed number of counties will always be in each tier.
The system is not flexible enough to respond to economic crises in real time, such as a hurricane, factory closure or pandemic. The 2025 tiers, for example, did not address or represent the economic havoc wrought by Hurricane Helene in late 2024 in many mountain and Western Piedmont counties.

Wealthy enclaves distort rankings by obscuring real poverty in adjacent communities within the same county. In Tier 3 Union County, for example, wealthy Charlotte suburbs in the west prevent heightened state attention to the eastern town of Marshville, where the poverty rate is 18%.
The system, once designed to distribute a single tax credit, now is applied across state agencies, economic and not. In some cases, this punishes counties with a system that was intended to incentivize growth.

A lack of mobility
Since North Carolina implemented its three-tier system in 1987, the designations were meant to be dynamic. The ranking was intended to incentivize growth in struggling areas, eventually helping them move out of the most distressed tier and make room for other counties that needed special attention from the state.
That is not what happened.
CPP analysis showed that half of the 40 Tier 1 counties — or the most economically distressed — have held that same status for more than a decade. It reflects a kind of economic fatalism that’s becoming increasingly pervasive.
“There are parts of North Carolina that do not have anything, and may never have anything much,” Orange County economic development director Steven Brantley told CPP.
The pattern holds at the other end of the spectrum as well. More than half of the 20 Tier 3 spots have always been occupied by the same counties, CPP analysis showed. Think counties like Wake, home to Raleigh, and Mecklenburg, home to Charlotte.
The static tiers hide the fact that the poorest counties don’t improve while the richest counties just get richer.
In Eastern North Carolina, two distinct clusters of counties have remained locked in the most distressed tier since the system’s inception. An economic issue plagues these counties that the tier system does not, and cannot, address.
The northeastern cluster of Tier 1 counties is aligned with the cluster of counties that are home to the highest percentage of Black North Carolinians. Some of the economic challenges in these counties are rooted in the history of racial economic disadvantage going deep into the region’s history. The tier system obscures these counties’ specific struggle into a broader category of distress.
One such northeastern county, Edgecombe, is currently tied with an adjacent county, Halifax, for highest unemployment rate in the state. It has been designated as Tier 1 for as long as the system has been around.
“I’m sick and tired of Edgecombe County being at the top of every bad list,” Edgecombe County Manager Eric Evans told Carolina Public Press.
“We’ve been able to capitalize on it and tap into resources that we otherwise might not have. But really changing the economic outlook for these counties takes a whole lot more than just a designation and first dibs at federal and state funding.”
Because of its tier designation, Edgecombe County received a job development grant and other incentives from the state that helped the county attract Natron Energy, an international industrial battery manufacturer. Natron planned to bring more than 1,000 jobs and an investment of $1.4 billion to Edgecombe County with a “gigafactory” at Kingsboro Business Park, midway between Rocky Mount and Tarboro.
Natron had plannned to build an sodium-ion battery plant with 1,000 jobs at this Edgecombe County site between Tarboro and Rocky Mount. Those plans have changed. File / Provided
Other companies had promised to come to the business park before — namely CSX and Triangle Tire — but pulled out at the last minute. Now, it’s happening again.
“We just found out recently that (Natron) just couldn’t make things work, and they pulled a plug on the project,” Evans said.
The state incentives are enough to get companies interested in North Carolina’s poorest areas, but not enough to ensure follow-through.
For all the bad PR that Tier 1 counties get, many don’t actually receive that much special treatment from the state. In the two years that Renee Perry has served as Vance County manager, she hasn’t seen any money or incentives come in as a result of Vance’s economically distressed status.
Halifax County Manager Dia Denton doesn’t think her county will ever ascend out of Tier 1, but she doesn’t necessarily see that as such a terrible thing — the system just fails to appreciate Halifax’s dominance in the agriculture sector, she says.
But that may not be of much help to workers in Halifax County who don’t happen to own farms. Like Edgecombe, Halifax has a perpetually high level of residents without jobs.
Challenges in every tier
Tier 1 counties aren’t the only ones with challenges.
Many wealthy, older North Carolinians own second homes in the mountains. Should that mean that the county receives less funding to repair buildings? What about counties whose populations are rapidly growing — should that mean they receive less funding to build new schools?
Logic would suggest not, but that’s the way it works under the current system.
For Tier 3 counties, their relative success can handicap parts of the county that aren’t as affluent as others.
Karen Howard is a county commissioner in Chatham County, which has been designated as non-distressed for upwards of a decade.
“In a community like Chatham, we certainly have condensed wealth and a lot of opportunity, but we also have deep pockets of poverty,” Howard said.
Siler City in western Chatham County has lagged behind the wealthier and fast-growing northeastern portion of the county. The Mountaire poultry processing plant is one of the few major employers in Siler City. Frank Taylor / Carolina Public Press
“The lack of access to some of the grant and funding opportunities in towns like Siler City and Goldston has been crippling. The model itself is the challenge. Towns that are distressed and unable to access or manage the funding opportunities because of where they are located are just at this permanent disadvantage. The system is unable to take in nuance.”
The same sentiment is felt by other Tier 3 counties, such as Iredell and Mecklenburg.
“Being a Tier 3 county excludes us from multiple revenue sources that are desperately needed,” Beth Milton, Iredell County manager, told CPP.
“It punishes a less vibrant area of a county because of another’s success.”
In the state’s largest city, Charlotte, the tier system breeds even more contradictions. Mecklenburg County Commissioner Arthur Griffin argues that Charlotte has many more poor people than sparsely populated, rural counties, but those people are excluded from the benefits of the tier system.
In North Carolina’s cities, economic success is accompanied by deep pockets of poverty. The system is designed to ignore those pockets, Griffin argued.
Officials from Tier 3 counties like Iredell feel they contribute more to the state economy, and are unfairly punished for it.
“In North Carolina, counties classified as Tier 1 and Tier 2 — accounting for 80 out of the 100 counties — receive a far greater share of state funds despite paying less than 20% of the state’s total taxes,” said Gene Houpe, an Iredell County commissioner.
“In contrast, Tier 3 counties like Iredell contribute the majority of the tax revenue yet receive little to no support back from the state. This disparity leads to severe reductions in state incentives for economic development, local grants, and much-needed capital funding for school projects.
“One of the most pressing issues we face in Iredell is the lack of adequate funding for school capital projects. Due to rapid growth, our county is required by law to build new schools to accommodate the increasing population. However, we do not receive enough funding from the state to meet these obligations, and the financial strain is becoming unsustainable.”
Growing uses for the tiers
The tier system was never intended to impact public school funding. Over the nearly 40 years the system has been in effect, its influence has grown beyond the purposes for which it was designed.
“The program was built in 1987 for one specific economic development incentive program,” explained Anson County Planning Director Nick Addison.
“Since then, the state has expanded this program to kind of be all-encompassing. Michelangelo didn’t paint the Sistine Chapel in broad strokes.”

The tier system doesn’t just dictate which counties get which job creation incentives. It now impacts random county programs, like spay-and-neuter programs, farmland preservation programs, school construction, waste- and drinking-water reserve programs, community colleges, oral health preventative services and medication assistance programs.
The tier system has seeped into the grant-making decisions of nonprofits like the Golden Leaf Foundation, a major grantor for counties impacted by the decline of the tobacco industry. It can also affect federal funding streams, when those are operating normally.
The School of Government at UNC-Chapel Hill recently published a study examining the effectiveness of the tier system. One of the authors, Carolyn Fryberger, blames the increasing use of the tiers for many of the system’s unintended consequences.
“The goal of the system is now very unclear,” Fryberger said.
“It was originally created under this one very specific statute for a very specific use. It is now used in every program, across every department, in every issue area, in ways that it was not intended and was not designed.”
These tier designations, whose influence has grown to represent so much of counties’ identity, in many cases, are not all that meaningful.
Tier soup
The prescribed number for each tier results in a “musical chairs” effect where a county can improve or decline just because of another county’s unrelated performance.
Some counties wobble between tiers. The counties that hover near tier boundaries need not experience meaningful changes to switch. Caldwell County, for example, has switched between Tier 1 and Tier 2 six times in the last 10 years.

In the most recent rankings, Caldwell once again moved tiers, from medium distressed to most distressed — with hardly any meaningful, or negative, changes in its economic outlook.
Between 2024 and 2025, Caldwell County’s property tax base increased by $9,700. The median household income increased by $8,900. These are positive changes.
It experienced population growth at a rate of 1.32% between July 2020 and July 2023, which is faster than it had been growing in previous periods, but slow compared to the statewide growth rate of 3.95%.
The unemployment rate in Caldwell was 3.65%, exactly on par with North Carolina’s over the same period. It represented an increase in unemployment in Caldwell, but just by 0.3%. That tiny fraction amounted to a decline of 12 positions in the unemployment rate rank among North Carolina counties.
The county moved from Tier 2 to Tier 1, spurring bad PR and making it less attractive for potential businesses.
“Last year, when we moved down in the tier rankings, we saw improvements in three of the four categories,” Ashley Bolick, Caldwell County economic development director, told CPP.
“The only area that we saw a decline was in unemployment rate, and our unemployment rate was still the second-lowest unemployment rate we’ve reported since we’ve been keeping records. So it’s hard to think of yourself as a Tier 1 community when all of your metrics are improving. People think we are going backwards, and that is not the case.”
In Surry County, the median household income dropped by just $2,300 between 2024 and 2025. That amounted to a drop of 30 positions in the median household income ranking, and Surry moved from Tier 2 to Tier 1. That marks the sixth time Surry County has shifted in 10 years, complicating the county’s economic planning.
The distress tiers system magnifies relatively insignificant changes like these while obscuring more meaningful changes. A Tier 1 county could improve dramatically without ever exiting its tier, and that improvement would be completely obscured by the system.
The tier system touches nearly every corner of North Carolina’s economy, from school construction to businesses recruitment to animal control. It has calcified into a static ranking that fails to capture economic reality and punishes counties at both ends of the economic spectrum. It resists the very changes it was intended to promote.
For North Carolina’s poorest counties, the system represents anything but a beacon of hope.

(Photo by U.S. Department of Agriculture)With roughly 170,000 Mainers about to lose federal food assistance and, in the absence of a state contingency plan, dozens of legislators are calling on the federal government to release emergency funds.
On Tuesday, 81 Democratic lawmakers sent a letter urging U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins to release contingency funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, in light of the agency’s warning that November checks would not be issued due to the ongoing federal government shutdown. 
More than 12% of Maine’s population will go hungry if SNAP benefits lapse, and about 20%of the children across the state rely on food assistance as well. 
“As the adults in charge, we simply cannot allow for 1 in 5 Maine children to grow and play on empty stomachs, especially with the colder months on the way,” wrote Maine Sen. Henry Ingwersen (D-Arundel), co-chair of the Health and Human Services Committee, who led the letter.
The loss of SNAP benefits “will devastate our local economies,” he added. More than 160 independent food stores, 136 grocery chain locations, and 80 farmers’ markets and farm stands in Maine accept SNAP, which helps generate $1 million in sales every year for local farms, which now face losing this revenue.
“The increased strain on food banks because of this lapse in benefits puts access to food at risk for so many families — including financially strained Mainers who rely on local pantries because they don’t qualify for other assistance,” the letter reads.
According to the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, even though the November checks will not be issued, SNAP benefits already loaded onto EBT cards remain available for use to purchase food.
SNAP is operated jointly by federal and state governments to help low-income families pay for food. In recent days, several states — including New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Nevada, Louisiana and Colorado — have announced contingency plans to mitigate the loss of federal food assistance. Other states, such as Florida and Tennessee, have said they will not compensate for the funding loss.
Most plans rely on additional funding for food banks as they meet the increased needs of residents. New Hampshire’s plan, for example, asks the Legislature to approve $2 million to open up 20 additional temporary food bank locations for the state’s 75,000 SNAP recipients. 
Maine has the highest rate of food insecurity in New England, but the state has yet to announce how it will make up for the federal SNAP cuts. At an event in Brunswick on Monday, Gov. Janet Mills said, “We’re looking at every possible contingency plan, talking with members of the Legislature and leadership about what we can do, looking for any possible alternatives.” 
While Maine has $1 billion in the Budget Stabilization Fund — commonly known as the rainy day fund, which serves as a reserve account to be used to offset a General Fund revenue shortfall — that is not available for short term SNAP funding, Mills said.
“People seem to think that the rainy day fund is like a checkbook I can use and draw from. I can’t do that legally.”
Mills’ office did not respond to a request asking if there are any updates on the contingency plan. 
Reversal of federal plan
The USDA initially planned to use its multi-year contingency fund to continue paying for SNAP benefits during a federal shutdown, according to a Sept. 30 plan that has since been deleted from the agency website. 
On Friday, the department released a memo saying that the fund cannot legally be used to provide November food assistance benefits for the more than 42 million people who rely on the program.
The fund contains roughly $6 billion, which still is short of the approximately $9 billion needed to cover a full month of the program.
U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, has urged Rollins to use any funding possible to keep SNAP benefits intact as the shutdown continues.
“The SNAP program is incredibly important to families in Maine,” Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, wrote in a letter last week. “I will continue to work with my colleagues to end this damaging shutdown and reopen the government but in the interim, I ask that you use every available tool to ensure legally available funds are expended to provide SNAP benefits.
U.S. Sen. Angus King and U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree have also signed onto letters encouraging the agency to use all possible alternatives to fund the program. U.S. Rep. Jared Golden of Maine’s 2nd Congressional District was not among the 214 House Democrats to sign the letter.

The name, 7-OH, is short for 7-hydroxymitragynine, and it’s made by chemically converting the main opioid-inducing element in kratom. Products containing it are sold in smoke shops, gas stations, convenience stores and online shops. 
The health department stated in the advisory that 7-OH is sold as gummies, candies, imitation ice cream cones, liquid shots, tablets and powders.
Sometimes it’s marketed as kratom, the department said, but it is “far more addictive.”
“Isolated 7-OH is currently untested in humans, unregulated, not proven safe or effective for any use and sold to the public without restriction,” the department said in its advisory. “Until safety data is available for human consumption, Missourians are advised to avoid these products.”
The department said both 7-OH and kratom have been marketed as natural promoters of alertness and remedies for pain, anxiety and opioid withdrawal. 
“However, isolated 7-OH products marketed and sold in Missouri have a far higher concentration – and therefore far higher potency – than natural kratom,” the department stated. “Research data reveals 7-OH has 13 times the potency of morphine at the opioid receptors.”
The department’s action follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announcement in July that it planned to restrict access to 7-OH products due to strong opioid-like effects.
The FDA sent a warning letter in July to a Kansas City company, Shaman Botanicals LLC, alleging it was illegally marketing pills that have opioid-like effects.
The letter sent to Shaman was also sent to six other companies, all but one of which have their products manufactured at Shaman Botanical using its patented 7-OH formula, Vince Sanders, Shaman’s owner, previously told The Independent.
Shaman was the first company to make 7-OH products. Its products are called 7-OH White Vein and Green Vein chewable tablets. 
Sanders told The Independent in July that the company conducted three research studies on its products, including using rodents and beagles, which he believes shows they are safe.
“We’ve spent an enormous amount of money and time on this,” Sanders said, regarding the scientific studies, in July. “My 82-year-old mother takes it twice a day. She was in so much pain… and it changed her life.” 
Aside from pain relief, Sanders has advocated in Washington, D.C., and in the media that the product can also be a harm reduction tool for people addicted to opioids.
“There’s some addiction specialists that are just like, ‘Hey, this is too important,’” Sanders said. “The public needs this product. We can’t lose it, so we’re going to have some big voices on our side.”
Sanders couldn’t immediately be reached on Tuesday for comment on the health advisory.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/7-OH-Advisory-image.png,,,2025-10-28 13:59:07.764778

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Across the country, families are feeling the sting of rising electricity costs — and Utah is no exception. Over the past year, our electricity prices have spiked by nearly 15%, one of the steepest increases in the nation. Nearly one in four Utahns now struggle to pay their electric bill in full.
Yet, despite this growing affordability crisis, Rocky Mountain Power’s parent company, PacifiCorp — owned by billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway — continues to propose higher rates while clinging to expensive, polluting coal plants. Instead of helping Utah families, the company seems more interested in padding profits.
Every year, PacifiCorp must submit a long-term energy plan to the Utah Public Service Commission. This plan is meant to identify the most cost-effective and reliable energy sources to meet our state’s needs. Right now, the commission is reviewing PacifiCorp’s latest proposal — and Utahns should be paying attention.
Instead of choosing cheaper, cleaner energy, PacifiCorp plans to double down on costly coal and gas. That choice would lock Utah ratepayers into years of higher bills and missed opportunities.
Even PacifiCorp’s own modeling shows that retiring one of its dirtiest coal plants — the Hunter facility — by 2030 would save customers money. But rather than move forward with that plan, the company is keeping coal units running indefinitely. In 2024, it even sought a 30% rate increase for Utah customers, 85% of which was tied directly to high fossil fuel costs.
Meanwhile, PacifiCorp has already acknowledged that renewable energy — especially wind — drives prices down. In its 2023 Wyoming rate case, the company reported that wind projects reduced costs across its service territory by $343 million. That’s real savings, spread across millions of customers.
And yet, instead of seizing that opportunity, PacifiCorp is walking away from billions in federal clean energy investments that could lower costs and create jobs. With just one year left to take advantage of the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy incentives, the company is choosing to forgo a 30% discount on new wind and solar projects — projects that could make our energy cheaper and our grid stronger.
According to a recent analysis by Utah Clean Energy, PacifiCorp’s reluctance to invest in renewables means leaving nearly $2 billion in federal funding on the table across its eastern service area. A recent Sierra Club report found that a high-renewable scenario would generate over $100 million in local tax revenue and create more than 20,000 new jobs right here in Utah — many in rural areas that need them most.
This isn’t just a climate issue. It’s a pocketbook issue, an economic development issue, and a fairness issue. Utahns shouldn’t have to foot the bill for PacifiCorp’s refusal to adapt.
Utah deserves that same reliability and savings.
As the Utah Public Service Commission considers whether it’ll approve PacifiCorp’s plan that benefits out-of-state shareholders, or push for a plan that serves Utahns, we have an opportunity to make our voices heard. Rocky Mountain Power customers can share their concerns by submitting comments to the commission, or even better, speak up in person at a public hearing on Oct. 29.
Our energy future doesn’t have to cost us more. In fact, it can cost us less — if we choose it.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/073124_hunter-power-plant_01-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 13:59:07.764778

Ron Kresha and Rep. Cheryl Youakim converse during a floor session April 12, 2023. (Photo by Catherine Davis/House Information Services)A lawsuit filed by conservative activists has accused state Rep. Ron Kresha, R-Little Falls, of lying about the number of people he employed on applications for a pandemic-era forgivable loan program. 
The Paycheck Protection Program was established by Congress in March 2020 to prop up small businesses and help them pay employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. Kresha applied for PPP loans for the economic development business of which he is a co-founder and CFO, Golden Shovel Agency.
Kresha’s company received more than $300,000 in the form of two loans, both of which were forgiven by the federal government. On his two applications, Kresha said he had 17 and 20 employees, according to the lawsuit. But during a deposition for an unrelated lawsuit, Kresha said he had no employees — only independent contractors, the complaint alleges.
In a statement to the Reformer, Kresha called the allegations “politically motivated and false.”
The plaintiff in the case is Troy Scheffler, who ran as an America First Party candidate against Republican Rep. Josh Heintzeman for House District 6B last year; he is represented by renowned Republican poster, lawyer and conspiracy theorist Nathan Hansen. The lawsuit is a qui tam action under the False Claims Act, meaning Hansen and Scheffler are suing Kresha on behalf of the federal government.
Kresha said Scheffler “has a pattern of filing frivolous lawsuits and has proven to be an unreliable source of information. Anyone can file a lawsuit, and anyone can allege anything, even lies.” 
Scheffler has sued Costco for assault, false imprisonment and disability discrimination over the store asking him to show his receipt and wear a mask in 2020. He has a “lengthy lawsuit history,” including against his political opponents, per the Brainerd Dispatch. (He sued the Dispatch over that article.)
Action 4 Liberty, a far-right faction of the Republican party, has criticized Kresha for being a “RINO” — Republican In Name Only.
State Rep. Elliot Engen, R-White Bear Township, who is running for state auditor, posted a video Tuesday calling for the GOP-controlled House Fraud Prevention and State Agency Oversight Policy Committee to hold a hearing on the matter. 
“We need an independent watchdog who has integrity, who … doesn’t selectively choose when to call out bad behavior,” Engen said in the video. 
Kresha said he is “disappointed with Mr. Engen’s misinformed attack.”
“He and I haven’t spoken and I am surprised that a potential MN Auditor doesn’t understand the difference between false allegations and actual fact,” Kresha wrote to the Reformer.
Republican state Rep. Drew Roach of Farmington, Action 4 Liberty president and former state Rep. Erik Mortenson and Action 4 Liberty founder Jake Duesenberg quickly voiced support for Engen.
“If these accusations have merit, Rep. Ron Kresha must resign immediately!” Roach posted on X.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/ronkresha.jpg,,,2025-10-28 13:59:07.764778

(Getty Images)A rare bit of respite from rising energy bills is coming to Rhode Island Energy customers under a trifecta of initiatives approved by state regulators Monday.
The series of refunds, discounts and protections for federal workers and contractors come one month after a 16% spike in winter electricity prices set in for Rhode Island Energy customers, reigniting public anguish over energy affordability and company profits. 
The largest savings will come through gas, not electricity, bills, though, under an annual reconciliation process in which the state utility supplier rectifies forecasted gas supply and delivery expenses against actual costs. 
While it’s not unusual for the utility supplier to over or under collect on costs associated with gas delivery and capital projects, this year’s mismatch was particularly noteworthy: $63.9 million in excess collections from April 1, 2024 to March 31, now coming back to customers.
“The size of this decrease is highly unusual, but it’s good news for customers this winter,” Rhode Island Public Utilities Chairman Ron Gerwatowski said during the commission’s Monday morning meeting.
In 2024, by contrast, Rhode Island Energy undercalculated its gas costs, resulting in a $3.3 million annual increase in gas rates for customers. Information on average annual changes in gas recovery costs was not immediately available.
The newly approved refunds will translate to year-long savings for Rhode Island gas customers starting Nov. 1, with the largest bill reductions concentrated in the first five months when customers’ gas usage for home heat is highest. For the average residential heating customer who uses 845 therms of gas per year, this translates to an annual savings of $188.51, with $109.92 of the refund distributed from November through March, according to calculations by Rhode Island Energy.
While Rhode Island Energy has faced scrutiny for overbilling some customers, including state agencies, Gerwatowski emphasized that the company was not to blame for the inaccuracy of its projected expenses.
“The overcollection of revenue was not intentional, but a convergence of many different factors,” he said.
Part of the unforeseen savings on supply costs reflects the company’s strategic management and preparations for available natural gas during peak demand periods, lowering costs compared with the previous winter, as detailed in its July 31 submission to utility regulators.

Penalties for overspending, service problems 
On the delivery side, however, the company exceeded its state-mandated cap on capital infrastructure spending for fiscal 2025, including for new meters, resulting in a $2 million fine. Rhode Island Energy asked for state regulators to waive the penalty, but its request was denied by a unanimous vote.
“From my perspective, the rules are what they are,” Gerwatowski said Monday.
Commissioner Abigail Anthony also said the company failed to present “real evidence” supporting its argument to waive the fine.
“The structure of the framework is really intended to hold the company accountable to a budget cap,” She said. “It’s one of the few tools that the commission can use.”
Michael Dalo, a Rhode Island Energy spokesperson, did not respond to questions Tuesday about the denial of its request to waive fines. However, Dalo said in an email that the company supported the reconciliation measures more broadly.
Another $301,000 penalty was added because the company did not meet minimum state customer service requirements, with more calls abandoned or longer wait times, among other reported violations.
Rhode Island Energy attributed the service problems to problems with technology transfers as it moved customers from the system used by former utility operator National Grid, to its own software, in August 2024.
Both sets of fines are included in the refunds to customers.
Low-income customers are also poised to benefit from unrelated credits on their winter electric bills under a separate proposal, also approved by state regulators Monday. The $5 million in proceeds from the state’s regional gas cap-and-trade program was one of several initiatives proposed by Gov. Dan McKee to cool the rage at rising winter utility prices. Eligible customers, who qualify based on proof of participation in other state or federal assistance programs, will receive $46.61 off monthly electric bills from December through February, for a combined savings of $139.53, according to company filings.
Relief for federal workers 
Meanwhile, federal workers and contractors who have gone without pay, or lost jobs, since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1 can temporarily stop paying their energy bills without risking fines or utility shutoffs. The policy change approved Monday was prompted by House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, who asked state regulators in an Oct. 23 letter to step in to help the estimated 11,000 federal workers and active-duty military personnel in Rhode Island. In Massachusetts, utility supplier National Grid began a similar program on Oct. 21, offering a temporary pause in bill payments for federal workers and contractors.
Greg Cornett, Rhode Island Energy president, indicated willingness to launch a Rhode Island program in an Oct. 24 letter to state regulators, alongside an early start to the regular, seasonal moratorium on utility shutoffs for low-income customers who fail to pay on time. The seasonal shutoff suspension typically begins Nov. 1, but this year, began Monday. It ends on May 1.
Eligible federal workers and contractors and military personnel can qualify for suspended bill payments, along with discount rates and payment plans, by filling out a self-attestation form online. Repayment is expected once the shutdown ends, with payment plans and short-term extensions available.
An estimate on how many Rhode Island Energy customers are federal workers or contractors affected by the shutdown was not available.
Shekarchi praised the company and state regulators in a statement Monday.
“Thanks to the prompt action from both Rhode Island Energy and the Public Utilities Commission, the hardship being felt by these families will not be compounded by the fear of losing access to basic services like heat and electricity,” Shekarchi said.

Show me your budget—and I’ll tell you what you value.”
Of course, our current federal government no longer budgets directly.  It stumbles through months at a time with extensions, continuing resolutions, and bills with large budgetary effect — but often not complete or even rational. Thus, it’s best to express the past several months of budgeting (everything from Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill to the current government shutdown) as a simple but profound value choice.
If you only could choose just one temporary item to extend, which would it be: Trump’s tax breaks largely benefitting the wealthy and corporations, or the credits that help many middle class and poor Americans pay for health insurance?
The numbers from Tennessee make it clear the latter is the far superior choice. The Urban Institute examined how ending those credit subsidies would affect health insurance policies done through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. For Tennesseans the average annual net premium would jump from $145 to $608, even if persons switched to the lowest cost plan in the market. More than 600,000 Tennesseans get health insurance through the ACA. The Tennessee Justice Center estimates the ballooning costs will lead to an estimated 265,000 Tennesseans being forced to go without insurance — and the rest of us pay through increased costs when the uninsured find care only through emergency rooms.
Report: An end to ACA tax credits to increase uncompensated care costs in Tenn. by nearly one-third 

If the Congressional Republican majority closes its eyes to the effects of Trump budgeting, Tennessee could see one result in rural hospital closings. One recent analysis found that nine Tennessee hospitals are at risk of closure if the current budget policies prevail. The problem is nationwide, but Tennessee has the highest rate of rural hospital closures per capita. This problem is exacerbated by our long and nonsensical tradition of turning down Medicaid expansion. This failure of our state legislature has cost our state more than $27 billion and counting.
Compromise may be the currency of legislating, but the current congressional majority already has turned aside one reasonable compromise regarding extending tax breaks. Congressional Democrats proposed an amendment that would continue the lowered tax rates for people making less than $400,000 a year. Only those over that high annual income would see previous rates kick into place. As 60 percent of the Trump tax break extension money goes to that higher income group, the budgeting becomes better — and we thus could extend the health insurance subsidies benefitting everyday middle-income families. Republicans, including those from Tennessee, quickly shut down that reasonable compromise.
Our current batch of Republican senators and congressmen from Tennessee are toeing the Republican line and blaming Democrats for the shutdown, but contribute little to any resolution — other than bloviating about passing their plan and maybe they might get around to all those other matters.
The current federal stalemate and government shutdown is particularly problematic. Democrats want to avoid the coming crisis of health insurance costs crushing family budgets. Further, trusting the GOP is a real problem because of the Trump administration’s record of snubbing law and tradition, and refusing to spend certain monies already allocated by Congress. Republicans control the White House, Senate and House. This fall already Senate Republicans have used the “nuclear option” (changing the rules to negate the filibuster and allow a simple majority to prevail) to jam through a package of dozens of Trump judicial nominees. Presumably they could do the same to ram through their awful budgeting, but haven’t gone there yet.

(Fran Baltzer for New Jersey Monitor)A federal judge Tuesday denied the federal government’s request to pause a challenge to sanctuary policies in four New Jersey cities, rejecting arguments that the federal government’s shutdown prevents U.S. Department of Justice attorneys from working on the case.
U.S. District Judge Evelyn Padin’s order will allow the federal government’s lawsuit over laws that restrict when local law enforcement in Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, and Hoboken can aid federal immigration enforcement efforts to continue.
Department of Justice attorneys had requested a stay, arguing the federal government shutdown, which stretched into its 28th day Tuesday, bars them from working on the civil case. The federal government wanted the matter postponed until the government reopens.
Democrat running for NJ governor wants to ban ICE agents from wearing masks

Chief District Court Judge Renée Marie Bumb earlier this month stayed most civil cases to which the United States is a party, but she allowed the challenge to the cities’ sanctuary policies to continue.
Padin on Tuesday challenged whether the shutdown would actually prevent federal attorneys from working on the case, noting that the initial complaint alleged a “crisis of illegal immigration” that caused the murder of American citizens and underscored “the gravity and emergency of this present danger and imminent threat.”
“In the Court’s view, the serious nature of Plaintiff’s allegations warrants this action proceeding in its ordinary course,” Padin wrote in her order.
In their letter requesting a stay, Department of Justice attorneys said the shutdown barred officials from working even voluntarily except in emergencies that threaten human life or property.
Former New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal, who is representing Newark and Hoboken, noted in a letter to Padin that other courts had allowed similar cases to continue because the federal government continued to fund immigration enforcement despite the shutdown.
Grewal added that courts around the country had rejected bids to overrule local laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration authorities.
The Trump administration’s suit charges the cities’ sanctuary policies run afoul of the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause, which states federal law supersedes state law so long as the laws fall within the scope of the powers the U.S. Constitution grants the federal government.
The cities argue the supremacy clause does not apply here because their sanctuary policies regulate local — not federal— law enforcement.

(Photo by Yereth Rosen/Alaska Beacon)Winter weather is settling in across parts of Alaska, and as folks start to bundle up, many are reaching for their thermostats. Unfortunately for many this winter, their ability to stay warm will heavily depend on events taking place over 2,000 miles away, in Washington, D.C. 
On October 1st, the federal government failed to pass a budget resolution, and the government shut down. Rather than protect the healthcare and pocketbooks of working-class families, the far-right has chosen to sit out negotiations as the House moves into an extended recess. In the meantime, the Trump administration has celebrated the shutdown as an opportunity to fire another wave of civil servants, building upon many of the layoffs that caused chaos across federal agencies earlier this year.
Across Alaska, thousands of federal employees can expect to be furloughed. The state is home to 15,000 federal employees, not including military personnel. Many of these employees will be forced to resign or work without pay. A week after the shutdown began, the Administration has thrown into question if workers can count on back pay at all, with the President saying “There are some people that don’t deserve to be taken care of…” in reference to federal workers. These developments are particularly alarming in Alaska, as the cost of living due to policy changes — from tariffs to rising energy bills — is rapidly increasing. 
A few federal programs provide a lifeline to our vulnerable economic neighbors. This includes the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, a program that helps low-income families afford their energy bills and prevent disconnections. In 2023, 4,737 households received assistance from LIHEAP in Alaska, the majority of which included a vulnerable household member. Future funding is currently tied up in the appropriations process, and the program’s solvency is uncertain unless a resolution is passed and funding is approved. Funding in Alaska is likely to expire in a matter of weeks.
During past shutdowns, other state LIHEAP offices have been forced to close temporarily or delay payments. As this particular shutdown draws out, Wyoming has already announced that it will soon run out of money for its program. In Alaska, where temperatures can reach extremes during the winter months, LIHEAP provides a critical public health service for many communities. Without the ability to access affordable energy, many folks may turn to unsafe heating practices (such as using a stove for home heating) or risk exposure to frigid temperatures. 
If the government shutdown ends in the near future, it’s still hard to imagine what sort of government we will be coming back to. Earlier this year, for example, the entire LIHEAP staff was dismissed by the Trump Administration. Further permanent cuts could severely hinder the ability of the services to be deployed in an effective and meaningful manner. Even if the government comes back online, without a guarantee of back pay, a number of Alaskan families will be left hurting.
One New Hampshire Representative recently introduced legislation to fund LIHEAP during the shutdown. As Alaskans, we deserve to know what our federal delegation is doing to protect our communities this winter.

Hifz Academy and Bayaan Academy in Tampa have together brought in more than $18 million in scholarship funds during the past decade, according to data provided to the Phoenix by the non-profit that administers most of the state’s scholarships, Step Up for Students.
Both schools on Monday came under heavy fire from members of the Florida Cabinet for accepting school vouchers while allegedly promoting Sharia law.
Of note, “Sharia” appears nowhere on either of the schools’ websites.

Hifz Academy has brought in $15,711,396 since 2015. Its biggest year was 2024, when parents used $3.7 million of Department of Education money to send their students to the Tampa school, which enrolled 501 students that year. Bayaan Academy has brought in $2,668,694 since 2017. Its wealthiest year was also 2024, with a $1.5 million state distribution for its 204 students.
Parents, not Step Up, decide which schools the funds go to.
The data come after Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia, and Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson publicly questioned whether it was legal for schools supposedly promoting Sharia law to receive these vouchers.
Although there’s no evidence that Hifz and Bayaan teach or practice Sharia law, Islam’s legal system derived from the Quran. Uthmeier amplified his concerns on social media Monday, responding to a right-wing organization’s article claiming that one Bayaan employee is related to a founder of the U.S. Muslim Brotherhood.
Florida’s school choice programs were largely expanded under a 2023 law allowing any Floridian, regardless of income, to apply for vouchers for private schools accepting these scholarships. This built off of a 1999 law providing these vouchers exclusively to low-income students.
As of this year, the program applies to 2,278 private schools, while 82% of participating students attend a religious school. Roman Catholic schools are the single largest religious recipients.
The programs provide an average of between $7,700 and $8,500 to students attending non-public schools. More than 122,000 new students started using vouchers in the 2023-24 school year.

Rand Paul voted no.Vance to huddle with RepublicansDemocrats are under increasing pressure to pass the House-passed GOP stopgap measure, with 42 million Americans at risk of losing food assistance for November, many federal workers beginning to miss their paychecks and one of the largest unions representing federal workers calling for an end to the government shutdown, now at day 28. Amid the government shutdown, the Trump administration has moved to lay off federal workers, and a federal judge is holding a Tuesday hearing to consider a preliminary injunction to block the mass Reductions in Force, or RIFs.As President Donald Trump continues his overseas travel throughout Asia meeting with foreign leaders, Vice President JD Vance is set to join Senate Republicans during their Tuesday caucus lunch meeting. Democrats have continued to vote against the House’s GOP short-term spending bill to draw attention to and force negotiations on tax credits that will expire at the end of the year for people who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. Republicans maintain the government must reopen before they begin any talks.Votes possible on SNAP fundingRepublicans are also weighing whether to pass a stand-alone bill by GOP Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley to approve funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. Ten Senate Republicans have joined to sponsor the bill, including Senate Appropriations Chairwoman Susan Collins of Maine. One Democratic senator also cosponsored the bill, Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont. Another critical deadline is approaching. Active-duty military members will miss their paychecks by Friday if the government is still in a funding lapse. The Trump administration already reprogrammed $8 billion earlier this month from multi-year research funds from the Defense Department in order to pay the troops. Before Tuesday morning’s vote, Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Democrats should listen to calls for an end to the shutdown from the American Federation of Government Employees, or AFGE, labor union, which typically aligns with Democrats. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, also cited the call from AFGE, telling Democrats “you have an off-ramp,” during a Tuesday press conference.“The largest unions are saying, ‘Please do this,’” Johnson said. “You can claim that as cover and say that you had to do it.”Last week, there were dueling bills from both parties related to paying federal workers amid the shutdown, but those efforts failed to meet the 60-vote threshold to move forward.The end of the 2019 government shutdown, which lasted 35 days, was in part due to shortages of air traffic controllers that upended air travel across the country and forced lawmakers to strike a deal. This report will be updated.",,,,2025-10-28 13:04:24.994700

A New Castle County senior is now living under a safe, secure roof thanks to a coordinated effort led by Roofs from the Heart, with support from GAF, Bank of America, and Good Neighbors Home Repair. The full roof replacement was provided at no cost to the homeowner through donated materials, grant funding, and volunteer-driven services designed to protect the health and stability of vulnerable residents across Delaware.
The homeowner, a retired gentleman facing multiple health conditions, had been living in deteriorating conditions since a tree struck his home in 2019. The damage caused significant leaks to the roof and bathroom areas, leading to mold concerns and unsafe living conditions. Without the financial ability to make repairs, he was referred to Roofs from the Heart by a close friend who recognized the urgency of his situation.
Roofs from the Heart stepped in to coordinate the full project. G. Fedale Roofing and Siding conducted a structural assessment and provided installation services at a reduced rate, replacing damaged fascia, installing aluminum capping, and adding a complete gutter system to prevent further deterioration. GAF, North America’s largest roofing and waterproofing manufacturer, donated all roofing materials through its GAF Community Matters initiative, which leverages industry expertise and resources to build resilient communities. Good Neighbors Home Repair addressed critical bathroom damage caused by long-term water intrusion, ensuring a safe and livable interior environment. Bank of America contributed a ten-thousand-dollar grant to fund roof replacement projects in New Castle County, marking its third consecutive year of partnership with Roofs from the Heart.
“This project reflects the heart of our mission, restoring dignity, health, and safety through reliable housing,” said Kate Domanski, Executive Director of Roofs from the Heart. “As housing costs rise and repair needs grow, more Delaware families are slipping through the cracks. That’s why our work providing safe, secure roofs matters more than ever. When we repair a roof, we’re not just fixing a home, we are helping rebuild hope and resilience in our communities.”
Roofs from the Heart was founded by G. Fedale Roofing and Siding and received its 501(c)(3) nonprofit status in July 2023. The organization focuses on replacing failing roofs to prevent displacement, reduce health risks, increase energy efficiency, and support long-term neighborhood stability for underserved residents. GAF has been protecting homes for more than 135 years and continues to invest in community-based programs that promote safety, sustainability, and housing access. Good Neighbors Home Repair is dedicated to ensuring all people can live in a warm, safe, dry, and healthy home through no-cost emergency repairs. Bank of America continues to support organizations working to improve housing security and strengthen communities across Delaware.

Randy Feenstra formally announced his campaign for governor Tuesday, saying he aims to “take Iowa to new heights” by working with President Donald Trump and keeping the governor’s seat Republican in 2026.
Feenstra had filed the paperwork to run for governor with the Iowa Ethics and Campaign Disclosure Board in May, and shortly after had announced an “exploratory” committee to run for governor. While Feenstra had appeared at several Republican events and talked about his vision for Iowa’s future, he did not formally launch his campaign until Tuesday.
In a statement, Feenstra said he wants to “take a workhorse mentality to Des Moines.”

“In Congress, I worked with President Trump to deliver the largest tax cut in U.S. history, keep men out of women’s sports and bathrooms, and stop China from buying Iowa farmland, and as Governor, I will work with President Trump to advance the America First agenda in Iowa,” Feenstra said. “Together, with the support of Iowans across our great state, we will defend our conservative values and take Iowa to new heights.”
Feenstra, a Republican from Hull, has served as representative for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District in Congress since 2020, when he defeated former U.S. Rep. Steve King in the Republican primary. Before his time in Washington, D.C., Feenstra had served as a state senator beginning in 2009 until he went to the U.S. House, and as Sioux County treasurer from 2006 to 2008.
The representative’s gubernatorial campaign comes in the wake of Gov. Kim Reynolds’ decision to not seek reelection in 2026. Her exit from the race means Iowa will have an open gubernatorial race — and a competitive Republican primary — for the first time in many years. Alongside Feenstra, Adam Steen, former director of the Iowa Department of Administrative Services; Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston, and former state Rep. Brad Sherman have launched campaigns to become the Republican candidate for governor in 2026. State Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, launched an exploratory committee for the governor’s race in April, but has not formally entered the race.
Among Democrats, Iowa Auditor Rob Sand is considered the frontrunner to become the gubernatorial Democratic nominee.
In a video launching Feenstra’s campaign, a narrator compares Feenstra to Sand, saying the Republican “will always stand tall,” while Sand “will say anything to climb the political ladder.” Sand has worked to appeal to Iowa voters as a moderate candidate during campaign events, saying he believes partisan politics have gone too far.
But Republicans have repeatedly argued Sand is more liberal than he portrays himself to be — a point stated again in Feenstra’s announcement video. The video claims Sand supported “anti-police radicals, higher taxes, weak borders, men in girls’ bathrooms, sex changes for minors, and misallocated millions of tax dollars.”
“Now he’s hiding his record,” the narrator states. “Liberal liar Rob Sand only sinks low, but Randy Feenstra always stands tall for Iowa.”
Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart criticized Feenstra for launching his gubernatorial campaign amid the ongoing government shutdown, saying the timing shows he is “the definition of an insider politician.”
“After failing Iowa families in office for nearly 20 years – first for 12 years in the Iowa state Senate, and for the last five years in Congress, Randy wants to bring the D.C. swamp to Des Moines,” Hart said in a statement. “Iowans are ready for change – not more of the same status quo that Randy Feenstra and this slate of Republican candidates would maintain, which has landed Iowa 49th in the country for economic growth, 48th for personal income growth, plummeting in public education, and number one for cancer growth. Iowans want a leader who will put them first, not special interests, political parties, or the millionaires and billionaires that any of the Republican candidates for governor would prioritize.”

The Cape Henlopen Vikings (5-3, 2-1 in district) and the Caesar Rodney Riders (5-3, 1-2 in district) stand a game apart in the class 3A district two standings. 
 
The Vikings will go on the road to Camden, Delaware, for their final road game of the regular season to take on the Riders, Thursday night. It’s the final home game for the Riders this season.
Cape Henlopen enters the matchup on a two game winning streak against a pair of district opponents. The Vikings defeated Sussex Central by two points two weeks ago and last week the Vikings scored a season high 47 points to defeat Dover High School. The Vikings lone loss in district play came on October 10 to district leading Smyrna High School.
Caesar Rodney enters the game following a victory over Sussex Central last week in which the Riders’ offense scored their season high 45 points. It was the Riders first district win of the season.
The Riders boast a strong defense allowing a little more than 15 points per game to their opponents. Caesar Rodney allowed just two opponents to score over 30 points against them this season. That dominant defense will have a difficult test against a Vikings’ offense that averages over 29 points per game. The Vikings have scored under 30 points just three times this season. 
This is the second to last game of the regular season for both teams as they try and make a late season push for the state tournament.

(Leah Romero for Source NM)Two recently filed lawsuits seek to stop Project Jupiter, the massive southern New Mexico data center that recently received approval for $165 billion in government-backed bonds, and allege that Doña Ana County commissioners violated state law by giving the green light to a project that had an incomplete application.
The litigation comes as a number of unknowns persist about the deal. Supporters of the project hail it as a major economic win for the area, but it’s not clear whether the region’s infamously troubled water system will be able to support it, or if it will be able to generate its own energy in compliance with state law. Critics of the deal, including local residents and state lawmakers who represent the area, say the project’s proposal for a natural gas generating station appears to exploit a loophole in the state’s landmark Energy Transition Act.
The Doña Ana County Board of Commissioners voted 4-1 on Sept. 19 to approve $165 billion in industrial revenue bonds for the development known as Project Jupiter, a 1,400-acre swath of desert that is planned to support artificial intelligence tech giants OpenAI and Oracle. Although Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham announced the project in February, some local residents and state lawmakers say they learned of the project too late to prepare for the county’s vote and that meaningful details remain hard to come by.

The nearly 400 pages of county documents governing the project contain a number of unknowns. They say the project will create about 750 full-time jobs with salaries of $75,000 to $100,000 and that the companies will “prioritize hiring locally,” but it’s unclear how that can be enforced. 
They say the project’s main water source will be drinking water from the Camino Real Regional Utility Authority, though it’s unclear how developers will pull that off as serious problems of water quality and safety have persistently plagued CRRUA. 
And they say that by 2045, the project will comply with the state’s landmark Energy Transition Act, which requires that utilities use fully renewable energy resources by 2045. Even that is not clear, though. State officials disagree about whether a last-minute floor amendment to a bill passed in the 2025 legislative session permits “microgrid” developments like this to skirt the ETA’s requirements of being 50% renewable by 2030 and 80% renewable by 2040.
“That leaves 20 years of potential pollution,” said Stacy Tellinghuisen, deputy director of policy development for clean energy at Western Resource Advocates, a regional conservation nonprofit. “When we estimate what it means in terms of emissions, it’s sizable. It’s near 2 to 3 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions per year. That’s more than PNM emits across its entire system.”
Data centers have increasingly popped up across the Southwest — the Phoenix area is the fourth-largest data center market in the nation, according to real estate firm CBRE. The arid climate and wide, open land are typically sought after by developers. Many data centers rely on evaporative cooling, which is most efficient in regions that have low humidity. Building in relatively affordable places with large lots of land for sale, like Arizona and New Mexico, allows data center operators to more efficiently transmit data to major metro areas like Los Angeles, Denver and Dallas. Traditionally, these thirsty facilities generate few jobs. Apple’s 1.3 million square-foot data center in Arizona employed 150 people in 2018, and three Microsoft data centers in the area created just 110 combined jobs.
Project Jupiter plans to pay a total of $360 million — less than 1% of the $165 billion in bonds issued for this project — over the next 30 years rather than pay property taxes.
A recent Western Resource Advocates report says a sizable portion of new strain on PNM’s electric grid comes from data centers and forecasts that PNM’s peak energy demands will increase 40% by 2035. In August, PNM filed an application with the state to be acquired by private equity firm Blackstone Infrastructure, citing a need to “provide the financial resources necessary to thrive in a rapidly changing energy environment.”
OpenAI, Oracle, developer Stack Infrastructure and the company that represented this deal at public meetings, BorderPlex Digital Assets, did not respond to requests for comment.
Water woes
While documents governing the project say it will generate its own power, they say water for the project will come from the area’s drinking supply. What’s not clear is whether the strained drinking water system, which is currently the subject of state litigation, will be able to rise to the occasion. 
Project Jupiter could use less water than its competitors, but this part of the state, in particular, has been roiled by water woes and critics aren’t confident the system here can support such a development.

In 2023, the New Mexico Environment Department found that CRRUA leaders had bypassed the system’s arsenic treatment and sent arsenic-laden water to residents. NMED recently sued CRRUA and asked a judge to place it under a receivership.
Developers anticipate that Project Jupiter’s “closed-loop” cooling system will need a “one-time fill” of about 2.5 million gallons per building, which will use and reuse that water, according to the project’s website. Ongoing water demand will average 20,000 gallons per day and will max out at 60,000 gallons per day, according to county documents. By comparison, the Meta data center in Los Lunas is permitted to use about 163 million gallons per year, an average of about 447,000 gallons per day.
“That’s not a huge water use,” said Anjali Bean, WRA’s senior policy adviser for healthy rivers. “But you can’t watch the news down in that part of the state without hearing about the challenges CRRUA has faced. The specifics are really critical and they aren’t immediately available.”
The companies behind Project Jupiter have pledged to spend $250,000 to explore potential for a water desalination plant, which removes harmful contaminants from groundwater. The process is typically inefficient and costly, though some nations desalinate seawater for drinking. Either way, it’s not yet guaranteed, Bean said.

When did the deal come together, and will it skirt state law?

At public meetings, officials representing Project Jupiter touted that it would generate its own power. There was no need to worry about an increase in energy bills, they said. But critics allege that the legislation that enabled Project Jupiter’s self-powering microgrid created a “loophole” in state law.
In February, Lujan Grisham’s office announced Project Jupiter as a $5 billion partnership with BorderPlex Digital Assets and said it would create 1,000 jobs.

On March 20, two days before the regular 2025 legislative session adjourned, state Sen. Michael Padilla (D-Albuquerque) introduced an amendment to House Bill 93, legislation regarding advanced grid technology. The amendment said that microgrids—systems that can solely rely on their own energy source, rather than drawing from an existing electric company’s power grid—would be required to generate fully clean energy by 2045. It did not make any mention of the Energy Transition Act’s benchmark requirements of 50% clean energy in 2030 and 80% in 2040. Doña Ana County’s documents on Project Jupiter say it will use a self-powering energy microgrid, powered at least in part by natural gas generation. It also states the project will have “large-scale battery storage” and that its leaders are “actively exploring renewable energy integration in accordance with HB93.”
By saying simply that microgrids must use 100% renewable energy by 2045 and omitting any requirement to be 50% renewable by 2030 and 80% renewable by 2040, critics like State Rep. Micaela Lara Cadena, a fellow Democrat who represents Mesilla, say that the law doesn’t comply with the ETA and that it does nothing to stop Project Jupiter from polluting for 20 years and then leaving town in 2045 once the clean-energy requirements take effect.
Padilla disagrees. He told Source that projects like these will still have to follow the 2030 and 2040 benchmarks laid out in the Energy Transition Act. He said the ETA “is the law of the land” and supersedes HB93. When asked why he didn’t clearly write those benchmarks in his amendment to HB93, he said it wasn’t necessary.











I used ChatGPT to try to fight and kill this ChatGPT proposal


– Las Cruces resident Derrick Pacheco, who is suing the Doña Ana County Commission over Project Jupiter



	After Doña Ana County commissioners approved the deal in September, Las Cruces resident Derrick Pacheco said it felt like an overnight decision. He filed a lawsuit on Oct. 17 against the commissioners, alleging that they acted inappropriately by issuing billions in bonds before the project had even gone through the Planning and Zoning Commission. That same day, the New Mexico Environmental Law Center filed suit against commissioners for approving the project even though its application was missing pages.
Ordinarily, someone like Pacheco might seek out an attorney. But he wants to fight fire with fire.
“I used ChatGPT to try to fight and kill this ChatGPT proposal,” he said. He uploaded documents related to the county’s vote into ChatGPT, which is owned by OpenAI, and asked it to find where commissioners erred. Then, he asked it to help him write a lawsuit.
He said he’s concerned about energy use, pollution and strain on a water system that is perhaps best-known for its lack of resilience.
“When you start getting corporate involvement in farming, and water and chemicals, it becomes clear that this is really just a fight for resources and the communities that are smallest, AKA poorest, are most vulnerable,” he said. “It’s clearly a resource grab, it’s clearly an energy grab.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Jupiter1-1024x683.png,,,2025-10-28 13:04:24.994700

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)A tense second day of Virginia’s surprise special legislative session erupted Tuesday morning into partisan fireworks, as Senate Democrats and Republicans sparred over a proposed constitutional amendment that could give lawmakers authority to redraw the state’s congressional map mid-decade — a move Democrats want to push through before next week’s statewide elections.
The proposal, which has not yet been released publicly, is expected to surface Tuesday afternoon and will be heard by the House Privileges and Elections Committee Wednesday morning. 
The session’s temperature spiked early when Senate Democrats voted to block the reading of a communication from Gov. Glenn Youngkin — a sharply worded letter blasting the session as a “shameless 11th-hour political power grab.”
“I am disappointed to see the General Assembly reconvening this week to ram through a constitutional amendment on redistricting only seven days before the close of our 2025 statewide and House of Delegates election and with over one million voters already casting their ballot,” Youngkin wrote. 
Youngkin accused Democratic leaders of trying to “subvert the will of the voters who thoughtfully considered and overwhelmingly voted to remove this very same politics from our redistricting process,” pointing to the 2020 referendum that established Virginia’s independent redistricting commission.
 Democrats reject Youngkin’s criticism as partisan

Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, moved to waive the reading of Youngkin’s letter altogether, saying it crossed a line of decorum.
“When it was placed at my desk, I quickly skimmed it, and I’ve never seen anything with the letterhead of the commonwealth that was so blatantly partisan and political — it should have been written on campaign letterhead,” Surovell said. “I don’t feel like this body needs to listen to anything he has to say. He’s a lame dog now, he’s not relevant, and he’s not involved in this process.”
Republicans erupted in protest. 
Sen. Mark Obenshain, R-Harrisonburg, invoked a point of personal privilege to read the governor’s message aloud himself, arguing that silencing the governor disrespected the office.
“Never that I can recall did we ever refuse to hear the message that was delivered from one of our governors,” Obenshain said. “While the contents of it may not be something that everybody wants to hear, I would respectfully submit that we owe the governor the respect of at least listening to what he has to say.”
 Partisan and philosophical divides

The morning debate underscored how little consensus exists in Richmond over the amendment’s necessity — or legality. 
Sen. Bill Stanley, R-Franklin, appealed for restraint, recalling the bipartisan spirit that once animated Virginia’s reform movement.
“Sometimes we must overcome our partisan desires and do what is right for the commonwealth as a whole,” Stanley said. “We looked Virginia voters in the eye, and promised them something fundamental, that Virginia would pick their representatives, and not the other way around. What message do we send to them if we walk away now?”
Democrats countered that the original redistricting commission had failed in practice, deadlocking along party lines and forcing the Virginia Supreme Court to draw maps for the 2021 elections. 
Sen. Mamie Locke, D-Hampton, who served on the commission, said the process “was anything but bipartisan.”
“There was constant gridlock, and partisan roadblocks were the reasons why the Supreme Court ended up drawing the lines,” Locke said. “What’s being proposed is an effort to provide flexibility for the future. And voters will have a voice in what’s being proposed — they will vote in a referendum.”
 Republicans warn of secrecy, speed

Senate Minority Leader Ryan McDougle, R-Hanover, another commission member, said Democrats were moving recklessly by pushing the expected redistricting bill.
“Between 12 and 1 o’clock, something that’s going to change the constitution of Virginia is going to be introduced, and not a single Virginian outside of a couple in this body … have even seen it,” McDougle said.
Sen. Mark Peake, R-Lynchburg, who also chairs the Republican Party of Virginia, called the effort “a travesty” given that “over a million people have already voted.”
“We have a process for amending the Constitution,” Peake said. “People know what it is, people weigh in with their legislators … but that is not the process we are undertaking this week. What’s it going to say? Like the rest of the 8 million people in the commonwealth, we can’t wait to see.”
Sen. Richard Stuart, R-King George, lamented that the debate had devolved into “personal attacks on our president and our governor,” warning that Virginia was losing its tradition of civility.
 Democrats defend timing, cite national stakes

Democrats argued that Virginia must respond to what they describe as a national “redistricting arms race.” Republican legislatures in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina are exploring mid-decade remaps after encouragement from President Donald Trump.
Sen. Schuyler VanValkenburg, D-Henrico, said Trump’s push to alter maps in red states underscored why Virginia should act.
“He’s going to the states where he has allies and saying, ‘Change the maps to make them better, because I can’t win,’” VanValkenburg said. “Donald Trump doesn’t want the people of Virginia to be able to have a say, and that’s why we are here today.”
Sen. Adam Ebbin, D-Alexandria, said Youngkin’s intervention only proved Democrats’ point that the process needed insulation from partisan interference.
“This letter is an attempt by the governor to inject himself into a process in which he is constitutionally and politically irrelevant,” Ebbin said. “Potentially giving voters a choice to revisit their past decision, under extraordinary circumstances, undermines no one.”
Sen. Barbara Favola, D-Arlington, emphasized that any amendment passed this week would still need to be approved by the next General Assembly in 2026 and ratified by voters.
“Whatever we start today is just the beginning,” Favola said. “Ultimately, it will be the voters in Virginia who will decide. We are opening up an option … we are even being asked to do this, by constituents, because they want a voice.”
 Republicans decry “Washington politics”

Some Republicans urged colleagues not to allow national partisanship into Virginia’s halls. Sen. Luther Cifers, R-Prince Edward, the Senate’s most senior member, said the chamber should resist “being pinch hitters for the power brokers in Washington.”
“Maybe we should be holding ourselves to a higher standard,” Cifers said. “If we’re not looking out for the people of Virginia, who else is going to do that?”
Republicans also accused Democrats of hypocrisy, noting that Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger once criticized mid-decade redistricting. Her opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, has used the issue to frame Democrats as backtracking on reform.
The House on Monday adopted the procedural resolution allowing redistricting-related measures to move forward during the special session — a rule change that Republicans said was sprung without warning.
Democrats maintain they acted within their authority to “protect democracy in Virginia,” as Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, chair of the House Privileges and Elections Committee, told The Mercury Monday.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Not surprisingly these days, free speech on college campuses is back in the headlines.
That makes it worthwhile to highlight the seven-page policy the Iowa Board of Regents wrote to proclaim how it values and protects freedom of expression at the three state universities.
Before getting to that, it is important to note the regents did not start with blank slate when they crafted their policy.
First, they and their policy must comply with the First Amendment, which became part of the Constitution when the lands of Iowa still belonged to France. Second, any sidestepping of the First Amendment could prove expensive for government administrators who discriminate among speakers based on the content of their speech.
We see this more clearly now after two Iowa public school teachers, in Creston and Oskaloosa, sued their employers after being fired or threatened with termination in the wake of the death of activist Charlie Kirk. Both teachers allege school officials violated their First Amendment free-speech rights over their Facebook posts about Kirk.
ON ITS FACE, the regents’ freedom of expression policy reads well. It says the policy conveys the board’s commitment to the principles embodied by the First Amendment and the Iowa Constitution. The policy provides a guide to students, faculty and staff at the universities in Ames, Cedar Falls and Iowa City.
Recent events, however, reveal troubling proof the board’s First Amendment pronouncements are not self-evident to current board members and university administrators they supervise.
For example, the policy states, “The Board’s fundamental commitment is to the principle that debate or deliberation must not be suppressed merely because the viewpoints presented are considered by some or even most members of the campus community to be unwelcome.
“… It is not the responsibility of the universities to shield individual members of the campus community from viewpoints they may find unwelcome, disagreeable, or offensive. Rather, it is the responsibility of individual members of the campus community to make these determinations for themselves and to respond, not by seeking to suppress speech, but to openly and vigorously debate those viewpoints that they oppose.”
The policy continues: “Employees are free to express personal opinions on their personal social media accounts, consistent with the First Amendment and its application to public employees.”
WHILE SOUNDING INSPIRING, and in harmony with what the Founders sought to protect with the First Amendment, actions can speak louder than words. And recent actions suggest the regents do not embrace the constitutional bedrock that freedom of expression and the First Amendment constitute.
Last month, the board met in a closed session to discuss the freedom of expression policy in the context of another social media post about Charlie Kirk, this time by a financial aid adviser at Iowa State University who is but one of the more than 10,000 ISU employees.
The private meeting lasted two and a half hours, supposedly to review the employee’s job performance as a lower-level worker making less than $50,000 per year.
The regents exited their private discussion and gave the schools two weeks to investigate each complaint about employees’ social media postings. They ordered the suspension with pay of any worker who was the subject of such a complaint while investigations ensued. And the regents authorized the school presidents to fire any employee who violated the freedom of expression policy.
TWO IRONIES FLOW from the closed session and the employee termination mandate.
First, it is choice that the people of Iowa, along with students and employees, were shut out from listening to what regents President Sherry Bates later described as a “robust discussion” of the limits of freedom of expression at the state universities. Robust, but secret.
Then, there is what happened to the employee who was the subject of the closed session.
That employee was (note the past tense) Caitlyn Spencer. When Kirk was killed, she took to her personal social media account as a private citizen after her work hours and posted her personal opinions about him. She noted Kirk’s opposition to limits on gun ownership and opined that he “got what was coming and I’m happy he’s rotting in hell now.”
Her posting went viral once supporters of Kirk learned she worked for a public university. They demanded her firing.
And the Board of Regents and ISU President Wendy Wintersteen complied — succumbing to the heat and pressure despite their policy saying, “It is not the proper role of the Regent universities to shield individuals from speech protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which may include ideas and opinions the individual finds unwelcome, disagreeable, or even offensive.”
In her termination letter to Spencer, Wintersteen wrote, “… your conduct and continued employment has caused, and is reasonably likely to continue to cause, significant disruption, harm, and adverse impact to the efficient and effective operations of the university.”
THE FOUNDATION FOR Individual Rights and Expression is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to defending the individual rights of all Americans to free speech and free thought. FIRE offered the following analysis in a court brief in a school case in Oregon involving freedom of speech and the assertion that an employee’s social media comments caused disruption — the same term Wintersteen used in her letter to Spencer:
FIRE said in its court brief, “The disruption must be of the classroom, not the teacher’s lounge or the local community; the complaints must come from students and parents, not teachers and outside community members; and the disruption must be caused by the speaking employees themselves, not outraged community members who cause a ruckus.”
Sadly, Wintersteen and the regents demonstrated that ruckus or not, they prefer robust expediency rather than forceful principles that encourage and protect campus speech, even speech with which we disagree.

The gift, announced by Paychex founder Tom Golisano, is the largest ever to UK HealthCare, second-largest in UK history and will “transform pediatric health care in Kentucky,” according to a news release from the university.
Golisano on Tuesday also announced sizable donations from the Golisano Foundation to five other children’s hospitals, bringing the Golisano Alliance to 10 pediatric hospitals across the country.
Speaking in Rochester, New York, home to the first Galisano children’s hospital, he said the alliance is an opportunity for the institutions to share best practices, knowledge and ideas. 
“As part of the Golisano Children’s Alliance, UK HealthCare becomes part of a nationally recognized network of children’s hospitals that exemplifies excellence, dignity, and innovation in pediatric health care,” Galisano said. “With this gift, I hope to further UK’s mission of advancing health care in the state and providing high-quality health care to children and families closer to home.” 
UK President Eli Capilouto said, “Mr. Golisano’s life has been about grit and grace, and that’s exactly what we see every day here in Kentucky. His generosity is a testament to his faith in what we provide to Kentucky and her children — a promise to extend compassionate care, to more patients, closer to home. We’ll translate his gift into acts of goodness to ensure a healthier, wealthier and wiser Kentucky.” 
The UK Board of Trustees was set Tuesday to approve renaming  Kentucky Children’s Hospital, its specialty clinics and affiliate network in honor of Mr. Golisano:

Kentucky Children’s Hospital will become Golisano Children’s at UK.

(Screenshot of Operation SAFE video footage)OKLAHOMA CITY – Gov. Kevin Stitt said he’s expanding an effort to remove homeless camps located on state property to Oklahoma City.
“Leaving people on the streets isn’t compassion,” Stitt said on social media. “The state is doing its job by cleaning up state property and protecting families.”
The action comes after a September effort in Tulsa, involving the Highway Patrol and the Department of Transportation, that cleared 64 locations and disposed of two million pounds of debris as part of Operation Swift Action for Families Everywhere. 
Homeless people were offered rides to treatment or housing facilities or a trip to jail if they refused to vacate.
No arrests were made.
Tulsa Mayor Monroe Nichols called the project a “manufactured” crisis, noting that Stitt did not consult with him.
After the Tulsa operation, business leaders and stakeholders requested that it be done in Oklahoma City, Stitt said.
Stitt said leaders are working with Key to Home, an Oklahoma City-based organization that works to connect people to services and housing.
“The governor just put on this political show in Tulsa and there is no evidence that it actually solved any real problems,” said Senate Minority Leader Julia Kirt, D-Oklahoma City. “We all want the same thing – to reduce homelessness and make our communities safer. But these short-sighted solutions do nothing but waste taxpayer dollars.”
Affordable housing, access to community-based mental health services and a living wage are the answer, she said.
“Until those issues are addressed, nothing will really change,” Kirt said.

A court-appointed special masater recommended two remedial maps to remedy a Voting Rights Act violation in Montgomery-area state Senate districts.(Photo/Stew Milne for the Alabama Reflector)A court-appointed special master Friday submitted two proposed maps redrawing an Alabama Senate district in the Montgomery area as part of an ongoing lawsuit alleging racial discrimination in state legislative districts. 
In August, U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco ruled that the current map violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting laws or procedures that purposefully discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. Manasco ordered new district lines to be drawn in Senate Districts 25 and 26, represented by Sens. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, and Kirk Hatcher, D-Montgomery, respectively.
After multiple check-ins with Manasco and lawyers with both sides, Gov. Kay Ivey said last month she would not call a special session to redraw the map, citing a similar case in the U.S. Supreme Court, Callais v. Louisiana.
Manasco then appointed the same team that redrew the state’s congressional districts in 2023 to remedy the state Senate issue. Richard Allen, the Special Master, recommended two maps to remedy the VRA violation.
Remedial Plan 2 aligns more with the current State Senate districts and provides a better Voting Rights Act remedy, according to court-appointed Special Master Richard Allen. (Map from court documents)

Remedial Plan 1 provides a weaker remedy to the Voting Rights Act violation than Remedial Plan 2, according to court-appointed Special Master Richard Allen. (Map from court documents)
The first map, Remedial Plan 1, reallocates South Montgomery in Senate District 26 to Senate District 25, leaving a tail of the south-western portion of Montgomery County in District 26. The northern part of the district is extended into Elmore County, which is currently in Senate District 30 represented by Sen. Clyde Chambliss, R-Prattville.
Remedial Plan 1 changes the Black voting-age population from 29% to 51.6% in Senate District 25, 66.1% to 49.7% in Senate District 26 and 23.6% to 20% in Senate District 30. 
The second map, Remedial Plan 2, completely reallocates the southern portion of District 26 to District 25. It also extends northward into District 30, but not as far. 
Remedial Plan 2 changes the Black voting-age population from 29% to 53.6% in Senate District 25, 66.1% to 48.3% in Senate District 26 and 23.6% to 19.1% in Senate District 30. 
“Remedial Plan 2 even more closely aligns with the enacted plan than Remedial Plan 1 … Remedial Plan 2 also performs slightly better than Remedial Plan 1 as a Section 2 remedy,” Allen wrote. 
The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Callais v. Louisiana earlier this month, and seemed open to limiting the consideration of race in the redistricting process. A ruling from the high court could come anytime before June, which is why Manasco put Allen to work before a ruling. 
In her original ruling, Manasco ordered a remedial map to be in place before the 2026 midterm elections. The qualifying period for candidates is in January.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AL_Senate_049-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-10-28 13:04:24.994700

Those who do not are left without access.,"When my grandmother began losing her hearing, our video calls became one of the few ways we could still feel close. Even then, every call began the same way as she stared at a frozen screen, apologizing that she didn’t know how to fix it. 
If staying connected with family was this hard, it must be even harder for older adults to reach their doctors online.

Xuehan Sang
The digital divide in healthcare is not just a problem with technology, but a reflection of social inequity. The tools that are supposed to make care more accessible often push vulnerable groups further away. Health systems and policymakers have a moral obligation to ensure that technology reduces inequalities rather than perpetuates them.Public health is based on the idea that people’s health is affected by more than just their biology. Where they live, how much money they make, what language they speak, and how much social power they have also play a role. When society treats health as a personal responsibility rather than a shared right, it overlooks how privilege quietly determines who can stay healthy.
Technology now reflects the same inequities that shape health. Access to the internet, devices, and digital skills are now a kind of privilege. Seeing lack of access as a personal issue misses the bigger social and economic causes. Many health tools assume people have money and know technology, and leave out those who do not.Research shows how these digital and social inequalities play out in real life. A national study of Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 and older revealed that telehealth access increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, yet remained significantly unequal. Older adults from underserved or socioeconomically disadvantaged groups were less likely to have reliable internet or to be offered telehealth by their primary care providers.
These differences aren’t about willingness to use technology; they reflect systemic unfairness. Even when older adults can get internet access, the design often fails them. A 2023 study on telemedicine in primary care found that older adults were more satisfied with virtual care when the technology was usable, accessible, and met their communication needs. In other words, complex interfaces and discomfort with virtual communication were big problems. Designing health tools without older users is like building a ramp without asking wheelchair users if it is too steep.Policy can either widen or bridge this divide. Between 2013 and 2019, states that required Medicaid to cover telemedicine experienced notable growth in live video visits and improved access to care, whereas similar mandates for private insurance showed smaller or less consistent impact. When governments treat digital access as a public good, more people can use it. Policy can expand telemedicine and reduce the usability and design barriers older adults face.
If public programs require technology to be clear, easy, and affordable, health systems and developers will make more inclusive tools. That progress is at risk of being reversed. Medicare’s telehealth flexibilities now last through September 2025 but will end unless Congress acts. This change would not only make things less convenient, but also cut off a vital way for millions of people with chronic illnesses or mobility issues to get care.A fair digital health system rests on three ideas. It requires redistributing resources such as broadband, affordable devices, and digital training as part of health infrastructure. It also requires respect for older adults learning to use systems not made for them. Lastly, it demands representation so that older people can help shape Medicare policies and technology design.Critics often argue that seniors simply prefer in-person visits or that the private market will innovate on its own. Nonetheless, choice requires access. A person cannot choose telehealth without broadband or digital confidence. In addition, inequities persist when systems normalize exclusion and then blame individuals for being left out. Justice calls for collective responsibility to invest in design, infrastructure, and policy that view aging not as decline but as a shared part of our human future.Imagine each senior housing complex with a digital navigator who helps residents schedule appointments or fix their tablets, and Medicare rewarding doctors for teaching patients how to use telehealth. These changes would return technology to its ethical purpose by strengthening human connection. Building equity means investing in resources that improve access and empower communities to shape the systems that serve them, because true justice depends on policies that redistribute resources and redesign systems to eliminate exclusion at its roots.My grandmother learned to use captions and larger buttons until she could join calls on her own. It showed how technology can create inclusion. The future of health technology should prioritize accessibility and justice to ensure meaningful participation for all older adults.

Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) speaks at a June 6, 2025 town hall in Lansing. | Kyle DavidsonBoth of Michigan’s U.S. senators, Democrats Elissa Slotkin and Gary Peters, have joined a letter to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services administrator Mehmet Oz demanding that his office open the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, website for “window-shopping,” a period in which enrollees are able to view different healthcare plans and their pricing options prior to the open enrollment window, which begins Nov. 1.
For the past eight years, the group of 28 senators wrote in the letter on Monday, such window-shopping has opened on either Oct. 25 or 26. Delaying this or not having the window-shopping period, they say, will lead to “sticker shock” for those enrolling. 
“Republican and Democratic administrations have ensured that consumers have the opportunity to review their plan options before open enrollment begins,” the letter continued. “This Administration has no reason to delay giving Americans this vital information.”
This is even more important, the senators continued, as health care premiums are expected to increase as a result of the expiration of a key Affordable Care Act tax credit — a sticking point for Democrats in the federal budget debate and resulting government shutdown. 
“Window-shopping is more important than ever before,” the letter reads. “The 24 million people who buy insurance on the ACA Marketplace need as much time and information as possible to understand and prepare for these significant premium increases.”
A request for comment was sent to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
Beyond the lack of window-shopping, Slotkin and Peters, alongside their colleagues, criticized guidance issued by Oz in June that they say has allowed insurance providers to exclude information about premium increases in mandatory insurance notices ahead of open enrollment — affecting millions of Americans. 
Slotkin is also asking Michiganders to send their letters from health insurers with notices of premium increases to her office
“The over 24 million Americans relying on the ACA Marketplace for health coverage need clear information from CMS and their health insurance plans, and they need it now,” the letter says.

Some states seek a loophole,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/28/gun-manufacturers-shield-lawsuits-state-laws/,"Since 2021, 10 states have passed laws intended to make it easier to sue gunmakers and sellers. Connecticut's is the latest to take effect.","HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Two decades after a Republican-controlled Congress gave gun manufacturers immunity from being sued over crimes committed with their firearms, blue state Democrats upset about gun violence think they’ve found a way to penetrate that legal shield.
Since 2021, 10 states have passed laws intended to make it easier to sue gunmakers and sellers.
The newest such law, in Connecticut, took effect this month. It opens firearms manufacturers and retailers up to lawsuits if they don’t take steps to prevent guns from getting into the hands of people banned from owning them, or who should be suspected of intending to use them to hurt themselves or others. Other states have allowed lawsuits against companies deemed to have created a “public nuisance” through the sale or marketing of firearms.
The legislation — and flurry of lawsuits against gun companies that followed — has outraged gun rights advocates, who accuse the states of trying to skirt the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.
That law, which blocked a wave of similar lawsuits two decades ago, says gun companies operating legally cannot be held liable for violent acts committed by people misusing weapons.
“They know these laws are unconstitutional. They know these laws violate the PLCAA,” said Lawrence G. Keane, senior vice president for government and public affairs at the National Shooting Sports Foundation. “They don’t care,” he said, adding that the real goal of the lawsuits was to harass the industry and drain it financially.
Gun control groups say the states have simply set clearer requirements for gun companies to ensure their products aren’t sold or used illegally.
“These laws don’t just open the courthouse doors to survivors. They also force the gun industry to operate more responsibly and, most importantly, can help prevent future tragedies,” said Po Murray, chair of the Newtown Action Alliance, a gun-violence prevention group founded after the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.
Two decades of federal immunity
Congress adopted protections for the gun industry after lawsuits filed in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere attempted to hold the firearms industry responsible for violent crime.
Many of those suits argued that gun companies had knowingly oversupplied certain markets with cheap handguns and ignored signs that those weapons were being trafficked to places with strict gun controls.
The firearms industry and the National Rifle Association saw the lawsuits as unfair. As long as gun companies weren’t breaking rules around sales, they shouldn’t be held responsible for violence, they said.
President George W. Bush, a Republican, agreed and signed the shield law in 2005, saying it helped stem “frivolous lawsuits.”
“Our laws should punish criminals who use guns to commit crimes, not law-abiding manufacturers of lawful products,” Bush said at the time.
A new approach
The legal protections Congress gave the gun industry aren’t absolute.
For example, a gunmaker that sells a faulty firearm can still be sued over dangerous defects. Another exception allows lawsuits against companies that knowingly violate laws regulating how firearms are sold and marketed.
When Congress drafted that exception, it cited the example of a shop that knowingly sold a gun to someone banned from owning one, such as a convicted felon.
The new state laws have sought to expand potential liability for gun companies by creating new rules for the industry. New York passed a law in 2021 requiring gun companies to create controls to prevent unlawful possession or use of their products. It also says they cannot knowingly or recklessly “contribute to a condition” that endangers public safety.
“Any business operating in New York must adhere to our laws — and if they don’t, they are held accountable,” said Democratic state Sen. Zellnor Myrie, the law’s chief proponent.
Several states and cities have used the new liability laws to sue Glock over the design of its pistols, saying it is too easy to convert them into automatic weapons.
Many of the new laws follow legal theories from a lawsuit filed against gunmaker Remington by families of Sandy Hook victims. The suit, which was settled for $73 million in 2022, argued that Remington’s marketing violated state consumer protection law.
What’s next?
It’s too soon to say if courts will uphold the new state laws.
A panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in July that New York’s law wasn’t expressly barred by the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, but that decision is not expected to be the last word. One of the judges, Dennis Jacobs, made it clear he believes the law is vulnerable to future legal challenges, calling it “nothing short of an attempt to end-run PLCAA.”
The U.S. Supreme Court, which is controlled 6-3 by Republican-nominated justices, hasn’t yet considered the state liability laws, but the gun industry was encouraged when the justices unanimously agreed in June to toss out a $10 billion lawsuit Mexico filed against top firearms manufacturers claiming their business practices fuel cartel violence.
Justice Elena Kagan, a Democratic nominee, wrote in her opinion how Congress passed PLCAA to halt lawsuits similar to the one filed by Mexico. She said Mexico had made no plausible argument that the companies knowingly helped gun trafficking.
“The Court doubts Congress intended to draft such a capacious way out of PLCAA, and in fact it did not,” she wrote.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/AP25301560278328-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-10-28 13:04:24.994700

Unless a deal is reached to end the ongoing funding lapse that began Oct. 1, more than 65,000 children in 140 local Head Start programs across 41 states and Puerto Rico will not get their federal grant funding come Nov. 1, according to the National Head Start Association. The federal government spent about $12.3 billion on the program in fiscal 2025.
Community programs that receive Head Start funding have different start dates for when their grants are available. 
Head Start helps fund roughly 1,600 community programs that served more than 790,000 children during the 2023-2024 program year. 
The program is managed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the employees in that agency who would disburse those awards are currently furloughed because of the shutdown.
Six programs serving 6,525 children did not receive a grant award Oct. 1 and are already tapping into outside resources and local funds to stay afloat. If the shutdown continues past Friday, another 134 programs that serve 58,627 children will lose federal grant funding. 
Head Start provides early childhood education, nutritious meals, health screenings and other support services to low-income families. 
It is a discretionary program and subject to congressional approval each year, making it particularly vulnerable to the government shutdown. 
“There’s just so much instability … that this is causing,” Tommy Sheridan, deputy director of the advocacy group the National Head Start Association, told States Newsroom. “And while we’re hopeful and we’re going to be doing everything we possibly can to try to minimize the impact directly on children and families, there is going to be a long-term impact, no matter what, that is felt.” 
Shutdown standoff
The shutdown began Oct. 1, the start of the fiscal year, when Congress failed to appropriate money for federal programs. 
Democrats have voted against bills that would temporarily reopen the government as they ask Republicans to negotiate a fix to expiring tax credits for health insurance premiums purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Republicans have refused to negotiate while the government is shut down, leading to an ongoing stalemate.
In a statement Monday, Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for HHS, blamed the impending lack of funds on Democrats. 
“More than 58,000 children are on course to lose access to Head Start funding and programs on November 1 due solely to the Democrat-led government shutdown,” she wrote.
Hilliard added that “the Trump Administration is committed to reopening the government for the American people.”
‘Collateral damage’ 
Sheridan criticized the political landscape that will likely lead to a lack of funding.
“I can’t stress enough — this is purely due to politics,” Sheridan said. “This has nothing to do with Head Start not being an effective program or people in Congress and the administration not supporting Head Start.” 
He pointed to the “strong bipartisan support” the program has received since its launch in 1965. 
“This is just us being collateral damage in a bigger fight that is going to be hurting working families and children,” Sheridan added. 
Sheridan noted that “when programs don’t have access to federal resources, generally speaking, they can try, depending on the size of the program, to stay open for a certain period of time, but they’re going to be basically using other funds, and then would be reimbursing those costs down the road, kind of like an accounting maneuver, to be able to keep their programs running.” 
He added: “That’s why we’re seeing so many programs either close or have to consider closures or things of that kind and why … we are just urging Congress and the administration to stop having children and families be the collateral damage of a political fight.”
Consequences for local Head Start programs
For programs that have to shut down because of the loss of federal funding, Sheridan pointed to several impacts.
Children would lose access to healthy meals and other resources. Families would be without affordable child care options, forcing some to quit their jobs or reduce their work hours. Community members could see economic ripple effects if staff who work in Head Start programs lose their paychecks or their jobs. 
“We also have community partners that we rely on for services, and they rely on us for business — small businesses, contractors, vendors, other small businesses, things like that — but they rely on their Head Start contracts, and if we can’t pay the bills, they’re not going to be able to count on us for what they need as well,” he said. 
Program already reeling
Under President Donald Trump’s administration, the program was already experiencing chaos prior to the government shutdown, including reports of delays in accessing approved grant funding, regional office closures and firings at HHS’ Office of Head Start.
That office also told grant recipients in March that it “will not approve the use of federal funding for any training and technical assistance (TTA) or other program expenditures that promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.” 
A federal judge in September temporarily blocked the administration’s directive that aimed to prevent immigrants living in the United States illegally from accessing Head Start programs. 
Meanwhile, Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget request calls for maintaining Head Start funding at its prior fiscal year level of roughly $12.3 billion.
The Senate Appropriations Committee passed its annual bill to fund HHS, including Head Start, back in July and provided $12.4 billion for the program, a roughly $85 million increase.
The corresponding panel in the House also approved its bill to fund HHS in September, aligning with the administration’s request of maintaining funding for Head Start at $12.3 billion in fiscal 2026.  
Sheridan pointed out that the program has operated through challenges before, whether natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, or previous government shutdowns. 
“Our programs are absolutely dedicated, hopeful and are working tirelessly to minimize that impact on children and families, but we cannot operate a program on hope and goodwill alone,” he said. “We need Congress and we need the president to come together to keep our classrooms open and also to ensure that Head Start funding can stay in line with the rising costs that we’ve seen over this last year.”

A recent public hearing over a proposed asphalt plant near Taylor in Lafayette County played out in a familiar way.
Neighbors, given a few minutes each to speak from a podium in front of a large audience, voiced  heartfelt concerns about the proposed plant’s potential impact on noise, dust, water safety and the loss of rural character. The developer, in turn, defended his right to invest and create jobs. Reporters framed the meeting as a “heated exchange,” a “fight,” a “debate.”
If you’ve ever attended a public hearing or a “town hall meeting,” this pattern will sound familiar.These meetings, meant to demonstrate transparency and community input, too often devolve into spectacles of frustration.
They invite people to perform their opinions rather than exchange their perspectives. Participants speak in turn, into a microphone, facing officials who cannot respond and neighbors who cannot reply.
It’s civic theater, not civic dialogue.
While a public hearing may seem as if it is open to all, it truly only includes those brave enough to write and deliver an oration that they hope will meet with the crowd’s approval – perhaps censuring themselves in the process, perhaps grandstanding to win applause.
In any event, it cannot ever become an authentic space to understand the full breadth and depth of a community’s opinions. It also normally occurs just before elected officials will decide a matter – hardly a moment that allows them to incorporate input meaningfully into their decisions. 
Public hearings are designed for recordkeeping, not relationship-building. They are procedural necessities, not spaces for understanding. They ask: “Did everyone get a chance to speak?” when the  more important question is, “Did anyone really listen?” 
Take the meeting on Oct. 20: Citizens opposing the plant, many of them longtime residents, spoke of family farms, clean air and the peace of their community. The developer spoke of economic opportunity and compliance with regulation.
Both sides raised legitimate points rooted in values we all share: safety, stability and stewardship of the land. But the structure of the hearing forced those shared values into competing positions.
Instead of How can we protect our community while allowing responsible growth?, the discussion became Whose side are you on? It turned a complex issue into a binary choice.  
There are better ways. Across the country, communities facing similar land-use conflicts have experimented with dialogue-based models of public deliberation – charrettes, stakeholder dialogues and consensus-building workshops that focus first on understanding before decision-making. These formats help residents uncover shared interests and explore creative options before opinions calcify into camps. 
What if Lafayette County tried something like that?
The next meeting on Nov. 3 could still follow legal procedure while making space for genuine listening.
Imagine smaller, facilitated conversations where developers and residents alike articulate what they value most about this place and what they fear losing. Imagine supervisors who not only hear concerns but reflect back what they’ve understood and how it informs their next steps. 
Public hearings will always be part of the process, but they should not be the only process. When we reduce democracy to a microphone and a timer, we mistake participation for engagement and hearing for listening. 
Lafayette County deserves a model of governance that goes beyond compliance to connection. It  could be different.

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas farm leaders are pushing Congress to get back to work and solve problems facing the agriculture industry, pointing out that a closed government doesn’t mean U.S. lawmakers can’t be in session.
“I’m up here in Republic County and there’s a lot of activity going around harvest,” said Nick Levendofsky, executive director of the Kansas Farmers Union. “And then, of course, wheat drilling and all that, too, and getting ready to move cattle off of pastures. The work doesn’t stop for farmers. We don’t pause, we don’t shut down. We have to keep going.”
Levendofsky, speaking earlier this month in a virtual press conference arranged by Kansas Congresswoman Sharice Davids, echoed comments from Kansas agriculture secretary Mike Beam to get Congress back to work.
“It’s time to get back to work on and really address some things, particularly some things that really don’t cost money — it’s just public policy that we need to address,” Beam said on the same call.
Levendofsky said the farm bill was allowed to expire, and even though some agricultural issues were addressed in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, much is left to do.
“I’ve talked with farmers in our organization, farmers in my area, and farmers all across the state, and they’re very frustrated with what’s going on right now,” he said.
As farmers are grappling with increased input expenses, tariffs and weather, Davids said she was “p***ed” about President Donald Trump’s expressed intentions to import more Argentinian beef.
“I think we need to be doing everything we can to support American ranchers and producers and farmers and not importing in stuff that we’re growing here,” she said.
Matthew Steele, CEO and executive director of the Kansas Cattlemen’s Association, listens to news everyday with a strong dose of caution and “trying to read through the lines.” As an engineer with a compliance background, he’s always looking deeper, he said.
“You’ve got to always be thinking about this is the black and white, what does all the gray around it mean?” he said in a call with the Kansas Reflector.
For instance, outcry about the potential of Mexico reopening its U.S. border to import feeder cattle doesn’t have as big of an impact as people might expect, Steele said.
About 1 million head a year come in from Mexico, out of 83 million head produced in the U.S., he said.
“It’s not that big of a number,” Steele said. “They’re still anywhere from three to eight or nine months from being ready for harvest anyway. Where the impact comes is those aren’t prime animals that are coming up. It’s not like they’re bringing in certified Angus roasts and steaks. It’s lower quality we grind up and serve as hamburgers.”
Still, the market took that news and went “crazy,” he said. Live cattle contracts fell Monday, dropping about $7 on Monday, according to Marketwatch.
Steele said his organization is telling farmers to call their representatives to share stories and help them understand how the system works. Although organizations like Kansas Cattlemen’s are advocating, it means more coming from the people who are doing the work, he said.
Adam Phelon, a Kansas Soybean Association board member who farms with his family near Garnett, joined Davids’ call to share his frustration with the shutdown and what a challenge it can be throughout rural communities with a “snowball effect” that hits many areas.
Phelon said farmers need consistency and certainty to make plans, and they don’t have that right now. He also pointed to families that need support from programs like Women, Infants and Children payments and a friend in the Navy who is stationed in Germany and wasn’t able to make their house payment that was due in October.
“The difficult thing is that even when the government does get back up and running, we’re going to be so far behind,” Phelon said. “We applaud the Congress for getting the renewable fuel standards up to where they should be, but those should be implemented at the beginning of November, and because of this government shutdown, it may be pushed back into the following year.”
Although Davids said the Farm Service Agency announced last week it would resume partial operations, that wasn’t enough to help Kansas farmers.
“This is just a Band-Aid on a larger problem of a government shutdown, and our farmers, ranchers, producers are hurting,” Davids said. “They haven’t received some of their farm subsidies or loans. Conservation projects are stalled, like one that’s near Baldwin City, Kansas, they can’t move forward because no one is in the office to simply process the paperwork. Without crop or market reports, producers are being forced to make major financial decisions in the dark. These programs are truly a lifeline for rural America.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20250812_191119-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-28 12:00:02.014219

(Photo by Tony Webster/Minnesota Reformer)The city of Minneapolis does not need to provide a legal defense for five police officers who are being sued over brutal crowd control tactics following the 2020 murder of George Floyd, the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled Monday.
Under state law, municipalities are obligated to defend and indemnify employees in most instances, but that duty comes with exceptions: cases involving “malfeasance in office, willful neglect of duty, or bad faith.”
“There is evidence in the records for these appeals — in particular the footage from multiple officers’ body-worn cameras — to support the city’s determinations that [the officers] ordered and used excessive and indiscriminate force in violation of the police department’s policies and that, in doing so, intentionally or recklessly failed to exercise due diligence in the performance of their official duties,” Judge Elizabeth Bentley wrote for the three-judge panel.
The five cops — Sgt. Matthew Severance, Sgt. Andrew Bittell, Sgt. Ronald Stenerson, Officer Christopher Cushenbery and Officer Kristopher Dauble — are currently being sued in federal court for firing pepper spray and multiple rounds of 40 mm “less lethal” ammunition at a group of people who were gathered in the parking lot of the Stop N Shop gas station on Lake Street in south Minneapolis on the night of May 30, 2020.
At the time, a city curfew order was in place, owing to the widespread protests, riots and arson fires that erupted in the wake of the killing of Floyd.
According to the federal lawsuit, the six plaintiffs were friends and family members of the owner of the Stop N Shop, which had already been looted. While they were standing guard over the premises, they say, police rolled up in an unmarked van and, without warning, began firing.
Immediately prior to the encounter, Bittell, who was leading a “chemical agent response team,” offered an instruction to his fellow officers: “Alright, we’re rolling down Lake Street. The first f***ers we see, we’re just hammering ‘em with 40s.”
Stenerson, meanwhile, was recorded spraying a chemical agent in the face of a reporter for Vice News, even though the reporter had identified himself as press. Following an internal investigation into the incident, Stenerson was fired.
The same night, Bittell was involved in the beating of Jaleel Stallings, who settled with the city for $1.5 million to compensate for his ordeal. Stalling got a fractured eye socket and an attempted murder charge, of which he was acquitted. 
While cities rarely refuse to defend an employee against a lawsuit, it’s not without precedent.
Earlier this month, the Minnesota Court of Appeals rejected an appeal from another former Minneapolis cop, Alexander Brown, who wanted the city’s backing in a lawsuit over his use of a chokehold on a looting suspect.
While the appeals court’s decision may come as a relief to Minneapolis taxpayers, it’s likely a setback for the individuals who are suing the city.
That’s because it is typically more difficult to collect settlements from private citizens, who may have limited assets, than from the government.
Eric Rice, the attorney for the plaintiffs, told the Reformer in a statement that he would “continue our lawsuit to hold those responsible accountable.” 
“We hope that the city will use its efforts to discipline those responsible and change the policies and culture that led to these violent and dangerous actions by its officers,” he added. “Without those corrections, the city’s refusal to indemnify would merely be passing the buck to avoid the cost of the harm done by its officers.”
Rice said his clients would continue to pursue a separate claim against the city in connection with the incident.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Minneapolis-Police-22924866924-Tony-Webster-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 11:17:27.999408

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)Larry Keefe, the first executive director of Florida’s new State Board of Immigration Enforcement, exited his post Tuesday in what the governor’s office says was a planned move.
A former U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Florida, Keefe’s position will be taken over effective immediately by Anthony Coker, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement liaison to the state of Florida. This comes months after the Legislature created the board to consolidate efforts against undocumented immigration and approve state grants to reimburse state and local law enforcement.
“Larry has done a number of things in our administration over the years, and he has performed at a very high level with honor and integrity, and we really thank him for his service,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said in a Tuesday Cabinet meeting. “I move to approve the appointment of Anthony Coker as executive director of the State Board of Immigration Enforcement.”
The three Cabinet members unanimously agreed to Coker’s appointment in the phone call meeting, which lasted under three minutes. These meetings are chaired by DeSantis and include Attorney General James Uthmeier, Chief Financial Officer Blaise Ingoglia, and Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson. Cabinet members are elected statewide and independently of the governor.
A representative of the governor confirmed that Coker will take over immediately from Keefe, and that this was a “planned transition.” It wasn’t immediately clear where Keefe heads next.
Keefe served as public safety czar in DeSantis’ administration early in his second term, helping to orchestrate migrant flights from Texas to Massachusetts in 2022. He was tapped as executive director of the State Board of Immigration Enforcement on Feb. 17, vowing to be “relentless.”
The board’s new leader, Coker, was announced in June to be the nation’s first state-embedded liaison with ICE.
“We’re excited to be the first state to announce our own ICE agent embed in the state,” Uthmeier said at the time, explaining that Coker would be stationed alongside Florida’s immigration board to support efforts against undocumented immigration, Talk of Titusville reported.
Keefe did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Screenshot from campaign ad)Republican Air Force veteran Jennifer-Ruth Green announced Monday she will run again for Indiana’s 1st Congressional District despite pending state ethics charges.
She first challenged Democratic U.S. Rep. Frank Mrvan in 2022. He defeated her 53% to 47%. It was the northwest Indiana district’s closest margin in decades.
“I have spent my life serving our country and striving to serve others. I love this country, and I am still called to serve. Today, I am announcing my candidacy for Congress because Northwest Indiana deserves better,” Green said in a news release. “The stakes have never been higher. When we defeat far-left Congressman Frank Mrvan and take back Indiana’s First District for the first time since 1928, Republicans will keep the House, and we’ll stop Mrvan and his radical allies in Congress from impeaching President Trump and advancing their socialist agenda.”
Indiana lawmakers are set to return to the Statehouse next week to redraw congressional boundaries early — possibly reconfiguring the 1st District into a reliably Republican seat.
In her announcement, Green promised to support President Donald Trump and back American manufacturing, lower prices, gun rights, border security and immigration enforcement.
“This isn’t about politics — it’s about saving America,” she said. “I serve our country in uniform. Now I’m ready to fight for the America we love in Congress.”
Green resigned as public safety secretary for Gov. Mike Braun’s administration in September. The Indiana Office of Inspector General filed a formal ethics complaint accusing her of ghost employment and misuse of state property. It came after Green signed a remediation agreement while an investigation ran its course.
Green previously commanded the 122nd Cyber Operations Flight in Fort Wayne and deployed to Baghdad with the Multinational Security Transition Command-Iraq. A U.S. Air Force Academy graduate, she is a Federal Aviation Administration-certified pilot and a former Air Force Special Agent. She also served as deputy commander of the 11th Operations Group at Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling in Washington, D.C.

Corteva — the former agricultural arm of DowDuPont — is keeping one of its corporate offices in the state with a move from Chestnut Run Plaza to the former Brandywine Building located at 1000 North West Street.
 
WILMINGTON — On Monday, October 27, Corteva Agriscience and the Delaware Prosperity Partnership (DPP) announced in a joint press release that Corteva Agriscience will be moving its Delaware offices to the former Brandywine Building in downtown Wilmington. 
The company is relocating its operations from its Chestnut Run Plaza offices following the expiration of its lease at the end of the calendar year. The building used to be the headquarters for the company, but it relocated its headquarters to Indianapolis in 2022.
Corteva looked at new locations across northern Delaware and southern Pennsylvania before settling on space within the 19-story building, according to the press release. The move follows in the footsteps of Incyte — a biopharmaceutical company — which brought its headquarters to Wilmington last year. 
“As major employers like Corteva and Incyte center operations here in the city, it’s clear that Wilmington is a place where business and innovation can thrive,” said Mayor John Carney via the press release. 
Corteva’s decision to remain in Delaware keeps more than 200 jobs within state lines and keeps the company’s presence in the state it was founded in.
“Corteva is a company built on innovation, and so is Delaware’s economy,” Governor Matt Meyer said via the press release. “By investing in and strengthening this partnership, we’re ensuring a Delaware-grown company like Corteva can keep creating good-paying jobs and shaping the future right here at home.”
Corteva could receive 1 million dollars in funding for this move via two different grants, according to the press release. The company could receive $500,000 from a Retention Performance Award Grant and another $500,000 from a Delaware Goods and Services Grant. The actual distribution of the grant money is dependent on Corteva meeting certain criteria set by the Council of Development Finance (CDF), according to the release. 
The CDF did recommend that the funding be approved, and Corteva’s application for funding was supported by the DPP.  
The specific criteria to receive the grant money were not explained in the press release.
“We’re pleased to continue our footprint in Delaware, where we and our heritage companies have enjoyed more than 200 years of partnership,” said Cornel Fuerer, senior vice president and strategic advisor for Corteva via the press release. “Corteva is an important company in an indispensable industry, and we are proud to say that the state of Delaware will be an important partner in our shared, bright future.”",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-28-163233.jpg,,,2025-10-28 16:57:06.061721

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Changes continue in senior leadership under Gov. Wes Moore (D), with the announcement Tuesday of two new deputy chiefs of staff.
The appointments of Michael Huber and Chichi Nyagah-Nash follow Monday’s announcement that two of Moore’s senior staff were leaving the office. The changes are part of a reorganization under Lester Davis, Moore’s new chief of staff.
Nyagah-Nash, the deputy secretary of the Department of General Services, joins the second floor on Wednesday to take over for Shaina Hernandez, who is leaving to run the Baltimore Public Markets Corp.
In her role as deputy chief of staff, Nyagah-Nash will oversee environmental protection, transportation, general services, information technology and energy. She earned her undergraduate degree from Alliant International University and her master’s degree from Johns Hopkins University.
Huber, an attorney who is currently the director of government affairs at Johns Hopkins University, is expected to join the Moore administration on Nov. 12. He will oversee economic development, workforce development, housing, insurance regulation, public health, education and human services.
Prior to his work at Hopkins, Huber was chief of staff to two Baltimore City Council presidents and to Mayor Brandon Scott. He also served on then-Lt. Gov. Anthony Brown’s unsuccessful 2014 campaign for governor.
Monteiro to depart service year program, Dorsey to take over as acting secretary

He earned his bachelor’s degree in political science from Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois, and his law degree from the University of Illinois College of Law.
Nyagah-Nash and Huber fill vacancies created by the departures of Hernandez and Jonny Dorsey, two departing deputy chiefs of staff.
Moore’s office announced Monday that Dorsey, part of the administration since 2023, had been named acting secretary of the Maryland Department of Service and Civic Innovation to replace outgoing Secretary Paul Monteiro. He was the first to lead the department that was created when Moore took office, part of his signature legislative effort to create a paid service-year program.
Dorsey takes over from Monteiro on Nov. 12.
The Baltimore Banner reported that Hernandez is leaving to become CEO and president of the Baltimore Public Markets Corp., effective in January. Moore’s office did not publicly announce or confirm Hernandez’s departure on Monday.
The moves are the latest in a series that has seen nearly a dozen senior staff and Cabinet secretaries leave Moore’s administration in advance of his 2026 reelection bid.
The changes also come as Davis takes over as chief of staff from Fagan Harris, who continues as an adviser to Moore but is set to join the Abell Foundation as the next president and CEO of the Baltimore philanthropic organization. Harris begins that job after the first of the year.

The pipeline is expected to have a total capacity of 20 million tons per year; Glenfarne said in a statement that the project will “reach a financial close” if there are deals for 16 million tons per year.
With Friday’s announcement, Glenfarne has now announced arrangements totaling 11 million tons, with prospective buyers in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Thailand. 
Tokyo Gas has a long history with Alaska; in 1969, it began importing liquefied natural gas from Cook Inlet, marking the first time the United States had exported liquefied natural gas. The terminal used for those exports was mothballed in 2017 amid the ongoing supply crunch in Cook Inlet.
“This agreement validates the strength of Alaska LNG’s commercial offering and the importance of Alaska LNG as a strategically positioned supplier of affordable, clean LNG for U.S. Pacific allies,” said Glenfarne CEO and founder Brendan Duval in a prepared statement. “Tokyo Gas pioneered the LNG industry with their agreement to purchase LNG from Alaska fifty-five years ago and is one of the most respected voices in the industry. We welcome their participation in Alaska LNG.”
AKLNG, as the pipeline project is known, would consist of a 807-mile pipeline from the North Slope to Cook Inlet, with a processing plant at the northern end and a liquefaction facility at the southern end.
Glenfarne envisions the project as being built in two phases: The first phase would consist of the pipeline itself and supply a limited amount of gas for in-state use. The second phase would include compressor stations and the endcap facilities needed to allow exports.
Glenfarne has said that it intends to complete a go/no-go decision on the first phase by the end of the year.
U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, speaking at an event hosted by the American Petroleum Institute last week, said he believes the timing for what is known as “front-end engineering and design,” or FEED, remains on track.
“There’s a lot of optimism about the Alaska LNG project, and the FEED study should be coming out in December of this year, and I think that we’re going to see a lot of interest in that project,” Burgum said, according to Reuters.
Later in the week, according to Bloomberg News, Burgum said that an alternative project, which would involve the sale of natural gas directly off the North Slope via icebreaking tankers, has also drawn interest from international investors.

The Michigan Public Service Commission took public comment Tuesday on guidelines for its integrated resource plan, offering residents a chance to weigh in on the state’s energy future during a hearing at Oakland Community College’s Auburn Hills Campus.
“It’s the spooky season, but the scariest thing in Michigan right now is AI data center’s threat to the Great Lakes state,” said Michelle Martinez, the inaugural director of the Tishman Center for Social Justice and the Environment at the University of Michigan during a rally held ahead of the meeting.

Data centers house servers, storage devices and other pieces of online infrastructure. They are considered essential for artificial intelligence and have contributed to a significant increase in demand for electricity across the nation due to their continuous, energy intensive operations, and similarly demand large amounts of water for cooling.
While the Legislature approved tax incentives for data centers in 2024 in a bid to court investments into Michigan communities, Martinez warned that failing to act will sacrifice water resources, balloon energy costs and risk accelerating climate change.
Rural petition seeks vote on Washtenaw County data center zoning

Martinez pointed to an analysis from Bloomberg News which found that energy prices had increased 267% within five years in areas located near data centers, warning that Michigan communities could face a similar threat, with seniors and people with disabilities particularly at risk.
Christy McGillivray, the executive director of Voters Not Politicians slammed the Legislature for moving forward with incentives for data centers without protections for ratepayers, while Andrea Pierce, the policy director for the Michigan Environmental Justice Coalition warned these facilities could deplete groundwater aquifers and disrupt ecosystems through thermal pollution of surface waters, alongside pollution with PFAS, methane and other harmful chemicals. 
“The only way to protect our water is through airtight regulations at every level, including the MPSC,” Pierce said.
Through its integrated resource plan, the Public Service Commission should require utilities to plan within water limits, Pierce said, factoring in cooling water needs, growing demand from various industries and climate-adjusted water scenarios.
The commission’s chair, Dan Scripps spoke with reporters ahead of the meeting. He noted that the commission is currently weighing consumer concerns in a contested case with Consumers Energy intended to protect ratepayers from the additional costs brought on by data centers, telling reporters he expected those issues would be addressed on a utility by utility basis.

When asked what role the commission could play in looking at the water use associated with energy generated for data centers, Scripps said that was not a role the Legislature had given them. 
However, when asked about the extent of the commission’s ability to institute air and water protections, Scripps noted there are statutes barring residential, industrial and commercial energy customers from shifting costs from one customer class to another. He also pointed to clean energy laws passed in 2023 – with one law instructing the commission to weigh factors like equity, environmental justice, affordability, public health and more when reviewing energy companies’ operations plans – as another piece of those considerations.
During the hearing, residents continued to raise concerns that a proliferation of data centers would bring additional costs to ratepayers and derail the state’s goal to meet a 100% clean energy standard by 2040.

Mikal Goodman, a member of the Pontiac City Council, stressed the importance of energy affordability and the environmental impact of expanding energy infrastructure, particularly as it affects low income residents and communities of color.  
He noted that many Michigan communities still have lead water lines, raising further concerns about the ability of Pontiac and communities like Detroit and Benton Harbor to access clean water should data centers open up nearby. 
“If our city of Pontiac is not able to get clean and affordable drinking water on a regular basis, that is a catastrophic outcome beyond the decades of disinvestment that have already happened,” Goodman noted.

Byron Donalds (R) (Photos via the Governor's Office and the U.S. House.)U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds and First Lady Casey DeSantis enjoy nearly identical leads in prospective one-on-one gubernatorial matchups versus Democrats David Jolly and Jerry Demings in a public opinion poll out Tuesday.
The survey of 728 likely voters by the University of North Florida’s Public Opinion Research Lab shows that Donalds leads Jolly by 11 percentage points, 45%-34%, with 17% undecided. Jolly is the only major Democrat to enter the race for governor.
The poll considered additional potential matchups for the 2026 gubernatorial election, which takes place in a little over a year.
In a one-on-one contest between Democratic Orange County Mayor Demings (who has said he is considering entering the contest), Donalds leads by 12 points, 45%-33%.
Casey DeSantis, who has been floated as a candidate to succeed her husband Ron DeSantis but has never committed, leads Jolly by a slightly larger margin than Donalds’, 47%-34%. In a fantasy matchup against Demings, she leads 47%-36%.
The survey does not poll the chances of two other Republicans for governor, former House Speaker Paul Renner or Lt. Gov. Jay Collins. Renner entered the race last month and Collins is still considering getting in.
Donalds has the endorsement of President Donald Trump and has raised more than $31 million, dwarfing every other candidate.
“We’re still a year away from the midterm election, and there are quite a few undecided voters,” said Michael Binder, the poll’s faculty director and professor of political science. “At this point, it looks like both Republicans are more than 10 points ahead of whoever emerges on the Democratic side.”
Moody & Uthmeier with strong leads
In the race for U.S. Senate, Republican Ashley Moody holds an 11-point lead over Jennifer Jenkins, the former Brevard County School Board member who entered the Democratic race for Senate last month, 49%-38%, with 10% undecided.
In the contest for Florida attorney general, Republican James Uthmeier, who like Moody was appointed to his seat and has never gone before the voters, leads Democrat Jose Javier Rodriguez by nine points, 45%-36%, with 14% undecided.
“In both the Senate and Attorney General races, folks are generally voting along party lines. In a state that has gotten more red with every election cycle, Uthmeier and Moody have the added benefit of  incumbency,” said Binder. “Moody likely enjoys a bit of extra name recognition, too, after gaining some national attention for replacing now-Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the Senate.”
Respondents were also asked what they believe is the most important problem facing Florida. The top response was housing costs, with 14%, followed by property insurance (12%) and property taxes (11%). The economy and jobs were also high on the list with 11%, as were political division and polarization with 10%.
Constitutional amendment on property taxes would lose today
Regarding property taxes, an issue DeSantis has been campaigning on for months, the survey shows that there is not enough support to pass their elimination or reduction if introduced as a proposed constitutional amendment. The poll shows 49% support for eliminating property taxes for homeowners in Florida, with 43% against. Eight percent said they didn’t know. Constitutional amendments in Florida must win 60% support to become law.
On childhood vaccine mandates, the survey (like several others) shows that Floridians on the whole do not support eliminating them, as the DeSantis administration proposes. A total of 63% oppose the idea, with 48% strongly opposed. Thirty-four percent support removing vaccine mandates for children.
The Epstein files
The poll asked Floridians if they think the U.S. Department of Justice should publicly release all the files associated with the Jeffrey Epstein case. An overwhelming majority said yes (83%). Nine percent said they should not and another 8% didn’t know.
When asked if they approved or disapproved of the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein case, 32% expressed approval, either strongly or somewhat, and 57% disapproved. Respondents were asked how likely it is that President Donald Trump is criminally involved in the Epstein case, and 45% said it is at least somewhat likely and 43% unlikely.
The poll surveyed 728 likely voters over the phone from Oct. 15 to Oct. 25, with a margin for error of +/-4.25 percentage points.

Jackson, a single mother from Columbia working as a certified medical assistant, said she has $44 of her family’s October benefits left.
“I’m trying to stretch it until the end of the month,” she said, “but is $44 going to make it until November, when we don’t know what’s going to happen?”
As Congress remains deadlocked on a plan to fund the federal government, and families who rely on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program wait, food pantries across Missouri are confronting how to make up for the potential loss of a key pillar of food security in their communities.
“We rely on families getting food stamps,” said Andrew Diemer, executive director of the St. Augustine Wellston Center in St. Louis County. “We’re just there to make a couple of the hard questions go away…. When families might not even have the money to buy food for the rest of the month, I don’t know. If this continues, fundamentally the role of our food pantry has changed.”
The Missouri Department of Social Services, which disburses SNAP benefits in the state, announced Oct. 20 it won’t be able to pay benefits until further notice, after USDA informed states that funding would run out. 
Approximately 650,000 Missourians receive SNAP benefits.
USDA won’t shuffle funds to extend SNAP during shutdown, in about-face from earlier plan

Four days later, the USDA said it couldn’t legally shift contingency funds to sustain SNAP, despite an earlier USDA shutdown plan indicating that was the department’s intention. USDA last month transferred $300 million into its Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, from an account funded partly by tariff revenue to keep that program running.
Food pantry directors said they are already seeing heightened demand, from families of furloughed or laid off federal workers, SNAP users trying to stock up in case their benefits pause and those struggling to cope with rising food prices.
Suzanne Wilber, executive director of Good Samaritan of the Ozarks in Pulaski County, said the group gave out 125 bags of food during its monthly mobile distribution to food insecure students at Ozarks Technical College on Thursday. It’s typical to distribute 30 to 35 bags of food per month, Wilber said.
“Some federal employees are getting paid and some are not here,” Wilber said. “We have had a number of folks last week come that had not come before. And again, we’re just expecting that to increase.”
Beginning Nov. 12, Wilber said the food pantry will be open later on Wednesdays, from 1 p.m. to 7 p.m., to accommodate people who work or have limited transportation. The food pantry is currently open Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.
In the St. Louis area, the federal shutdown and potential suspension of SNAP is compounding heightened need from tornadoes earlier this year and a strike of Boeing workers that has lasted almost three months.
Angela Gabel, executive director of Ritenour Co-Care Food Pantry in Overland, one of the largest pantries in St. Louis County, said she doesn’t know how food pantries will be able to take the place of SNAP.
“It’s like we were invited to Thanksgiving dinner and asked to bring a side dish, and now all of a sudden the cooks quit, and we have to make a whole meal,” Gabel said.
On Wednesday alone, the food pantry served 185 families, Gabel said, and registered 25 new families. The pantry is preparing to increase the number of volunteers signing up new clients and helping them shop the pantry’s shelves.
“Another part of the plan that we haven’t worked out,” Gabel said, “is how are we going to manage inventory for all of these new faces that are likely to appear because all of a sudden, they have no food budget?”
Missouri lost 1.6 million pounds of federal food aid to Trump cuts this year

Patrick McKelvey, executive director of Gateway Food Pantry in Arnold, said the pantry served a record 135 families Thursday. The previous daily record was 122 families in September — double the number of families the food pantry was serving on a typical distribution day two years ago, McKelvey said. The pantry signed up 40 new families in a recent week.
“We are setting new records every day, month, week, quarter,” he said.
McKelvey said the food pantry’s support from its largest food source is down $300,000 from January to September.
“In the past week, I’ve spent $10,000 just to shutdown-proof my pantry,” McKelvey said. 
The pantry is likely to open extended hours and extra days to meet demand, McKelvey said.
Food banks throughout the state source food from an array of retailers, private donations, federal programs and their own purchases. 
“We try not to put all of our eggs in one basket,” said Katie Adkins, chief communications officer at the Food Bank for Central & Northeast Missouri in Columbia.
The food bank, one of six members of the statewide coalition Feeding Missouri, turns around about two million pounds of food every two weeks, Adkins said.
Adkins said that although the food bank receives strong community support, resources are finite. 
“We can continue to try to use those other avenues of food sourcing to grow what we have,” Adkins said, “but when you have a specific amount, and you’re serving more people, that could mean that people are taking home less when they’re seeking help.”
Several St. Louis area food pantries have formed a coalition of their own, said Diemer, director of the Wellston Center.  
McKelvey said St. Louis area food banks are sharing information on the cheapest places to buy food items and planning to exchange supplies to allow variety for clients. They’ve started to pool bulk food orders in order to split shipping costs.
“That is new,” McKelvey said. “That is basically in direct response to the food crisis we’ve seen since the beginning of the year.”
McKelvey said people receiving food have been expressing frustrations about the federal lawmakers’ lack of a plan to end the shutdown or fund SNAP.
“There are people making decisions about their lives hundreds of miles away in Washington, D.C., and [they’re saying] how can we tell them how badly we need it?” McKelvey said.
Jackson, the single mother from Columbia, said she has been trying not to worry, “because it just causes stress and anxiety for my family.”

With one week to Election Day, the Yes on Proposition 50 campaign has far outraised its opponent, and support for the redistricting measure is slightly ahead in the latest polls. Early in-person voting has also opened up in some counties, though President Donald Trump is discouraging voters from early and mail-in voting — putting California Republicans who accept these voting methods in a bind.
If voters pass Prop. 50, one of California’s congressional districts that would undergo a notable change is the 48th District, writes CalMatters’ Nadia Lathan. Currently spanning an area in San Diego County known as East County, it includes rural regions such as Lakeside and Blossom Valley, and is represented by Republican U.S. Rep. Darrell Issa. Lakeside, for example, is 64% white and has a median household income of $103,000.
But to the southwest, East County also includes urban, Democratic-leaning cities, including El Cajon and La Mesa, which are represented by Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs of the 51st District. La Mesa’s population is about half white and its median income is $90,000.
Under Prop. 50, these areas would merge. The 48th District would absorb more Latino voters, as well as more Democratic voters from the left-leaning city of Palm Springs. Republican voting power would likely weaken as a result, making incumbent Issa — who cruised through reelection in the last two elections — more vulnerable.

Fredrich Bahrke, a 65-year-old Lakeside resident: “I don’t like that they’re changing that and lumping us in the urban areas. It’s going to put us in a district with people with very different views in our area.”

Issa isn’t the only GOP congressmember who could find themselves newly disadvantaged: Rep. Kevin Kiley in California’s 3rd District would take in more voters under Prop. 50 who had been previously represented by his latest challenger, physician and former Democratic state Sen. Richard Pan.

LA considers hydrogen

Los Angeles officials are deciding today whether to shift a 67-year-old electric generating plant to hydrogen-ready turbines, during a time when the Trump administration wants to rein in California’s clean-energy ambitions.
As CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo explains, the Scattergood Generating Station is owned and operated by the L.A. Department of Water and Power. The department’s commissioners are considering an $800-million plan to retrofit the facility to burn hydrogen, a potentially cleaner fuel.
But burning hydrogen is costly, water-intensive and still requires oil and gas. Some critics of the plan view it as a gamble.

Alex Jasset, director of energy justice at Physicians for Social Responsibility Los Angeles: “We’re dumping a lot of our very limited resources for addressing the climate crisis into an inefficient, expensive option when we could be instead investing in cheaper, more scalable, more immediate benefits.”

Further complicating matters is the federal administration, which earlier this month nixed $1.2 billion in funding for California’s hydrogen hub, an initiative to boost renewable hydrogen projects, including Scattergood’s retrofit. The administration this summer also limited tax credits on clean hydrogen production.

High school, reimagined

For students struggling with the structure and rigidity of typical high school classes, a school like Fresno County’s CART High could be a boon, reports CalMatters’ Carolyn Jones.
Founded in 2000, the Center for Advanced Research and Technology allows students to choose an area of focus — including business, psychology or law and policy — and learn about the topic in three-hour “labs,” or classes. These classes are taught by a team of teachers who weave in other academic subjects, such as literature, that are relevant to the topic.
The 11th and 12th graders at CART spend half their day at their regular high school in either Clovis or Fresno Unified school districts, and half their day at CART. Students are selected by lottery.
Attendance at CART is nearly 100%, according to its principal, and more than 90% of its students scored at least “proficient” in standardized English test results. Its alternative approach could serve as a model for a wider state effort to reimagine the traditional high school format, which is partly based on the factory model of the early 20th century.

Madelyn Quiroga, a senior at CART: “At my other school, they just throw stuff at you and never really explain it. Here, they actually teach us. And it’s all stuff we actually want to know, so it sticks in your brain.”

The last time the state raised the age was […],"THE MASSACHUSETTS LEGISLATURE is again debating whether to raise the age of Juvenile Court jurisdiction to include 18 to 20-year-old youth. The last time the state raised the age was in 2013, when 17-year-olds were moved from facing charges in criminal court to the Juvenile Court’s jurisdiction. Almost three years ago I argued that, from an equity and public safety perspective, raising the age again was necessary. Today, this position is even more compelling. 
Including late teens and emerging adults within the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court system is the most effective way to protect public safety, as recidivism rates in the juvenile system are significantly lower than in the adult criminal system.  
A 2024 report from the Center for Law, Brain & Behavior at Massachusetts General Hospital notes that there are no meaningful cognitive differences between 17- and 18-year-olds. The study, which includes the most current developmental research, also notes that nationally most juvenile systems feature lower recidivism rates than state criminal systems.  
These findings correspond with Massachusetts data from the Council on State Governments, which found that 76 percent of the 18 to 24-year-olds sentenced in the adult criminal system were reconvicted within three years, compared with only 26 percent of those in our juvenile system.  
This age group makes up 10 percent of the state’s population but accounts for more than 29 percent of arrests. Many 18 and some 19-year-old youths are still in high school. In addition, the Harvard’s Criminal Justice Program reports that African-Americans are 7.9 times more likely to enter the Massachusetts criminal justice system than white youths.   
The Juvenile Court, which includes a statewide juvenile court clinic system, specially trained judges, and probation staff, is well-equipped to hear cases involving this age group. Cases can be considered more contextually than in the adult criminal system.  
This is particularly true for late teens who are dually involved in juvenile justice and child protection cases. Juvenile courts have jurisdiction over child welfare cases involving families and youths up to age 22, and over delinquency and youthful offender cases until age 21. (Youthful offender cases are those involving 14 to 17-year-olds who are charged with certain felonies.)  
The state’s youth correctional agency, the Department of Youth Services (DYS), promotes positive youth development and educational continuity by providing greater opportunities and more opportunity for pre-arraignment diversion than exists in the adult criminal system. The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education is being sued for not meeting the educational needs of late teens in Massachusetts adult jails.  
Diversion also avoids the collateral consequences of a criminal record that compromises educational and job opportunities. When youths are discharged from DYS at age 18,  or 21 in youthful offender cases, they are not subject to parole and probation conditions as is the norm in the criminal system. However, over 60 percent of youth discharged from DYS volunteer to continue receiving support through the Youth Engaged in Services program. There is nothing comparable in the criminal system. About 20 percent of youth discharged from the Department of Youth Services reoffend, compared to rates nearly twice as high for 18 to 21-year-olds released from adult jails.    
The Juvenile Court has the capacity to hear additional cases. According to Massachusetts trial court filing data, since September of 2013, there has been a 53 percent reduction in juvenile arrests. Juvenile Court caseloads for all types of cases, including care and protection, status offense cases, delinquency and youthful offender filings, have declined by 23 percent.  
Trying to create the infrastructure to address emerging adult issues in the criminal system which already exists in the juvenile system would be very expensive. Creating emerging adult or youthful offender court models in the criminal system requiring an admission or guilty plea also compromises the presumption of innocence and can lead to a chain of prolonged court involvement from probation violations for reasons other than reoffending. Developing emerging adult units in criminal jails can hopefully decrease high rates of abuse and assaults in those facilities, but there is no evidence to indicate this approach has reduced recidivism.   
In considering these issues the Center for Law, Brain & Behavior’s findings on the age–crime curve are particularly significant.  Rates of offending peak by age 20 and then decline precipitously. While it may seem counterintuitive, this finding is true for even the most serious of offenders. Neuroscientific research has further shown that the adolescent brain is still developing until age 25. This research was cited by the Supreme Judicial Court in January 2024 in Commonwealth v. Mattis, when Massachusetts became the first state in the country to abolish life without parole for people under 21. 
Maturation contributes to a natural decline in criminal behavior. Applying an appropriate developmental lens which supports this process best serves the public interest. Treating late teens in the developmentally oriented juvenile system is evidence-based and provides for fair and proportionate accountability.  
When we raised the age in 2013 to include 17-year-old youth, the sky didn’t fall. Indeed, since Massachusetts raised the age to include 17-year-olds, we have seen a 51 percent reduction in juvenile crime rates. I am confident this history will be repeated if we begin the process of raising the age of juvenile court jurisdiction further. Let’s follow the science and be smart on crime.

Proposition 50 would join them together in an attempt to weaken Republican voting power.,"In summary
San Diego County is divided by its urban and rural regions in congressional maps. Proposition 50 would join them together in an attempt to weaken Republican voting power.


Fredrich Bahrke moved to Lakeside 25 years ago, lured by the ranch-style homes that dot its open landscape and the slower pace of life in the town of 63,000. 
“I’ve always been an out-in-the-country kind of boy. The rural life is more comfortable for me,” Bahrke said.
This portion of San Diego County, known as East County, is divided by its rural and urban areas in U.S. House maps. Lakeside sits in contrast to the county’s eastern, urban core on the outskirts of Democratic-leaning cities El Cajon and La Mesa.
Rural regions such as Lakeside and Blossom Valley in the 48th House district are represented by longtime Republican Congressmember Darrell Issa, while the nearby cities of El Cajon and Lemon Grove are represented by Democratic Rep. Sara Jacobs of the 51st District.
Proposition 50, the November ballot measure to temporarily draw new House maps to give California Democrats an advantage, proposes to join San Diego’s rural and urban East County together in an effort to weaken Republican voting power in an area known for its stalwart conservatism.
“I don’t like that they’re changing that and lumping us in the urban areas,” Bahrke, a 65-year-old former Naval officer, said. “It’s going to put us in a district with people with very different views in our area.”
Republicans drawing new partisan maps in Texas is not the same as California’s attempt because its state constitution allows it to do so, Bahrke said.
Under the proposed maps, the 48th District, which Issa now represents, would take on more Latino voters to become more competitive in the 2026 midterm elections and the following two election cycles. 
Once the head of the powerful House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Issa has represented parts of San Diego County for decades and built a positive reputation in the GOP for leading a series of investigations of the Obama administration.
Issa has cruised to reelection in the last two elections, but took a two-year break when he didn’t seek re-election in 2018, after his previous district became increasingly Democratic.
Merging ideologically distinct communities
The Republican-leaning Lakeside is 64% white  and has a median household income of $103,000 — 14% higher than the $90,000 median in La Mesa, where about half the population is white, according to a 2023 San Diego County report.
Liberal Palm Springs, which would move into the proposed 48th District, is nearly 64% white and has a household income of $69,000, according to a 2023 city report.
Candidates running in the proposed new district would likely need to focus on affordability to appeal across its rural and urban regions, according to UC San Diego political scientist Thad Kousser. 
“It will create a dynamic where a Democratic candidate will be looking both to capture moderate voters, but also to galvanize voters in deep blue Palm Springs,” Kousser said.

This marriage of ideologically distinct communities would be among many under the proposed gerrymandered maps, such as Northern California’s remote ranching towns being tied to parts of the San Francisco Bay Area. 
Some districts would also move into wholly different parts of the state. East of San Diego, the district Republican Rep. Ken Calvert represents would move entirely outside of Riverside County into Los Angeles County, which would give Democrats a more than 10 percentage point advantage in voter registration.
Calvert, who represents the 41st District, is a 17-term congressmember and one of the longest-serving legislators in Washington. He’s faced some of the most competitive races of his political career since the last decennial census redrew his U.S. House seat, which led to both parties pouring millions of dollars into his last two races. Calvert narrowly defeated his Democratic opponent, former prosecutor Will Rollins, in 2022 and 2024.
If voters approve Prop. 50, many residents currently in Calvert’s district would move into the 48th District and Republican-controlled 40th District in Orange County.
Tucked away in the San Jacinto Mountains southwest of Palm Springs, Mary Rider, a retired community college counselor in Idyllwild, said her support for Prop. 50 is a “moral decision.”
She and other Riverside County voters would be shifted into the more competitive 48th District if voters approve the measure.
“If we have to break a rule, so to speak, to make sure what’s best for everyone occurs, we break that rule,” Rider said. She agrees with the argument that Prop. 50 is the only way to respond to Republicans gerrymandering in Texas and other states.
Districts are typically drawn at the beginning of the decade after the U.S. Census. Most state legislatures create their own congressional maps, but in California, voters approved an independent redistricting commission of regular citizens to draw the maps. Prop. 50 asks voters to temporarily suspend the independent maps for three cycles in favor of the ones drawn by Democrats.
Gov. Gavin Newsom has said the measure is in response to Texas Republicans drawing their own maps in favor of  Republicans ahead of the 2026 elections to make it easier for them to maintain control of the House.
A handful of Democratic hopefuls are eyeing seats in both districts, including a public school teacher and a San Diego city councilmember. But all prospective candidates, including deep-seated congressmembers Calvert and Issa, are in limbo until after the November special election.
So far, the Yes campaign has raised a whopping $97 million and is bolstered by star-powered ads featuring the likes of former President Barack Obama. The No side has drawn in less than half of that, at $42 million.
A message to lawmakers
Nickie Watts of Palm Desert, views Prop. 50 as a tool to hold Calvert accountable. 
“I have never seen him. You don’t really hear about him,” said Watts, who says she has lived in Palm Desert for decades. “He’s like an invisible human.”

Calvert, like a majority of GOP members across the country, has abstained from doing in-person town halls where constituents outraged over Republican support of President Donald Trump’s policies have become common.
“Gerrymandering districts because you disagree with the outcome of an election is politics at its worst,” spokesperson Calvin Moore said of voters supporting Prop. 50 in response to Calvert’s record.
Issa has similarly faced mounting criticism from his constituents for not holding any in-person town halls this year.
A spokesperson for Issa, Jonathan Wilcox, dismissed the idea that constituents upset with Issa’s voting record could play a role in Prop. 50 passing.
“I don’t dispute that Democrats around the country are opposed to the policies of the congressman and Republican Party,” he said.
Maree Doden, a 74-year-old former city employee in Palm Desert, said she is a Democrat but is worried about the precedent that approving partisan maps would set. She said Texas gerrymandering its own maps was not a strong enough reason to retaliate.
“I am not a fan of President Trump,” she said. “But this just felt like you’re taking a process and you’re now saying, ‘Let’s dump that process and all the work we took in passing it and throw that out the window.’”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/102525_SoCal-Prop50_ZM_CM_03.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-28 09:00:16.046253

(Photo courtesy Three Square of Southern Nevada)The State of Nevada plans to quickly funnel $38.8 million toward local food banks in hopes fewer people will go hungry next month when $90 million in federally funded “food stamps” are not delivered to low-income people and families.
A memo released by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo’s office Monday announced a $38.8 million “Food Insecurity Nevada Plan” that will prop up local food banks, which are expected to see a flood of demand from the approximately half a million residents who currently receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as SNAP or by the antiquated term food stamps.
SNAP benefits are 100% federally funded. Nevadans receive approximately $90 million in SNAP benefits each month.
Because of the federal government shutdown, and because of a USDA decision to not follow its own contingency plan outlining the use of nearly $6 billion in emergency funds to keep providing food assistance, SNAP benefits are expected to come to a screeching halt for more than 42 million people nationwide.
The “Food Insecurity Nevada Plan” proposes taking $30.2 million from the Interim Finance Committee’s contingency fund, which lawmakers typically use to pay for unexpected expenses like lawsuit settlements or overtime salaries. Another $8.6 million will be reallocated from other already approved projects, though the details of that are not yet public.
Lombardo’s memo says he will engage the Nevada National Guard “to assist with food distribution to those in need.” To that end, he is requesting legislators approve $200,000 for their pay.
The Nevada Board of Examiners — composed of the governor, Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford, and Democratic Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar — is scheduled to meet Wednesday morning to consider the IFC contingency fund transfer and National Guard salaries.
The Interim Finance Committee is scheduled to meet Thursday afternoon to give final approval. The agenda of that meeting had not been posted online as of late Monday.
Nevada’s planned response is similar to what’s being done by its neighbor to the west. California Gov. Gavin Newsom last week announced the state would fast track $80 million in funding to food banks and deploy its national guard to assist at food banks.
Several California food banks declined that help, citing community fear.
Lombardo in August authorized the use of the Nevada National Guard to support U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Officials have said that work is administrative in nature and only involves 1% of the state’s guard. Still, distrust within immigrant communities is high.
The “Food Insecurity Nevada Plan” is expected to boost local food banks across the state. 
“The resources provided through these community programs are intended to make sure that no family goes hungry during this crisis,” said Lombardo spokesperson Elizabeth Ray in an emailed statement to the Nevada Current.
Key details are unknown, such as what time period the $38.8 million will be used over, and to what extent the food banks have capacity to scale up their services.
Even before the federal government shut down on Oct. 1  food banks were already struggling to meet increased demand. They have also been dealing with earlier cuts to federal grant programs.
SNAP benefits are distributed via an electronic benefits transfer (EBT) system, in which recipients get benefits deposited on what is effectively a debit card that can be used to purchase items in stores. Best efforts notwithstanding, food banks will not be able to fill the void left by discontinued SNAP funding of EBT cards.
A spokesperson for Food Bank of Northern Nevada told the Current the food bank is “working on aggressive food sourcing through donations and purchased food” but acknowledged that, even with additional state money, it will be an impossible task to immediately help each of the 77,008 people in Northern Nevada set to lose their SNAP benefits on Saturday.
“For every meal that we provide, SNAP provides nine, making it impossible for us to scale up our operations to that level,” said spokesperson Jocelyn Lantrip in an email. “We do want our communities to know that we are here to help them and we will do everything that we can to offer that support.”
Three Square of Southern Nevada did not provide a comment by publication time.
Lawsuit expected
On Friday, 23 Democratic attorneys general sent a letter to USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins questioning the legality of the department’s decision not to draw on its own contingency fund to continue SNAP funding during the shutdown. Ford signed Nevada onto that letter.
Dozens of Democratic AGs and governors are expected to file a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Tuesday, according to Politico.
Vermont Gov. Phil Scott, a Republican, on Monday released a statement saying “there is bipartisan support for a lawsuit seeking to require the federal government to release contingency funding it has available for emergencies.”
Ford’s office would not confirm reports of a lawsuit Monday, but in a statement provided to the Current, Ford said he would “take any and all legal actions available to me to protect SNAP recipients from going hungry.” 
Senate Majority Leader Nicole Cannizaro, a Democrat now running to succeed Ford as Nevada AG, on Monday sent a letter to Ford urging him “to employ every available legal remedy, including federal litigation.”
Other top Democrats in the state continue to criticize President Donald Trump
“The Trump administration is finding any excuse they can possibly come up with to avoid helping Nevadans have Thanksgiving,” said Nevada State Treasurer Zach Conine, adding that the administration is doing it “in exchange for the pressure that they’re hoping it’s going to put on Democratic senators to vote for a continuing resolution.”
The USDA website blames the shutdown and drying up of SNAP funds on Senate Democrats, falsely accusing them of prioritizing “healthcare for illegal aliens and gender mutilation procedures.”
Senate Democrats, including Nevada’s U.S. Sen. Jacky Rosen, have been clear their priority is maintaining Affordable Care Act premium subsidies. ACA plans are not available to undocumented immigrants.



Who receives SNAP in Nevada?
Approximately 500,000 Nevada residents receive SNAP benefits. That’s 1 in 6 people, more than the national average of 1 in 8 people.
According to the Nevada Division of Social Services:

40% of SNAP recipients are children;
1 in 3 of households include a child/children;
29% of households include an elderly person; and
22% of households include an individual with disabilities.

In Nevada, 70% of households receiving SNAP benefits report having other income; 28% report earned income, meaning a wage or salary.
Social Security benefits are one of the most common non-wage sources of income, according to the DSS. Other sources of income include child support or unemployment benefits.
What benefits do SNAP recipients receive?
SNAP benefits vary depending on income level and household size. But, according to the governor’s office, for October 2025:

15.58% of households received $100 or less, and
8.4% of households received $25 or less.

According to The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the average SNAP benefit in Nevada during federal fiscal year 2024 was $166 for each household member per month. That’s equivalent to $5.46 for each household member per day.
The average monthly SNAP benefit for all households in fiscal year was $276. For households with children, it was $479.
Benefits are accessed via electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards, which look similar to a debit or credit card. They are issued during the first 10 days of each month, with Nevadans receiving their benefits on the day of the month that aligns with the last digit of their birth year. (For example: A person born in 1986 would receive hers on the 6th.)

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)As Utah’s housing affordability crisis continues to be a stated top priority for the state’s political leaders, short-term rentals — like Airbnbs and VRBOs — have been in some policymakers’ crosshairs. 
Lawmakers for years have contemplated changes to Utah’s short-term rental laws — some to allow more restrictions and others more leniency — but it’s a moving target as the number of short-term rentals continues to grow. 
Past research has shown that short-term rentals eat into less than 2% of the statewide housing market, but they have a bigger impact on vacation areas like Park City, Moab and St. George. Housing experts have stressed that short-term rentals — while they impact some communities more than others — are taking up only a fraction of the state’s housing stock, and they’re just a small piece of the state’s housing affordability crisis. 
Still, lawmakers have explored legislation targeting short-term rentals, including possibly enacting higher taxes on the properties. So a Utah taxpayer watchdog group recently commissioned a new report wanting to give lawmakers a bigger picture of short-term rentals’ impact — both on housing and the economy. 
How much are short-term rentals like Airbnbs actually cramping Utah’s housing stock?

Billy Hesterman, president of the Utah Taxpayers Association, told Utah News Dispatch on Monday that he wants policymakers to “look at the whole picture” when it comes to short-term rentals — not just in the housing affordability conversation, but also as economic drivers. 
“Short-term rentals are often framed as having an outsized impact on housing supply while only benefiting the relatively few Utahns who own them,” Hesterman said in a prepared statement issued alongside the report. “This couldn’t be further from the truth; the report shows that short-term rentals benefit small businesses, contribute to local economies, and generate needed tax revenue. As Utah grows, it’s important that our elected officials understand the role short-term rentals can play in boosting communities across the state.”
The report released earlier this month concluded that while short-term rentals “continue to be a significant component of Utah’s tourism landscape, their broader impact on housing supply and affordability is relatively limited at the statewide level.” 
They account for only 1.9% of the state’s total housing stock, the report said. And even in the communities where they’re the most concentrated, if they were to be converted into for-sale homes, they still “would not fundamentally solve local housing shortages or materially shift affordability for most residents.”
To understand their impact, the Utah Taxpayers Association study tested a scenario: What if the state’s short-term rental properties were converted into traditional residential housing? 
“We wanted to evaluate what would happen if all of the current STR stock became available, residential housing,” said Hesterman. “This helps us understand what’s at stake and whether or not STRs are a major driver of supply-side availability and affordability.”
Even if all of Utah’s year-round short-term rental housing units moved to the residential housing market, the statewide median home price would drop by just 0.4%, the report concluded. That would equate to about $2,000 off a $500,000 home’s sale price. And still, less than 1,000 short-term rentals would be affordable for families earning their area’s average income. 
In areas where short-term rentals are highest — such as Summit, Grand and Kane Counties — converting them would “dramatically increase inventory; yet these markets often have limited year-round housing demand and unique economic drivers,” the report said.

Hesterman said those areas, while they have housing challenges, also “benefit greatly” from their short-term rental availability and the tourism dollars they bring. He said any changes like increased regulations or higher taxes on short-term rentals would likely not “have the impact people hope” while the “status quo is producing really good results for those areas.”
As for Utah’s largest and fastest-growing urban counties, the report said short-term rentals “represent a negligible share of housing stock, and their potential conversion to owner-occupied or rental housing would provide only marginal and temporary impacts on housing supply.” 
At the same time, the report found that short-term renters generate a significant amount of tourism dollars, totaling $1.19 billion in direct visitor spending in 2023. Additionally, the report found they’ve led to an estimated 10,200 jobs across the state. 
Tax wise, short-term rentals have generated an estimated $35.8 million in usage taxes, which the report said accounts for more than a third of statewide collections for hotel and other temporary room rentals. Plus, short-term rentals generated about $181 million in property tax revenue last year. 
“This research makes it clear,” Hesterman said. “Eliminating short-term rentals would do almost nothing to solve Utah’s housing challenges, but eliminating their significant benefits to tourism and small business-based economies would create revenue shortfalls and other problems for communities across the state.”
Hesterman said he thinks lawmakers should continue focusing on incentivizing more affordable housing types rather than “punishing or regulating” the short-term rental market. 
“Let’s look at other options. How do we increase the supply? How do we look at making construction more affordable in the state and making sure our future families do have somewhere to live at an affordable cost?” Hesterman said. “There are a lot of options to consider.”

The Trump Administration pulled $1.2 billion from California’s hydrogen hub. Even without federal funding, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is pressing ahead with clean energy retrofits.


The Scattergood Generating Station in Los Angeles is an oceanfront natural-gas-burning relic that sits on the uncertain brink of a clean-energy showdown.
On Tuesday, the Los Angeles Board of Water and Power Commissioners will decide whether to advance a plan to shift the plant to futuristic hydrogen-ready turbines. The $800-million-plus retrofit is an anchor in California’s effort to boost hydrogen, a potentially clean fuel that for now remains costly, water-intensive and rarely produced without oil and gas.
But California’s high hopes for hydrogen — and the state’s investments in it as a potential economic driver in the era of clean energy — are at a crossroads.
Earlier this month, the Trump administration canceled $1.2 billion in federal funding for California’s hydrogen hub, a public-private partnership to build a clean hydrogen economy and support projects like Scattergood. The move followed a decision earlier this summer to scale back federal tax credits nationally for hydrogen.
California says it’s pressing ahead with hydrogen projects including Scattergood, with or without federal support.
“The state remains committed to developing a renewable hydrogen ecosystem,” said Willie Rudman, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office of Business and Economic Development, or GO-Biz, which led the creation of the hydrogen partnership. Clean hydrogen, Rudman added, “holds incredible potential as California continues its transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.”
Critics say that optimism ignores real costs and trade-offs. 
A bold investment, an uncertain climate
California politicians have chased hydrogen for decades, seeking environmental and economic benefits. In 2004, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger famously rolled out a hydrogen-powered Hummer and ordered a “Hydrogen Highway” of fueling stations.
The state’s most recent bid – an ambitious hydrogen hub – has been its boldest investment yet.
In 2022, Gov. Gavin Newsom launched the Alliance for Renewable Clean Hydrogen Energy Systems, or ARCHES — a partnership led by GO-Biz, the University of California, and the State Building and Construction Trades Council. It now counts more than four hundred public- and private-sector partners, including Chevron and other energy companies.
Most hydrogen today comes from natural gas — a carbon-intensive process that undercuts its climate appeal. Over time, ARCHES hopes to help industry swap that process for “green” hydrogen made by splitting water with renewable power, an expensive and elusive process.
Newsom has embraced hydrogen as both climate and economic policy.
“Scaling this in California isn’t just about addressing the climate crisis — it’s also about creating hundreds of thousands of jobs,” Newsom wrote in August 2023. He directed his administration to develop an “all-of-government Hydrogen Market Development Strategy,” similar to what California had done for electric cars.
ARCHES won up to $1.2 billion in federal funding from the Department of Energy as part of a $12.6 billion total statewide hydrogen hub. The award positioned California at the center of the nation’s ambitions for clean hydrogen — until the Trump administration abruptly withdrew funding Oct. 1.
Newsom blasted the move as political and “common sense be damned.” While California lost its funding, several hydrogen hubs in Republican-led states kept theirs. California has appealed the decision. 
State Sen. Anna Caballero, a Democrat from Merced who authored a law speeding approval of hydrogen projects last year, said she expects talks next session on using cap-and-trade funds to keep the hydrogen hub alive. Private and international investors, she added, remain interested in California’s market.
“People in my district are asking for good jobs as we make this transition — and they’re looking for clean air — and hydrogen has the capacity to do all of the above,” Caballero said. “We have the opportunity, and I’d like to see us explore it.”
Not everyone was disappointed by the loss of the California funding. Some environmental groups, concerned about encouraging fossil fuels and the potential for explosions, welcomed the federal cancellation. Nevertheless, Los Angeles is pressing ahead with Scattergood — one of several projects that were part of the original statewide hydrogen push. 
Why LA is betting on hydrogen 
Until a few weeks ago, ARCHES, the state’s hydrogen hub, was expected to contribute at least $100 million to the Scattergood retrofit. 
“Our understanding is that the federal dollars are not coming in,” said Jason Rondou, assistant general manager of power planning and operations for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. “We don’t know yet if there will be another mechanism to make up that $100 million.”
Still, the largest municipal utility in the country is seeking approval from its board for the Scattergood conversion, calling it a step toward the city’s goal of  fossil-free power by 2035 and the state’s similar goal, with a deadline a decade later.
Utility officials say the Scattergood upgrade is necessary because its aging gas turbines are inefficient, dirty and cooled with seawater — a process now banned under state policy because of its impact on marine life. The plan is to replace the old turbines with a new combined-cycle unit designed to burn a blend of hydrogen and natural gas.
The goal is to make Scattergood more of a “peaker” plant — one that can fire up and cycle down to match demand surges, rather than running around the clock. But environmentalists are concerned about a project that runs on “green” hydrogen when it isn’t readily available at scale. The retrofit would keep the plant running on natural gas, with LADWP reserving the option to blend in as much as 30% hydrogen if the fuel becomes available and affordable.
“You’re spending a lot of money on a technology that doesn’t currently exist,” said Julia Dowell, a Long Beach-based organizer with the Sierra Club, who’s led opposition to the Scattergood plan. “We don’t really know when it will come to fruition — if at all.”
For now, this is a natural gas plant, said Dan Esposito, a hydrogen expert with the clean energy think tank Energy Innovation. “In a place with high local air pollution, in a place that has these high clean energy goals … should we be building a new gas plant if there are other clean technologies that we can invest in that we have more certainty will deliver on those clean energy targets? It’s a very tough question.”
In a recent analysis, the city’s ratepayer advocate said the financial setback “doesn’t close the door on clean hydrogen” but nevertheless raises questions about who ultimately pays for the project — and how the utility will balance its clean-energy goals with affordability.
The risks ahead 
LA’s water and power commissioners are likely to approve Scattergood’s modernization on Tuesday. The vote won’t start construction, but it will clear the way for the city’s department of water and power to seek builders and finalize designs. 
The decision also points up a tough question for California’s hydrogen strategy: without federal support, are public agencies investing scarce climate dollars in the right places?
Scattergood’s environmental review drew nearly 100 comments from residents, neighboring cities and advocacy groups.
The city of El Segundo warned that emissions and construction traffic could spill across its borders. Business groups backed the plan as a source of jobs and grid reliability. Meanwhile environmental groups warned of harms both locally and beyond.
Building even one major hydrogen project like Scattergood means committing to an entire network of pipelines, storage and supply. 
“An investment in hydrogen comes with an opportunity cost,” said Alex Jasset, director of energy justice at Physicians for Social Responsibility Los Angeles, who opposes the project. “We’re dumping a lot of our very limited resources for addressing the climate crisis into an inefficient, expensive option when we could be instead investing in cheaper, more scalable, more immediate benefits.”
Jasset said that the infrastructure for hydrogen projects will mostly be paid for by Californians – through taxes, utility bills, or state business fees. And if those projects fall short, they risk prolonging fossil-fuel infrastructure in neighborhoods already burdened by pollution.
Esposito, the analyst at Energy Innovation, says the Trump Administration’s cancellation of the hydrogen hub award, and the loss of federal credits, might offer a silver lining. 
“There was so much money for hydrogen, and so much excitement, that we were frankly at risk of making a lot of bad decisions,” Esposito said.  “There were all these proposals that were coming out that were not on solid financial ground — and needed these big subsidies — and then a lot of this money dried up overnight.”
As Los Angeles considers its major project, Esposito added, the state’s hydrogen boosters are getting something essential: a reality check. The challenge now is whether that clarity can guide smarter investments — and a more sustainable path forward.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/031722-Scattergood-Power-Plant-GETTY-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-28 08:16:31.954488

Forty people have been executed in the United States in this year, the most since 2013.  (File)Alabama’s execution of Anthony Boyd on Thursday added to the growing number of executions for the year.
Boyd was the 40th person executed in 2025 with another two months left in the year, according to figures obtained from the Death Penalty Information Center website. It is the largest number of executions in the nation since 2013.
The executions are also heavily concentrated geographically, with nearly all originating from southern, Republican-leaning states. This is especially true for Florida and its geographic neighbors.

“Florida, though, has carried out 14 executions so far, so it is leading the country in the number of executions,” Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said in an interview prior to Boyd’s execution. “The state has three more executions scheduled for this year. If you took Florida out of the equation, we would have a very different year.”
The increasing frequency builds on a trend that has been happening for the past several years since the most recent trough during the coronavirus pandemic. In 2021 when states throughout the country put 11 people to death. Since then, the figure has been increasing, going to 18 in 2022; 24 in 2023 and 25 in 2024.
After Florida, Alabama and Texas have had the second-highest number of executions this year, with five each. South Carolina has put four people to death in 20254.
Only four of the 40 people were executed in states outside the South. There were two in Arizona and another two in Indiana.
Executions usually occur decades after the original sentence. A person on death row can take 25 to 30 years to exhaust their appeals.
“In criminal justice, the climate of the 1990s, we are talking tough-on-crime,” said Kenya Brumfield-Young, an associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at Saint Louis University. “We were in the middle of the crack era. We are seeing extremely violent and heinous crimes. We have got extreme violence through bicoastal gang warfare, Bloods, Crips and everybody in the middle. And that was also the peak of the War on Drugs. We were very heavy handed relative to crime control in the late 1980s and early 1990s.”
Four of Alabama’s five executions this year involved crimes committed more than 25 years ago. Boyd was sentenced to death for the 1993 murder of Gregory Huguley; Boyd maintained his innocence through Thursday’s execution. Alabama put Demetrius Terrence Frazier to death in February after he was convicted and sentenced to death for his role in a murder that happened in 1991. Gregory Hunt was executed in February for the murder of Karen Lane in 1988, the same year that more than 300 other people were sentenced to death. Geoffrey Todd West was executed in June for the murder of Margaret Parish Berry in 1997.
The only exception was James Osgood who was executed in April for the murder of Tracy Brown in 2010.
The sentences were imposed at a time when support for the death penalty reached 80%, according to Maher.
“There were 316 new death sentences imposed in the United States in 1996,” Maher said. “And in 1996, there were 45 executions. The real high was in 1999 when there were 98 executions. So, in the late 1990s there were many more new death sentences and many more executions.”
The political environment also plays a role for deciding whether to authorize an execution.
“The Trump-affiliated governors are simply competing for who can issue more death warrants,” said Frank Baumgartner, who researches capital punishment, a professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “It didn’t used to be that way. It was always a southern phenomenon, but it wasn’t a particular ideology.”
President Donald Trump authorized the execution of 13 people incarcerated in federal prison, six of whom were put to death after the November 2020 election, which he lost to Joe Biden.
Trump issued an executive order in January encouraging offices of attorneys general around the nation  to bring capital charges for all capital crimes, especially for those who kill law enforcement or for people without the necessary paperwork to reside in the country.
“The (U.S.) Attorney General shall take all appropriate action to seek the overruling of Supreme Court precedents that limit the authority of state and federal governments to impose capital punishment,” the executive order states.
Just about all the states who have executed people in the past year have supported Trump. Oklahoma and Texas are states that have been traditionally active in its use of capital punishment, but now others, including Alabama, have become more aggressive.
The 11 people that Alabama has executed combined for this year and 2024 equal that of the prior six years, from 2018-2023.
Criminal justice experts have a mixed view whether the trend will continue.
“We are going back to this tough-on-crime ideology, and the emphasis on finality, that is going to be a major driver in, not necessarily what is considered to be an uptick, but it is going to be the carrying out of sentences,” Brumfield-Young said. When we speak of uptick, I think we are actually speaking to the number of executions that are carried out. We have to keep in mind that the court had already issued the death penalty order.”
Maher said that the recent increases in the number of executions is not indicative of a longer-term trend. The number of new death sentences issued in 2024 was 26, a fraction of the more than 300 that were issued in courts during the peak in the 1990s.
“This is a year, this is a data point among many,” she said. “The long term trend, which is very important to pay attention to, has been that we have been moving away from the use of the death penalty in the past 25 years.”
She added that, “I think public officials, if they are paying attention to what their constituents want, probably don’t realize they are very much out of step with what their constituents want to see with the use of the death penalty.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Prison-Dorm-and-guard-tower-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 08:16:31.954488

Newsom and Harris could face off for president in 2028,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/10/newsom-and-harris-president-2028/,"Both Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris dropped hints about running for president, revealing complications in their relationship.","Well, sports fans, how about this scenario — long-time frenemies Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris facing off for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination three years hence?
The two Californians’ parallel careers launched in San Francisco nearly three decades ago with the city’s storied political kingpin, Willie Brown, mentoring both.  Since then, they have carefully avoided direct conflicts while maintaining at least a veneer of mutual support.
However, on Sunday both strongly hinted at presidential campaigns in 2028 — Harris for the third time after falling short in 2020 and losing to Donald Trump in 2024, and Newsom for the first time after repeatedly disavowing interest in the White House during seven years as governor.
Newsom escalated his status as a potential candidate in a pre-recorded interview with CBS News that aired Sunday, while Harris dropped her hint in a pre-recorded interview with BBC in London, which also broadcast Sunday.
Asked whether he would give “serious thought” to running for president after next year’s midterm elections, Newsom responded, “Yeah, I’d be lying otherwise. I’d just be lying. And I’m not … I can’t do that.”
When asked if he is moving closer to finding a reason to run he answered, “Fate will determine that.”
His coy response notwithstanding, Newsom has been developing a national image with a possible presidential run in mind, soliciting national media attention and making appearances in other states.
With Trump back in the White House, Newsom has appointed himself resistor-in-chief and has taken to mocking Trump in social media posts. Polls indicate he has gained traction as a potential candidate.

Harris, meanwhile, has been touring to tout her memoir about her brief campaign against Trump last year after Biden, who had chosen her as his vice presidential running mate in 2020, declared he would not seek re-election.
After months of uncertainty Harris announced she would not run for governor in 2026, fueling media speculation she would try for the presidency again in 2028. Her interview with the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg keeps that possibility bubbling.
“I am not done,” Harris told the interviewer. “I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it’s in my bones.”
Asked about polls indicating only lukewarm support for another White House run, Harris responded, “If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office — and I certainly wouldn’t be sitting here.”
Kuenssberg wrote that Harris has been reticent about plans to run for president, but “her candor in our conversation was more striking. She was quick, eager even, to put herself in the frame for another tilt at power. But she stopped short of making any concrete commitment.”
If Harris is “not done” with politics and the governorship is off the table, what else could be on her political horizon other than another presidential bid?
Since this about potential scenarios, how about this off-the-wall notion: U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla runs for governor next year and wins. Newsom then appoints Harris to the Senate in return for not opposing his White House campaign.
The future moves of both will hinge on the true relationship between these two ambitious politicians.
Harris’ book, “107 Days,” takes a few digs at other politicians, including Newsom. She wrote that she tried to reach Newsom after Biden’s decision to not seek re-election, but Newsom’s reply was “Hiking. Will Call Back.”
“He never did,” Harris added.
Newsom later told reporters that an unknown number popped up on his phone that day, and only later did he realize it had been Harris. “That exact same moment, was working with my team to draft a statement,” he said. “I assume that’s in the book as well.”
Harris’ book did not mention Newsom’s endorsement.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/082224-Kamala-Wisconsin-MB-REUTERS-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-28 08:16:31.954488

Residents of the Louisiana and Texas Gulf Coast are bracing for their latest environmental setback: A two-year exemption loosening emissions standards at some petrochemical plants — a move that could pump nearly 5.3 million additional tons of air pollution each year into their neighborhoods.
According to an analysis by the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), five petrochemical facilities planning expansions along the coast would be exempt from rules limiting emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gasses and other hazardous emissions. The facilities include two in Texas and three in Louisiana that make products ranging from pesticides to plastic resins.
Advocates say the exemption deals yet another blow from President Donald Trump to the predominantly Black and brown communities located near these facilities, which are already overburdened by pollution. 
“Our lives don’t matter,” says Tish Taylor, a community activist and lifelong resident of the corridor in southeast Louisiana known as “Cancer Alley,” where she says residents are routinely subjected to chemical smells and “fog” from the high concentration of polluting facilities. “Nothing that Trump does says that he cares about people. Everything about his actions shows his disdain for poor and Black people specifically, but poor in general.”
Since taking office this year, Trump has made it his mission to dismantle the previous administration’s moves to improve environmental justice and lower greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change. 
Among them was the gutting of provisions that allowed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to take action against emissions from tailpipes, smokestacks and the oil and gas industry. The agency also has seen massive layoffs and a rescission of  then-President Joe Biden’s multibillion-dollar push for more renewable energy. 
Under this latest move, 52 chemical facilities owned by 25 different companies are now exempt from adhering to key air emissions standards outlined in the so-called HON Rule finalized last year under Biden. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
CIEL’s analysis includes emissions estimates culled by the Environmental Integrity Project’s Oil and Gas Watch — a database tracking the expansions of fossil fuel and petrochemical industries. Floodlight used those estimates to calculate the overall emissions impact of the two-year regulatory pause on the five communities in Texas and Louisiana with planned expansions.
Expanding Gulf plants get compliance delay
The rule is scheduled to take effect in July 2026, requiring additional pollution control equipment and, in some cases, fenceline monitoring. For the exempted facilities, the rule now takes effect in 2028 — and Trump could push it back another two years beyond that, says Steven Feit, a senior attorney and legal and research manager with CIEL. 
Five of the companies are planning expansions that would be exempt from the HON Rule for at least two years. They are BASF’s Geismar plant, which makes various chemicals and petrochemicals; Shell’s chemical plant, also in Geismar; Chevron Phillips’ refinery in Sweeny, Texas; Formosa Plastics’ plant in Point Comfort, Texas; and Westlake Chemical Corp., in Westlake, which produces vinyl chloride and other chemicals. 
“These rollbacks are essentially saying we’re going to keep the status quo, the existing environmental injustice, the existing disproportionate impact — that is going to continue,” Feit says. “And that, as we point out, is going to worsen, because these facilities are growing, expanding, in addition to all the new ones planned.” 
The American Chemistry Council, an advocacy group for more than 190 chemical companies, applauded Trump’s action, saying it will play a “critical role” in maintaining and strengthening the country’s chemical manufacturing sector. 
”Without relief from these unworkable timelines, the HON rule jeopardizes the production of essential chemistries that are crucial for our national security interests, including public health and economic security, as they are used for countless everyday products and critical industries such as agriculture, healthcare, semiconductor manufacturing, and more,” the council said in a prepared statement. 
In its analysis, CIEL noted that the American Chemistry Council spent nearly $31 million in 2024 and 2025 on lobbying. Ten of the companies granted exemptions spent a similar amount in those two years, CIEL found, while their employees donated $3.6 million to various campaigns during the 2024 election cycle. 
The HON Rule is expected to cost the industry more than $190 million a year to meet the new requirements.

Trump: Chemical industry is ‘critical infrastructure’
The HON Rule requires more than 200 facilities across the country to monitor their emissions for certain high-risk emissions including ethylene oxide, chloropene, benzene and vinyl chloride —  which have been linked to cancer and other health-related problems. The rule also ends loopholes that exempted facilities from the Clean Air Act during startups, shutdowns and plant malfunctions. 
When the rule was finalized in 2024, the Biden administration said it would reduce elevated cancer risk by 96% in fenceline communities. Taylor’s father, Robert, was one of the environmental advocates from Louisiana present when the HON Rule was signed by then-EPA Administrator Michael Regan.
“We always want any petrochemical industry to be regulated,” Tish Taylor says. “That’s all we ask: That they be good neighbors, that they not kill us in the process of making billions of dollars and maybe pay some taxes to help us have economic development.” 
CIEL argues the Trump administration cited a never-before-used provision of the law to grant the exemptions, allowing the president to suspend hazardous air pollutant regulations if he “determines that the technology to implement such standard is not available and that it is in the national security interests of the United States to do so.”
In his July proclamation granting the two-year exemptions, Trump characterized petrochemical facilities as “critical infrastructure” vital to safeguarding the country’s supply chains and reducing its dependence on foreign minerals crucial to the nation. 
Trump also wrote that the HON Rule “imposes substantial burdens on chemical manufacturers already operating under stringent regulations” and that the monitoring and air quality testing being mandated were not “practically available” and could not be implemented “safely or consistently under real-world conditions.”
CIEL expects the exemptions to be legally challenged as were the ones Trump issued a month prior for the coal industry. The coal exemptions are the subject of a lawsuit filed in June by a coalition of environmental groups.   
“Justice delayed is justice denied,” Feit says. “At some point, the short term becomes the long term.”
Fear, confusion grip communities
Jane Patton, the Fossil Economy Campaign manager with CIEL, says environmental advocates were stunned by how quickly the Trump administration handed out the exemptions — with no community notice. She also notes that the list of exempted facilities released by the Trump administration in some cases did not match the names of existing facilities, leading to confusion. 
She says CIEL’s initial calls with environmental leaders in fenceline communities were riddled with questions: How do the exemptions affect the lives of people living in fenceline communities? Which facilities are affected?
“How are families supposed to keep their children safe if they don’t know what’s in the air?” Patton says. “Folks are trying to come to us for answers, and we don’t have answers. Like, it’s not even just that we don’t have answers because we haven’t investigated. It’s that there may not be answers to be had right now, and that is very scary and confusing for communities.”
In 2019, Diane Wilson reached a $50 million settlement against Formosa Plastics, one of the exempted companies, in what was called the largest payout in U.S. history for a citizen environmental suit. The petrochemical giant was found liable for illegally dumping toxic waste — including plastic beads and powder — in waterways along Texas’ Gulf Coast. The settlement funds are being used to remediate affected land and water, boost environmental education and research and revitalize the local fishing industry. 
As part of that settlement, the company also agreed to eliminate all plastic waste at its Point Comfort plant in Calhoun County, Texas, and pay penalties until discharges from the facility stopped. But since June 2021, Wilson says her organization has documented 859 violations and $34.1 million in fines, which the company is required to pay under a consent decree.
The company plans to expand its Point Comfort plant, which is projected to raise greenhouse gas emissions the most of any of the expansions — equivalent to about 670,000 gas-powered vehicles.. 
“It’s really outrageous that they can get permits when you have a serial polluter and it’s documented,” says Wilson, leader of the San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper. “I have a real problem about them getting all of those exemptions — like they need it easier.”

Dina Titus at the No Kings rally in downtown Las Vegas Oct. 18. (Photo: Hugh Jackson/Nevada CurrentDemocratic U.S. Rep. Dina Titus called Republicans’ false claims that the government shutdown was part of Democratic push to extend benefits to undocumented immigrants an “outright lie” as she warned of the damage of ending health care subsidies.  
Titus, accompanied by panelists from Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence, the Nevada Campaign for Reproductive Freedom for All and MomsRising, hosted a town hall last week to talk about health care, reproductive rights, and economic issues affecting women.
While speaking about the importance of extending health subsidies, speakers also decried the actions of President Donald Trump, including cuts to access to health care to downplay the severity of domestic violence, as being harmful to women. 
The town hall comes nearly four weeks into the federal government shutdown.
The Senate failed to pass a continuing resolution Oct. 1 to keep funding the government until Nov. 21. A resolution passed the Republican-controlled House but has not been able to secure enough votes in the Republican-controlled Senate. 
Democrats are calling for any resolution to fund the government to also reverse cuts to Medicaid and restore subsidies to the Affordable Care Act health insurance premiums — actions Republicans took while passing Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill Act.
“I think that the Republicans will not agree to open up the government until Trump says to do it,” Titus said. “ They just do what he says. Until he makes that determination, I don’t see anything happening.”
Nevadans who get insurance through Nevada Health Link are facing a projected average 26% premium rate hike, though the increases could be far greater for many Nevadans. 
Trump and congressional Republicans have falsely claimed the shutdown was due to Democrats pushing a “far-left wish list” that included extending Medicaid and ACA health insurance premium subsidies to undocumented immigrants. 
Undocumented people in the U.S. are not eligible for either program.
“It’s an absolute, outright lie,” Titus said, adding “Extending the tax credits for the ACA has nothing to do with that.”
Titus instead questioned Trump’s funding priorities, adding that “what you want to spend money on is a reflection of your values.”
“There’s a lot of money floating around out there right now,” she said, noting the demolition of the East Wing of the White House to make way for Trump’s $300 million ballroom funded largely by corporate donors, and the administration’s $20 billion bailout of Argentina.
“When you lose the ACA, you lose that health insurance, you lose the coverage of preventive care,” Titus said. “We know if you can prevent something, that’s a lot better than trying to cure something.”
Trump’s policies mean people “will be forced off Medicaid,” said Denise Lopez, director of the Nevada Campaign for Reproductive Freedom for All, adding that women would bear the brunt of those cuts.
“This is going to impact postpartum care,” Lopez said, noting data showing 42% of births in Nevada are to women enrolled in Medicaid. “And this is going to impact women’s health overall. This is a dire, critical situation that we’re in.”
Women will also be locked out of access to other services including mammograms, said Annette Magnus, an organizer with MomsRising. 
“For a lot of younger women who are just starting their journey of doing their breast health checks, of getting those mammograms, they are not going to have access to those services anymore,” Magnus said “These cuts are going to be devastating for those women.” 
The administration has also made cuts and changes to domestic violence funding and programs, said Elizabeth Abdur-Raheem with the Nevada Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence.
When speaking about crime rates in the District of Columbia, the president dismissed domestic violence, saying “If a man has a little fight with the wife, they say this was a crime scene.”
The speech received criticism from national domestic violence groups. 
“This is gaslighting to the highest degree,” Abdur-Raheem said.. “We know that people who cause harm will be not only emboldened, but they won’t think they’re causing harm. They were told by the president that this isn’t a big deal.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3461-1-scaled-e1761609051185-1024x703.jpg,,,2025-10-28 08:00:32.468365

HOST: Paul Hattis & John McDonough
GUEST: Audrey Morse Gasteier, executive director of the Massachusetts Health Connector







OPEN ENROLLMENT THROUGH the state health care marketplace begins on November 1, and hundreds of thousands of people are staring down bracing changes to their health care costs. Notices are going out all across the Commonwealth warning residents about rising premiums if pandemic era tax credits are left to expire at the end of the year – the issue at the heart of the government shutdown. 
“We don’t have the luxury of planning for a hypothetical open enrollment, or the hope or the chance of open enrollment” that looks like prior years, said Audrey Morse Gasteier, executive director of the Massachusetts Health Connector, on The Codcast. “We have to deal with the reality in front of us.” 
This week, on the monthly Health or Consequences episode of The Codcast, Gasteier joined John McDonough of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and Paul Hattis of the Lown Institute to discuss the looming deadline.  
The average premium increase is expected to be $1,300 a year in the state if the tax credits are not extended, she said. 
“We know that those are going to be eye-popping notices for a lot of individuals,” she said. “We have done a lot of work to intensify and clarify those communications so people understand what’s happening, that they understand it’s a result of federal law and federal policymaking.” 
The idea of the Health Connector is that it’s a centralized marketplace where residents can access insurance coverage products that are vetted by the state. When the Biden administration passed the American Rescue Plan in 2021, it created enhanced premium tax credits to make the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) low-income subsidy for premiums more generous and removed an income cap that had created a cliff for moderate-income people who still needed help affording the care.  
This was “a game changer” that “turbocharged ACA enrollment all over the country,” Gasteier said. 
The credits were extended two years later, but have become a flashpoint this year between Democrats, who want to see them extended again, and Republicans who are still deeply critical of the ACA but without a clear alternative as frustration mounts from constituents over the credit loss. 
If these tax credits are not extended, the consequences when the calendar flips to 2026 will be immense, Gasteier said.  
Massachusetts would lose about $425 million in federal support to make insurance more affordable. About 337,000 people in the Bay State would feel the impacts of higher premiums, Gasteieir said, and 26,000 of them would no longer get any tax credit at all. “If Congress doesn’t take action to extend these, that’s several hundred millions of dollars just evaporating out of thin air for Massachusetts residents to help afford their coverage,” she said. 
Massachusetts residents have a longer open enrollment period that runs through January 23, Gasteier noted, though part of the federal government recently finalized a rule that will remove that enrollment timeline flexibility starting next cycle.  
“I wouldn’t suggest to people that they wait,” she said. “If they want to come in and start exploring their plan choices and checking provider networks and the rest, they should do that. But they don’t actually have to pick a plan and make a payment to effectuate their coverage that starts January 1st until December 23rd. So there are several more weeks where, if things do change and subsidy eligibility changes or the rest, we will be in touch with people right away so that they know that.”

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Rama Schneider: Act 73 can provide certainty on the path forward on district consolidation.","Dear Editor,


Act 73 of 2025, “An act relating to transforming Vermont’s education governance, quality, and finance systems”, is a call from Vermont’s Legislature and governor to make radical changes in how we view our children’s school districts. The requirements in this law include a large-scale reduction in the number of and corresponding increase in the size of these districts.
I have served on school boards for a local school district and a supervisory union. I chaired an Act-46-of-2015-related merger study committee that resulted in a new district made up of two communities from different SUs. I participated for a year and a half on a committee that merged two different sets of staff contracts into a single, cohesive framework.
I am under no illusion as to the difficulties that are before us when it comes to implementing the district restructuring as required in Act 73. Furthermore I come from a perspective based upon a long history of actively opposing forced school district consolidation.
However, since Act 153 of 2010 it has been the policy of Vermont’s Legislature and governors that a larger school district of the supervisory district type is the preferred model. Legislation over the last 15 years has emphasized this point as more mergers were encouraged in Act 173 of 2012 and then mandated in Act 46 of 2015. Act 73 of 2025 is simply one more logical step.
Our kids deserve better than to have their teachers, principals, superintendents and school boards dealing with constant changes in consolidation demands and expectations, and the task force can help provide a great deal of certainty by putting forth a redistricting proposal that will put the district consolidation issue to rest for 20 years or more.
There are countless details that will have to be left for future leaders and decision makers. The task force needs to focus on the big picture and creating a platform for those folks who follow to creatively and effectively work within.

Mikie Sherrill backs the state's system for creating affordable housing. Jack Ciattarelli wants development focused in urban centers.,"Republican Jack Ciattarelli and Democrat Mikie Sherrill are competing in November to succeed Gov. Phil Murphy. (Photos by Dana DiFilippo and Amanda Brown)[2025 governor's race Voter Guide: Where NJ’s governor hopefuls stand on the issues]The front-runners to become New Jersey’s next governor are sharply divided on how the Garden State should boost construction of affordable housing
Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D) supports the state’s existing system for affordable housing production but wants the state and its municipalities to move faster to stand up housing, and she has pledged to boost assistance for first-time homebuyers.
Former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli (R) wants broader changes, including a rewrite of a state constitutional doctrine that demands every municipality create realistic opportunities for the creation of affordable housing. Ciattarelli also wants to largely contain such units in New Jersey’s urban centers and developed suburbs.
This comes as the state needs more than 200,000 affordable housing units for its poorest renters, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.
“The main difference in the candidates’ housing agendas boils down to Jack Ciattarelli’s opposition to the state’s affordable housing law, while Mikie Sherrill wants to make it work,” said Micah Rasmussen, director of Rider University’s Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics. “Both candidates want to focus new housing units around mass transit, but Ciattarelli goes a step further with his goal to push affordable housing into our cities.”
New Jersey municipalities have a constitutional duty to zone in a way that creates realistic opportunities for the creation of low- and moderate-income housing. That duty stems from a series of court cases dating back a half-century that found some New Jersey municipalities had zoned to exclude housing for low-income residents.
The Mount Laurel doctrine, named after the municipality at the center of the state’s seminal exclusionary zoning case, has remained a target of some local officials and Republicans who charge successive courts have erred in their decisions and worry over the impact of mandated development in communities that do not want it, regardless of need.
Affordable housing production under the state’s previous 10-year rounds of production regularly stumbled before gaining some footing under a court-run system, and lawmakers last year codified a version of that system that sought to maintain the framework established by the courts.
Under the new law, virtually every New Jersey municipality is responsible for creating affordable housing, and the current 10-year round calls for towns and cities to create tens of thousands of new units over the next decade.
Ciattarelli and Sherrill, who are seeking on Nov. 4 to succeed term-limited Gov. Phil Murphy, differ on how and where that housing should be built.
Ciattarelli disfavors the approach under existing state law, preferring a system that limits development mandates and allows towns to pay other municipalities to take on their affordable housing duties through regional contribution agreements barred under current law. He touted his plans recently at an appearance in Cranbury, a Middlesex County town that was the center of a recently settled court fight over where to place affordable housing.
“Everyone should have a skin in the game for making housing affordable, but that doesn’t mean we should be putting it in communities such as this,” Ciattarelli said.
Towns that trade away their affordable housing obligations could still contribute to housing production by paying into the state’s affordable housing trust fund, he said.
The Republican argued affordable housing development should be concentrated in urban centers and developed suburbs that can bear the strain new residents impose on sewer systems and roadways, and that have economies strong enough to support them or need residents to support their economies.
“100 years ago, the population of Atlantic City was 55,000. Today it’s 35,000,” he said. “What would 20,000 more people mean for the local economy, the mom-and-pop shops?”
Sherrill’s proposals would keep the state’s existing affordable housing framework intact. Her campaign said she would seek to speed state permitting for housing projects and extend additional state support to reduce permitting delays at the local level.
She has pledged to bolster New Jersey’s aid programs for first-time and first-generation homebuyers. Down payment assistance programs combined with awards for first-generation homebuyers can provide residents with between $22,000 and $17,000.
“Mikie is committed to cutting through red tape and business-as-usual policies to reduce housing costs for families while protecting New Jersey’s open spaces,” said Sherrill campaign spokeswoman Sam Chan.
The Democrat has pledged to end diversions from the state’s affordable housing trust fund, which was drained to near empty this year after the state budget allocated more than $130 million in trust fund dollars to programs not directly related to affordable housing production. The Department of Community Affairs later moved to restore some trust fund dollars.
Stricter enforcement against collusion among landlords would also be a priority of Sherrill’s administration if she’s elected. The state in April sued 10 of New Jersey’s largest landlords and the property management software company RealPage, alleging they used RealPage’s pricing algorithm to inflate and align rents to skirt market competition.
Sherrill has also called for financing to help municipalities turn commercial buildings increasingly disused following rises in remote work following the pandemic into housing.

Voters will choose between Republican nominee Cindy Myrex, a realtor, and Democratic nominee Matt Glover, a parts manager at a poultry plant. Myrex is a first-time candidate and Glover served on the Good Hope City Council from 2012 to 2016 before he moved to Valley Grove. 
The district covers parts of Cullman County.
When do polls open?
Polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Tuesday. 
Where do I find my polling place?
The Alabama Secretary of State’s website allows you to check voter registration and the location of your polling place. You can find it here.
What do I need to vote?
Voters must present a valid photo ID before voting. Valid forms of ID include: 

Alabama driver’s license (not expired or expired less than 60 days)
Alabama Law Enforcement Agency digital driver’s license
Alabama Non-Driver ID (not expired or expired less than 60 days)
Alabama Photo Voter ID card

Where is the district located?

The district covers part of Cullman, including Good Hope, Garden City, Colony and Smith Lake. 
How did the seat become vacant?
The seat became vacant after former Rep. Corey Harbison, R-Cullman, resigned in April. Harbison was absent for much of the 2025 legislative session.
Does the seat have a partisan lean?
The district is solidly Republican. Harbison took over 85% of the vote in his re-election campaign in 2022. 
What issues dominate the race?
In the primary, both Myrex and Glover opposed a law passed in this spring that would allow the city of Cullman to annex a resort in Cullman County, a dry county, in order for the resort to serve alcohol. 
The law drew criticism from Democratic and Republican candidates in this election and the House District 11 election. Cullman County did not have representation in the House after Harbison resigned in April and Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview, resigned in February to work for Senate President Pro Tem Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman.
Gudger, who co-sponsored the legislation, pre-filed a bill on Aug. 1 to repeal the law, which goes into effect on Oct. 1. Myrex supports the repeal bill, which cannot become law until the Legislature returns in January. 
Myrex also campaigned on improving mental health care in public schools and economic growth.
Glover has campaigned on eliminating state sales tax on groceries, a lottery to fund public education and expanding Medicaid. The Legislature this spring approved a cut in the state grocery tax from 3% to 2%. 
Campaign fundraising
According to campaign finance records, Myrex raised over $157,000 and spent almost $158,000. Since Myrex was selected as the GOP nominee in August, she’s raised over $62,000. About two-thirds of those funds have come from political action committees (PACs). During the primary, most of Myrex’s funds came from businesses and individuals.
According to campaign finance records, Glover has raised about $4,000 and spent about $3,500. Glover has gotten 180 donations, most of which are less than $20, from across the country.

What happens after today?

The candidate with the most votes will represent the district in the Alabama House of Representatives. The seat will be up for election in the 2026 midterms.
Will the results alter control of the Legislature?
No. Republicans currently hold 72 of the 105 seats in the Alabama House, after three resignations after the end of the 2025 session in May, including Wood. Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, was appointed president of the Public Service Commission in June. Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, was elected to the State Senate on June 24.

In July 2024, Joseph Leitz walked into a red brick sheriff’s office building in the small Western Washington city of Shelton and turned in two handguns.
A court commissioner had ordered Leitz to do so after his then wife, Lauryn Berg, secured a domestic violence protection order, alleging he had beaten and raped her, threatened to take their kids, and held an unloaded gun to his head, pulling the trigger three times. Leitz denies the allegations.
The commissioner later determined that Leitz no longer possessed any firearms, based on Leitz’s word and documentation from the Mason County Sheriff’s Office. But Berg believed her ex-husband still had nearly a dozen other firearms, including an AR-style semi-automatic shotgun that he stored in a safe during their 12-year relationship.
“I’ve seen them. I’ve shot them. I have videos of my friend shooting them,” said Berg, referred to here by her maiden name. “When they said ‘handguns,’ I was like, ‘Are you kidding me?’”
Washington, with some of the nation’s strongest civil protections for domestic violence survivors, is one of 22 states that require certain alleged abusers to turn in their guns while under a restraining order. But researchers say even with these laws in place, most states lack mechanisms to actually ensure accused abusers are disarmed, which has been shown to lower rates of intimate partner homicides. 
Despite Washington’s pioneering policies, Berg’s fears that her ex could still have access to firearms show the holes in the state’s system for enforcing surrender orders. While some communities, like King County, have invested substantial resources into the problem and are touted by gun violence prevention advocates as a model, many jurisdictions still rely primarily on the honor system to ensure guns are turned in. Judicial officers waive or give cursory attention to hearings that would give survivors an opportunity to present evidence of missing guns, according to firearm enforcement advocates and attorneys. And even when there are indications that a person is violating a surrender order, some police and prosecutors are hesitant to investigate over concerns of infringing on an alleged abuser’s constitutional rights. 
As a result, whether a survivor will actually see their abuser’s firearms confiscated in Washington depends heavily on where they live — and what their local courts, police or prosecutors think of the law.
“We’re going basically on the stance that they’re providing true and actual factual information to us,” said Stephen Rowe, a sergeant at the Mason County Sheriff’s Office, where Leitz was ordered to surrender his guns. “Whenever you have a case that challenges the Constitution, they’re difficult to enforce.”
Washington state Rep. Lauren Davis, who has sponsored several bills to protect domestic violence survivors, said that although other states might look to Washington as an example, she “wouldn’t give us any gold stars.” 
“It says all of these things on paper, but it’s not actually happening,” Davis said. “Not every judge is going to take a victim’s word seriously. Not every prosecutor is going to bother litigating that with the court, even upon the victim’s word. And not every court even has a compliance hearing in the first place.”
This patchwork enforcement leaves survivors like Berg with a very real fear that their alleged abusers could act on threats of gun violence. More than 70 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month on average in the U.S., according to the national gun violence prevention organization Everytown for Gun Safety. In Washington, two-thirds of the state’s 43 domestic violence-related homicides reported in 2022 were by firearm, research shows.
Many accused abusers tell police and courts that they don’t have any guns, even when that’s not the case, firearm-surrender enforcement experts say. In Kitsap County, where Berg’s case is, the Superior Court issued orders to surrender weapons in 1,961 civil protection order cases from 2022 to mid-August 2025, according to data provided by the county clerk’s office. Only 12% of those individuals turned over their weapons and submitted the required receipt from law enforcement to the court, according to a data analysis by the Gun Violence Data Hub, a data initiative by The Trace, a nonprofit newsroom covering gun violence in the United States. The majority — 56% or 1,094 people — simply claimed that they didn’t have any guns to surrender, although at least 12 of those people refused to sign a court declaration swearing to that.
Leitz, a 34-year-old truck driver, told InvestigateWest that he did have an AR-style shotgun and other guns during his marriage, but gave them to his dad and cousins before being hit with the surrender order. While that’s allowable under state law, the sheriff’s office and court never attempted to verify his claim, according to court and police records.
Although Leitz says he can’t access the guns, Berg doesn’t feel safe knowing that his family members have them. 
“He could go get them at any time,” she said.
Government funding is making a difference in some communities, showing what can be done when counties have dedicated money and a commitment to enforcing the orders. King County’s domestic violence firearms enforcement unit, made up of police, prosecutors, advocates and enforcement experts, tracks down evidence of missing firearms and encourages alleged abusers to turn them in — sometimes leading courts to resort to jail time and fines for those who still don’t comply. 
Spokane, in eastern Washington, has also sharply increased its collection by thousands of guns since 2019, when it began receiving federal dollars to prioritize the issue, according to data provided by Spokane’s YWCA, which is working with local police to address the issue. But amid the Trump administration’s threats to shrink the U.S. Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women and slash funding for domestic violence services, it’s not clear if the federal funding will be available in the future.
Increased funding, however, is only one piece of the puzzle, according to researchers and victim advocates. It also takes a coordinated effort by police, prosecutors and courts to prioritize the issue. 
“Resources are always brought up as a challenge, and I totally understand that,” said Renée Hopkins, CEO of the Alliance for Gun Responsibility, a Washington nonprofit that recently launched an online portal to help survivors navigate the state’s civil protection order system. “My response to that is, we’re talking about some of the highest risk situations. Some of it has to come down to priority.”
 Challenges to enforcement 

When an alleged domestic abuser is ordered to surrender guns in Washington, state law lays out specific steps to ensure that all firearms are accounted for. Police serving the order must tell them to immediately turn in their guns and seize any firearms “in plain sight” or discovered through a lawful search. The alleged abuser must sign a declaration that they have no guns, or provide evidence, like a receipt from police, that the weapons are no longer in their possession. The court then reviews this evidence in a hearing to determine whether all guns have been surrendered. 
The process is straightforward in theory. But people lie.
“The declaration of nonsurrender that’s signed in court, almost always they’re not accurate. They’re not being honest,” said Amie Simeral, a domestic violence firearms analyst at the Spokane YWCA, which provides resources for survivors.
Yet many Washington communities still rely largely on the accused abuser’s word. In Yakima, a city in rural central Washington with high rates of gun ownership and domestic violence, there’s “not a whole lot” that police can do to ensure people are telling the truth, said Yakima Police Department Capt. Chad Janis. 
Yakima is one of 12 pilot sites nationwide that receives federal funding from the Office on Violence Against Women to protect survivors from gun violence. Yakima’s $500,000 grant goes toward costs like data collection, equipment for police to send protection orders electronically, and a coordinator to help monitor and encourage firearm surrenders. 
But even with this increased support, tracking guns remains overwhelming. Like Berg’s ex-husband, many accused abusers give their guns to relatives or friends just before an order is served, said Janis and Mason County Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Rowe. 
“The law allows that. And there’s really no verification process,” Janis said.
Following up with family members takes a lot of manpower, Rowe said. “And I will tell you, most agencies are short-manned.” 
Still, there are steps that police and courts should take, according to enforcement experts and attorneys. In King County, judges ask family members and friends for a sworn statement confirming they were given guns.
“But after that, I don’t know if there’s much more that can be done,” said Karla Carlisle, a managing attorney with the Northwest Justice Project, a nonprofit legal aid program in Washington. “Obviously, the big elephant in the room is, what’s stopping the family member from just handing over the guns?”
Constitutional challenges have also hampered the implementation of Washington’s firearm surrender law ever since its passage in 2014, though recent court rulings have affirmed its constitutionality. 
Some judicial officers who stopped issuing surrender orders in 2023 over concerns that they infringe on accused abusers’ protections against self-incrimination and unreasonable search and seizure have once again started ordering them, following a state Court of Appeals ruling in June.
In 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court also put an end to Second Amendment concerns when it affirmed the constitutionality of a federal law prohibiting people subject to domestic violence restraining orders from possessing firearms. 
Yet when it comes to actually removing these guns, some police officers remain wary.
In 2019, for example, a new state law requiring police to seize firearms at the scene of domestic violence incidents met with “enormous resistance” in law enforcement, said Spokane Police Department Sgt. Dave Adams, who trained fellow officers on this law.
“I had people who were command level yelling at me in training,” Adams said. “Just generally speaking, most of my co-workers are people who are, ‘I’ve got my Second Amendment right. You’re not going to take my guns away. I don’t care what a local court says, the U.S. Constitution overrides.’”
It took until this past year for many agencies like Spokane to start implementing it more proactively, he added.
“These are state mandates,” Adams said. “If you’re in law enforcement and you’re not OK enforcing the laws as written, you have to really reconsider whether or not this is going to be the career for you.”
 ‘Yes, he can lie to us’ 

In August 2024, four weeks after the Kitsap County court found that Leitz had surrendered all of his guns, Berg met with a Mason County detective about her reported sexual assault. Berg told the detective that she feared Leitz still had firearms, according to the sheriff’s office report. She explained how Leitz had shot and killed their family’s two dogs earlier that year, before the protection order was put in place, which Leitz admitted to in a court hearing.
The detective said she would look into it, and later emailed Berg that Leitz had surrendered two guns. 
That’s “definitely not all of what he has,” Berg replied.
Two weeks later, after receiving no response, Berg followed up again. “I’m very concerned he may go off the deep end,” Berg wrote. “I know for a fact he didn’t give up all his guns.”
The detective reached out to Leitz and his lawyer, but they didn’t cooperate with her investigation and Leitz was never interviewed, according to the sheriff’s office reports. There’s no indication that the sheriff’s office tried to verify where those other guns were.
Another four months went by. Finally, Berg’s mom, Kelly Walker, submitted a complaint against the sheriff’s office in December, accusing them of mishandling the surrender order. Her complaint fell to the responsibility of Jason Dracobly, then the department’s chief criminal deputy.

Dracobly himself had been ordered to surrender guns to the Mason County Sheriff’s Office back in 2013, when he was a sergeant at the agency. His ex-wife had accused him of domestic violence and anger issues, including threatening to shoot a man she was texting with. The court granted her a restraining order and found that “irreparable injury could result” if Dracobly wasn’t ordered to give up his firearms. He surrendered various hunting rifles and handguns to his co-workers, court records show, but his ex-wife raised concerns that he had not given up three of his guns, including an AR-15. Dracobly, who denied the domestic violence accusations or that he violated the surrender order, eventually got his guns back and continued climbing the ranks in the department. 
Dracobly’s internal investigation into Walker’s complaint concluded that her accusations were unfounded. His own divorce had no impact on his review of Walker’s concerns, which, he told InvestigateWest, was “handled objectively and based solely on the facts and information” available to him at the time.
“We do not know what other firearms he may or may not have,” Dracobly’s report said about Leitz. “Yes, he can lie to us. We have no evidence or proof currently that he has physical control of any more firearms.”
Berg says she has shipping information for the AR-style shotgun and a December 2023 video taken by Leitz of herself shooting it, but the Mason County Sheriff’s Office never asked her for proof. According to Sgt. Rowe, that wouldn’t give them enough evidence to search Leitz’s home for prohibited guns anyway. To obtain a search warrant, the Fourth Amendment generally requires that law enforcement have a factually grounded belief that evidence of a crime will be found in that location. 
“From my understanding, there is absolutely next to nothing that would give us probable cause to violate somebody’s rights and go into their home and their free space,” Rowe said. A time-stamped photo of a person holding a gun after being subject to a surrender order might give police more tread, he added. “But it’s difficult.”
Dracobly, now the undersheriff, told InvestigateWest that neither Walker nor Berg provided information about specific firearms or their current location, and a general claim that someone “has many guns” isn’t enough to justify a search warrant. It’s critical to have recent information, as opposed to older statements that have lost evidentiary value, he noted. He also emphasized that under state law, it’s up to the courts — not law enforcement — to verify whether people are telling the truth.
It’s not uncommon that survivors know about a partner’s guns but don’t have recent evidence, according to Sandra Shanahan, program manager of King County’s enforcement unit. “Those things are not great fact patterns, necessarily, to get a police officer out there on a warrant,” she said. 
But Shanahan and other experts say there are many other actions that police and courts can take. They can look for evidence of previous gun purchases, recent gun ownership or social media posts displaying guns, for example, which could be enough for a judge to determine that a person is not in compliance and ask for further proof. 
It’s a lack of communication between police, prosecutors and courts that’s the problem, said Natalie Nanasi, a Southern Methodist University law professor whose research focuses on effective firearm surrender strategies. The solution, Nanasi said, “really can be something as simple as one or two people who are within a county’s court system who are flagging these cases, who are following up on them, who are making sure that everybody who needs the information has the information.”
 ‘We’re way, way beyond that’

At the Spokane Police Department, Sgt. Adams reads each domestic violence report that comes across his desk, he said. The volume is daunting. Spokane County has one of the highest reported rates of domestic violence in Washington, with 6,998 offenses in 2024 — making up 11% of the state’s total, according to the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs’ annual crime report. More than half of those offenses were handled by the Spokane Police Department.
When Adams reads a report that has even “the whiff of a mention of a firearm,” he routes it to Simeral, the YWCA’s domestic violence firearms analyst. Simeral and Spokane police officers explain to accused abusers that surrendering weapons doesn’t mean their guns will be destroyed or sold, but rather stored by law enforcement for safekeeping.
Many people simply state that they have no guns, which Simeral said is often not accurate. To get to the truth, she dives into their history. She checks if the person has legally purchased a gun from a licensed dealer. She works closely with local pawn shops to spot firearms that aren’t supposed to be there. She scours social media accounts for recent pictures of guns and reviews past police reports for mentions of firearms. Then she presents this information to the court.
“If we tell them that we fear that there are some firearms outstanding, and we’ve got some good, tangible evidence to prove that, the courts hold that very highly. They will not just say, ‘You’re in compliance because you say so,’” Simeral said. “We’re way, way beyond that.”
Simeral and Adams say their success comes largely from the city’s decision to invest in the problem. Spokane also has a federal grant and is spending it on costs like increased police training and overtime pay for officers to serve firearm surrender orders during off-duty hours.
In 2017, before Spokane began receiving the federal dollars, 36 firearms were collected, according to data provided by the YWCA. This is despite Spokane courts issuing 3,000 surrender orders that year, representing a 1% collection rate in a state where an estimated 42% of households own guns. 
Compliance has now surged, with 2,568 firearms collected from 2020 to 2023, according to the YWCA. That number continues to rise — over 600 guns have been removed this year alone.
Now, it’s unclear if the funding will exist past 2026. To the surprise of some victim advocates, the Office on Violence Against Women under the Trump administration did not release a notice for future grant applicants this year. The office says it plans to do so next year, with the caveat that “any planned funding is always subject to available appropriations and other factors,” it wrote in a statement to InvestigateWest. 
Spokane remains committed to prioritizing the issue even if their federal funding stops — advocates secured a grant through the state Department of Commerce to continue their work, according to Sally Winn, YWCA Spokane’s director of legal services.
King County, home to Seattle and the state’s most populated county, has found similar success. After launching its firearms enforcement unit in 2018, people subject to domestic violence protection orders became 3.3 times more likely to relinquish at least one firearm or other dangerous weapon, according to a 2023 study by University of Washington researchers. Gun violence prevention experts across the country say other states should look to the unit as a model. 
“Laws don’t implement themselves,” said Shanahan, the unit’s program manager. “Do we get every gun from every person? Absolutely not. We sure try.”
 Bearing the burden

It wasn’t until August 2025, a year after Leitz was first ordered to surrender his guns, that the Kitsap County Superior Court convened a hearing on Berg’s claims that her ex-husband had not complied. 
It was Berg’s chance to present her proof to the court. But without an attorney or enforcement experts like Simeral or Shanahan to assist her, the shipping information and video of the AR-style shotgun were never considered — she didn’t properly send those documents to the court, her emails show.
With little proof to show that Leitz had other guns, a commissioner quickly signed an order finding him in compliance, ending the hearing within minutes.
Leitz, meanwhile, said the hearing was “just another pain in the ass.” He’s frustrated by his mounting legal fees and the repeated requirements for him to prove he can’t access guns. “It’s nothing new for a nasty divorce like this,” he said.
Although state law requires courts to hold compliance hearings as soon as possible after a surrender order is served, and whenever there’s any indication that the order’s subject still has firearms, victim advocates and attorneys say they often don’t happen. In Spokane, courts frequently skipped compliance hearings until the city started focusing on the issue, Winn said.
“Now, the judges and commissioners are infinitely better about setting compliance hearings where they consider actual evidence and not just taking the abuser’s word for it,” Winn said. 
Statewide, inconsistent recordkeeping across state courts makes it nearly impossible to track whether courts are properly holding compliance hearings and confirming that all guns were turned in.
“It is actually very, very difficult — and I’m going to say infeasible — to be able to measure all of those separate parts,” said Alice Ellyson, an assistant professor at the University of Washington who researches firearm surrenders in the state.
Courts are still figuring out what penalties to impose when a person refuses to comply, Simeral said. In 2022, the Spokane County District Court found a man named Jesse Jones in contempt of court for stating that he had no firearms despite “overwhelming evidence” to the contrary — including videos of his “secret bunker” behind a hidden door that had gun ports and firearms hanging on the wall, court records show. When Jones failed to prove that he no longer had access to those weapons, a judge hit him with a $150 fine.
The case was a “really big deal” for establishing consequences for not complying with an order, according to Simeral. The goal is to avoid overly punitive measures while still encouraging compliance. 
Leitz has maintained, even after the protection order, that he never abused Berg. He also denied the sexual assault allegation that Berg reported in July 2024. (“You can’t rape the willing,” Leitz told InvestigateWest, asserting that photos of Berg’s black eye and bruised arm following the alleged assault were from Berg bumping into walls while drunk.) The Mason County prosecutor’s office said it is still reviewing the rape allegation.
Without his guns, Leitz said his farmwork is more difficult. While he used to be able to shoot cows to put them out of their misery when they injured themselves, he now has to bludgeon them to death with a hammer or wait for a butcher to come slaughter them.
“It’s a lot more gruesome,” Leitz said. But he feels like he has no alternative. “My kids mean more than the firearms do to me, and I gotta be 100% compliant for everything or else I won’t even be able to see my kids.” 
Berg still feels that she and her kids are in danger as long as his other guns remain unaccounted for, and plans to keep raising the issue in court. 
“My anxiety is off the charts. I’m scared of him,” Berg said. It’s why she got the protection order in the first place. “But of course, it’s just a piece of paper.”

Indiana has 12, monitored by the state's Department of Workforce Development. (Photo by Niki Kelly/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A system of regional workforce development boards wants to lead the way on solutions to Indiana’s “immense” labor needs — but fragmentation, funding and other challenges limit its effectiveness, the Indiana Workforce Alliance has found.
The alliance, which represents the state’s 12 workforce boards, commissioned the report from Pathemy Strategies. It was released last week.
At a time “when employers are struggling to find talent, Hoosiers need clear and faster routes to good jobs,” the 25-page report reads. “… Workforce boards offer the connective tissue linking regional economic growth strategies to the people who will power them.”
But they’re “limited by fragmentation in the talent ecosystem, funding cuts, inconsistent quality, and regulatory constructs that crowd out strategy,” it said. It also laid out a plan to help them “evolve from program administrators to strategic conveners and talent system architects.”
Workforce boards are federally authorized groups of community leaders — led by local employers — that guide how national and state workforce dollars are spent in their areas. Indiana has 12, monitored by the state’s Department of Workforce Development.
Indiana needs to retrain 82k+ workers annually to meet demand, Ivy Tech finds

They oversee about 70 WorkOne job centers, run the recently gutted Jobs for America’s Graduates program, help Hoosiers find jobs or enroll in registered apprenticeships, assist employers in recruiting workers and more.
The report lauded the boards’ “extensive” geographic reach, employer network, adaptability to economic changes and wraparound service provision — such as transportation or child care — to ease barriers to employment. It also applauded Gov. Mike Braun for his attempt to align talent and economic development strategies.
But the system has its weaknesses.
Communication between the boards, state workforce and economic development agencies, and others is often “fractured or ineffective,” according to the report.
The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration, for instance, administers an employment services program for Hoosiers on the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program.
Because workforce boards “are the primary entities charged with helping low-income Hoosiers access job training and employment, the separation of TANF job-readiness efforts creates duplication and limits integration,” the report found.
The critique also applies to the boards themselves, which maintain different databases and platforms that don’t connect to each other.
The report further chided Indiana for not applying for more waivers from federal requirements, which can ease administrative requirements and add flexibility.
But “declining and unpredictable” funding was highlighted as a “growing threat to the stability and scalability” of Indiana’s workforce system.
The federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act provides most of the Hoosier system’s funding, but the amount received has dropped 16% in the last decade — and the share of funding DWD withholds has increased.
Additionally, state funding cuts of $22 million “have all but eliminated” the popular, $26 million Jobs for America’s Graduates program. That’s less than a year after the program finished a massive expansion to become the nation’s largest network.
Thinking bigger
The analysis made several ambitious recommendations to boost workforce development progress in Indiana.
The boards “must see their missions as much bigger” than administering WIOA and their WorkOne centers, it asserted. They should partner more with businesses, chambers of commerce, universities and others — and get talking to lawmakers to prevent cuts in the future, the report added.
“Maintaining active, year-round relationships with public officials and civic leaders means going beyond occasional updates and instead systematizing regular interactions such as district visits, site tours of WorkOne centers, and data briefings that highlight outcomes, workforce needs, and employer perspectives,” it said. “These activities reduce misperceptions about what (workforce boards) do and build long-term champions who can advocate for stronger policies and resources.”

Workforce boards should become the default source of information on training programs, perhaps by creating provider scorecards along key metrics, the report suggested.
The analysis included a call for Indiana’s employers to step up.
It noted many want new or expanded programs, or are frustrated by funding cuts to programs they benefit from, but “are often unwilling to contribute funding or engage in formal advocacy.” Doing so would make the workforce system less reliant on government money, the report said.
The boards should also get more involved in youth apprenticeships, plus educational and economic development planning.
“Rarely are (workforce boards) involved in Indiana’s code-name economic development projects, and that needs to change if workforce and economic development are to be more aligned,” the analysis noted.
Other recommendations included: offering boards greater funding and flexibility, having them administer workforce-related human services programs, strengthening the Indiana Workforce Alliance and integrating data infrastructure.
Workforce boards are “Indiana’s most scalable, demand-responsive workforce infrastructure,” the report asserted. “… But realizing their full potential requires deliberate action from leaders across the full workforce ecosystem.”

(Photo by Scott Taetsch/Getty Images)When I first heard about the arrests of Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and former NBA player Damon Jones in connection to federal investigations involving illegal gambling, I couldn’t help but think of a recent moment in my sports writing class.
I was showing my students a clip from an NFL game between the Jacksonville Jaguars and Kansas City Chiefs. Near the end of play, Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence threw a perfect pass to receiver Brian Jones Jr. to secure a critical first down. Out of the blue, a student groaned and said that he’d lost US$50 on that throw.
I thought of that moment because it revealed how ubiquitous sports betting has become, how much the types of bets have changed over time, and – given these trends – how it’s naive to think players won’t continue to be tempted to game the system.
 The prop bet hits it big

I’ve been following the evolution of sports gambling for about a decade in my position as chair of Penn State’s sports journalism program.
Back when legal American sports betting was mostly confined to Las Vegas, the standard bets tended to be tied to picking a winner or which team would cover a point spread.
But ahead of the 1986 Super Bowl between the Chicago Bears and the overmatched New England Patriots, casinos offered bets on whether Bears defensive lineman – and occasional running back – William “Refrigerator” Perry would score a touchdown. The excitement around that sideshow kept fan interest going during a 46-10 blowout.
Perry did end up scoring, and the prop bet took off from there.
Prop bets are wagers that depend on an outcome within a game but not its final result. They can often involve an athlete’s individual performance in some statistical category – for instance, how many yards a running back will rush for, how many rebounds a basketball center will secure, or how many strikeouts a pitcher will have. They’ve become routine offerings on sports betting menus.
For example: As I write this, I am looking at a FanDuel account I opened years ago, seeing that, for the Green Bay Packers-Pittsburgh Steelers game currently in progress, I can place a wager on which player will score a touchdown, how many yards each quarterback will throw for and much, much more. As the game progresses, the odds constantly shift – allowing for what are called “live bets.”
Returning to my student who lost the bet on Lawrence’s pass completion: It’s possible he’d placed a bet on Lawrence to throw fewer than a set number of yards. Or he could have been part of a fantasy league, which is also dependent on individual player performances.
Either way, a problem with prop bets, from an anti-corruption perspective, is that an individual can often control the outcome. You don’t need a group of players to be in on it – which is what happened during the infamous Black Sox Scandal, when eight players on the Chicago White Sox were accused of conspiring with gamblers to intentionally lose the 1919 World Series.
In the indictment against him, Rozier is accused of telling a co-defendant to pass along information to particular bettors that he planned to leave a March 2023 game early – a move everyone involved knew meant he would not reach his statistical benchmarks for the game. They could then place bets that he wouldn’t hit those marks.
In baseball, meanwhile, Luis Ortiz of the Cleveland Guardians was placed on leave during the 2025 season and is under investigation for possibly illegally wagering on the outcome of two pitches he threw. MLB authorities are essentially trying to determine if he deliberately threw balls as opposed to strikes in two instances. (Yes, prop bets have become so granular that you can even bet on whether a pitcher will throw a ball or a strike on an individual pitch.)
 An exploding market with no end in sight

The popularity of prop bets feeds into a worldwide sports gambling industry that has experienced explosive growth and shows no sign of slowing.
Since the U.S. Supreme Court in 2018 ruled that states could decide on whether to allow sports betting, 39 states plus the District of Columbia have done so.
The leagues and media are more than just bystanders. FanDuel and DraftKings are official sports betting partners of the NBA and the NFL.
In the days after the Supreme Court ruling, I wondered whether journalists would embrace sports betting. These days, ESPN not only has a betting show, but it also has a betting app.
According to the American Gaming Association, sportsbooks collected a record $13.71 billion in revenue in 2024 from about $150 billion in wagers. A study released in February 2025 by Siena and St. Bonaventure universities found that nearly half of American men have an online sports betting account.
But those figures don’t begin to touch the worldwide sports betting market, especially the illegal one. The United Nations, in a 2021 report, reported that up to $1.7 trillion is wagered annually in illegal betting markets.
The U.N. report warned that it had found a “staggering scale, manifestation, and complexity of corruption and organized crime in sport at the global, regional, and national levels.”
 Who’s the boss?

In early October 2025, I attended a conference of Play the Game, a Denmark-based organization that promotes “democratic values in world sports.” Its occasional gatherings attract experts from around the world who are interested in keeping sports fair and safe for everyone.
One of the most sobering topics was illegal, online sportsbooks that feature wagering on all levels of sport, from the lowest levels of European soccer on up.
It sounded somewhat familiar. This summer at the Little League World Series, which my students covered for The Associated Press, managers complained about offshore sportsbooks offering lines on the tournament, which is played by 12-year-old amateurs.
And with so much illegal wagering in the world, the issue of match fixing was bound to come up.
One session screened a recent German documentary on match fixing. Meanwhile, Anca-Maria Gherghel, a Ph.D. candidate at Sheffield Hallam University and senior researcher for EPIC Global Solutions, both in northern England, told me how she had interviewed a professional female soccer player for a team in Cyprus. The player described how she and her teammates were routinely approached with lucrative offers to throw matches.
Put it all together – the vast sums of money at play and the relative ease of fixing a prop bet, let alone a match – and you cannot be surprised at the NBA scandal.
I used to think that gambling was just a segment of the larger sports industry. Now, I wonder whether I had it exactly backward.
Has sports just become a segment of the larger gambling industry?

Under a provisionary — but longstanding — ownership transfer process, these nursing home operators were approved by the state out of the public eye.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Problems followed some of Vermont’s largest and most troubled nursing homes after state approved new ownership.","Some of the most sizable and troubled nursing homes in the state have struggled for much of this year to provide sufficient care under new ownership, logging violations that included a death, injuries and neglect of residents.
The slate of investigations and new operators’ previous track records have raised questions about how Vermont vets prospective operators and protects residents, under a longstanding process that was supposed to be only temporary.
Corrective plans and subsequent inspections have recently led the facilities to achieve compliance with state regulations. But advocates say there should be policy changes to improve the state’s review process of new ownership, to preempt and root out the problem of poor care.
Genesis HealthCare, a large-scale nursing home operator and private-equity-backed company, sold off six of its nine Vermont nursing home facilities in the past year to little fanfare before filing for bankruptcy this summer. 
Genesis had a questionable track record operating in the state in recent years and had been trying to sell its Vermont holdings for years. Facilities under Genesis ownership in Burlington, Berlin and St. Johnsbury were the subject of one of the largest nursing home-related settlements in state history in 2020 after a resident died and two others were hospitalized.
In 2023, the state granted iCare Health Network a contract to operate the former Genesis-owned Bennington Health & Rehabilitation Center. Under the state contract, the new operator agreed to serve people who would typically not be taken in by other nursing homes due to complex mental health challenges or being formerly incarcerated. iCare took over the facility in September 2024 and renamed it MissionCare at Bennington. 
This past December, Allaire Health Services, led by CEO Benjamin Kurland, assumed control over former Genesis facilities in St. Johnsbury, Springfield and Rutland. Stellar Health Group owner Ari Erlichman took over facilities in Berlin and Burlington after gaining state approval.

Under a provisionary — but longstanding — ownership transfer process overseen by the Agency of Human Services, these nursing home operators were approved out of the public eye.
With somewhere between 91 and 126 licensed beds at each facility, these nursing homes are all considered large scale, and therefore the care and system breakdowns reported at the facilities affect a sizable swath of the state’s elderly population, said Kaili Kuiper, the state long-term care ombudsman for Vermont Legal Aid.
Since the ownership transfer dates, the rate of complaints reported by residents received by Vermont Legal Aid’s Long-Term Care Ombudsman Project shot up at four of the six facilities, and rose across the board by an average of 25%, according to a data analysis by VTDigger. 
Pamela Cota, assistant director for the Division of Licensing and Protection, which inspects facilities to ensure compliance with state and federal guidelines, said the division will investigate complaints and issue citations when substantial evidence of deficiencies are found. 
“We expect all of our homes to be in compliance all of the time, so whenever we’re citing a violation, that means that there’s something broken,” Cota said. “We don’t allow for a grace period.” 
Nursing homes are typically required to draft corrective plans that are submitted to the state when the facility fails to meet minimum care standards. The division then accepts the plans and conducts a follow-up inspection to ensure changes are implemented before a facility can be considered back in compliance, Cota wrote in an email. 
Given the gravity of the situation reported at some facilities this year, Cota said the division has imposed new measures to ensure the safety and care of residents. 
 “We evaluate each case and really look to what enforcement actions might assist the facility in achieving and sustaining that compliance,” Cota said in an interview.

Death at MissionCare
At MissionCare at Bennington, a resident died from lithium toxicity, according to a March inspection by the state Division of Licensing and Protection. The inspection stated that the resident regularly received lithium carbonate medication despite the resident displaying signs of toxicity.
The facility’s failure to contact doctors, conduct lab work and amend its care plans for the resident put “all residents at risk for serious injury or death because of the noncompliance,” according to the inspection. 
David Skoczulek, a spokesperson for iCare — which took over the facility in 2022 — wrote in an email that the company disagrees that “any action by the facility violated state or federal law in this case,” although he wrote that changes were implemented following the incident. 
In order to gain state approval, Skoczulek noted that iCare had qualified under the state’s regulatory standards and was considered capable of “delivering secure, stigma free and high quality care” to residents with state-determined “specific service needs.”
“We are honored to be entrusted with this mission and to partner with the State of Vermont to address this critical care gap,” Skoczulek wrote.
Kuiper said she could not comment on the operator’s legal liability for the death, but said that long-term care facilities are supposed to implement measures to prevent lithium toxicity. 
“We certainly would expect there the recommended testing to be done and completed,” Kuiper said. “It’s a horrible tragedy that this person died because no one caught that she was suffering from lithium toxicity.”
MissionCare at Bennington is currently in compliance as of September, Cota wrote in an email.

‘Widespread system failure’ at Allaire
The three Vermont facilities now run by Allaire Health Services have faced a string of problems in recent months as well, including resident neglect, medication errors, staffing shortages and the rollback of Covid-19 protocols, state inspections show. 
St. Johnsbury Center for Living and Rehabilitation was found to have “immediate jeopardy” level violations due to neglect cases and “widespread system failure” that put residents at a “serious risk” of harm and death, according to a July state inspection. 
The facility faced chronic staffing shortages and lacked systems for care planning, medication management and lab services. The July inspection also found breakdowns in communication among staff, residents, physicians and state officials, leading to delayed care, unresolved complaints and other failures.
According to the inspection, the director of nursing confirmed to the inspector that she heard about a reported incident in which a certified nursing assistant allegedly slapped a resident across the face, but did not think it was necessary to notify the state. The administrator then told the inspector that she filed a state report in June, but there was no record of the report being received by the state a month later. 
The July inspection found widespread lack of care plans and treatment for residents with diabetes at the facility. In one case, a diabetic resident was denied insulin by a previous medical director, who told the state inspector it is a “dangerous medication” for nursing home residents, according to the report. 
That incident came after a different St. Johnsbury nursing home resident with diabetes was hospitalized due to dangerously high blood sugar levels, after a staff member refused to seek medical attention for the resident, according to an inspection report in May. 
In an April inspection, staff members also reported that the St. Johnsbury facility’s medical director told staff not to test residents and to stop testing themselves for Covid-19 in March after an outbreak in January, and Covid-19 personal protective equipment and N-95 masks were removed from the facility.

The vice president of operations told surveyors that the previous medical director “did not believe in COVID” and told “staff to pull the precautions and stop testing the residents for COVID and to treat symptoms like the cold,” according to the inspection.
Due to the repeated problems at the St. Johnsbury facility, Cota said, the division implemented an “extended survey” of the nursing home in July to identify system-level issues and violations that caused immediate jeopardy to residents. Once the state completed the extended inspection, Cota said the St. Johnsbury facility laid out an “extensive quality improvement plan” on Aug. 12, so the division did not impose a direct corrective plan. 
As of Sept. 3, the St. Johnsbury Center for Living and Rehabilitation was found in compliance by the state after an unannounced follow-up inspection, according to Cota. 
At the Rutland Center for Living and Rehabilitation, state inspectors found in August that a resident with dementia and a co-occurring mental health diagnoses was physically abused by a licensed nurse assistant. While receiving care, the resident hit the assistant, and the staff member responded by striking the resident across the face, according to the inspection. 
A resident was hospitalized for a fractured hip, according to a state inspection in June, after the Rutland Center for Living and Rehabilitation failed to place nonskid strips on the resident’s room. The inspection also found that the facility failed to store drugs and food properly and implement hygiene practices.
The Rutland Center for Living and Rehabilitation was found in compliance in September, Cota wrote in an email.
At the Springfield Center for Living and Rehabilitation, a licensed nurse withheld a resident’s pain medication, did not treat their wounds and inserted a silicone catheter even though the resident had a potential allergy to silicone, according to a state inspection in March. Adult Protective Services were called after the report, but the licensed nurse continued to work at the facility during the investigation.
The grievance policy was not updated after the ownership change to Allaire, according to the inspection. No residents surveyed knew how to report a grievance and several residents reported fear of retaliation if they reported their grievances.
Under the new ownership, the facility’s digital tracking systems were not updated, meaning employee records were not up to date and admissions records for patients were delayed. There were additional problems at the Springfield facility with lack of dental care, lack of trauma-informed care, lack of review of treatment plans, food safety violations, and residents receiving non-medically necessary medication, according to the March inspection. 
After the “systemic” issues found in March at the Springfield Center for Living and Rehabilitation under Allaire Health Services, the division imposed a direct plan of correction requiring an independent consultant to offer weekly reports on progress, Cota said. The Springfield Center for Living and Rehabilitation was found in compliance in July, Cota wrote in an email. 
Allaire spokesperson Suzanne Anair wrote in an email that the operator is known for turning around troubled long-term care facilities in other states. 
Anair acknowledged that problems at the St. Johnsbury facility are “disappointing” and that the Allaire team has “implemented a rapid improvement plan to address all issues.” Allaire has changed regional leadership and is working with staff to place focus on improving care for residents at the St. Johnsbury facility, Anair wrote.
Anair wrote that the Rutland facility staff member who was found to have physically abused a resident was vetted in accordance with the state and federal protocols and received training. The facility reported the incident immediately to proper authorities and takes resident safety seriously, she wrote. 
The nursing homes in St. Johnsbury, Springfield and Rutland struggled under Genesis’ ownership due to short staffing, failing compliance standards and leadership turnover, but the facility is working to stabilize operations and implement better systems, according to Anair.

Injury, staffing shortage at Stellar
Premier Rehab and Healthcare at Berlin — renamed from Berlin Health and Rehabilitation Center under Genesis — is still in the federal special focus facility program due to persistent quality issues under Genesis ownership. 
The facility under Stellar Health Group continues to face serious problems. A May inspection found that staff failed to notify family until a resident’s bedsore “deteriorated to an unstageable pressure injury with necrosis.”
In February, inspectors reported that the facility lacked adequate staffing, leading residents to wait long periods of time for medication, personal care and assistance with daily activities. One new resident said they had been confined to a bed for an entire weekend and forced to use a bedpan due to a policy requiring a physical therapy evaluation before staff could help a resident move.
Other findings included inadequate trauma-informed care, a 43% medication error rate, improper drug storage and staff giving residents unnecessary medications with long-term side effects. 
Erlichman wrote in an email that the Berlin facility recorded its “very first successful survey” in years in August. Stellar Health Group is hopeful that “after one more strong survey, Berlin will come off the Special Focus Facility list as early as February,” Erlichman wrote in August.
Yet, the since released August inspection describes several violations. A resident diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury and identified as a flight risk escaped the Berlin facility through a window. The resident was found with scraped knees and with a headache after falling down a hill, and was brought to the hospital. 
A physician assistant did not maintain hand hygiene standards when assessing a resident with a pressure ulcer on their tail bone, according to the inspection.

The state inspector also found residents were served unpalatable, cold food; medications were stored improperly; two residents were given drugs to take unsupervised; and required emergency-preparedness exercises were not regularly implemented at the Berlin facility.
When asked about the inspection, Erlichman wrote that every violation is concerning, but the total of only six citations “represents a significant improvement and clear progress for the facility.” The facility consistently had around 20 violations in recent surveys as a special focus facility, and the average U.S. nursing home receives around 10 federal citations per inspection according to 2024 data, he wrote. 
Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition, said that comparison to average violation count is less important to note than the actual harm to residents caused by violations cited. The violations described in August, including lack of infection control and adequate monitoring of residents, indicate “serious failure,” Mollot said.
Cota said the division had required an independent review of Premier Rehab and Healthcare at Berlin along with a corrective plan. The facility is in compliance as of September, Cota wrote in an email.
Premier Rehab and Healthcare at Burlington, Stellar’s other facility, reported physical assaults between residents in a May inspection, but was found in compliance with regulatory requirements in July, Cota wrote in an email. 
One of Stellar’s other long-term care facilities in Vermont — Birchwood Terrace in Burlington, which was not formerly owned by Genesis — has become “a jewel of Vermont’s nursing homes,” and “every resident deserves the same kind of stability, attention, and dignity that Birchwood represents,” Erlichman wrote. 
Birchwood Terrace has an overall one-star rating, out of five, for health inspections, staffing and quality measures and was fined $128,000 in 2024, according to the federal  Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services website. 
In response to the ratings, Erlichman said the period that caused the low score was “truly an outlier in what has otherwise been a pristine record,” and the facility has seen improvement by completing an inspection recently with “only two minor tags.” The state Division of Licensing and Protection found Birchwood Terrace in compliance in September. 
The positive change at the two former Genesis facilities is “palpable” after the operator changed leadership and staff and started planning building renovations, Erlichman wrote in August.
‘Egregious problems’
Regardless of the troubled history of the facilities under Genesis, Mollot said, the owners failed to meet the care and services required under state and federal law to provide on day one of operations. It’s disconcerting that “very serious and egregious problems” have arisen at the six nursing homes in less than a year, Mollot said.
“The owner is expected to provide care and compliance with longstanding federal minimum standards for every resident, for every single day, and actions can certainly be taken in even the most urgent situations to rectify and address substandard care and neglect and abuse,” Mollot said.
Mollot said the new owners must provide good quality of life and meet minimum care standards under the Nursing Home Reform Act of 1987 in order to receive federal funds. 
“The whole point of the federal nursing home law is that you don’t accept residents for whom you cannot provide safety and care,” Mollot said. 
Under the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services evaluation standards, iCare Health Network has a 3.1 star rating, Stellar Health Group has a 2.6 star rating, and Allaire Health Network has an overall 2.3 star rating as operators. Allaire Health Network and iCare Health Network also operate facilities in nearby states of New Jersey and Connecticut, respectively, that have been reported for abuse by the federal government.
Mollot said subpar or even average ratings for nursing home operators raise alarm bells in his work as an advocate for nursing home residents because care violations often go underreported or are not adequately addressed across the country. 
“It’s really hard to get a lot of citations in this country,” Mollot said. “When problems are identified, for me, that is really important for the public and for policymakers to be aware of.”
The most recent federal inspection of an Allaire Health Network facility in New Jersey in 2024 found that the facility conducted canine drug searches of residents’ rooms without notifying law enforcement or obtaining consent of all residents. The New Jersey facility is in “full compliance,” and the operator is currently appealing the citations, Allaire spokesperson Anair wrote. 
The most recent federal inspection of the Connecticut facility in 2023 found three residents reported sexual abuse from one resident with co-occuring mental health diagnoses. iCare spokesperson Skoczulek wrote the federal inspections did not find “mistreatment by the nursing home or its staff.”
“We feel strongly that a nursing home should not be given an ‘abuse’ deficiency under state or federal law for resident-to-resident incidents that are not reasonably preventable,” Skoczulek wrote in an email. 
Skoczulek wrote that the Connecticut facility is currently in compliance with state and federal regulations. 
Kuiper said she could not comment on the specific incident, but operators need to provide protections from resident-on-resident violence in any state. 
The deluge of violations at the six former Genesis facilities under new ownership come amid broader questions about who should ultimately be responsible for regulating nursing home ownership changes in Vermont. 

Long interim process
The state’s nursing home ownership transfer formerly fell under the purview of the Green Mountain Care Board, but the regulatory board passed that responsibility to the Agency of Human Services in 2018 through Act 125, on an interim basis. 
The law on nursing home oversight required a working group to recommend a permanent transfer process, but the Legislature has yet to act on those recommendations. Seven years later, the agency still manages the process through temporary rules. 
Under the current system, the Agency of Human Services officials take a two-pronged approach to reviewing proposed buyers’ finances and record of care. The agency’s secretary decides whether to approve the transfer after a private hearing with ownership representatives. Members of the public are not allowed to participate directly in these hearings, though the state long-term care ombudsman may submit written comments, Cota said. 
The secretary of the Agency of Human Services denied VTDigger’s requests for comment. The Division of Rate Setting, which reviews the financial and administrative capacity, also denied an interview request. But, Division of Rate Setting spokesperson Alex McCracken wrote in response to the inquiry that the three operators “all appear to be for-profit,” and the division did not find any problems with the operators’ financial information. 
Through “comprehensive” review of quality care, staffing and information from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services documents, Cota said the Division of Licensing and Protection works to understand the “whole picture” of the operators’ track record and “how the homes have either improved or deteriorated over the years of ownership in other states” before making recommendations to the agency secretary. 
Genesis had its facilities on the market for years, Kuiper said, and the state was caught between a rock and hard place when approving new nursing home purchasers due to lack of bidders. 
Kuiper said Genesis had six of its Vermont nursing homes openly on the market for a number of years to little avail. A 2021 bid from another prospective buyer collapsed after state regulators scrutinized the company’s performance at other nursing homes, Seven Days reported in 2021.
Kuiper said she was not aware of any other operators that threw their hat in the ring other than Stellar and Allaire before the five nursing homes transferred in December 2024. 
“I recognize that it’s difficult in Vermont, because my understanding was they didn’t have a lot of options,” Kuiper said. “It’s not like they had a wide variety of options and they chose these among a lot of different possible purchasers.”
But the lack of transparency concerns Kuiper, who considered seven years “a long time for an interim process,” and said she’d like to see more publicly available information on the state’s nursing home ownership transfers decision-making process.
While Kuiper said it is premature to make sweeping judgements on iCare Health Network and Stellar Health Group’s ability to to turn around their facilities and provide care, she said her office has more concerns Allaire Health Services’ given past track record in Vermont and problems at the facilities it took over from Genesis.
“To be honest, we have more concerns about Allaire,” Kuiper said. “We still want to work with them. We still are hoping we can get better results.”
Kuiper raised red flags to the state about Allaire Health Services’ bid to acquire three facilities. She told the state about problems reported at the Center for Living and Rehabilitation in Bennington — which Allaire already owned — including complaints of excessive heat, lack of necessary supplies, lack of food, and that staff and management failed to rectify reported issues. 
Another ombudsman position was created to oversee facilities in Bennington due to the number of complaints at the Allaire facility, and to ensure MissionCare at Bennington residents’ rights are respected and needs are met given the specialized care required there, Kuiper said.
The Allaire spokesperson wrote that the operator has had a “very positive impact on services and outcomes at its Bennington facility and is dedicating itself to making necessary and important changes and improvements at its other Vermont facilities.” 
‘Best interest of the long-term care system’
Faced with a longstanding interim process, Cota said there are early plans to introduce legislation to codify the current system under the Agency of Human Services under the Vermont Human Services statute. 
Another solution would be to move some of the oversight back to the Green Mountain Care Board, said Sam Peisch, health policy analyst with Vermont Legal Aid. A bill backed by Vermont Legal Aid last session sought to regulate transactions between health care entities.
But Peisch said there was pushback to the bill partially because of the work it took to move the responsibility under the Agency of Human Services years prior. Now, nursing home resident advocates and regulators may need to consider other innovative approaches to improving the nursing ownership transfer process, Peisch said. 
While state law provides strong principles to strive toward in the health care system, Peisch said state regulators, legislators and advocates should work toward stronger prohibitions on worst practices in the nursing care industry. 
State regulators for nursing homes face a real challenge, and are often under-resourced and overburdened, Peisch said, so the goal of the bill is to create a guide to identify and stop operators engaging in extractive financial practices that lead to low-quality care or harmful consequences for residents. 
One restriction would be higher financial penalties when abuse and other violations occur that act as a more meaningful deterrent to operators rather than the cost of doing business in the nursing home industry, Peisch said. 
Under a finalizing nursing home ownership transfer review process, Kuiper said representatives of long-term care residents should be included in the process, and “the best interest of the present residents and the best interest of the long-term care system in Vermont” should be part of the finalized review standards of ownership transfers.
In the long run, Kuiper said the state should explore promoting other ownership models and investing in improving the long-term care system in Vermont, because staff at nursing homes facilities can only do so much while “the system that they’re working under is dysfunctional.”
Kuiper would like the long-term care landscape to move away from the large-scale, for-profit model and instead invest in smaller nursing home facilities that are tailored to individualized care. That necessitates more state support for potential providers who find regulatory processes to be a barrier, but are capable of caring for the Vermont elderly population Kuiper said. 
“I know there’s a lot of rules and policies that you have to follow that can be really difficult for someone who could be very, very good at the care part,” Kuiper said. “I would love to see Vermont develop more support for people too on the regulatory side.”
In the evaluation of prospective buyers for former Genesis nursing homes, the Agency of Human Services has failed to identify and prevent operators with a history of deficient care from opening shop in Vermont, Mollot said. 
The state should strengthen laws and improve the evaluation process to root out operators with a history of poor care, akin to reforms in New York and other states, he said. One concrete step Vermont could take would be to increase transparency and make the entire nursing home ownership transfer process open to the public, Mollot said. 
“The fact that these operators have been allowed to enter Vermont and operate facilities which have been found to have substandard care is very alarming,” Mollot said. “Vermont should be doing a much better job — even under its own current written processes — to ensure high-quality care and the absence of abuse and neglect.”

Jesse James (R-Thorp) will challenge Senate Assistant Minority Leader Jeff Smith (D-Brunswick) in 2026 for Senate District 31, a key district that will help determine control of the Wisconsin Senate. 
All of Wisconsin’s odd-numbered Senate seats — 17 out of 33 — will be in play in 2026, the first election in those districts since they were redrawn as part of new voting maps adopted in 2024. The maps already shook up the Senate in 2024, when Democrats gained five additional even-numbered seats, cutting the Republican majority from 22 seats to 18.
Next year, Republicans will be competing to hold onto their majority as Democrats have launched an effort to flip the entire body. The last time Democrats held a majority in the Legislature was during the 2009 legislative session. 
Democrats will need to win at least two additional seats and hold all their current seats to win the majority. Most of the seats, including SD 5, SD 17 and SD 21, are currently held by Republicans. 
SD 31, which represents the entirety of Eau Claire County and parts of Dunn, Trempealeau and Chippewa counties, is the one district that Democrats have tagged as a seat to protect.
Smith seeks reelection
Smith, the second top Democrat in the Senate, is the incumbent of SD 31 and he announced his intention to seek reelection earlier this year. He was first elected to the Senate in 2018. He told the Wisconsin Examiner that the prospect of flipping the Senate is one of the reasons he is  running again.
“I see the opportunity is right in front of me where I think we’re going to reach a point where we’re in the majority, and I’m going to have to be able to carry that voice into our state Legislature,” Smith told the Examiner.
Smith said he has introduced over 130 bills in his time in office and only one of those has gotten a public hearing.
“The public should have the ability to hear all sides and all ideas,” Smith said, adding that he believes that would happen under Democratic control.
Among the priorities he listed in the next session are boosting state funding for Wisconsin public schools, ensuring that private schools that receive public funding are held accountable and increasing access to health care. 
“It shouldn’t matter whether you’re working or not working, everyone should be able to access the same level of care in any hospital, in any clinic, in not only our state, but in our country,” Smith said. 
Smith’s Republican challenger, Jesse James, announced his plans to seek reelection earlier this month.
James says he’s ‘ready to come home’
When James was elected to the Senate in 2022, he lived in Altoona, which sits outside Eau Claire and was part of Senate District 23. Under the new maps, however, Altoona was drawn into SD 31, so James said he decided to “uproot” his life to Thorp to finish out the rest of his four-year term. 
In his campaign announcement for 2026, James said he is “ready to come home.”
“Being 40 minutes away sucks,” James told the Wisconsin Examiner in an interview. The Republican senator said he is still helping take care of things at his family and home in Altoona as well as helping take care of his father who is sick. 
James, who comes from a law enforcement background and has continued working as a [sheriff?]  while in office, said he loves what he does in the Legislature and wants to continue the work. Prior to the Senate, James served in the Assembly for two terms. Mental health services, substance use prevention and  public safety are among his top priorities. 
At the start of his current term, he proposed the Senate form a committee focused on mental health, substance abuse prevention, children and families, which he now chairs. He said he had 27 bills signed in his first two years and has spent the majority of his time seeking to advance legislation in those three areas, including for expanding postpartum Medicaid access — a bill that is currently held up by members of his own party  — as well as an effort to establish psychiatric residential treatment facilities in Wisconsin.
“I’m coming home. I’m in a prime seat where I chair the committee that I do, everything that I fought for up to this point motivates me, and I’m going to continue that work record,” James said. “I’m going to continue the performance level that I’m at and continue working for the people… It’s going to be an uphill battle. I’m OK with that. I’ve been through uphill battles my whole life, and I’m willing to take on challenges.”
With majority at stake, competitive race ahead 
There’s about a year before Wisconsin’s 2026 November general elections, leaving plenty of time for a campaign. Both candidates said they are prepared for a tough race, especially with the Senate majority at stake.
“I’m always for competition,” James said about challenging his Democratic colleague. 
“This is going to be a huge seat. It’s going to be a battle, and everything we know right now it’s going to be interesting with midterms because… they don’t always bode well,” James added. “Come this midterm election, we’ll know where things are if I win, and we’ll know where things are if Jeff wins.” 
According to an analysis by John Johnson, a research fellow at Marquette University, the current 31st Senate district has a slight Democratic lean. Former Vice President Kamala Harris won the area by 2.2 percentage points in the 2024 presidential election and Sen. Tammy Baldwin won it by 4.7 percentage points in the 2024 Senate race.
According to data compiled by the State Senate Democratic Campaign Committee and shared with the Examiner, the district’s Democratic lean goes back further than the recent elections. In 2014, the district voted for Mary Burke, who lost statewide to former Gov. Scott Walker, and in 2016, it chose Hilary Clinton by a 51-point margin as President Donald Trump won the state. 
James said when he decided to run for reelection some people questioned why he was running in a district that is “kind of a lost cause,” though in his mind, he views the race as a 50-50 prospect.
“It’s going to be ugly, and I cannot wait to see what ads come out,” James said, adding that he doesn’t plan to “go negative” during his campaign. “I want to talk about me. I’m not going to talk about Jeff. Jeff can do his thing. I’m going to do mine.”
While James is a popular legislator who has generally sought to avoid polarizing partisanship, Smith sees his entry into the race as part of a larger partisan plan. 
“The bottom line about Republicans somehow convincing Sen. James that he should run for this district is simply because they also understand one thing, and that is, whoever wins this district is going to be in the majority,” Smith said. He added that this “isn’t about Jesse James and it isn’t about Jeff Smith. It’s about the state of Wisconsin, and who actually is going to govern and lead Wisconsin to a better future, and I really believe that we as a Democratic Party are in the best position to be able to do that.”
Smith is accustomed to running in tough races, he added. 
Smith won a second term to the Senate in 2022 to represent SD 31, defeating his Republican challenger by 697 votes. In 2018, Smith defeated his Republican opponent with 51% of the vote.
Smith also served in the Assembly for two terms from 2007 to 2011. He was ousted from his seat in 2010 by Republican Warren Petryk. 
Smith said he will take the same approach to this race that he has always taken, knocking doors and talking to people where they are. In the past he has been known for setting up shop in his truck, putting up a sign encouraging people to stop and talk to him.
“I know how to do this. I’ve done it before, over and over, and it is nothing new to me to have to run a difficult race,” Smith said. “I’m a great believer… go to the people, don’t make them come to you.” 
Hospital access key issue
In a statement after James’ campaign announcement, Smith said the Republican senator would need to explain himself to voters. 
“After years of toeing the line for Republican leadership, botching the hospital closure funding, dropping the ball on PFAS funding and failing to deliver results — voters in the 31st District know all too well how these failures have affected their lives,” Smith said. 
Two hospitals, HSHS Sacred Heart Hospital in Eau Claire and HSHS St. Joseph’s Hospital, closed abruptly last year due to financial difficulties, leaving a big swath of the Chippewa Valley with diminished access to health care. Wisconsin policymakers sought to help provide funding to help the area, but lawmakers refused to release the funds after Gov. Tony Evers exercised a partial veto on a related bill.
Asked about Smith’s statement on his candidacy, James pushed back.
“I’m not going to talk about the hospital funding. It’s dead. It’s over. The $15 million went back into the GPR [General Purpose Revenue],” James said. He added that he’s helped secure other investments in the area since. 
One bill, coauthored by James, to set up the legislative framework for Rogers Behavioral Health to establish a behavioral health hospital in Chippewa Falls passed the Assembly in September and the Senate in October. James also helped secure $1 million for Lutheran Social Services of Wisconsin and Upper Michigan, so it can re-open the former L.E. Phillips Libertas Treatment Center in Chippewa Falls.
James said securing the funds are his biggest wins for the Chippewa Valley, especially given the recent closures.
“It’s a start, and I still think that there’s more — I already have ideas for next session, that if I come back, or when I come back, I’ll be able to work on so that we’re already starting to look at the future and improving what we can for our rural areas, primarily, especially up north, with mental health and substance abuse prevention,” James said.
For his part, Smith said that he believes there needs to be more accountability for hospitals, noting that the ones in Chippewa Falls were being managed by an Illinois-based health care system and they closed “because they just weren’t bringing in enough money…That shouldn’t be the reason that people lose access to health care because someone can’t make enough money off them.” 
“It’s been a real struggle up there, and has become at the forefront of what my office is dealing with these days,” Smith said.
When it comes to funding for cleaning up PFAS, also known as forever chemicals, in the water supply, James said he hasn’t been involved in drafting or negotiating on the bill to make use of $125 million set aside to combat them. “I will call Jeff out on this,” James said. “He’s the assistant minority leader, and he’s part of leadership to where he could be part of these discussions, so why not use that leadership position as far as having the discussions about PFAs and stuff?” 
James also noted that he recently helped author a bipartisan bill that would require the state Department of Natural Resources to warn county and tribal health departments when an exceedance of state groundwater standards is discovered.
“We want clean, safe drinking water. That’s why I worked with Jill Billings [the Democratic Assembly representative from La Crosse]… The PFAS funding and stuff that’s all political. I’m going to be honest with you, I don’t like to be political,” James said. “My work record shows I like to get things done. I’ve gotten things done to better people’s lives. I will continue to work on things bipartisan.”

The sometimes controversial sport is making a big run in Wyoming, benefiting horse breeders and track lovers. 
The post At a track in Wyoming’s sagebrush sea, horse racing flourishes amid a national decline appeared first on WyoFile .","ROCK SPRINGS—It’s about an hour before the final day of the 2025 Wyoming horse racing season begins, and Ron Moorhouse is manning a scale in a backroom of an administrative building.
The 72-year-old is responsible for weighing jockeys ahead of the races at Sweetwater Downs, a blue-collar track outside of Rock Springs. Moorhouse was a jockey himself for 12 years. He used to weigh in at 110 pounds and developed a stomach ulcer from purging what he ate to stay slim. One season he raced in 13 different states.
“It becomes a lifestyle,” he said. 
Now Moorhouse weighs in young jockeys like Brayan Juarez. After stepping off the scale, the lithe 23-year-old from Utah stands in a small locker room and mentally prepares himself for the five races ahead. “You have to slow your mind when you leave those gates,” Juarez said. 
There’s a lot more jockeys for Moorhouse to weigh in Wyoming now. Fifteen years ago, the Cowboy State hosted zero races. This year saw more than 50 days of racing. More could come next year. 
“This is one of the few, best, success stories right now in horse racing,” track owner Eugene Joyce said. “No doubt about it.”

Outside the administrative building, pickups slowly fill the sprawling dirt parking lot as race time approaches. Local fans trickle in. Since it’s the last day of the season, a beer costs $2 and the cheeseburgers are half off. Everything must go. 
High above it all, Liam Molinaro is trying to launch his career. In an announcer’s booth with a bird’s eye view of the track, Molinaro studies the names and weights of horses and riders. He marks which jockeys showed up heavier than billed on the rosters bettors will use to make their picks.
At 21 years old, Molinaro called his first horse race a year ago in Humboldt County, California. It was toward the end of a rapid collapse of horse racing in Northern California. Molinaro bounced around for a time afterward, but has been calling races here at Sweetwater Downs for several weeks.
Molinaro grew up with the sport, he said. His father trained race horses.
Horse racing is a family affair. That’s old news to Rick Hillstead, a horse breeder from Star Valley who later in the day will be standing in the dirt track after a race. His voice chokes with emotion as he describes what horse racing has brought to his family ranch, which he works with his son. 
“We don’t have to scrimp,” he said. “It’s just been such a blessing.”

All four men, Moorhouse, Juarez, Molinaro and Hillstead, are at a seasonal racetrack outside Rock Springs because, though the grandstand that day will never get beyond a third full, horse racing in Wyoming is a rapidly expanding endeavor while, nationwide, attendance and betting are in steady decline. 
Around the country, 50 tracks have closed since 2000, according to Horseracing Wrongs, a group of activists who oppose the sport because of the numbers of horses that die and are hurt racing. Wyoming is going the other way.

The race season began in mid May at Energy Downs in Gillette, carried on through the heat of the summer at Wyoming Downs in Evanston and ended Sept. 28 at Sweetwater Downs.
A fourth track is under construction outside Cheyenne. In a stark demonstration of the industry’s revival here amid its decline elsewhere, Wyoming’s tracks are buying equipment from more famous race courses as they close in more populated parts of the country. 
Eugene Joyce, who founded Sweetwater Downs, acquired equipment from closing southern California tracks. Thunder Plains, the track rising outside Cheyenne, bought items at auction from Golden Gate Fields, a famed track in the East Bay outside San Francisco, according to a report in the Cowboy State Daily. 
A day at Sweetwater Downs reveals an industry where both the devotion and the nomadic lifestyle it inspires are evocative of Wyoming’s more traditional equine pastime — the rodeo. 
The industry is giving back to the state that has so far embraced it, Joyce, Beirn and other horse racing boosters say. They point to the industry’s growing impact on Wyoming’s ranching and agricultural businesses. It’s a good selling point in a state where ranching still maintains a strong grip on the state’s ethos and politics, even as it lags as an economic sector well behind the energy and tourism industries.

Hillstead, the Star Valley rancher, used to milk a lot more cows, he told WyoFile. When horse racing began to grow, “I happened to have some stallions, I happened to have some mares, I happened to have a son who was interested in it.” 
Now, he earns much of his living through a program administered by the state that distributes money to breeders who raise horses in Wyoming, based on how often their animals race and how well they perform at the track. In the last 10 years, his horses have earned over a million dollars through that program, according to  public records kept by the Wyoming Gaming Commission. Though raising and training horses carries significant costs, Hillstead said the program has changed his family’s financial outlook. 
And more importantly, he said, the money keeps his ranch viable and has helped him draw his family closer around that lifestyle — what some would consider the Wyoming dream.
But the competition keeps growing, Hillstead said, as Wyoming’s growing winners’ purses increasingly attract jockeys and horse owners from out of state. 
On Sept. 8, Sweetwater Downs hosted a race with a $250,000 purse, “the richest race run in Wyoming history,” according to a press release from  Wyoming Horse Racing LLC, the company that owns Sweetwater Downs. 
The money fueling this growth did not come from the handful of fans attending today’s race.

Instead it is generated in the thousands of brightly lit slot machines that have proliferated throughout Wyoming’s towns and cities. 
But under Wyoming law, it’s not quite a slot machine. It is, instead, a terminal for placing a bet on a historic horse race.  
That distinction can be difficult to understand. Put money into the machine, press the button and a reel of images rotates until they align into a winning combination. Just like a slot machine. The result, however, is not random. Instead, it’s dictated by the results of a real horse race run sometime in the past. Gamblers can handicap the games based on anonymized stats about the horses and jockeys, according to industry officials. 
To own and operate historic horse racing terminals, you need to own a race track. There are three companies in Wyoming doing so. The fourth entrant on the scene is Cowboy Racing. That company is building Thunder Plains, a new race track 10 miles east of Cheyenne. 
Large amounts of money are changing hands through the historic horse racing machines. In 2024, the total “handle” or sum of bets placed in the state’s burgeoning horse-based gambling industry, was more than $2.1 billion, according to a report compiled by the Wyoming Legislative Service Office. Joyce, however, cautions that the handle is swelled by people who win money and keep their winnings riding on the next bet. He estimates his industry’s revenue at around $200 million a year from the historic horse racing, far from the billions.

Just how much these companies are earning, and should be able to earn, is a question lawmakers have struggled with this year, as they take a new interest in an industry that reshaped Wyoming towns as more than 40 gaming halls cropped up around the state. 
Lawmakers are driven in part by the concerns of county and municipal officials, who say they lack statutory authority to regulate where the historic horse racing machines are placed. There’s also, among the members of the socially conservative Wyoming Freedom Caucus, some trepidation toward gambling itself. 
Legislative bids to increase taxes on the gambling industry failed in committee votes this summer. But the Wyoming Legislature’s Select Gaming Committee advanced other measures for lawmakers to consider when they convene in February. Those bills include a measure requiring local approval for betting facilities in towns, and legislation that would cap the number of historic horse racing machines a track operator can manage throughout the state, according to the Wyoming Tribune Eagle.

Wyoming Horse Racing, the company Joyce cofounded, is behind Swan Ranch, the large casino-like facility that has risen outside Cheyenne, and a similarly large-sized facility planned outside Evanston. It also operates nine other gaming locations around the state.
Horse racing’s opponents, like those behind the Horseracing Wrongs website, describe the modern iteration of racing as largely government subsidized — through the rerouting of gambling revenues that could go to public schools or other programs but instead supports the racing industry.
Joyce argues that in Wyoming, lawmakers have seen the value that industry brings to veterinarians, farriers and other subsidiary agricultural businesses. 
Local authorities skeptical of gambling’s impact on their communities have questioned whether horse racing is propping itself up on the backs of Wyoming’s poor. A study in Laramie County, conducted by the public health division of the Cheyenne Regional Medical Center, found that gambling venues there were “disproportionately concentrated in lower-income neighborhoods.”
Joyce and his partners point out that their large facilities are targeting the large populations around Denver and Salt Lake City. 
“The point is to attract tourists from out of state and take their money, not our own people’s money,” Laurie Urbigkit, a lobbyist for Wyoming Horse Racing, told the Select Gaming Committee at its Oct. 14 meeting.
Beirne, the track manager, described Joyce as “the godfather” of Wyoming horse racing. The moniker has some veracity. Joyce first came to the state in the late ‘80s, when his father purchased Wyoming Downs, the track outside Evanston, out of a bankruptcy. His father sold the track a decade later, but not before Joyce met his wife in Evanston and developed an affection for the state.

He went on to a career in horse racing around the country before returning to the state in 2010. 
When he got back, Joyce planned for a race track that would run a handful of days a year, paid for by a couple of off-track betting locations around the state, he told WyoFile. When he first entered into an agreement with Sweetwater County to use the fairgrounds, the area that today is a track was being used for demolition derbies. Joyce’s crews had to dig the shrapnel of wrecked cars out of the soil to build a circuit safe for pounding hoofs. 
Historic horse racing has allowed something far more expansive than his initial vision. Joyce said he operates the track at a loss of nearly $800,000 a season, even as his company pulls far more than that in revenue from its gaming business. 
Legally, he needs to have a race track in order to run the lucrative gambling businesses around the state. But both Joyce and those around him say the horse racing, for him at least, remains the point.

Joyce spoke with disappointment about one reason he saw behind the national trend of tracks closing — as cities have grown, he said, what was once cheap land for track building on their outer limits has become valuable real estate. For some companies, there’s more value in selling the land under the track than in running it. 
“They’re supposed to be in horse racing,” he said, adding “But you know they’re making business decisions on this stuff.”
Joyce does not see a negative social impact from the historic horse racing machines he said. He sees gambling as often traveling hand in hand with other addictions, like alcoholism or drug addiction. 
“I’m a horse racing guy, not a gaming guy,” he said. “My partners are gaming guys. They’ve really supercharged the amount of money we can put into horse racing which gets me excited.” 
There’s less betting at the track on race days than on the historic horse racing machines. In the last few days, the handle there averaged around $34,000 a day, Joyce said. But it still has its adherents.
Pete Radakovich and Jolene Endres are Rock Springs residents who describe themselves as track “lifers” now that Joyce has rebuilt the industry here. They make their bets on each race just before the horses enter the starting gates, after consulting the brochure and the jockey’s past performances, and assessing the horses during a walk-by for the fans. 
Radakovich says he’s come out ahead on his horse racing bets. Endres isn’t so sure. “I want to win, but it’s not the reason we’re out here,” she said.

Freedom Caucus’ attention-seeking ""aggressive legislative oversight"" is unwarranted, columnist Kerry Drake opines.
The post Dangers lurk behind DOGE-ing Wyoming’s health department appeared first on WyoFile .","Thousands of Wyomingites will likely lose their health insurance as a result of the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” a travesty that Republicans are so proud of they’ve shut down the federal government for weeks without caring about the damage.

Opinion

That’s appalling, but it goes hand-in-hand with the destructive action members of the Wyoming House’s far-right Freedom Caucus are taking by treating the state’s Health Department like it’s overrun by waste, fraud and abuse.
It’s a typical reaction by politicians who want to hold budgets hostage while taking divisive, ideological swipes at a department that has managed to craft sound health and fiscal policies despite being handicapped by poor legislative decisions.
For many years, the Wyoming Legislature has viewed the Health Department as the first place to cut when tax revenues decrease. With a budget of $2.2 billion in the current two-year fiscal cycle, it’s a big target.
This effort to mimic the federal government’s “Department of Government Efficiency” at the state level will hopefully fail and not result in the carnage that the Elon Musk-led DOGE was responsible for at the beginning of President Donald Trump’s second term. Still, the fact that the Freedom Caucus decided it needed to DOGE the Health Department at all is ample reason to worry.
How did we get here? As the Grateful Dead would say, what a long, strange trip it’s been.
In June, at a Joint Appropriations Committee meeting in Gillette, the panel heard a pitch for more funding for the Medicaid developmental disabilities waiver program. Through it, more than 570 providers care for about 2,500 people with intellectual and developmental disabilities or acquired brain injuries in home and community-based alternatives to an institution.
One of the disability waiver program’s biggest boosters for additional funding was Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan. I wrote a column in July about how remarkable it was to see a member of the Freedom Caucus say a social safety net program is “one of the reasons why we have government.”
I stand by that statement as well as my own support for this worthwhile program. But I didn’t know exactly where Pendergraft’s mission to obtain more funds would take us.
The Sheridan lawmaker said, “Before I sit down and authorize a $20-or-$30-or-$40 million check, knowing that taxpayers are already sacrificing, I want to look across the breadth of the Department of Health. If it considers this to be a high priority, what’s it willing to sacrifice to pay for it?”


Stefan Johansson, the department’s director, gave a diplomatic answer. He noted that three times in the past dozen years, the Department of Health saw its budget cut by more than $100 million. While the Legislature added some money back into critical programs like suicide prevention and substance abuse treatment when it could afford to, the department never fully recovered that money.
At the JAC’s August meeting, Pendergraft again pressed his point about sacrifices. Johansson explained that the disability waiver program’s biennium budget is over $300 million. “It’s a large-scale, very expensive program, because these services and the acuity of some of these clients is very high,” the director said.
It’s not a difficult concept to understand: The Legislature can’t add, say, $80 million to one expensive program and cut other health programs dollar-for-dollar and not do a considerable amount of damage to the latter. 
Here’s another fact: Programs that are either required to be offered under federal law or part of lawsuit settlements account for more than 90% of the department’s budget.
Still, at the end of the meeting, Pendergraft moved that the JAC appoint a three-member subcommittee to investigate and analyze the Department of Health’s budget because “aggressive legislative oversight and attention is warranted.”
The JAC agreed, and the Legislative Management Council approved enough money for the subcommittee to meet up to five times before next February’s budget session. Lo and behold, Pendergraft is chairman.
The first two meetings in Casper and Cheyenne have not been particularly well attended but were generally cordial affairs where Pendergraft has held court over his subcommittee’s “fact-finding mission.” Johansson and his staff dutifully covered every section of the budget, proving what long-time observers of the department already knew: It’s a well-oiled machine that spends 95% of its budget on providing medical services and a modest 5% on administrative costs.
What concerns me about this fishing expedition to find waste and abuse à la DOGE is that the Legislature is looking for massive savings but is likely to find minuscule amounts. In its self-righteous anger, does anyone seriously think the Freedom Caucus isn’t going to take an ax to whatever in the budget would inflict the most pain, just because it can?
Simultaneously, lawmakers are ignoring that up to 25,000 Wyomingites are about to be hit with a more than 300% increase in their health insurance costs when the enhanced premium tax credits on the Affordable Care Act marketplace expire at the end of the year under Trump’s “Big Bill.”
It’s a solid bet many will forego health insurance. They won’t receive preventative health care, and will instead leave rural hospitals that are already at risk of closing to pick up the tab for emergency room care.
What types of wasteful health care spending does the Freedom Caucus expect to find and shut down? When Wyoming Public Radio posed that question to Freedom Caucus Chairman Emeritus Rep. John Bear — who also co-chairs the JAC — this is what he came up with: a federally funded advertising program to ensure children get vaccinated. No, I’m not kidding.
It goes against my nature, but I’ll close on a potentially hopeful note, only because Johansson told the JAC subcommittee that the $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Fund that was included in the “Big Beautiful Bill” to appease some Republican critics may actually improve health care access in rural Wyoming.
Johansson said the state may receive between $500 million and $700 million over the next five years, which could go a long way toward improving Wyoming’s health care system.
I’d much prefer the Legislature work with professionals at the Health Department on better ways to spend money to solve problems like our rural state’s lack of OB-GYN physicians and to keep maternity wards open, instead of allowing the Freedom Caucus to use the budget process to keep its thumb ever-present over public health. As they say in the health care world, that would be a good outcome.

Massive turnout for 'No Kings' rallies across Wyoming is a good sign that American democracy still has a long life ahead of it, writes Marion Yoder.
The post Good day for democracy appeared first on WyoFile .","Having nothing more important to do at noon on Oct. 18, I went to Cheyenne’s “No Kings” rally in front of Wyoming’s Capitol building to help preserve our democracy. I was not alone. At least 200 people, and probably more, came out, despite weather that gave new meaning to the term “inclement.” 

Opinion

Similar events took place in Casper, Evanston, Laramie, Rock Springs, Gillette, Torrington, Jackson, Cody, Worland, Douglas, Pinedale, Sheridan and Rawlins. Hundreds turned out in Casper’s Conwell Park. All this, despite Wyoming holding the distinction of being the “Trumpiest” state in the Union ever since 2016.
Cheyenne protesters were decked out in costumes resembling everything from unicorns to dinosaurs to a Holstein cow. One dinosaur’s sign read, “Don’t Let Democracy Go Extinct.” The cow’s sign read on one side, “Hate Won’t Make us Great” and, on the other, “Ugh. Where do I even start?”
Others took up the challenge and bore clever signs aplenty. Among them: “The Only Monarch We Want is a Butterfly,” “I’m Your Aunt Ifa,” “Deportation Without Due Process is Just Called Kidnapping,” “I’m a Veteran, Not a Sucker or a Loser,” and “If We Hated America, We Wouldn’t be Fighting for It.” My personal favorite, in red, white and blue, was carried by a fit 30-something man. It read, “Pro-America, Anti-Trump.” That says it all, really. 
Several pro-Trump people were there, too. I approached one young man carrying a large “Trump 2024” sign and wearing a red sweatshirt celebrating Charlie Kirk. We exchanged a few pleasantries, each congratulating the other on exercising our First Amendment rights as we left the rally. 
Isn’t that the way it should be? Nothing will ever convince me that Kirk’s actions while on Earth deserve the sanctification that state legislators and universities across the country are heaping upon his memory today. Far from it. I’ve seen enough of him verbally attacking people who disagreed with him to convince me that he resorted to bullying to “win” a debate.  
Protesters gather outside the Wyoming State Capitol for the No Kings Protest on Oct. 18, 2025 in Cheyenne. This was the 43rd protest organized by Joe Ramirez since February. The No Kings protests, also known internationally as the No Dictators or No Tyrants protests, is a series of demonstrations, largely in the United States, against what the organizers describe as authoritarian policies of Donald Trump and corruption in his administration.

Nonetheless, I can respectfully speak with people who do admire him and they can speak politely to me while I’m sporting a badge showing Donald Trump’s unhealthy face with the word “Unfit” beneath it. We don’t have to agree with each other’s diametrically opposed worldviews, but we do have to get along with one another. We are all Americans. This is our country. It is our flag. We have a shared past, present and, we trust, future.  
It is incumbent upon everyone to remember that this country has been divided before and that we have come through it. Even the most cunning of revisionist historians are not going to succeed in making Americans forget that the Civil War was fought over slavery. Nor are we likely to forget that the Allies, with America joining the fray later than the rest, were fighting Fascism in World War II. Nor are we going to ever believe that the Founders for one instant thought that the president of the United States should be above the law. Only kings “can do no wrong.” 
America has, since its inception, rejected the very idea of monarchy. The three founding documents giving voice and meaning to this concept, and making it a reality, can easily be found at the National Archives. There, you can read the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Known collectively as the Charters of Freedom, these three documents have secured Americans’ rights for nearly 250 years.

Today, we have a government in intentional disarray, with a chief executive behaving as if he were a king, a Congress afraid of its own shadow and even more afraid of a quixotic president and a result-oriented Supreme Court, which kowtows to said president. It did so most egregiously last year by “discovering” the concept of presidential immunity for criminal behavior in the Constitution. This would surely come as a great and unwelcome surprise to each and every one of its writers and signers. In due course, though not soon enough, this wrong decision will doubtless be overturned just as other bad Supreme Court decisions have been.
We have not been precisely here before, but we have been through a lot in the course of our relatively young nation’s history. Somehow, our democracy has prevailed, tattered and worn though it may be. And the American people still retain the precious commodity of hope for a better future. 
If the Oct. 18 protests and the American people’s exercise of their First Amendment rights to freely assemble and speak their minds are any indication, I’m guessing our democracy still has a long life ahead of it. God knows, I hope so.

Gen. Craig Strong at left and Nebraska Department of Correctional Services Director Rob Jeffreys as the state announces work a new ICE facility. Aug 19. 2025. (Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — As Nebraska turns a state prison into a detention center for migrants facing deportation proceedings, the Nebraska Corrections Department confirmed where it moved state inmates from the McCook Work Ethic Camp to make room.
The transition plan, announced Aug. 19, will convert the Work Ethic Camp as soon as this week. Gov. Jim Pillen and federal officials said then it would be a “Midwest hub” for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 
As of that announcement, Nebraska housed 186 men at the McCook low-security facility, a total population that fluctuated with normal transfers in. The Corrections Department transferred them to other state facilities as follows:

103 inmates to low-security-level community corrections centers in Omaha and Lincoln.
59 inmates to minimum custody housing at the Nebraska State Penitentiary in Lincoln.
17 inmates to minimum custody housing at the Omaha Correctional Center.
7 inmates to parole.
2 inmates discharged.
1 inmates placed into post-release supervision.

“Several” were also temporarily transferred to the Reception and Treatment and county jails, “due to behavioral reasons and unrelated to the WEC transition,” a department spokesperson said.

State lawmakers created a “work ethic camp” in state law by a 41-1 vote in April 1997 at the request of McCook native and then-Gov. Ben Nelson. It opened in 2001, designed to reduce prison crowding through rehabilitative programming for low-risk offenders as a method to free up bed space for more violent offenders at other prisons.
The facility had served adult men convicted of felonies who needed substance use treatment or cognitive restructuring. It had a state budget of $10.2 million.
Rob Jeffreys, director of the Correctional Services Department, said last week in a court filing that all inmates formerly assigned to the Work Ethic Camp had been moved to other prisons that were “available, suitable and appropriate to … meet the inmates’ programming requirements.”
“In my opinion as NDCS director, the inmates transferred out of the facility to make room for [U.S. Department of Homeland Security] detainees will receive programming at the transfer facility that is equivalent to or meets the programming the inmates received at the facility,” Jeffreys said in the sworn statement.
If Nebraska needs to transport state inmates back to the Work Ethic Camp alongside ICE detainees, the state would incur costs for doing so. The Sept. 30 contract is in place for an initial two-year period. Pillen’s office estimates it could annually net Nebraska about $14 million. The rebranded state-federal facility will remain state-owned and operated.
A lawsuit filed Oct. 15 argues Pillen and Jeffreys violated the Nebraska Constitution and state law in entering the ICE contract and sought to “usurp” legislative authority. A Red Willow County District Court judge allowed the case to proceed but declined to pause the Nebraska-ICE deal while it is argued, ruling that Pillen and Jeffreys complied with the law.
Officials have said the first ICE detainees are expected to be sent to McCook by the end of the week. ICE inspectors completed walkthroughs of the facility last week and certified it for federal use.

This spring, the U.S. Department of Agriculture canceled thousands of orders, accounting for millions of pounds of food, meant for low-income Americans. Orders totaling more than 370,000 pounds of U.S.-produced meat, dairy and produce for Idaho food banks were canceled, according to USDA data obtained by ProPublica. 
The deliveries had been scheduled between May and September under the USDA Emergency Food Assistance Program. Nationwide, the cuts totalled about $500 million for nearly 94 million pounds of food, ProPublica reported. 
For Idaho, the canceled deliveries included cheese, turkey breast, dried cranberries, chicken, and pulled pork. The program is designed to provide nutritious, high-quality USDA foods for low-income residents and support U.S. agriculture markets.  
Seven orders would have gone to food banks in North Idaho through the Community Action Partnership, which offers food assistance in Boundary, Kootenai, Shoshone, Benewah and Nez Perce counties. The deliveries would have included hundreds of cases of canned chicken, dried cranberries, and frozen chicken legs, the data shows. 
Multiple orders of meat and cheese were scheduled to go to Boise Cold Storage on behalf of El-Ada Community Action Partnership. The canceled orders totaled approximately 200 pounds of food, including shredded cheese, turkey breast, chicken breast, pork chops, chicken legs and turkey breast deli meat. 
Food banks in Lewiston and Pocatello also had cases of pork and turkey that halted under the action.  
The food banks affected by the order cancellations could not be reached for comment.
Products delivered through the program are some of the most expensive and difficult for food banks to keep in stock, ProPublica reported. 
There may be additional strain on food banks as the federal government shutdown continues because the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, has depleted its funding until Congress renews it. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced last week it will pause its SNAP program, previously known as food stamps, in November. 
There are more than 130,000 Idahoans who use SNAP food assistance. 
The Emergency Food Assistance Program, known as TEFAP, was first authorized by Congress in 1981 to purchase farmers’ surplus food and distribute it to Americans in need. In 2018, under the first Donald Trump administration, funds were added to the program to help farmers dealing with tariffs amid trade disputes, ProPublica reported. 
Under the current Trump administration, the additional funding was cut and characterized as a Biden-era slush fund.” 
U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins in August announced the department would purchase up to $230 million in fresh seafood, fruits and vegetables from American producers for food assistance programs, including The Emergency Food Assistance Program.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Food banks and feeding centers across West Virginia are bracing for an influx of need in coming days as thousands of people will not receive their allotments of federal benefits on Nov. 1 and others continue to work without pay due to the ongoing federal government shutdown.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture — which operates the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — posted on its website over the weekend that “there will be no benefits issued” on Nov. 1.
“Bottom line, the well has run dry,” the message reads. It goes on to openly and directly blame Democrats in Congress for the government shutdown, which started on Oct. 1. 
Democrats in Congress have repeatedly voted against stopgap funding bills to reopen the government because they want a guarantee that certain health care subsidies will be extended and funded. Republicans don’t want those subsidies included, which are set to expire at the end of the year.
If they do expire, West Virginians will be particularly hurt, with thousands potentially losing their health insurance. Others could see premiums increase by an average of 133%.
President Donald Trump’s administration said Friday that it will not use any of the more than $5 billion available in SNAP contingency funds to support families and individuals who rely on SNAP to eat. 
In West Virginia, about 270,000 people — or one in six residents — rely on SNAP to feed their families. More than 56% of those receiving the benefits are in families with children and 46% are in households with elderly or disabled people, according to the national Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Earlier this month, the West Virginia Department of Human Services announced on social media that benefits would not be processed for anyone approved to receive SNAP after Oct. 16. November benefits, according to the post, were also expected to be indefinitely delayed.
Cyndi Kirkhart, executive director for the Facing Hunger Foodbank, said the benefits are a lifeline for thousands of families in West Virginia. Now, knowing that benefits won’t be available for them in coming days, the food bank and others across the state are grappling to meet what they expect to be a dramatic increase in community needs. 
“For some people, we might be giving them the only food they can really get to eat for God knows how long,” Kirkhart said. “We’re already at the point right now where, in some places, we’re running low on food. We don’t have enough to meet the existing needs. Now, we’re going to have to figure out how to do even more with much, much less.”
In normal times — when people are receiving their benefits and when other federal employees are being paid for their work and able to afford food — West Virginia already faces high rates of food insecurity. According to Feeding America, more than 15% of people in the state regularly go without food. 
And things have already gotten tighter for Facing Hunger over the past several months, Kirkhart said. Costs rising due to inflation have led more people to rely on food pantries and feeding centers to make their dollars go further. 
“Everyone is trying to do more with less,” Kirkhart said. “This is unrelenting.”
As individuals have struggled, Kirkhart said Facing Hunger has as well. It’s more difficult to get nutritious, protein-rich foods in stock. When those options are available for purchase or through individual donations, they go fast.
Kirkhart said there’ve been numerous times where volunteers and employees at food giveaways have had to turn people away without food because of low supply.
“We’re asking people to split bags of potatoes, of apples, of whatever we do have because we’re showing up expecting to see 250 families but actually have 370 there in need,” Kirkhart said. “That’s the worst feeling in the world — telling people who are relying on you for help that you don’t have anything to spare today.”
This spring — as inflation rates kept prices soaring for grocery staples — the Trump administration cut more than $500 million in food deliveries for feeding services like Facing Hunger. Those who operate them were forced almost over night to adjust their expectations for deliveries and giveaways.
Now, Kirkhart said, the consequences of these changes through the USDA and increasing prices are likely going to get worse as thousands of other people who don’t often rely on the foodbanks for day-to-day staples find themselves in need.
“It’s all compounding together and I don’t know how we’re going to handle it,” Kirkhart said. “We don’t have enough on hand to provide for the fallout of [unavailable SNAP benefits].”
Steven Little, the assistant executive director at Huntington City Mission, a feeding center and ministry in Cabell County, said individuals there have already been forced to “get creative” with how they’re handing out food.
If they get a bag of apples, for instance, volunteers and workers are spending time turning them into apple sauce in order to meet the needs of their many elderly clients and others who may have teeth issues and need soft foods.
In general, Little said, there hasn’t been as much protein-rich meat or nutritious fruits and vegetables available. Last week — for the first time in years, he said — City Mission had to give out bologna sandwiches for lunch.
“That’s something, but it’s not the nutrition that we really want to be providing and it’s not the kind of food that is going to meet the really dire needs of some of our clients,” Little said. “Something is better than nothing, yes, but I think we all know that we can’t keep going like this.”
And as these situations compound, individuals in communities have stepped up as much as they can.
Yeager International Airport is holding a food and supply drive on Nov. 4 for the numerous federal employees who are going without pay due to the shutdown. 
Jamason Sparks, who owns and operates eight grocery stores throughout the greater Kanawha Valley area, announced on Facebook that his stores will be giving away free meal bags to anyone in need starting Nov. 10. 
Sparks started a GoFundMe fundraiser to help purchase supplies for the free meal bags on Friday. By Monday, more than $24,000 was raised by more than 340 people for the initiative.
Kirkhart said it’s encouraging to see so many across several communities step up — through donations, volunteering or just information sharing — step up and support those in need.
It’s still difficult, however, to envision what could happen with existing community needs and the organizations that exist to meet those needs long term. 
Kirkhart is already making adjustments to prepare for changes that are set to take place next year from the Republican-backed “Big Beautiful Bill” that passed congress over the summer. 
And as those in Congress are deadlocked over health care subsidies that could particularly impact West Virginians, Kirkhart is weighing how those potential changes will impact her nonprofit as well.
Health insurance is likely to get more expensive, increasing costs for Facing Hunger.
The organization and other feeding agencies were set to receive thousands of dollars in state funds to support and cover operational costs. 
Last week, Gov. Patrick Morrisey announced that he would be expediting payouts from those already allocated funds.
While Kirkhart said she’s grateful to have access to the money, it’s clear that it must be spent as soon as possible on food and other supplies to meet the organization’s growing needs. How things will be paid for in the future, she said, is unfortunately going to become a problem for another day.
“Every dollar we spend in one place now is a dollar we can’t spend on something else tomorrow. We understand that, and the best place to put our dollars at this time is clearly on food for the community,” Kirkhart said. “We know how many people are already hungry and we need to prepare for others who are going to be newly hungry. That’s the reality of where we’re at, and unless something changes soon, that’s where we’re going to be for some time.”

Still, across the cane fields of South Louisiana, migrant workers from Mexico brave the sun and punishing humidity to plant sugarcane. They come from the mountains of Guanajuato and San Luís Potosí, or the tropical coast of Veracruz, working the fields, often up to 70 hours a week.
Their long hours spent in the sun create an estimated economic impact of $4 billion in Louisiana annually from sugarcane alone, according to the American Sugar Cane League. Many return for rice and crawfish harvests, spending most of their year in the U.S., separated from their families back home.

The isolation can be challenging. The question “what do you do with your free time?” earns mostly blank stares. Still, they return, year after year, often bringing brothers, cousins, nephews with them.
Jesus Tamez, originally from Monterrey, has built a life in South Louisiana, sending his children to school in Lafayette, then off to college. But for most of the men he works with, there isn’t much but the fields.
“We don’t have much of a social life, just work,” he says. “There’s no weddings, no quinceañeras, not like in Mexico.”
Connecting with the locals can be tough, in part because of the language barrier.
“People here are more closed off,” says Javier Aguilera Sanchez, a 29-year-old from Veracruz, a state famous for its colorful carnival celebration. In Louisiana, Aguilera Sanchez works the cane field to provide for his family and young daughter back home.
Their time in Louisiana is limited, a means to an end. Just like locals, they strive for the simple things: a truck, a house for their family, tuition for a good school to send their kids to.
They’ve become indispensable to the fields and crawfish ponds of Acadiana.
Without them, most local farmers acknowledge, there would be no planting, no harvest. Local workers are impossible to find, they say, even at the comparably high hourly pay ($15 in Louisiana) set by the migrant worker program — few locals apply, and those hired on have a habit of not showing up.
“The barrel is empty on people who want an opportunity to work on a farm,” says Chad Hanks, a local farmer and vocal supporter of the visa program for seasonal agricultural workers. “It’s vital to the survival of not only Louisiana sugar, but practically all of agriculture around the United States,” he adds.

Despite rising costs in transportation and lodging, which farmers are required to pay for workers in the visa program, along with a mandatory hourly pay far above minimum wage, they’re in high demand. Between 2017 and 2022, the number of H-2A workers nationwide grew nearly 65%, according to the American Immigration Council.
Ahead of this year’s various harvest and planting seasons, agricultural employers in Louisiana filed over 1,300 requests for participation in the program, based on quarterly reports by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification, resulting in over 6,000 workers being certified.
Hanks knows that the men laying down cane stalks in his fields on that August day make sacrifices to be there, as do their families, so he makes every effort to make it worth their while by giving them as many hours as possible, and getting them out of the field before the afternoon heat really hits.
“I feel equally indebted to each one of them,” he says. “It warms my heart to know that their families are well taken care of, even as they have to live with Dad being away and over here for that time.”

Marsha Blackburn will back efforts to provide SNAP funds during a government shutdown, although she blames the shutdown on Democrats. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Amid bickering about funding the nation’s food program for the poor in a government shutdown, U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn said Monday she is backing legislation to keep it from lapsing, according to news reports.
Blackburn joined Republicans in signing the Keep SNAP Funded Act to make sure it continues without interruption as the federal government shutdown drags into November, WSMV reported.
Funding the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) would make sure 1 in 10 Tennessee residents who depend on the program continue to receive benefits, Blackburn said. She blamed Senate Democrats for “holding government funding hostage to appease their far-left base,” according to the report.
Blackburn, a Tennessee gubernatorial candidate, made the announcement Monday with some 690,000 state residents on the brink of losing food assistance next month as the one of the longest federal government shutdowns in the nation’s history continues.
Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee declined to act last week, saying the state isn’t capable of uploading funds to SNAP recipients’ cards. 
Nearly 1 in 10 Tennesseans could lose SNAP benefits come November if government shutdown continues

House Democrats reacted late last week by urging him to call a special session to fund the food program for the poor, disabled and elderly. They increased their criticism Monday by pointing out Republican governors in Virginia and Louisiana declared emergency orders in their states to approve food assistance for children and elderly and disabled adults.
Likewise, U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen, a Memphis Democrat, sent a letter to Gov. Lee requesting he take action to avert a lapse of the food program.
The government shutdown has turned into a war of words between the two political parties since Democrats held up a vote in the Senate in an effort to persuade Congress to turn back cuts to Medicaid and subsidies for the Affordable Care Act as part of President Donald Trump’s “Great Big Beautiful Bill.”
Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson told colleagues recently to prepare for an onslaught of calls about SNAP and other services that could be affected by the federal shutdown. He predicted hundreds of state employees paid through federal funds will be furloughed if it continues into November.
Johnson, a Franklin Republican, said his caucus members should make sure constituents know “this is a Schumer shutdown,” referring to Sen. Chuck Schumer, leader of U.S. Senate Democrats.

Mike Johnson, R-Pineville, to the right, as he enters the Louisiana House of Representatives on the opening day of a legislative special session, Wednesday, Nov. 6, 2024, at the Louisiana State Capitol in Baton Rouge.(Hilary Scheinuk/The Advocate, Pool)In a place known globally for its culinary culture, it is absolutely heartbreaking that Louisiana finds itself facing a hunger crisis. What’s more disappointing is that our state leader’s response has been to score political points at the expense of the working poor. 
Republican Gov. Jeff Landry declared a state emergency Friday for what he’s calling the “Schumer Shutdown,” placing the label of blame on the U.S. Senate’s Democratic party leader despite the GOP holding the majority in both chambers of Congress.  
Landry’s declaration allows the Louisiana Legislature to pull together money to cover the pending loss of federal food assistance in November. But rather than address everyone in need, the governor went further in his emergency declaration to state it would focus on the “elderly, disabled and children” in the Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program.  
“I encourage our citizens to seek the thousands of new job opportunities across our State, and free themselves from these social programs that the Left uses as a weaponization tool to win political points,” Landry said in a statement accompanying his order.
To stand behind his statement, the governor must willingly ignore the significant portion of Louisiana residents among the working poor in a state with the nation’s highest poverty rate at 18.9%. 
As of 2024, the U.S. Department of Agriculture reported 18.4% of Louisiana residents relied on SNAP benefits. The Landry administration puts the number at 17%, or roughly 793,000 residents.
The federal government doesn’t report how many people with jobs rely on federal food aid by state, but its 2023 data found 28% of SNAP recipients nationwide had earned income. That would indicate a significant number who are working but still need the assistance. 
These figures don’t include federal employees and contract workers furloughed during the government shutdown who are increasingly turning to food banks.
In response to the governor’s declaration, Republican leaders in the legislature recognized a broader need. They advanced a resolution Friday that will direct $150 million in state health department funds a month to cover the cost of SNAP as long as needed. Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, and House Speaker Phillip DeVillier, R-New Iberia, have coauthored the measure.
State Rep. Jack McFarland, R-Jonesboro, heads the legislative committee where the annual state budget originates, giving him perhaps the best perspective into how Louisiana government spends its money. Before asking his House colleague to back the resolution, he told them it was “imperative that today we … take necessary actions to do our jobs, to make sure we take care of them, the most vulnerable of our population.”
The resolution was approved in a 97-0 vote in the House of Representatives, and it will take its next procedural step Wednesday in the state Senate.
Still, the legislative vote is by no means a secure solution. Henry said it’s not clear yet where the SNAP money will come from in the health department budget. Plus, the Trump administration made clear Friday it’s not likely to reimburse states that use their own money to cover federal food assistance during the shutdown.  
Yet Louisiana lawmakers appeared to set party politics aside to reach a solution. They will tap into a state reserve account, the Revenue Stabilization Trust Fund, to cover money the health department spends on SNAP in November and to pay for any future benefits if the federal shutdown continues. There’s more than $2.7 billion currently in the fund.
“It’s a choice between using money that we have or people going hungry,” Henry told the Illuminator. “That’s why we have the fund balances that we have.” 
Lawmakers are currently in a special session on elections, but the governor’s declaration allows them to address the SNAP emergency. Landry specifically mentioned the use of the Revenue Stabilization Trust Fund in his order.
If more state money is needed to cover SNAP in months to come, legislators will have to vote remotely to approve these withdrawals. That process could last days, meaning the balloting process will have to be proactive to avoid a lapse in benefits.
It could also depend on Landry extending the state of emergency, which is currently set to lapse Nov. 4. Its duration covers the first of the month, when SNAP benefits are typically issued for the elderly, disabled and children ahead of other recipients – like the working poor.
While there’s some comfort in knowing state legislators are preparing for a worst-case scenario, it’s troublesome that our governor is putting terms on that assistance – get a job or go hungry.
It seems to be lost on Landry that in Louisiana, you can do both.

(Photo courtesy of ACLU of Idaho)A community’s first responsibility is to keep its children safe. Every young person deserves the chance to learn, to play, and to trust that the adults around them are looking out for their wellbeing. When that promise is broken, the consequences echo far beyond childhood. Trauma caused by abuse, instability, and violence can alter a young person’s development and health for decades to come. And yet, time and again, children are put in harm’s way by the very people and systems that are supposed to protect them. 
Those consequences aren’t hypothetical. Last week in the small farming town of Wilder, a government raid showed a shocking disregard for the safety of everyone present, especially the children. Witnesses report agents zip-tied young people and adults. Children watched their parents taken away without explanation. Families were separated in a matter of minutes. What should have been an ordinary afternoon is now a traumatic memory many will carry for the rest of their lives. 
FBI backtracks on denying children were zip tied in Idaho raid, saying instead no ‘young’ kids were

Despite only a handful of arrests, more than 100 people were swept into detention centers across the region. Behind each number is a family left wondering when — or if — they will be reunited. Will they ever feel safe in their own community again? 
We are also left with important and urgent questions: Who counts as part of our community? Which families deserve safety? How wide is our circle of care? 
Our leaders often speak about “family values” as core to who we are as Idahoans. But values mean little if they only apply to some families. When we say we care for children, that cannot depend on what they look like, which languages they speak, or where they were born. True family values require caring for each other without conditions. 
Thankfully, many Idahoans are living those values. Neighbors, educators, and faith communities are stepping in to support the children who have been affected. Their care shows the kind of community most Idahoans want: one grounded in dignity, not fear. 
The harm in Wilder was avoidable. There are better, more humane ways to enforce the law. Agencies can use strategies that respect due process, community safety, and the wellbeing of young people. When enforcement relies on militarized tactics instead of measured communication and coordination, trust erodes in the very institutions meant to protect us. Children end up paying the highest cost for decisions they had no part in. 
We can turn away, insisting this is not our issue, not our family, not our children. Or we can widen the circle of who we care for and show up for one another. We have a choice. The kind of Idaho we build will be defined by how we respond now. 
Will we let fear decide for us, or will we lead with dignity, courage, and care for every person who calls this place home?

(Photo by Sharon Sullivan/Colorado Newsline)On a crisp, sunny mid-October day, Horst Caspari, Colorado’s state viticulturist, oversaw solar installers as they placed panels above his vineyard in Grand Junction. Caspari expects the agrivoltaic system to enhance and protect his quarter-acre research plot of Chardonnay grapes while also producing electricity for the Colorado State University Western Campus, site of the vineyard. 
Agrivoltaics, also known as dual-use solar, or co-location, refers to agricultural production — including crops, livestock grazing or pollinator habitat — that occurs underneath or adjacent to solar panels. While the vast majority of agrivoltaic projects in the United States are for grazing or pollinator habitat purposes, Caspari intends to show how placing solar panels above crops benefits growers.
​His vineyard will join more than 20 other projects that are demonstrating the advantages and tradeoffs of agrivoltaics in Colorado, where state government has invested in expansion of the practice and some farmers have proved to be eager adopters.
“Colorado is a hot spot for agrivoltaics, thanks to our innovative farmers and our frequent sunshine,” said Kristen Boysen, managing director of the Colorado Department of Agriculture’s Drought and Climate Resilience Office.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
While agrivoltaic projects involving vineyards are more common in Europe, Caspari said his is the first of its kind and size in the United States. A map from a National Renewable Energy Laboratory-supported data resource shows agrivoltaic projects nationwide — none includes a vineyard with panels placed above its grapes. 
In Longmont, approximately 7,000 people have visited the nonprofit Colorado Agrivoltaic Learning Center, located at Jack’s Solar Garden — the largest commercially active agrivoltaic system in the United States researching growth of crops and other vegetation under photovoltaic solar panels. Jack’s Solar Garden owner and manager Byron Kominek said thousands more have learned about agrivoltaics through the center’s outreach efforts. 
During the installation at the CSU Western Campus, workers stood atop two aerial lifts as they placed 7-foot-long solar panels on top of a 14-foot tall steel structure. The project’s 240 solar panels, which can rotate to track the sun from east to west, will produce approximately 155 megawatt-hours of energy a year — about 40% of the energy used by the Western Campus.
Caspari intends to demonstrate how agrivoltaics can help mitigate the effects of drought, increasing temperatures, and devastating weather events — like the hailstorm that occurred June 6, in Grand Junction.
“We had two years back-to-back hail, which is unusual,” Caspari said. “Heating up the atmosphere releases more energy, creating heavier rainfalls, more extreme weather. This year was catastrophic — we lost the crop completely — peaches, apples, cherries, vegetables, grapes. Everything grown here is gone. Some fruit survived but was dinged up and not marketable.” 
The research center at the CSU Western Campus lost 50% of its apples to sunburn a few years ago, he said.

The new solar panels will protect crops from future hail damage, as well as provide intermittent shade that will cool crops and prevent sunburn, Caspari said. Shaded plants also use less water, a significant factor in an arid climate, he added. 
Caspari also expects the panels will prevent frost damage, a major reason for crop failure. An inversion frost — where there’s little or no wind — causes cold air to settle near the ground as warm air rises. Wind machines tap into that warmer air and push it back to the ground to replace the cold air. Solar panels trap heat underneath when nighttime temperatures drop.
“A few degrees Fahrenheit can make the difference between a full crop or no crop,” Caspari said.
‘We can do both’
In nearby Palisade, Talbott Farms plans to install agrivoltaics above about an acre of its peach trees later this fall. 
“When we have cold nights, the panels will reflect the heat back into the orchard. That’s significant,” said Charlie Talbott, a partner at Talbott Farms. “We blow warm air from above into our orchard — with wind machines. (The solar panels) would accomplish that same thing.”
Talbott’s solar panels will produce 750,000 kWh of energy, which will provide all the electricity needed to power the family farm’s packing and processing facility, and cold storage areas.

Large solar arrays spread out over good agricultural land has led to land-use conflicts. Agrivoltaics reduces that tension because both uses — agricultural and energy production — occur on the same site, while providing added benefits for ag producers.
“We can do both — install solar panels to create energy, and protect crops and land at the same time,” Caspari said.
Talbott’s goal “is to create an environment of symbiosis — food production while creating energy,” he said. “We can do all of our farming uninterrupted below the panels. I think it’s going to be interesting. It should produce all the energy we need.” 
Harvesting crops underneath solar panels also potentially protects farmworkers. According to preliminary data from the University of Arizona, “skin temperature can be about 18 degrees Fahrenheit cooler when working in an agrivoltaics area than in traditional agriculture.” 
Both Caspari and Talbott are working with CSU to provide research data. 
State support
Caspari spent years raising the $450,000 needed for his vineyard/agrivoltaics research project — funds that came from multiple sources, including a U.S. Department of Agriculture Specialty Crops Block Grant, administered by the Colorado Department of Agriculture; a CDA Agrivoltaics Research and Demonstration Grant; Western Colorado Community Foundation; private donors; CSU’s renewable energy program; and the AES Corporation. 
One of the things that Caspari and his staff will be studying is the soil compaction caused by heavy equipment used during the solar installation process. Ideally, an agrivoltaics system would be installed prior to planting a vineyard, he said.
“Soil compaction in-between the rows can impact water, nutrients, and air infiltration which can also affect crop production, which is one of agrivoltaics’ greatest hurdles,” said Analissa Sarno, a postdoctoral scientist at the research station focusing on soil. 
To help fund his approximately $1.5 million project, Talbott was awarded a more than $700,000 grant from the USDA’s Rural Energy for America Program, or REAP, and has also received federal and other tax credits. He said he expects to recoup his investment by year three.
In August, the Trump administration cut federal funding, including for the REAP program, restricting future solar projects on farms.
However, the Colorado Department of Agriculture offers an annual Agrivoltaics Research and Demonstration Grant to fund all types of agrivoltaic projects, said Boysen, of the CDA.
“Colorado is still committed to renewable energy, and there are other programs that fund renewable energy and agriculture,” Boysen said. “While (agrivoltaics) won’t work in every scenario, it is a good option for many.”
Co-locating solar with agricultural production helps farmers withstand the pressure to sell their land to housing and energy developers, she said. 
“We, at the Colorado Department of Agriculture, believe agrivoltaics is a great idea,” Boysen said. “It creates multiple benefits with one parcel of land. It helps keep farmers farming.”
The CSU Western Colorado Research Center is offering a tour of its new agrivoltaics project Friday, Nov. 14 from 12:30 p.m. to 3 p.m., at 3170 B-1/2 Road in Grand Junction.

,Mississippi Today,2025-10-28 10:00:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,MDE changes licensure requirements for prospective special education teachers and elementary school teachers,Leonardo Bevilacqua,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/10/28/mde-changes-licensure-requirements-for-prospective-special-education-teachers-and-elementary-school-teachers/,New pathways to become certified elementary educators and special educators became effective Monday.,"The Mississippi Department of Education has announced new pathways to become certified elementary educators and special educators. The change became effective Monday.
Education students can start teaching elementary school classes on a provisional license while taking a new free course to satisfy the Foundation of Reading test requirements. Students must post an 80% upon course completion, by excelling in end-of-section quizzes and pre- and post- “inventories of knowledge” that measure progress.
The Omaha-based AIM institute designed the new academic year-long course, which consists of 14 asynchronous learning sections, two in-person training sessions and testing.
In-person sessions will be held in Jackson, Hattiesburg, Oxford, Meridian, Cleveland, Tylertown, Holly Springs, Hernando, New Albany, Brandon, Carthage, Greenwood, Ridgeland, Columbus, Brookhaven, Gulfport, Ocean Springs, Pascagoula and Moss Point.
MDE also got rid of the reading test requirement for would-be special educators teaching “mild to moderate students,” a term for special education students housed in general education classrooms.
The changes were implemented partly in response to the results of a 2024-2025 educator survey, which identified a need for MDE to review its existing licensure guidelines for elementary education and special education.
“The Office of Teaching and Leading is hopeful the revised Foundations of Reading requirements will strengthen Mississippi’s educator workforce,” MDE Office of Educator Continuum Executive Director Courtney Van Cleve said. It will allow for more “more Elementary Education and Special Education candidates to become licensed.”
Adrienne Hudson, who runs a nonprofit that helps teachers with certification, will now be able to move at least 10 teachers in her latest cohort to a traditional license.
“In an area where the critical teacher shortage is so prevalent, what seems like a simple change will have a drastically positive impact on the students we serve,” she said.
Five of her 10 teachers struggling with licensure were special educators on provisional licenses. She has seen a decrease in prospective educators seeking special education endorsements since MDE first introduced the Foundations of Reading requirement in January 2023.
“Typically, our teachers have a special education test after five sessions with no problem,” she added.
Most of the certified teaching jobs posted to MDE’s career portal were for Special education teachers and elementary teachers.
More tests are required for elementary educators than most other specializations. The primary elementary education licensure test has the lowest pass rate of any other subject test. Nearly a quarter of 2015 to 2018 test takers walked away after failing on the first try. (This is the most recent data available as a result of pandemic-era restrictions.)
Hannah Putnam, managing director of the National Council on Teacher Quality, told Mississippi Today that the Mississippi elementary education subject test wasn’t a good measure of teacher promise. Even a fifth-grade English teacher would have to take a test that covers kindergarten through sixth grade instruction as well as science, math, art, English, and social studies, among other subjects.
“Passionate, qualified educators should have multiple opportunities to teach, lead and make a difference in our classrooms,” said Clayton Barksdale, a former Delta educator who is currently running for state Senate on a platform that includes offering more pathways to teacher licensure. 
He still remembers the mad dash each summer to fill those jobs when he was a principal.
“We must do better,” he told Mississippi Today. “Many prove their impact while on emergency licenses, only to be fired then immediately rehired as a long-term substitute – doing the same work for a fraction of the pay, with no benefits or retirement.”
Student teacher Jennifer Allen was thinking of spending $1,200 on additional coursework so she wouldn’t have to rely on the reading exam for licensure. She now plans on taking MDE’s newly offered course.
She and five other teachers interviewed expressed that university education programs did not adequately prepare them for the material on the PRAXIS exams, including Foundations of Reading. 
With the new course, Allen can start teaching on a provisional license while she works towards a traditional license without penalty to the school.
She feels relieved.
“Knowing that there’s a new pathway designed to help me improve and finally reach my goal of becoming a teacher will boost my confidence, reminding me why I wanted to become a teacher in the first place.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/18114610/3X0A8609.jpg,,,2025-10-28 06:17:06.164116

(Photo: Getty Images) Maury County is installing its first tornado sirens following public demand after an EF-3 tornado destroyed multiple homes and killed one person in the city of Columbia in May 2024.
The mostly rural Middle Tennessee county broke ground on its first tornado siren on Oct. 21, according to Maury County Mayor Sheila Butt.
County commissioners charged Maury County Office of Emergency Management Director Jeff Hardy with crafting a plan to install the sirens, something Hardy said was challenging due to the area’s rural nature.
“Our county is 620 square miles, and the vast majority of it is pretty rural areas, so there’s not really a good system for warning people outside of NOAA weather radios and weather apps on their phones,” Hardy told The Tennessee Lookout.
The county partnered with the City of Columbia and the City of Mt. Pleasant and agreed to install 20 total sirens in outdoor areas where people gather most.
Maury County purchased seven of the sirens for about $315,000 and will install them at Maury County Park, Chickasaw Park, Yanahli Park, Mt. Pleasant Schools, Hampshire Unit School, Culleoka Unit School and Santa Fe Unit School.
“We have a lot of outdoor gatherings, a lot of festivals, people that are gathering at our parks and those areas, and we wanted to give those people as much advance warning as possible,” Hardy said.
The unit schools are K-12 schools that serve smaller, tight-knit communities that live near the school buildings, according to Hardy.
Columbia will install 12 sirens, and Mt. Pleasant will install one. The sirens are expected to be in place by the end of November, weather permitting.

Cost and logistics proved to be hurdles for the project until recently, Hardy said. The county has grown significantly in the past decade, attracting people from other areas of the country who may not be familiar with Middle Tennessee weather patterns and hazards. 
“As our demographics have changed, we’ve kind of had to readjust our warning systems and thought processes — how do we communicate that to our citizens, warning them without scaring them?” he said.
The sirens are connected to the National Weather Service and will sound automatically during tornado warnings and warnings for other life-threatening events, like flash floods, Hardy said. The county is also able to manually sound the sirens should local officials observe threats not apparent to the National Weather Service. 
They will not sound for tornado watches or watches issued for other severe weather. The National Weather Service issues warnings when hazardous weather conditions are occurring or imminent. A watch means that the “ingredients” for a severe weather event are present and an event is possible, but location and timing are not certain, according to the service’s website.
Tornadoes have become more common in Tennessee in the last few decades. 
Twenty-one tornadoes have touched down in Maury County since 1950, according to data collected by the National Weather Service. Middle Tennessee recorded an average of 16 tornadoes per year from 1995 through 2025, up from an average of five tornadoes per year from 1950 through 1994, data shows.
While the effectiveness of outdoor tornado sirens has been scrutinized in recent years — the sirens often cannot be heard indoors and have limited sound range — a case study published by the Federal Emergency Management Agency highlighted the advantages of having warning sirens in place in rural Marshall County, Alabama when a tornado hit in April 2011.
Hardy said while the sirens will add to the county’s overall preparedness for severe weather, they are only meant to warn people who are outdoors, and may not be audible for residents inside their homes or other buildings.
“We still encourage people to have a NOAA weather radio in their home, to have an app or two or three on their smart device, so that whether they’re at home, they’re on the go, they’re at work, that they get adequate warning and pay attention to those warnings,” Hardy said.
He also encourages Maury County residents to make a household plan for seeking shelter during a severe weather event.

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Orimartin Lima’s graduation from a weeklong offshore wind safety training program last Friday was bittersweet.
The completion of the global certification through the Community College of Rhode Island was supposed to lead directly to a union job with the Revolution Wind project.  But instead of shipping out to sea to climb towering turbines in  Rhode Island Sound, Lima is stuck on land, watching his job, and his plan, slip away.
“I had goals, buying a house, all this other stuff that came to a halt,” Lima, 34, of Pawtucket, said in a recent interview. “Now I have all this time, so I really have been thinking too much. I [am] in my head a lot.” 
The federal administration abruptly ordered work to stop on the 700-megawatt project in August under the guise of national security concerns. In response to a lawsuit filed by the project developers, a federal judge in D.C. issued a preliminary injunction in late September, letting work resume on the project that was already 80% complete. A separate lawsuit filed by attorneys general in Rhode Island and Connecticut remains under review in federal court in Rhode Island.
Local ports in Providence and New London, Connecticut, hum with activity as specialty vessels carrying workers and skyscraper-sized equipment travel out to sea. The project still appears poised to meet its mid-2026 operational deadline of supplying 700 megawatts of nameplate capacity — enough to power 350,000 homes — to Rhode Island and Connecticut.
But the monthlong pause left two dozen union painters and tradespeople, including Lima, out of the work and paychecks they were relying on for the next several months.
Meaghan Wims, a spokesperson for Orsted, the Danish co-developer of the project, confirmed in an email that painting work was rescheduled to next year to focus on more “time-sensitive tasks” while weather remained favorable and vessels available.
“Logistical planning for any large construction project is a dynamic process,” Wims said in her response. She did not comment specifically on the layoffs, but pointed to the work created through the project’s preparation and construction: more than 1,900 union jobs, with 4 million work-hours to date. 
Orsted has also invested millions of dollars into ports and piers in Providence and Quonset, including a $100 million wind manufacturing hub at ProvPort intended to buoy offshore wind projects across the region. The company funded the global wind training course through CCRI that Lima just completed, with a $500,000 grant to cover the $2,500 per-person costs for the first group of trainees.
Little comfort to Justin Kelley, business manager for the local chapter of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades. Less than 24 hours after the D.C. judge’s order letting work resume, he had to deliver the news to his members that they were out of work.
A ‘house of cards’ collapsed 
“We were gearing up to have people working all over, on the monopiles, the substations, overlapping crews here and in New York,” Kelley said in a recent interview. “That all fell in like a house of cards. Now, we have guys out of work, members who are angry because they desperately wanted to work on this project.”
He continued, “What do I tell them now?”
Other work that was available to local trade workers is now reaching its seasonal conclusion.
“You have to have atmospheric conditions to paint steel,” Kelley said.

Even before the cold set in, many of the major road and infrastructure projects that hire painters’ union members had been paused or canceled because of rescinded federal funding.
Despite President Donald Trump’s anti-wind directives, which had already halted reviews on other projects still awaiting federal permits, officials and industry experts initially considered Revolution Wind safe from political volatility. Project developers secured the final federal approval in November 2023. 
For local union laborers, the project’s multiyear construction offered a steady source of income without having to scramble to find a new project every month or two.
“Construction workers are the [original] gig workers,” said Patrick Crowley, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO. “They are constantly trying to line up work so that as soon as they end one job, they can start the next.”
Nick Reynolds, a member of the local painters union, started working on project components in ProvPort in October 2022, repainting pieces of the 40-foot-tall internal  platforms damaged in transport from their Polish manufacturing site. He enjoyed the work, relishing the opportunity to be part of a new industry and the prospect of future gigs on other regional offshore wind projects.
Reynolds is still working in ProvPort, but his enthusiasm has soured in the aftermath of the stop-work order.
“I was under the impression that once all the permitting and financial process was done, there was no legal way to stop the work,” Reynolds, 35, of Providence said. “If it can be done here, it can be done anywhere.”
Jobs in jeopardy 
Reynolds and his fellow union members were expecting years of good paying, steady work as more offshore wind projects begin construction. Many of those projects are now in jeopardy, with federal permits revoked,  contract negotiations delayed and financing questionable.
“I can’t imagine investors are going to jump at the opportunity to spend money in a place where the projects have uncertainty attached to them,” Reynolds said.
Orsted has already reported hundreds of billions of dollars in financial impairments amid rising costs for its East Coast wind projects, including the $5 billion Revolution Wind project. Earlier this month, the company announced it will layoff 25% of its 8,000 person global workforce by the end of 2027 to shore up its balance sheet as it prepares to take on new offshore wind projects, with an eye toward Europe and the Asia-Pacific area. 
Wims declined to comment on the potential for layoffs in the region. 
Shutdown means no money for Justice Department to file court documents, lawyers contend

Anticipatory anxiety is setting in for local laborers. 
“People are rethinking this entire thing,” Kelley said. “They don’t want to spend hours training for a job that might not exist.”
Lima learned his job had fallen through months after signing up for a five-day safety training at CCRI to hone his abilities working at heights, sea survival and other necessary skills. The training had already been paid for so he completed it, but without much passion.
“I feel like I am spending all this time for no reason,” Lima said.
He said he could have spent that time looking for another job, or even taking some side work to help pay his bills. He already received the maximum amount of state unemployment benefits allowed for the year.
“I have money saved, but I am burning through that fast,” he said.
Lima offers a compelling example of why Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha continues to argue for a separate court order on the project in Rhode Island federal court. 
“This is the problem with halting a project out of the blue,” Neronha said in a recent interview. “The people who lose, many times, include the everyday Rhode Islanders who are working on these projects.”
Legal matters 
Neronha and Connecticut Attorney General William Tong continue to push for a preliminary injunction against the federal administration, protecting the Revolution Wind project from impeding their states’ environmental and economic interests.
The U.S. Department of Justice attorneys representing the administration have rebutted the AG’s request as unnecessary, given the ruling in the D.C. case more than a month ago, according to court filings. Justice Department attorneys also sought to consolidate the two cases into one in D.C.










This is the problem with halting a project out of the blue. The people who lose, many times, include the everyday Rhode Islanders who are working on these projects.


– Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha


Neronha is intent on keeping the states’ case in its home court, though.
“Our interests are different from Orsted,” Neronha said. “I want to make sure we are protecting the interests of Rhode Islanders, and of people in Connecticut.”
The dueling motions remain pending before U.S. District Court Judge Mary S. McElroy as of Monday. While the government shutdown has limited hours and operations in federal courts nationwide, including in Providence, the AGs Revolution Wind lawsuit remains on schedule, Neronha said.

Researchers from the University of Louisville, Yale University and Florida State University surveyed 99 birth providers in 38 Kentucky counties from Nov. 9, 2023 to May 31, 2024. They found that some providers who want to offer vaginal births after cesarean, or VBACs, reported that liability insurance is “punitive” and thus larger hospitals who can absorb costs associated with VBACs are more likely to offer them. They published their report this month.

Melissa Eggen, project researcher and an assistant professor at the University of Louisville School of Public Health and Information Sciences, said the provider support she uncovered for VBACs was “somewhat surprising because Kentucky has such a low rate.” 
In 2023, about 34% of all live births in Kentucky were via C-section, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, higher than the national rate of 32%. That was only a slight improvement from 2014, when the rate was 35% in Kentucky. 
The state has a high rate of repeat c-sections and a lower rate of VBACs than the national average. Kentucky VBACs were up to 12% in 2023, an increase from 9% in 2016, according to the new October report. Across the country, though, VBACs were around 15% of live births in 2023. 
Increasing patient access to vaginal birth after cesarean, the report says, is “an evidence-based strategy for decreasing overall cesarean delivery rates, decreasing maternal and infant morbidity and mortality, and improving patient satisfaction with their birth experience.” 
The benefits of vaginal delivery include not having major surgery, having lower risks of infection and serious blood loss, shorter hospital stay after birth, faster recovery and lower risk of the baby having breathing problems, according to the Mayo Clinic. Though rare, a risk of VBAC is uterine rupture, according to the Mayo Clinic.

One provider, quoted anonymously in the report, said: “We overuse interventions including cesareans in the USA and KY. VBAC accessibility is necessary to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality in KY.”
VBACs are more common in hospitals that have a higher volume of births, the report shows. In other words: urban facilities are more likely to have the necessary resources, especially 24-hour access to anesthesia in case an emergency C-section is required during the labor process. 
Some of this urban-rural divide can be traced to 1999 guidance from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), Eggen said. That guidance said that trial of labor after cesarean (called TOLAC) should happen at facilities that could, immediately if required, provide emergency care with anesthesiology and an operating room. 
“These guidelines resulted in steep decreases in the national VBAC rate, which disproportionately impacted smaller hospitals that did not have access to these resources,” the October report says.
The ACOG guidance was updated in 2017 but “the initial guidance continues to be implemented by many healthcare facilities across the country,” the report says. 
Many providers across the state expressed support for vaginal births after a C-section and said they need more training on providing VBACs and identifying candidates who could be successful in safely laboring and delivering vaginally. Providers who were surveyed also said midwives were the most likely to be supportive of VBACs and hospital administrators sometimes discouraged VBACS. (Screenshot)
One provider, quoted in the report, said “the greatest barrier” to providing VBACs “is lack of need/want to provide 24h anesthesia,” in case it is needed. Another provider said the lack of an in-house anesthesia provider also limited their facility even though “there are people who want to VBAC in our area.” 
“Administration wants to provide TOLAC, but the financial burden of in-house anesthesia and [operating room] teams makes this challenging,” another provider said.
One provider was more skeptical, saying that “TOLACs are a ton of work. The provider needs to be in-house for active labor. I work enough hours.”
Despite the low number of vaginal births among patients who have previously had cesarean sections, Kentucky providers generally support them but face barriers to providing that option. (Screenshot)
Still, many providers across the state who answered Eggen’s survey expressed support for vaginal births after a C-section and said they need more training on providing VBACs and identifying candidates who could be successful in safely laboring and delivering vaginally. Providers who were surveyed also said midwives were the most likely to be supportive of VBACs and hospital administrators sometimes discouraged VBACS. One provider said malpractice insurance would cost double if their facility offered VBACs. 
There are risks to VBACs as well as cesarean deliveries, Eggen said, but better training on identifying good candidates for VBACs is a place to start in increasing Kentucky’s rate.
“There are people who still believe that if they’ve had a cesarean, they have to have cesareans in the future,” Eggen said. “So I do think that there is a need for more awareness that VBAC is an option for some people.”

(Photo by Mike Sweeney/Special to Colorado Newsline)If you had a 50-year old truck that cost thousands to keep running, constantly broke down, and gave your kids asthma, would you keep it or buy a new vehicle that always ran and saved you money?
What if the government said you had to keep paying for the old truck because it was the only way to avoid a transportation emergency? Would you believe them?
That’s what’s could happen with Pueblo’s Comanche coal plant, which opened in 1973.
It’s Colorado’s largest source of greenhouse gas emissions and has been plagued by constant breakdowns and expensive maintenance — the plant’s newest generator was broken down two cumulative years between its construction in 2010 and 2022, and a catastrophic turbine failure kept it offline most of 2020. This all increased Comanche’s energy costs 45%.
And now Comanche is broken down again.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
A public records request published by journalist Allen Best unearthed news that the coal clunker went offline Aug. 12, and won’t be online until at least June 2026, while Xcel conducts an investigation into the “root cause” of the latest outage.
When it does run, Comanche belches millions of pounds of air pollution annually, making people sick — Pueblo has some of Colorado’s highest asthma rates — while its power is shipped to other Front Range communities.
Comanche’s remaining two coal-burning generators are scheduled to retire in 2025 and 2031 because Xcel Energy and Colorado’s utility regulators decided its age, significant unplanned closures, and health damage weren’t worth it.
Everyone involved, including Pueblo’s community leaders, agreed the best option was replacing Comanche with new generation sources — not burning fossil fuels.
But Pueblo’s coal-to-clean transition faces an unexpected problem that could hit Colorado within three months.
The U.S. Department of Energy declared an “energy emergency” overriding states and utilities that decided to close aging coal plants to protect families from soaring energy bills and dirty air. New administration announcements will throw $625 million in taxpayer money to subsidize those clunkers. “This administration’s policy is going to be to stop the closure of coal plants,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright.
Colorado could lose that state’s right as soon as January: Pueblo County recently indicated it wanted the Energy Department to force Xcel to keep Comanche 3 running past its planned retirement — even though it has been one of America’s least reliable plants.
It already happened in Michigan, where a coal plant was forced to stay open, even though Michigan’s top utility regulator said “there is no existing energy emergency.”
Forcing that Michigan coal plant to stay open added $29 million in net energy cost increases over five weeks to energy bills paid by families and businesses. Nationwide, forcing coal plants to stay online could cost $3-$6 billion annually, on top of $6 billion in extra costs consumers paid for coal power in 2024 due to inflation and rising fuel costs.
Colorado’s government, grid experts and Xcel Energy agree Comanche isn’t needed — closing it will cut costs and air pollution. Pueblo does need new tax revenue and jobs, but keeping Comanche online or tying Pueblo’s economic future to expensive, dirty energy forces Coloradans to pay more.
Clean, cheap energy that attracts new manufacturing to an “energy park” could generate $40 million in annual property tax revenue, cut Xcel customer bills, and create local jobs. Data shows bundling renewables plus batteries strengthens our grid and prevents blackouts.
At public hearings were held by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission to determine Comanche’s replacement, Puebloans touted the energy park’s potential to attract investment. No one said they wanted Xcel to change its mind and keep burning expensive, dirty coal.
Accelerating the coal-to-clean transition could snag big discounts from federal funds. That’s why the Polis administration ordered state agencies to cut red tape to build as much clean energy before the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s” regressive repeals spike clean energy project prices by 30%-50%.
Colorado’s statewide electricity prices rose 24% between 2021-2024 and could soar another 45% by 2030 as OBBBA’s repeals take hold. We simply can’t afford this fake “energy emergency,” especially if it means keeping such an expensive jalopy online.
We have legal recourse — if the Trump administration orders Comanche to stay open, Attorney General Phil Weiser could sue to stop the Energy Department’s decision, like Michigan did, and Colorado’s PUC or Xcel could petition against it.
We think Coloradans deserve the right to decide how we power our homes, protect our kids from dirty air, and insulate our families from surging energy bills.
Forcing Comanche to stay online takes away all those rights — it’s an idea that should never come to pass.

(Photo by Susan Walsh - Pool/Getty Images)A few days ago, Bobbie Coleman — the chairperson of the Hardin County Republican Party — shared an AI video on the county party’s Facebook page with former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama portrayed as grinning apes.
Coleman took the video down and eventually posted an apology, which began, “Earlier today, I shared a video from social media that was intended to celebrate President Trump’s successful policy achievements by depicting him as a Lion King, triumphing over liberal Democrats.” She closed with, “I believe the Republican Party is the vehicle to save our country from the far-left and I look forward to continuing to support our Republican candidates and Make America Great Again.”
The Obamas left the White House almost nine years ago. Other than being Black, what do they have to do with Trump’s alleged “policy achievements?” With making America great again? With supporting Republican candidates? With their obsession to “save our country from the far-left?”
What’s odd about today’s latent obsession with Barack and Michelle Obama is how little their obsession has to do with policy. If anything, Obama as president is viewed by those on the “far-left” (Coleman’s word choice in her apology) as someone who was not all that liberal, as someone who played it too careful and too close to the center. 
But realities like these do not matter in Trump’s Republican Party. 
Obama, almost a decade post-presidency, is not a cartoon figure for today’s Make America Great Again crowd because he is influencing policy. Obama is a MAGA cartoon figure because he is Black.
Racism sells.
At the end of Kentucky’s 2024 General Assembly, I wrote a recap of what I’d witnessed over the course of those many weeks titled, “Undercurrent of racism fueled this legislative session.” This is not a title a writer chooses without a pretty long list of strong, supporting evidence.
There was Senate Bill 6 and House Bill 9 that year which aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion — DEI — in our education system and would pass in the next session because, hey, who needs diversity?
There was Sen. Gerald Neal’s proposed Crown Act, a repeat bill that never gets anywhere, “which would have outlawed discrimination on the basis of a hairstyle historically associated with a person’s race.” 
There was Rep. Jennifer Decker (who is white) telling an NAACP audience that her white father was a slave and then doubling down on the claim when asked to explain.
There was Rep. Jason Nemes (who is white) ranting in anger at Rep. Derrick Graham (who is Black) for daring to tell the truth on the House floor about how the Jefferson Davis statue was “taken out for a reason,” the reason being that he led the Confederacy, which was built on the backs of slaves, and the insurrection that kicked off the Civil War.
And later in 2024, a bunch of white university presidents prostrated themselves before the interim education committee in our state Capitol, assuring them that they were not, no-way-no-how, teaching diversity of thought or helping people of color in their education systems, even as one brave Black woman sat right there in the front row wearing a bright red t-shirt that read in bold white letters, “Make America Not Racist for the First Time.”
Racism is not a side item in today’s Republican Party, with its masked ICE agents profiling brown people on the streets; it’s a main menu selling point. 
The president told a gaggle of reporters on Air Force One Monday that U.S. Rep. Jasmine Crockett is “a low-IQ person” which is the same derogatory statement he makes regularly about professional Black women, insisting they can’t be smart because they’re Black.
And speaking of women – because GOP misogyny runs in the same creek as their racism  – a 35 year-old Louisville Republican named Calvin Leach is currently running for state Senate after once writing in an online article in that young women are “promiscuous skanks,” “coddled americunts,” “party whores” and “damn sloots” (internet slang for slut). 
When asked about this in an interview with Kentucky Public Radio, Leach described his writing as dating advice, saying that diversity, equity and inclusion has gotten out of hand. 
It is notable that I also wrote  – during the same 2024 General Assembly that was fueled by racism – that our GOP supermajority is often nothing but a good old boy, misogynistic, frat-house-like romp masquerading as serious lawmaking. With Leach as a candidate, it appears they like it this way.
Apologies for the digression. There is so much rampant sexism and racism in the KY GOP, it’s hard to keep up.
If the Republican Party of Kentucky does not want to be viewed as racist — if they do not want their leaders out in the counties posting racist videos — they might start by not telling tall tales about how their white fathers were slaves, by passing bills *allowing* Black people to wear their natural hair at work, by not obsessing about how one whiff of diversity or Black history might dare appear on a college syllabus.
“Racism greeted Obama in both his primary and general election campaigns in 2008,” Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote in his book, “We Were Eight Years in Power.” “Photos were circulated of him in Somali garb. Rush Limbaugh dubbed him ‘Barack the Magic Negro.’” After “Obama won the presidency in defiance of these racial headwinds, traffic to the white-supremacist website Stormfront increased sixfold.”
We will soon approach two decades since Obama’s 2008 campaign, but overt racism is alive and well here in the commonwealth. Just last week the Frankfort Police Department advised the public that KKK propaganda was strewn around and that they were looking for ring-cam footage and any other evidence of the perpetrators. 
I watched and rewatched the video posted on social media by the GOP chairperson in Hardin County, opening as it does with Barack and Michelle Obama portrayed as grinning apes, and I was not surprised.
I read and reread the article about KY GOP candidate Calvin Leach and his use of “promiscuous skanks”and worse to describe women, and I was not surprised.

All children in Colorado will become educated and productive citizens.
— Vision statement of the Colorado State Board of Education
 

In September, the Trump administration announced it will move direct management of career-technical education programs from the U.S. Department of Education to the Department of Labor.
This should be a wake-up call to advocates of “workplace learning” for high school students.
This switch is part of this administration’s dismantling of the Department of Education. Given the support for CTE programs from Colorado’s governor, commissioner of education, and the business community, let’s consider the potential impact of this specific change.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
We can imagine the Department of Labor will pay little heed to the “education” component of workplace learning. Under the Department of Education, programs needed to at least appear to be about something more than “practical work experience.” With the Department of Labor, no need to pretend.
This change is part of a larger pattern. Since Jan. 20, we have seen this administration curtail support for:

students who need additional academic support
future teachers
minority-serving institutions of higher education 

Trump’s secretary of Education claims her department is “unnecessary.” In this case, it’s not just the department; one wonders if K-12 education even matters.
Note where education will see more funds. The so-called One Big Beautiful Bill “will extend Pell Grant eligibility to some short-term, workforce-aligned education and training programs,” according to the University Professional and Continuing Education Association.
CTE’s move out of the Education Department must be seen in this larger context. Chalkbeat’s headline on the change posed a question: “Trump gave the Labor Department more control over career-technical education. Will students benefit?”


We must hold true to the mission of public education, which is about more than “upskilling” future workers. Our goal is to educate future citizens.


Students? Why should students matter to the Department of Labor? Its focus is future workers. Productive employees. The labor force.
Chalkbeat wrote: “the Labor Department will integrate education and job training programs ‘with an employment first perspective, which places employers at the forefront of workforce development programs.’”
I have criticized advocates of “work-based learning” when they suggest the chief purpose is “to fill those high-demand jobs” that bring “ROI to businesses.” And when we hear short-term thinking — let’s be sure our students have the job skills to graduate from high school and enter the workforce right away.
This is at odds with the goals of a good education.
Done well, a K-12 public education provides a sound foundation that will help graduates make the most of their potential – throughout their lives. They will gain the essential skills and knowledge — in our state, articulated in the Colorado Academic Standards — enabling them to learn, adapt, and grow in a wide range of jobs they pursue.
Last spring, Susana Córdova, Colorado’s commissioner of education,  praised a program in a rural (four-day week) district: A senior first obtained his commercial driver’s license certificate; then he had an internship, trucking corn to the local ethanol plant — before coming to school at 11:30 and taking three academic classes. His principal told me that Colorado’s Innovative Learning Opportunities Pilot Program provides more flexibility on assessing “seat time.” (Only 12 academic classes in a week? As a senior?)
This young man knew the work he would be doing upon graduation: driving that truck.
With little E in CTE, I do not see how such programs offer students a sound high school education. Overseen by the Department of Labor, I suppose that won’t matter.
The writer Marilynn Robinson observes, “We have been told again and again that our educators are not preparing American youth to be efficient workers. Workers. That language is so common among us now that an extraterrestrial might think we had actually lost the Cold War.”
If we truly want “educated and productive citizens,” we often need more time, not less, to ensure our 16-to-18-year-olds receive a solid education. Expose them to careers? Sure. But to become effective citizens — especially in times like these — first they need those essential skills and knowledge.
How else will our students become critical thinkers able to keep our democracy alive?
How else will they know to question Big Brother when he does not speak the truth?
So, yes, I hope CTE programs maintain their education focus. But this is just part of a broader concern.
We must hold true to the mission of public education, which is about more than “upskilling” future workers. Our goal is to educate future citizens.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia is barreling toward a Nov. 4 general election in which voters will choose a new governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general while also deciding all 100 seats in the House of Delegates. 
In cooperation with Keep Our Republic — a civic-education group founded in 2020 as part of a push to counter efforts to undermine confidence in the presidential election — The Mercury spoke with four local officials about what they do to keep voting both secure and accessible: Norfolk Director of Elections and General Registrar Stephanie Iles, Henrico County General Registrar Mark Coakley, Richmond General Registrar David Levine and Virginia Beach Director of Elections Christine Lewis.
What follows is a look at the mechanics of election protection in their offices — in plain terms, and in their own words.
 Locking down machines

The backbone of Virginia’s voting system remains paper ballots read by optical scanners — a design choice that reduces the risk of remote intrusion and leaves a hand-countable record. The state Department of Elections says it works with the Department of Homeland Security and the Virginia Information Technologies Agency (VITA) to monitor and harden systems.
“We never, ever hook our voting machines to the internet,” Iles, Norfolk’s director of elections, said. 
“We have secure locations. We have cameras, we have security systems, we always do things in pairs. We do logic and accuracy testing of every piece of voting equipment, and we do post-election audit testing of every piece of equipment.”
Coakley, Henrico County’s general registrar who has watched technology cycles come and go, noted that Virginia’s return to paper is the point. 
“Most people used lever machines or punch cards, then touchscreens, and then we went back to paper,” he said. “You cannot hack paper with optical-scan ballots.”
Levine, general registrar for the city of Richmond, added that for those worried about files created on computers that might ever touch the internet, the system’s layers matter more than any single step.
 “Having paper ballots, strong chain-of-custody protocols and rigorous post-election audits … are additional layers” that mitigate risk, he said. 
Several Virginia localities have also hosted public “how it works” tours and demonstrations of machine testing to blunt misinformation about hacking and tabulators.

 Watching for fraud

Asked what safeguards exist to detect and prevent voter fraud — and how often they see it — Coakley pointed first to the human presence surrounding the process.
“(Political) parties do a really good job with their poll watchers,” he said. “They observe logic and accuracy testing before the election. Then during the 45 days of early voting, they can come in and watch as one voter at a time checks in, gets a personalized ballot, puts it through the machine and leaves. They can report back to their parties that things are going smoothly — or where more help is needed for a disabled voter.”
Virginia officials have said for years that proven cases of voter fraud are rare; their larger concern is the corrosive effect of false claims on public trust.
 Chain of custody, end to end

Lewis, the director of elections in Virginia Beach, said that her office locks down ballots throughout early voting. 
“Every day the ballots are stored in our DS300 tabulators. Once it gets to a certain amount, two officers of election put the ballots into a box, they seal the box, everyone signs, and it goes into our secure vault,” she said. “Only certain people have access, and you have to use your badge to get into it.”
Norfolk runs a similar daily sweep, Iles said, and then hands off everything to a neutral custodian: the circuit court clerk. 
“On election evening, all of our ballots come back from each precinct, and they are put directly into the custody of our circuit court clerk. We do not access or touch those ballots unless there is a recount or contest. There’s always a chain of custody,” she said. 
Precinct chiefs also reconcile how many ballots were issued, voted and left unvoted at close of polls before sealing and returning all materials.
 Coordination with state and federal partners

The officials described coordination that ranges from long-planned exercises to race-day troubleshooting.
“For federal elections, we have FBI agents assigned to assist us,” Iles said. “We have our local police, Virginia State Police, the Fusion Center, VITA, the Department of Elections and the State Board of Elections, plus our locality’s emergency operations center.” 
Coakley said Henrico runs tabletop drills with local police, the fire department, public works and Dominion Energy to prepare for outages or disruptions and to make sure “everyone has everyone’s cell numbers” in a crisis.
The Virginia Department of Elections notes that its cyber posture is supported by DHS and VITA, and that Virginia systems are monitored and audited to state and Center for Internet Security standards.
 Access for every voter

Virginia law requires accommodations such as curbside voting for voters 65 and older or those with disabilities. 
Lewis said Virginia Beach uses Pocketalk, a handheld translation device that can convert hundreds of languages into English and has staff who speak French, Tagalog and Spanish.
Richmond offers outreach materials and ballots in English and Spanish, Levine said, and tries to recruit election officers “from a diverse range of constituencies, including the disability community.” Training stresses inclusive language — “for example, to call a pet a service dog” — and respectful ways to assist older voters without playing into stereotypes, he said. 
Norfolk employs poll workers with disabilities and partners with groups such as The Arc of Virginia. 
“Each voting place offers an ADA-accessible machine,” Iles said, referring to devices in compliance with the American with Disabilities Act. She added that her office coordinates with senior centers and nursing homes on ride times during early voting and Election Day.
Virginia’s 2021 Voting Rights Act further added state-level protections for language access, polling-place changes and early public notice requirements beyond federal law.
 Training, audits and accessibility checks


“There’s required training for officers of election,” Iles said, with emphasis on how to set up and use the ADA-accessible device, and how to correctly assist voters who need help. 
Coakley said the State Board of Elections requires localities to complete an annual, detailed ADA compliance survey of polling places — “from the slope of your ramp, to the door handle itself” — which must be uploaded for state review.
Virginia’s early voting period — roughly six weeks — gives officials time to monitor operations, respond to issues and publish audit materials to the public.
 Transparency without exposing vulnerabilities

Open government is part of the security model, the officials said, but there are limits.
Coakley said Henrico routinely responds to Freedom of Information Act requests, including for “cast ballot records” — data exported from tabulators that allow outside analysts to study patterns without revealing how any voter voted. 
“Anything FOIA-related that we can give to the public, we do,” he said. “We’d rather help the voters and the media than deny access to what we have readily available.”
Levine said Richmond tries to “proactively communicate” when mistakes happen, and invites residents to observe. 
“Having people in place who know the rules, who are able to secure equipment properly, and are able to talk with the public about why they’re doing what they’re doing,” is crucial, he said.
 The 2024 voter-roll removals and the aftermath


The Youngkin administration last fall ordered daily removals of noncitizens from voter rolls based on DMV data, a move that touched off a legal fight over whether federal law bars systematic purges within 90 days of a federal election. 
A federal judge ordered more than 1,600 registrations restored; days later, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed removals to continue pending appeal. The state’s top elections official later said no additional voters were removed after the ruling.
On the ground, the registrars The Mercury spoke to described the controversy as largely a non-event in their offices. 
“It did not affect our office at all,” Lewis said of Virginia Beach. In Henrico, Coakley said there was “not a big increase” in workload — the state publishes daily and monthly reports for anyone seeking numbers — and his staff referred questions to Richmond. 
Iles said Norfolk follows a notice-and-affirmation process when DMV data suggest a registrant indicated non-citizenship: If a voter doesn’t return the affirmation letter, they’re removed; if the person later appears to vote and is a U.S. citizen, they can use Virginia’s same-day registration and cast a provisional ballot that will count once eligibility is confirmed. 
The Mercury reported at the time that same-day registration was a backstop for affected voters who showed up to vote in person.
 How list maintenance actually works


List maintenance is largely state-directed, the officials said. 
“The state provides the data to us on a monthly basis,” Lewis said. “We pull up the information they give us and see if it’s a match to a voter. And if it is, then that voter gets removed. As far as non-citizens, a lot of them are mistakes.” If the person quickly returns an affirmation of citizenship, “we can get them back.”
Coakley emphasized the “top-down” architecture: the statewide voter database and list-maintenance tools live at the state level; local offices carry out the mailings and processing. The National Voter Registration Act limits wholesale removals close to elections — a key legal issue in last year’s litigation.
 Threats, safety and staffing

Iles said the environment after the 2020 presidential election — which was contested by then-President Donald Trump who repeatedly alleged fraud without providing evidence — has included real-world harassment. 
“I’ve actually received threats before,” she said. “I have colleagues that have been doxed.” 
COVID-era health concerns also shrank the pool of older volunteers, Iles added. To help protect election workers, the Voter Registrars Association backed legislation allowing election administrators and officers of election to list a P.O. box as a “protected voter” address.
Local offices have also added cameras and other security features and coordinate closely with police on Election Day.
Coakley recalled decisions in past elections to avoid uniformed officers inside polling places to prevent intimidation, while still maintaining a discreet law-enforcement presence nearby. He said one current worry he hears from party officials is the hypothetical appearance of immigration agents at polls — something local officials would quickly escalate to state and federal partners to defuse.
 The throughline: redundancy and openness

None of the officials claimed their systems are perfect. What they described instead was redundancy as a means of security: paper ballots backed by audits; cameras and vaults backed by two-person rules; public observation backed by formal records requests; statewide databases backed by local reconciliation; early voting backed by a same-day registration safety net.
The state, for its part, continues to point to layered defenses and partnerships with DHS and VITA — and to public-facing steps meant to show the process up close. For many Virginians, that offer to “come and see for yourself” may be the most persuasive answer to questions seeded by an age of disinformation.

It’s notable for an issue both complicated theoretically and challenging politically. The recent flurry of activity comes thanks, in part, to a campaign to abolish property taxes outright at the ballot.
First, lawmakers overrode Gov. Mike DeWine’s veto of a budget provision eliminating emergency, substitute and replacement levies. Republican lawmakers argued the names are confusing and muddy the water for voters. After this November’s election, all those options will be off the table.
In the last few weeks, the Ohio House approved four bills meant to rein in property taxes in going forward.
Ohio House Bill 129 changes a longstanding tax reduction formula, creating new slack for additional cuts.
Ohio House Bill 309 empowers to local commissions to trim levies after the fact if they determine they’re raising too much revenue.
Ohio House Bills 186 and 335 limit the increase in property taxes to the rate of inflation in the economy.
It’s a lot of moving parts. Many Democrats contend they still haven’t done enough, and state senators still have to weigh in.
But the legislation offers a rough sketch or an opening bid detailing what lawmakers are willing to do to address growing concerns about property taxes.
The questions now are what do property taxes look like if those bills take effect? And will it make a difference if voters are asked to decide whether to abolish property taxes?
How it all fits together
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman thinks lawmakers have made a strong case to Ohio voters.
“This is a big deal,” he said Wednesday after lawmakers approved the last parts of the property tax package. “As a result of these things, over the next three years, there’s going to be $2.4 billion less paid, which is about a 10% cut — that’s significant.”
Those savings come from the two bills limiting tax increases to the rate of inflation. Recent spikes in property values have been particularly hard in rural areas where many schools levy the state minimum (20 mills or 2%).
A 1970s-era Ohio law reduces tax rates as property values rise, but when a district hits that 20-mill floor, there’s nothing left to cut. After that, taxes rise with property values.
Ohio House approves bills limiting property tax increases to inflation

Huffman noted the legislation targeting those districts works as a credit, so homeowners will actually see the amount they saved itemized on their bill.
He thinks that could make a difference for skeptical property owners.
“I think this should convince a reasonable voter, a reasonable citizen in Ohio, that something significant has been done,” he said.
Earlier this year, Ohio realtors, auditors and the state chamber of commerce rolled out a property tax advocacy group called The Ohio Taxpayer Protection Coalition.
Their biggest ask was for lawmakers to fix that decades-old tax reduction formula.
The system was meant to ensure taxes don’t increase without voters first approving them, but in districts at the 20-mill floors, that’s no longer happening.
Coalition chair, and former state tax commissioner, Tom Zaino is pretty thrilled with lawmakers’ work.
He praised them for taking steps to “tamp down that future growth to the rate of inflation.”
He sees the package as a compromise between making tax bills more manageable for homeowners while giving school districts some benefit from rising property values.
“I think it’s a real win-win,” he said, adding “voters can always add more revenue in the future. They can vote more taxes on themselves.”
Zaino said eliminating property taxes would “ruin” Ohio, and that homeowners should view the latest action as significant reform.
Ohio’s tax reduction formula is almost 50 years old, and he predicted 50 years from now, people will be talking about how the latest reform package.
Chamber-backed tax reform group urges Ohio lawmakers stamp out ‘unvoted’ increases

Economist Howard Fleeter agrees that the House’s work is significant, but he worries lawmakers haven’t done quite enough.
He explained Ohio’s tax system is quirky.
We deliver a lot of services at the local level, so local taxes are relatively high. But our state taxes are relatively low, because we don’t handle those services at the state level, like many others do.
For a long time, the two balanced out, and Ohio’s overall tax burden landed near the middle.
But in recent years, Fleeter said, that imbalance has grown, and the tax burden has shifted further toward local governments.
When you mix greater reliance on local taxes and a sharp increase in property values, that’s “really the straw that broke the camel’s back,” he said.
To Fleeter, some kind of cap on property taxes going forward was probably “a necessary step.”
But rather than just limiting taxes going forward, lawmakers decided to go back to counties’ most recent valuations — starting the clock as far back as 2023.
That means homeowners in districts at the 20-mill floor (about 2/3 of districts in the state) will see their taxes go down.
But homeowners in more urban districts won’t see the same benefit.
With homeowners paying less, lawmakers also had to figure out what to do about the shortfall.
Do schools just get by with less or does the state step in to make up the difference?
The House decided to spend more than $300 million to hold schools harmless until their next revaluation.
Fleeter said it’s a good idea for the state to pitch in, but he thinks it would’ve been better to scrap the retroactive start date and use the money to provide targeted relief — like increasing the homestead exemption or an income-based credit.
And he warned there could be challenges down the road.
If property values continue to outpace inflation, for instance, the gap between what schools could’ve collected and what they actually receive will widen.
“The next increase that school districts get will not only be limited,” he said, “but it will also start from a lower starting point.”
Despite the state’s one-time cash infusion, some districts could wind up with less money in a year or two than they have right now.
And perhaps more consequential, Ohio’s school funding formula weighs a district’s ability to pay — known as capacity — when determining how much the state ponies up.
But right now, capacity is based on property values — not taxes. With a new cap in place, a district’s capacity could look much greater than its actual revenue.
Local views
Athens County Auditor Jill Davidson has been serving in that post for more than two decades, and she said Ohio’s property tax challenges have been developing for a very long time.
“I don’t believe that this is a COVID property housing boom issue,” she insisted.
Davidson points to 2005 when the state transitioned its business taxes from tangible personal property to commercial activity.
That change shut off a stream local business tax revenue and shifted it to the state. In the most recent fiscal year, it generated $2.3 billion.
“I’m not saying (tangible) personal property tax was the best way to do that,” Davidson said. “What I am saying is that was over $3 million in Athens County that was coming back to our community to help those businesses be successful that we don’t have anymore.”
Ohio House votes to advance a pair of property tax reforms

Next she points to 2011, when Gov. John Kasich cut the Local Government Fund in half.
Athens County still isn’t receiving as much as it did before that cut.
Then in 2013, lawmakers nixed a credit on certain levies, effectively shifting a 12.5% share onto homeowners.
Davidson is ready to hold up her end of the bargain. She’s all for government efficiency and accountability but explains Southeast Ohio “does not have the capability to overcome those cuts and be able to absorb those losses.”
Davidson praised lawmakers for empowering local budget commissions to roll back excessive levies but found their other property tax bills wanting.
She sees the moves as ‘reform’ rather than ‘relief,’ with state lawmakers again asking local governments to pick up the tab.
The bill putting inflationary caps on inside millage (the 10 mills or 1% local governments are constitutionally allowed to levy) almost guarantees a reduction in services.
At some point, she said, something’s got to give.
“You can’t cap growth and expect the same level of service, right?” she said.
And Davidson sees momentum growing behind the campaign to abolish property taxes, adding it’s a lot harder to make the case for keeping them than it is for getting rid of them.
Still, Davidson thinks lawmakers’ efforts so far haven’t offered a strong enough response.
“The voter wants to hear that you’re going to fix it,” she said. “I don’t think any of these bills fix it.”
Like Fleeter she contends the state should be making targeted investments like bolstering the homestead exemption.
Current benchmarks for the program amount to “comic relief,” she said.
The people receiving the exemption are barely making ends meet she said “and we’re giving them a few hundred dollars here or there to help with their property tax burden — that’s not even meaningful.”
In the end, Davidson worries, taxpayers are likely to see more levies on the ballot as local service providers feel the pinch.
“And how do you think that is going to be interpreted to the voter?” she asked.
In Northeast Ohio’s Lake County, Commissioner John Plecnik has similar frustrations but a very different response.
Like Fleeter and Davidson, he points to the yearslong shift of Ohio’s tax burden onto local taxpayers.
He contends state lawmakers are only “nibbling on things” instead of making substantive changes.
“They promise small reductions in future increases. They promise more procedural fairness and transparency — all good things, by the way — but not enough,” he said.
“And none of which actually cut people’s taxes so that they’re lower tomorrow than they were today.”
Plecnik contends Ohio can eliminate property taxes without completely eviscerating local services — lawmakers would just have to start cutting into the state budget.
“You know, we’d have to cut a lot,” he said, “I’m not saying this would be easy, but it’s certainly doable.”
The changes he’s contemplating would be a dramatic restructuring of state government, like stripping a home to the studs and starting over.
He doesn’t have an exact blueprint, but suggests several state departments would disappear, adding as an afterthought, “lieutenant governor could be a non-paid position.”
But most other observers, including Zaino, Fleeter, Davidson and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, think abolishing property taxes would be an unmitigated disaster.
If property taxes disappeared, governments would have to make deep cuts to services or dramatic tax increases elsewhere.
In 2024, property taxes generated about $20 billion.
In the most recent fiscal year, sales and income tax combined amounted to a little more than $21 billion.
Plecnik thinks it’s still possible for lawmakers to make a good enough case that Ohioans reconsider supporting the constitutional amendment.
First, he says lawmakers should expand the homestead exemption to 100% for seniors and disabled veterans.
And second, Ohio should follow California’s lead and tie property taxes to a home’s sales price — effectively locking in a homeowner’s property taxes regardless of changes in the home’s value.
Ohio is moving to a flat 2.75% income tax rate next year; California’s income tax rates run as high as 13.3%.
Regardless, Plecnick argues it’s up to state lawmakers to convince skeptical constituents, and he warns “half measures only makes them madder.”
“Either you take the cut,” he said of state officials, “and give real property tax cuts through it, or the people are going to take all the money back come November 2026 when this goes on the ballot.”

As part of its federal restructuring and crackdown on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs, the Trump administration has been shuttering federal offices and rescinding grants dedicated to addressing worse health care access and outcomes for racial minorities.
The shake-up has caused some state agencies and nonprofits to pause programs and some groups and universities to apply for foundation grants instead.
Hundreds of grants have been terminated for state, local and territorial health departments as well as nonprofits and universities, many of which addressed health equity across rural, low-income and communities of color.
The nation’s racial health disparities were laid bare during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the virus killed Black, Hispanic and Indigenous people at higher rates than white people. The police murder of George Floyd in May 2020 also fueled a racial reckoning across the nation, prompting efforts by states, universities, health systems and the federal government to address racial health disparities.
Those approaches ranged from targeted vaccine campaigns and efforts to enroll more people of color in clinical trials to corrections of diagnostic tests that relied on inaccurate information about race and biology.










COVID revealed the impact of health disparities to individual health — as well as how not addressing these disparities undermines the health system for everyone.


– Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association


Communities of color have long had less access to health care, increased exposure to environmental pollutants and higher rates of certain chronic illnesses and cancer deaths. They also have more diabetes-related amputations because of a lack of access to care. And specific genetic diseases, such as sickle cell disease, disproportionately affect Black people.
“COVID revealed the impact of health disparities to individual health — as well as how not addressing these disparities undermines the health system for everyone,” said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association.
Now, many of the programs trying to address health disparities are being rolled back.
As a result, health policy experts, clinicians and researchers fear those disparities will widen as states, universities and nonprofits grapple with lost federal dollars while the administration continues to limit federal funding for DEI programs. In July, the U.S. Department of Justice released guidance saying such initiatives should not receive federal funding, alleging they are “discriminatory.”
Entities that receive federal funds “must ensure that their programs and activities comply with federal law and do not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, religion, or other protected characteristics—no matter the program’s labels, objectives, or intentions,” the news release said.
Several state and local health officials were reluctant to speak with Stateline on the record about how the federal administration’s DEI crackdown has left them in a bind, fearing retaliation or targeting by the federal government. The White House did not respond to Stateline’s request for comment.

“My concern about what the administration is doing is that they are, in effect, making these disparities worse,” Benjamin said. “Everybody’s health is not the same. … It’s important to know that the disparities are really profound.”
Benjamin added that the cumulative effect of disparities means more late-stage disease — costing both patients and health systems more.
“There’s a trope or misunderstanding out there that DEI is a ‘woke’-related agenda. DEI is not a ‘woke’ agenda. DEI is an American agenda, because it’s really one that is the same thing as ‘rising tides lift all boats,’” said Brandon Wilson, senior director of Health Innovation and Public Health at Community Catalyst, a health equity advocacy organization. “When you cut [resources] off, you’re actually disproportionately impacting those who are already impacted.”
‘Increasing need’
The administration canceled billions of dollars in grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services.
Many of the grants helped recipients create solutions tailored to their communities’ needs and strengths.
At least three dozen state, local and territorial health departments have had pandemic-era grants that addressed health equity terminated. While originally focused on COVID-19, agencies have since used that grant money for other public health efforts: testing and contact tracing for a wide range of diseases, better data reporting, and community partnerships that address social and environmental effects on health.
The money was part of a $2.2 billion national health equity initiative that aimed to address vulnerabilities and protect those communities ahead of the next outbreak.
The Department of Health and Human Services told media such cancellations were due to the pandemic emergency ending in 2023.
At NIH, the administration terminated more than 5,400 NIH research grants, although about 2,800 were reinstated. Canceled grants included research toward illnesses like HIV and AIDS, which disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic people as well as gay and transgender people.
The Trump administration has also gutted federal offices dedicated to fighting disparities, including the Offices of Minority Health under the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Department of Health and Human Services.
Federal changes could end up ‘cutting holes’ in HIV safety net, experts say

At the state level, the Arkansas Department of Health recently shut down its own minority health-focused office. Ashley Whitlow, a spokesperson for the department, said in a statement that it “relies on federal grant funding to support a variety of public health programs.”
“The recent reduction in program staff reflects the Arkansas Department of Health’s ongoing efforts to operate more efficiently with the resources available. Despite these changes, ADH remains fully committed to serving communities across the state,” the statement said.
Meanwhile, Maryland’s Department of Health said its minority health office is funded through state general funds and not directly impacted by the federal cuts.
The nation has seen a spike in congenital syphilis cases, which disproportionately occur among Black and Indigenous families.
“Regardless of whether you’re at the highest risk, any outbreak that’s not controlled can spread widely and broadly, and you can see that that’s what’s happening with measles,” said Dr. Julie Morita, former executive vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former health commissioner Chicago Department of Public Health.
But states likely can’t replace all the lost federal dollars.
“You’ve got declining capacity, and increasing need — which is a formula for problems,” said Richard Frank, director of the Brookings Institution Center on Health Policy.
“It’s impossible to make all that up with state and local dollars,” he continued. “You’re going to see programs that serve real people getting pulled back.”
Frank and Wilson also expressed concern about the Medicaid changes included in the broad tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed in July. The law is projected to cut federal Medicaid spending by an estimated $911 billion over the next decade, largely because new work requirements will push people off the rolls. Data shows the majority of Medicaid enrollees already work, and experts say many will be kicked off the rolls due to difficulties in states’ reporting processes. Black and Hispanic people are disproportionately represented on the Medicaid rolls.
Historically redlined communities have slower EMS response times

OB-GYN Dr. Versha Pleasant, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Michigan, directs the Cancer Genetics and Breast Health Clinic at Von Voigtlander Women’s Hospital. She treats patients at high risk for breast and ovarian cancers. Black women have an almost 40% higher risk of death from breast cancer than white women.
“That, to me, is unacceptable,” she said, adding that such disparities speak to the need for ongoing programs to “provide everyone with a fair chance at leading a long and healthy life.”
“If we don’t make a special effort to save the most vulnerable lives … where does that leave us?” she continued. “The changes that we’re seeing are only going to magnify preexisting challenges.”
Data and dollars
Dr. Sarah Rudman, acting public health officer at the Santa Clara County Public Health Department in California, and others have told Stateline that federal officials are informing health agencies that race and ethnicity data are no longer required to be reported.
“We are being asked to change the way we collect our own data here and report it,” Rudman said, adding that her county is going to continue collecting data to “understand who is here, who’s experiencing what health outcome and what they need.”
Many families, in the shadow of the county’s Silicon Valley, still struggle with poverty — more than 27,000 children suffer food insecurity, United Way Bay Area says.
“It is sometimes surprising and striking to people to understand how much poverty and other types of vulnerability are hidden among the more visible wealth of Silicon Valley, and that’s where we’ve dedicated our resources,” Rudman said.
“It’s hard to even imagine what my colleagues in smaller areas of California or in other parts of the country are experiencing,” she added about lower-income counties. “We are feeling extremely strained and already in our second round of layoffs, knowing that many more are likely. So I think that the hits are going to be that much more significant in areas who have less resources than we do.”
Federal officials also canceled the county’s $5.7 million grant to address COVID-19-related disparities, used to shore up vulnerable communities ahead of the next disease outbreak, natural disaster or heat wave, Rudman said. The money helped the county conduct basic laboratory testing and vaccine outreach for a wide range of diseases, not just COVID-19.

(Getty Images)House lawmakers are pushing forward legislation to criminalize parents who violate custody orders, arguing harsher penalties are necessary to deter unfair behavior.
In a party-line vote, Republicans on the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee voted last week to recommend House Bill 194 to pass. 
The bill, as amended by the committee, would create a three-strikes system in which a parent could be charged with a Class B felony on the third instance if they interfere with parenting time arrangements by holding onto the child.
Supporters say the current system requires parents to go to civil courts in order to enforce parenting time agreements if they feel they are being violated, which can be time consuming. 
But critics, including Rep. Buzz Scherr, a Portsmouth Democrat and professor at the University of New Hampshire Franklin Pierce School of Law, say the bill would unnecessarily inject prosecutors and criminal courts into disputes that should be resolved civilly.
“I just don’t think it’s a positive thing to start to criminalize some of this behavior,” Scherr said on Wednesday. “It’ll make things worse; it won’t make things better.” 
The full House will take up the committee’s “ought-to-pass” recommendation when it convenes for the start of the 2026 session on Jan. 7.
In current New Hampshire law, a parent can be charged with a misdemeanor if they take a child out of the state in order to deny access to another parent or to a child protective agency like the Division for Children, Youth, and Families. There is also a misdemeanor penalty for taking, enticing away, detaining, or concealing a child.  
But there are no criminal penalties for violating a custody arrangement if the child remains in the state. 
Instead, the aggrieved parent must file a “family access” motion in family court. That court must then prepare a summons against the other parent within 10 days, and must issue a decision within 60 days. If the court finds the other parent violated the agreement, it can fine them up to $500, award a compensatory amount of parenting time to the aggrieved parent to make up for time lost, require counseling for the violating parent, require that parent to post a bond to ensure compliance, and require the violating parent to pay for counseling between the aggrieved parent and the child to help heal their relationship.
The Legislature recently updated that process: A law took effect in January intended to make the access motions clearer to navigate, especially by parents who are representing themselves.
HB 194, in contrast, would create a set of criminal penalties. Under the committee amendment passed last week the first two violations of the custody order would result in a $500 fine but no criminal penalties; the third would incur a Class B felony, which can include a punishment of up to 7 years in prison and a fine of up to $4,000.
Rep. David Love, a Derry Republican and one of the sponsors of the bill, said the bill is intended to strengthen the existing statute and require law enforcement to enforce custody orders against parents. That enforcement is important, Love argued — it helps enable parental rights, he said. And he said it would alleviate the effects of a “broken home” on children by incentivizing parents to stick to their shared custody agreements. 
“Parental rights are not just legal formalities. They’re an essential in the emotional and psychological well-being of both the child and parent,” he said. 
“Unfortunately, many divorcing couples are so enraged that they can’t see the emotional damage they’re inflicting on their beloved children, much less understand the long term damage that often caused by their own selfish behavior,” he added.
Keeping the enforcement of custody in civil court would force aggrieved parents to endure six to eight week delays, while HB 194 would deter bad behavior from the outset, Love argued.
But Democrats said the threat of criminal penalties would deprive parents of the opportunity to resolve difficult situations relating to custody through mediation or civil court. Rep. David Meuse, a Portsmouth Democrat, pointed to research that the majority of primary custody holders are women, who could face felony charges and jail time. 
“What are the implications of sending a person like that to prison?” he said. “A mother up to prison, away from her children?”
Rep. Terry Roy said that a Class B felony does not automatically mean the harshest punishment. “It’s up to the judge. They don’t have to send them to prison,” he said. 
Instead, he said the three-strikes could be a tool for law enforcement to use to convince a parent to relinquish custody and avoid fines or felony charges. 
To Scherr, the presence of law enforcement into custody battles sets a bad precedent. He brought up his own divorce, which he went through while he had a 6-year-old child. That experience was civil, he said, but many are not. 
“I think everyone on this committee knows otherwise smart, intelligent, thoughtful people losing their minds when it comes to divorce and child custody,” he said. “I dont think it should be a violation. I think the person should go back into court, and it should be dealt with in a civil context.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/youthriskbehaviorsurvey-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-28 05:21:04.905807

Garlin Gilchrist has landed his first major gubernatorial endorsement from a sitting member of Congress: Democratic U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Detroit.
Gilchrist is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor in 2026. Tlaib, an often controversial progressive Democrat from Detroit, carries with her the weight of progressive voters and ideas in Congress. She’s also often the source of ire for many conservative and far-right Republicans.
Tlaib announced her support for Gilchrist in a video published Tuesday morning.
“I trust Garlin [and his] lived experience, not only as a father, but as someone who understands what it means when we don’t have people in office defending us and fighting on our behalf,” Tlaib said. “He has shown up at the picket line and has shown up for our folks who are returning citizens, who need that second chance.”

Tlaib’s reference was to Gilchrist’s championing of “Clean Slate” expungement laws that went into effect in recent years.
“He believed in them, and that’s why he helped push the Clean Slate program,” Tlaib said. “I know, again, many of you feel very strongly that we need a fighter. I know Galrin is going to fight for us. And that’s why I am proud to support him for governor of the state of Michigan.”
Prior to Tlaib’s announcement, Gilchrist’s list of endorsements online only included nods from state senators and representatives
With Tlaib, Gilchrist extends his footprint of support in Detroit, his hometown, and those aligned with Tlaib’s politics, namely young progressives. Gilchrist and Tlaib also see eye-to-eye on the plight of the Palestinian people, with the lieutenant governor pronouncing recently at a national Arab convention in Dearborn that Israel’s actions in its war on Gaza is a genocide.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Gilchrist’s comments set him apart from the Democratic primary field. Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson, who is also seeking election to the governor’s office on the Democratic side, earlier this month called for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, a lasting ceasefire and said humanitarian aid should flow freely to those in need. Swanson said the situation “hurts his soul, and I know I’m not alone.”
Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, also in the race, has called for a peaceful solution to the conflict. However, neither has gone as far to call Israeli actions a genocide.
Following Gilchrist’s comments, the Jewish Federation of Detroit said it was “deeply disappointed” in the lieutenant governor’s remarks, which the organization said was a use of his tall platform to vilify support for Israel.
“Gilchrist promotes an inaccurate and offensive narrative that also omits the horrific attacks of October 7th and ignores those that remain hostage in Gaza,” the organization wrote in a news release issued in September. “This inflammatory language is an attempt to foster divisiveness as a campaign tool. We expect our elected representatives to reject political rhetoric that plays into antisemitic tropes and instead promote peace and understanding among all Michiganders.”

Countering that rhetoric was the pro-Palestinian “Detroit Jews for Justice” organization, which said it was disheartened by the federation picking apart and policing Gilchrist’s remarks.
“It is not antisemitic to use the term genocide or to criticize the actions of a government, no matter who the government is,” Detroit Jews for Justice wrote on Instagram. “Just days later, when a white political leader also described the situation as a genocide, she was not met similarly targeted and labeled as divisive or inflammatory. Let’s be clear – disproportionately scrutinizing our allies from other marginalized communities, while ignoring their public record of support for the Jewish community, is divisive and rooted in racism.”
The group went on to say that progressive leaders of color already face dangerous political environments, and should not be admonished for speaking out for Palestinians, or any other group’s human rights.
Arab American Democrats, the Arab cultural caucus within the Michigan Democratic Party, also issued support for Gilchrist in his stance on Gaza and Palestine.

“For Arab Americans across Michigan, this genocide is painfully close to home. Our families, loved ones, and communities are living with daily grief and fear as entire generations are being killed and forcibly displaced from their homes and homeland,” the caucus wrote in a news release issued in early October. “We know the cost of silence, and we recognize in his words the courage and principle that embody true Democratic leadership. His remarks on the influence of money in politics reflect a concern Democrats across the state have voiced for years.”
Like Detroit Jews for Justice, the Michigan Democratic Arab caucus noted that when Black elected leaders speak out against injustice, they often face disproportionate attacks and attempts to silence them.
“The same forces seeking to punish truth-tellers in Palestine are driving broader assaults on free speech, racial injustice, and democracy here in Michigan,” the caucus wrote. “This radicalized double standard weakens our democracy and undermines the inclusive value that our party claims to represent.”
The caucus went on to praise Gilchrist’s leadership on the matter.
“His leadership aligns Michigan with the universal values of justice, equality, and human dignity, principles the Democratic Party must uphold if it is to remain credible in the fight against authoritarianism at home and abroad,” the caucus wrote. “Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist has shown the courage this moment demands, and the Arab American Caucus proudly stands with him.”

Brian Kemp term-limited and unable to run again, the governor's office will be up for grabs next year. Photo by John McCosh/Georgia RecorderWith Brian Kemp leaving the governor’s office after next year’s election, Georgia Democrats have an opportunity to make history. 
All they need now is a candidate.
The alleged frontrunner for the 2026 nomination is Keisha Lance Bottoms. According to a poll of Democratic primary voters commissioned by her own campaign last month, Bottoms “pulls more support than all other named candidates combined,” drawing 38% of likely primary voters.
However, I’d argue that’s more a sign of weakness than of strength. Only 9% of voters polled in that survey said they haven’t heard of Bottoms, which tells us that she’s a well-known commodity with less than overwhelming support, even in a field of relative unknowns.
And frankly, it’s hard to envision Bottoms winning a statewide general election. She is a former Atlanta mayor, which historically puts her at a disadvantage in much of the rest of the state. More important than that, Bottoms proved mediocre in the mayor’s office, accomplishing little and declining to run for re-election after her first term, without offering voters or supporters much of an explanation for walking away.
At a time when Democrats are looking for fighters, I’m not sure that’s a resume they should find attractive.
If Democrats do make Bottoms their nominee for governor, they also guarantee an endless run of commercials retelling the tragic tale of Secoriea Turner, the 8-year-old Atlanta girl who was shot dead by vigilante gang members in 2020. Secoriea was shot while riding with her mother in the back seat after Bottoms, as mayor, allowed gang members to take and keep control of a site in southwest Atlanta.
That’s a hard, even impossible thing to explain to voters.
In an election season that Republicans are desperately trying to turn into a soft-on-crime referendum, Secoriea’s story would become an anchor around the neck of every other Democrat on the ballot, from the U.S. Senate down to local races.
Bottoms’ best-known challenger is Geoff Duncan, the former lieutenant governor and, more famously, a Republican recently turned Democrat. Duncan deserves credit for recognizing that the party of Donald Trump bears no resemblance to the party of Lincoln, Reagan and Johnny Isakson, and for having the moral clarity and guts to act on that recognition. As far as I can tell, his conversion to the Democratic cause is sincere, but in an era of heightened tribal identities he’s asking a lot from primary voters to place their faith in him.
So far, I’m a little surprised by the open reception he’s getting, but translating voter curiosity into actual ballots will be difficult. If Duncan can pull it off, it would be a major miracle and a national news story, but I’m not seeing much in the way of political miracles these days.
The other two major announced candidates, Jason Esteves and Michael Thurmond, offer an important generational contrast, and my guess is that one of the two will emerge as the nominee. Esteves, 42, is a former chair of the Atlanta Board of Education and a former one-term state senator. He comes across well in public and has built an impressive slate of endorsements from those who have worked with him in his previous roles. In the investment world Esteves might be touted as a growth stock, and sometimes they work out and sometimes they don’t.
Thurmond, 72, has served ably in a variety of state and local offices, including state legislator, state labor commissioner and DeKalb County executive. He knows the state and state government, he has the resume of a governor and he campaigns and operates as a moderate. But for Democrats, he’s also the last holdover from a political era that a lot of Georgia voters either don’t remember or never experienced in the first place. 
In the current environment, that might not be to his advantage.

Calhoun, a single mother of four children in Columbus, is one of the approximately 1.39 million Ohioans who receive SNAP benefits. 
“I’m someone who’s living this currently,” she said Thursday during a press conference at the Statehouse. “Someone who’s seen the fear in her kids faces when there’s more months left than there is money, someone who knows that hunger is not a talking point, it’s a sound, it’s a feeling, it’s a slow ache that lives in your bones.”

The federal government has been shut down since Oct. 1 and SNAP benefits are funded for this month, but the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in a letter on Oct. 10 there “will be insufficient funds to pay full November SNAP benefits for approximately 42 million individuals across the Nation” if the shutdown continues. USDA has also posted a notice on its website saying federal food aid will not be issued for Nov. 1.
Ohio’s average SNAP benefits are $190 a month, Ohio Department of Job and Family Services Spokesperson Tom Betti said. 
“The Ohio Department of Job and Family Services is closely monitoring the federal shutdown situation,” Betti said in an email. “We’ve not yet received guidance from USDA Food and Nutrition Service beyond that, so we cannot speculate beyond October.”
To qualify for SNAP, Ohioans must have a net income at or below federal poverty guidelines —  $32,150 a year for a family of four.
State Rep. Latyna Humphrey, D-Columbus, introduced House Bill 502 earlier this month which would make an appropriation to continue to fund SNAP and some other federal programs if there were to be a lapse in federal funding. 
“Grocery stores won’t stop operating,” she said. “The bills won’t stop coming. The babies won’t stop needing formula, and families still have to eat.”
House Bill 502 has had no hearings so far and no hearings on the bill are currently scheduled. Her bill has an emergency measure, meaning it would take effect immediately if it were signed into law. 
“We are getting very close to Nov. 1, so I would urge my colleagues on the Republican side to start thinking and getting together and even being willing to work with me, work with us, to get something done so we are prepared if it is Nov. 1 and there is no solution,” Humphrey said. “Maybe my bill won’t be the actual solution, but it is possible to put together a similar bill and fast track it, and get it to the governor’s desk,” she said.
She sent a letter to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Monday urging him to preserve SNAP benefits.
State Rep. Dontavius Jarrells, D-Columbus, said H.B. 502 is a “ blueprint for how we can solve the problem facing us today.” 
“If we love Ohioans, then we have to feed our people,” he said. “It is just that simple.” 
The Mid-Ohio Food Collective helps feed more than 5,000 families each day — 58% more families than at the peak of the pandemic, said Mid-Ohio Food Collective Spokesperson Mike Hochron. 
“Many of our neighbors are one tough break away from having trouble putting food on their table,” he said. “SNAP helps working families keep food on their table, a roof over their heads and keeps our economy strong. … We are here to help as best we can, but without gap help, and if SNAP benefits are not issued for November, we anticipate the need for services will be far beyond what our food bank and network of interest are able to meet on our own.” 
Calhoun criticized President Donald Trump for building a $300 million ballroom at the White House. 
“They build ballrooms while I’m building grocery lists that don’t add up,” she said. “How do you have marble floors and empty pantries at the same time?”
The longest government shutdown took place during Trump’s first term as president in 2019 and lasted 35 days. 
“It’s now the second longest shutdown in our nation’s history and without immediate intervention from our state and federal elected leaders, it will be the most devastating,” said Franklin County Commissioner Erica Crawley.

Aveni originally granted a 14-day TRO on DeWine’s ban on Oct. 14 that was set to expire Tuesday. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for Dec. 2. 
DeWine announced earlier this month a 90-day executive order that bans the sale of intoxicating hemp products that also started on Oct.14. 
Titan Logistic Group, Fumee Smoke and Vape and Invicta Partners — all members of the Ohio Healthy Alternatives Association — quickly filed a lawsuit Oct. 8 against the ban, arguing DeWine is breaking federal and state law by restricting access to these products.
Intoxicating hemp products are items that contain THC that are sold anywhere other than licensed marijuana dispensaries including gas stations, smoke shops, and CBD stores, among others. The 2018 Farm Bill says hemp can be grown legally if it contains less than 0.3% THC. 
Marijuana is not considered an intoxicating hemp product and is legal in Ohio. This ban does not affect the marijuana law passed by voters in 2023.
Ohio has more than 4,000 small businesses and family-owned businesses that sell hemp products, according to the lawsuit. 
The Ohio House passed a bill last week that would add several regulations to intoxicating hemp products. Under Senate Bill 56, only a licensed hemp dispensary would be able to sell intoxicating hemp products to adults 21 and older. The dispensaries would be required to meet standards for testing, advertising and packaging. A 10% tax would be added to intoxicating hemp sales.
The bill heads back to the Senate for concurrence, but many changes were made to the bill over in the House.
At least 32 states have some regulations on intoxicating hemp products.

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)A variety of causes pulled people into the joyful throngs of the Oct. 18 No Kings demonstrations, despite masked federal agents ramming cars and snatching racially ambiguous people from American streets.
Joyous because songs, smiles and hugs, and inflatable costumes filled the atmosphere and pierced the loneliness and fear that escalating immigration raids and National Guard occupation threats have created. At the rallies, immigration advocates risked their safety to encourage those living in the shadows. LGBTQ+ advocates asserted their intention to live unapologetically. Organizers sounded a civic engagement call to action.
Cheers affirmed each perspective, a contrast to belched accusations of hating America from event detractors.
But my concern as a speaker at the Overland Park rally centered on a largely already dismantled cause, one worth fighting to restore.
I referenced a recent morning news appearance by Wright Thompson, the noted author of “The Barn: The Secret History of a Murder in Mississippi.” He said his readers believe that those in charge of government want a return to a pre-Civil Rights America. 
It seems that way.
Former MSNBC anchor Joy Reid said the MAGA movement now “has everything it wanted.”
She said MAGA has control of the White House, both chambers of Congress and an obedient Supreme Court that has imbued the executive branch with seemingly unlimited power. The court, she said, has allowed racial profiling. Masked ICE agents can stop Latino people based on their appearance and accents. MAGA has ended diversity, equity, and inclusion. It has ended affirmative action.
“You get all the best jobs even if you’re not qualified,” she said, referencing Pete Hegseth moving from Fox weekend news anchor to the head of the Department of War (Defense) and Kash Patel moving from podcasting to running the FBI.
MAGA has banned books, banned the 1619 Project, smothered Black history in museums and dared historians to tell the truth.
“You’ve canceled Black scholarships. You’re damned near getting rid of (Historically Black Colleges and Universities). The president has already said they’re not going to serve minority-serving institutions,” she said. “What more do you want? You said you wanted your country back. Now, you’ve got it.” 
It feels as though half the nation has backtracked on once foundational ideas such as freedom of and from religion, separation of church and state, and a common good. 
While this movement unfolds, the rest of us wonder how we’re going to live with people who spend every waking moment thinking of new ways to manage our lives. A dear friend said that because of these differences, he envisioned a future America organized like the European Union, with states or regions operating as nation states. We’d share economies and defense structures but live separately.
You can reasonably argue that we’ve never actually been “e pluribus unum,” out of many, one. Not with slavery, not with the destruction of Indigenous people, not with limited rights for women, not with inequality that always has existed. 
The No Kings participants don’t hate America. They hate how people can’t understand unfairness until it happens to them. They hate hollow religiosity. They hate how half the nation keeps reviving our racial caste system.
This tracks with my closing message.
Thompson told his interviewers that while standing on the bank of the Tallahatchie River in Mississippi with one of Emmett Till’s relatives and staring into the water, the relative said, “I’m just so grateful,” when asked what she felt in that moment. 
“Grateful?” He didn’t understand. 
“Because he got out of the river,” she replied, and it clicked for Thompson.
He said the Tallahatchie is known as the “singing river” for all the lynched bodies tossed into it, bodies that yet today cry out for justice.
That’s important, Thompson said, because so many people in the country today want to put Emmett and all such history back into the Tallahatchie. To drown it. To forget it. Symbolically then, we must get out of the water, onto the banks and into a movement to ensure immigration advocates don’t have to risk their safety, where our LGBTQ+ loved ones can live freely, where civic engagement is our default.
So many of us are just trying to keep our heads above water, but we must drag ourselves and as many others as we can out of the river and into a movement that protects what we have and restores what we’ve lost.
We have to get out of that river, before our Democracy sinks to the bottom.

(Photo by Olivier Douliery, Getty Images.)Silver linings are so rare in the grim story being written on the death watch of self-governance in Ohio and our democratic republic writ large that any glimmer of hope almost knocks you sideways. This one surprised me in a God Bless America way. 
Former Republican Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels broke his silence about the brazen Trump scheme to steal the 2026 election before a single vote is cast.
Kansas Republicans also appear unwilling to heed Trump’s call to rig the midterms through rare, mid-decade redistricting to preserve the party’s control on Capitol Hill.
The convicted felon-in-chief (and his morally bankrupt Ohio veep) are strong-arming red states to redraw their congressional districts for the sole purpose of snagging more guaranteed Republican seats in the U.S. House. 
Forget fair, competitive, representative districts where the voting power of each person is roughly equal to that of any other person. 
Trump and JD Vance are leaning on Republican legislatures to produce unfairly drawn districts that increase the voting power of certain groups at the expense of others. 
That’s called gerrymandering or cheating to win. 
Redrawing a district map with a two-to-one ratio of straight party line voters dilutes the vote of other constituents who statistically cannot influence the outcome of any election. 
I know. I lived in one of Ohio’s most egregiously gerrymandered districts for 10 years and expect a return to cancelled voting power in the redistricting map Ohio Republican will unilaterally enact in a few weeks. 
That’s the plan, anyway. 
But while Statehouse kingpins openly defy the Ohio Constitution to ensure continued party dominance through partisan gerrymandering — not persuasion — principled Republicans elsewhere balk. 
They are unsettled by the rush to manipulate congressional voting boundaries — between censuses — to secure election results demanded by a lawless president accustomed to unchecked power aided and abetted by a Republican majority in Congress. 
That narrow majority could be wiped out by voters in the midterms if the fix isn’t in with extra gerrymandered congressional districts Republicans can’t lose by design. 
But subverting the democratic process to win with lopsided redistricting that disenfranchises thousands of voters to placate the Dear Leader is a bridge too far for some.
“My home state of Indiana is on the national Republican target list for new lines, as part of the quest to ensure continued control of the (U.S.) House,” wrote Daniels, the ex-Indiana governor, in an op-ed for the Washington Post.
“While the outcome sought is one I support, the tactic (italics, mine) being employed to get there is not, and I hope earnestly that my state’s leaders will politely decline to participate.” 
He urged his fellow Republicans “not to cave to White House pressure to redistrict,” suggesting that would only invite public disgust because “Hoosiers, like most Americans, place a high value on fairness and react badly to its naked violation.”
If only Ohio’s lame duck Republican governor could summon the same courage not to cave on Trump-inspired gerrymandered congressional maps that give unfair advantage to the GOP.

If only Mike DeWine could use his bully pulpit to condemn the charade his fellow Republicans are running to skip good faith, bipartisan redistricting negotiations altogether and unilaterally gerrymander more GOP districts in naked violation of the state constitution. 
If only the guv could deliver on promises made for once. 
Am I right, Dayton? A year ago, DeWine promised to take politics out of redistricting and restore fairness to the process. 
He vowed to pass an alternative approach to redistricting reform if voters rejected the anti-gerrymandering initiative in 2024.
DeWine’s vaunted plan was similar to the non-partisan legislative commission that draws maps in Iowa. 
“I will lead as much as I can, and I will do everything I can to get the legislature, when they come back in January, to pass this, get it on the ballot, and move forward,” the governor said at a press conference before the referendum was defeated last fall. 
All talk and no cigar. DeWine did nothing to improve a redistricting system he acknowledged was broken and needed to be replaced. 
Today he stands ready to pass the gerrymandering baton to the gerrymandered Republican supermajorities in the General Assembly prepared to approve at least two more congressional districts that unduly favor one party over the other to placate an epically corrupt president.  
As a member of the Republican-controlled Ohio Redistricting Commission DeWine will look the other way again as GOP lawmakers mock the rule of law and silence disenfranchised voters with illegally gerrymandered maps. 
He is a coward.
Mitch Daniels is not, and neither are Republican legislators in Kansas and other Trump-supporting states who resist the full court press to throw an election for one man. 
Even party loyalists see the shameful race for additional gerrymandered GOP districts for what it is — a precursor to the collapse of democracy and just wrong. 
“I don’t underestimate the pressure Indiana’s leaders are under, and I empathize with them in the predicament they face,” said Daniels, “but I hope they quietly and respectfully pass on this idea. Their duty is to the citizens and the future of our state, not to a national political organization or a temporary occupant of the White House.”
A silver lining to a grim story from a neighboring state that, unlike Ohio, imparts fleeting hope for a different ending.

(Photos by Maine Morning Star)In addition to local races and initiatives, next Tuesday’s election showcases two statewide referendum questions. However, one has attracted more spending than the other. 
 
Read additional coverage of the November 2025 election in Maine here.

	As of the most recent round of pre-election campaign finance filing reports, which were due last Friday, a proposal to modify state election laws including requiring photo identification to vote has drawn more than $2 million in cash contributions. Comparatively, Question 2, which proposes a red flag law, has raised just shy of $635,000.
Data submitted last Friday reported activity through Oct. 21, but in the days leading up to the election ballot question committees are expected to file additional reports of single contributions of $5,000 or more or single expenditures of at least $1,000.
Question 1 
Question 1 on Tuesday’s ballot will ask Maine voters whether they want to require photo identification to be shown at polling places, in addition to limiting absentee voting and a multitude of other changes to the state’s election law. 
It will read: “Do you want to change Maine election laws to eliminate two days of absentee voting, prohibit requests for absentee ballots by phone or family members, end ongoing absentee voter status for seniors and people with disabilities, ban prepaid postage on absentee ballot return envelopes, limit the number of drop boxes, require voters to show certain photo ID before voting, and make other changes to our elections?” 
Based on the filings through Oct. 21, nearly $1.8 million has been raised in opposition to the measure while supporters have raised more than $585,000. 
“The fundraising success that we’ve had demonstrates how important protecting absentee voting is to a lot of people in the state,” said David Farmer, campaign manager for the effort to oppose Question 1, which includes more than 30 different organizations. 
With the opposition having raised more than three times as much as proponents, Alex Titcomb, the lead petitioner of the ballot question committee Voter ID for ME, highlighted the money coming from sources outside of Maine.
For example, between Oct. 1 and 21, the Save Maine Absentee Voting committee raised nearly $95,000, with more than $70,000 coming from out-of-state donors and national organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union and the Service Employees International Union. The National Education Association has also been a major contributor to the campaign, including with a $100,000 contribution on Oct. 22. 
But there have also been sizable donations from in-state organizations to oppose the campaign. For example, Maine Voices Network, a nonprofit civic engagement organization, contributed $20,000 last week after the last filing window.
Out-of-state money is also flowing in support of Question 1. Voter ID for ME raised more than $47,000 between Oct. 1 and the filing deadline, including $25,000 from the Republican State Leadership Committee PAC. In total, the Washington D.C.-based political organization has contributed more than $520,000 to back the ballot measure.
While proponents have spent just over $566,000, about $1.4 million has been spent to oppose it, as of Oct. 21. The Save Maine Absentee Voting ballot question committee reported another $370,000 in spending since then through more recent 24-hour expenditure reports. 
Question 2 
Question 2 on the ballot will ask voters if they would like to adopt a red flag law, which would allow family or household members to petition a court directly for someone’s firearms to be temporarily removed.
It will read: “Do you want to allow courts to temporarily prohibit a person from having dangerous weapons if law enforcement, family, or household members show that the person poses a significant danger of causing physical injury to themselves or others?”
The majority of the fundraising for that proposal has been in support. The Safe Schools, Safe Communities ballot question committee raised more than $540,000 as of Oct. 21, compared to the roughly $94,000 raised by opponents. 
On Friday, the Sportsman’s Alliance of Maine, which opposes Question 2, said it is trying to raise an additional $10,000 to reach undecided voters after a recent poll from the University of New Hampshire Survey Center showed the opposition has a slight edge with voters. 
“We are out-funded and we are scrapping for every dollar,” the gun rights organization wrote in a campaign email sent out Friday.

DETROIT – A group of tenants in the River Pointe Tower building in Detroit, a senior living apartment complex, are calling for the head of Capital Realty Group, Moshe Eichler, who owns the building, to come to the bargaining table. 
A number of River Pointe Tower residents formed a union in August, demanding safer living conditions and better quality of maintenance in the apartments, after tenants dealt with issues from roaches and bedbugs to cracked walls and ceilings. 
They held a rally outside their building on Monday to explain that Eichler had failed to adequately address these issues, and had only met with them one time.
“This is where we live every day,” said Jacqueline Rice, one member of the union and resident of the building. “Mr. Eichler could come here and live and stay for a month or two, see the conditions that we live in. If not, come to the bargaining table.”SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“If you want to run the building, you want us to stay here, you do what needs to be done, or else we’re gonna rent freeze, gonna picket, or we go to New York and let him know what’s going on,” said A.J. Johnson, a leader of the union.  
“That ain’t right” became a rallying call among the tenants throughout the demonstration, as numerous members of the union expressed their grievances with Eichler and building management.
Since the union was formed in August, tenants say that some additional maintenance has been done in their building — but they say it’s not adequate. The people brought in to make these changes are handymen who, according to tenant Teresa McCormick, have said the work required to get the building into shape is too much for them. 
“It’s paint, it’s floors, it’s blinds, it’s the plumbing, it’s the bathrooms,” she said. “They’re going to do this right away because it’s a band aid. It’s not fixing the problem. There are no skilled trades here, working on the boiler, working on the plumbing, working on electricity.”

“We need help, and Eichler needs to step up to the plate,” McCormick said. “We need proper security, not some fly-by-night that’s related to somebody in the office. We need proper maintenance people.”
And Walter Welch, a union leader, said that his apartment has been skipped over by maintenance in retaliation for his organizing. His whole apartment floor was sprayed for pests over a month ago, but his unit was skipped, even after he repeatedly asked for assistance. 
 “They still didn’t come back to do nothing. They haven’t done nothing up till now, right now, and I see bed bugs and roaches now when I didn’t have them,” he said.










We need proper security, not some fly-by-night that’s related to somebody in the office. We need proper maintenance people.

And Welch is not alone — Johnson said, “I myself have been yelled at and threatened with eviction.”
River Pointe Tower is not the only Capital Realty property that is unionizing amid allegations of poor management — there are tenant unions popping up around the country in buildings owned by the New York-based private equity firm, including in Kansas City, Missouri and New Haven, Connecticut.
Capital Realty Group and River Pointe Tower management did not respond to requests for comment. 
Latisha Johnson, Detroit’s City Council member for the district where River Pointe Tower is located, has already shown the union support — she spoke at the August event in which tenants announced their union. 
Michigan bills would require landlords to do repairs within 48 hours or renters can withhold rent

“She spoke particularly about how she wouldn’t allow Moshe [Eichler] and Capitol Realty to get any funding in Detroit,” said Steven Rimmer, a co-founder of the Detroit Tenants Union, of which the River Point Tower union is a part of. “We’re trying to hold them to that.”
This issue is also bigger than Capital Realty, said Sam Garin, a spokesperson for the Private Equity Stakeholder Project. 
“A private equity firm, they will do whatever it takes to make their ‘investment’ more profitable over a pretty short amount of time,” she said. “And unfortunately, what that usually means for tenants of private equity-owned buildings, we’ll see slashed maintenance, rent hikes, increased and more aggressive evictions.”
As he spoke during Monday’s event, Welch’s story shared a similar tone.
“They treat us the same, all the same. We are nothing but an income. That ain’t right,” he said. “They don’t actually care about us. They only care about their profit. Mr. Eichler, it’s time to put people over profit. Come to the bargaining table with our union right now.”

When I asked what happened, she smiled apologetically and said she needed to feed her kids first. By the time they arrived, the painting activity—the part her kids were most excited about—was almost over.
As a mom, this scenario is too relatable. These are the kinds of things that happen all the time. For many families I work with, getting through the day takes careful juggling—figuring out meals, housing, transportation—all before they can even think about joining a event or program, even a free one. 
When basic needs aren’t met, it’s hard to focus on anything else.
I’ve worked in Connecticut’s nonprofit sector for more than two decades. I’ve seen trends come and go, programs shift, funding dry up and come back again. But this moment feels different. The ground feels a little less steady. With a federal shutdown threatening SNAP benefits and housing insecurity rising, families are being stretched to the limit. Nonprofits are being asked to do more than ever with less support, and it’s the same families—those already facing the hardest circumstances—who feel it first.
If SNAP pauses in November, we’re going to see it up close. Pantries will run low. Kids will head to school hungry. Parents will have a harder time concentrating at work or in training programs. And when that happens, even the best programs can fall short—not for lack of care or effort, but because survival always comes first.
Nonprofits have always been quick to fill the gaps when government systems fall short. But the truth is, we have limits too. We want our education, workforce, and youth programs to succeed—but none of that can happen if families are hungry or without a safe place to live. It’s a question we all need to keep asking: Are our participants fed? Are they safe? What’s really keeping them from showing up fully?
There are things we can do. Sometimes it’s as simple as providing snacks or meals during a workshop. Other times, it’s building new partnerships—with a local farm, a grocery store, or another organization—to make sure people have what they need. We can work together across housing, food, and education. It’s not glamorous work, but it’s real, it’s human, and it strengthens our missions—not distracts from them.
Funders, this is your moment too. A STEM program is important, but it won’t reach a child who’s hungry or sleeping in a car. The more flexibility you can offer in grants, the better equipped organizations will be to meet real, immediate needs. This isn’t extra—it’s essential.
The SNAP pause is just one example of something bigger. Food insecurity, unstable housing, and financial strain have been growing for years. Nonprofits are the pulse of our communities, and right now, that pulse is quickening. It’s on all of us to act—with creativity, urgency, and empathy—and to let the voices of those most impacted lead the way.
I keep thinking about that mom who showed up late. We took a few minutes to connect, offered some options, made room for her family. Later, she came back to volunteer. That small exchange stuck with me. Sometimes the most meaningful changes start in small, relatable moments—when we see someone’s reality and choose to respond.
The nonprofit sector is at a crossroads. We can keep doing business as usual, or we can start showing up differently—listening more closely, meeting people where they are, and leading with heart. How we show up now will shape more than our programs; it will shape the lives of the people we serve. And my hope is that we’ll choose wisely.

They should be.
I spent more than 30 years in the classroom as a teacher and I saw how domestic violence intruded on the classroom in so many different ways. Around three-quarters of our nation’s K-12 teachers are women, and women are much more likely to experience domestic violence than men. According to the CDC, 41 percent of women have reported experiencing violence or stalking compared to 26 percent of men.
As a teacher, I especially think about the troubling link between domestic violence and gun violence. Nearly 70 percent of mass shootings involve a perpetrator with a history of domestic violence or family violence, according to a recent study.
Fortunately, we have more tools to intervene than ever before. Unfortunately, teachers are often left out of the loop. Connecticut was the first state in the nation to pass a “red flag” law. Signed into law in 1999, the law allowed law enforcement to seek a court order to remove guns and ammunition from the home of a person if there is cause to believe they pose an imminent risk of causing injury to themselves or others. Connecticut later modernized the law in 2021 to allow family members and medical professionals to also seek a court order.
Even after the law was modernized, as a teacher, I never received training about how these provisions, which are called “extreme risk protection orders,” work. That’s a significant gap that should be addressed. As teachers, we wear so many hats – not just educators, – we’re also unofficial clinicians and advisers. 
Much of teacher training involves our obligations to be mandatory reporters when a child faces abuse, neglect, or threats to their safety, training that is critical. But we should be going beyond that to make sure teachers are aware of extreme risk protection orders, which are now on the books in 21 states and the District of Columbia. Because too often, the public is not aware of these important tools.
A California survey found two-thirds of residents were unaware of the state’s Red Flag law, but 70 percent were supportive when they learned about the law’s provisions. In Connecticut, a study from this year found 79 percent of the state’s medical professionals were unaware of the state’s Red Flag law.
I’m not suggesting that teachers should be involved in having an extreme risk protection order issued. But we can be critical in helping to educate the community about these tools. When I think back to a mother who sat across from me in school who was visibly in crisis, or even a coworker who was struggling, I wish I had known about these provisions so that I could have been a better advocate for a struggling parent.
This work can go beyond educating teachers. Our teachers’ lounge could have had a fact sheet to share basic information about Connecticut’s Red Flag law, just like it had a poster with the usual labor law protections. And the information could be made available at parent-teacher conferences. 
As teachers, we often have some idea about what is happening in the home, especially when there is trouble. Having teachers and schools more routinely educate about Red Flag laws will not only make the public more aware of their options, but it can also help make these important tools seem less intimidating to people who are in crisis.
Red Flag laws are the first step. Now, we must make sure the public knows about them. Teachers are a natural answer.

(Stock.adobe.com photo by jonbilous)Two historically Black colleges and universities in Maryland received a total of $63 million in donations in a span of less than two weeks from billionaire philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, the schools announced this month.
The unrestricted gifts — $63 million for Morgan State University announced on Oct. 15 and $38 million to University of Maryland, Eastern Shore announced Friday — are in addition to $60 million that Scott gave the schools five years ago. Morgan State got $40 million then, and UMES received $20 million.
Scott also donated $25 million in 2020 to Maryland’s second-largest HBCU, Bowie State University, the largest single gift in the school’s history. In total, Scott has donated $186 million to Maryland HBCUs in a nearly five-year period.
Officials at Morgan State and UMES said the latest donations are a vote of confidence in the progress they have been making. That was echoed Monday by Del. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), chair of the Legislative Black Caucus, who said the gifts highlight the importance of HBCUs in the state, especially when the country is “seeing a movement” by the federal government to not support Black communities.
“Seeing these kinds of private investments really show us the importance and contributions of our HBCUs. I just feel proud and excited,” Wilkins said.
Scott was married to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for 25 years before they divorced in 2019. She currently has an estimated net worth of nearly $34 billion, according to Forbes. Besides being a philanthropist, Scott’s also an author of two novels.
On the same day Morgan State announced the second gift from Scott this month, she posted an essay on her website, Yield Giving.
“The potential of peaceful, non-transactional contribution has long been underestimated, often on the basis that it is not financially self-sustaining, or that some of its benefits are hard to track,” Scott wrote. “Votes are not the only way to show what we’d like to see more of in our societies. There are many ways to influence how we move through the world, and where we land.”
Scott or a representative could not be reached for comment Monday.

In a message to the UMES community Monday, President Heidi M. Anderson said the school will take suggestions – 100 words or less by Nov. 30 – on how to use the new $38 million gift.
“As we consider all input, we will do so through the lens of our strategic priorities – ensuring that every dollar advances UMES’s mission, supports our students, and builds a stronger future for generations to come,” Anderson wrote.
The letter notes that a “significant portion” would go toward strengthening the school’s endowment to generate future income.
Some other uses of the money for the school of nearly 3,000 students would go toward scholarships, academic research and creation of internships, apprenticeships and jobs in the Lower Eastern Shore.
David Balcom, vice president for university relations, said Monday the funding could also be used toward implementation of the school’s new school of veterinary medicine, which has about 100 students slated begin in fall 2027.
“It shows the confidence MacKenzie Scott and her team have put in UMES and Dr. Anderson,” Balcom said. “We’re still charting how best to use these funds, but literally hundreds of students will be supported by these funds over time.”
As for Morgan State, the state’s largest HBCU, the school said it plans to use the new $63 million donation to enhance its endowment, for student support, for academic research and initiatives to work with the city and state.
“To receive one historic gift from Ms. Scott was an incredible honor; to receive two speaks volumes about the confidence she and her team have in our institution’s stewardship, leadership, and trajectory,” Morgan State President David Wilson said in a statement announcing the donation. “This is more than philanthropy — it’s a partnership in progress.”
Del. Gabriel Acevero (D-Montgomery), who received a master’s degree this year from Bowie State, said Scott’s investment shows confidence in the work of HBCUs.
“For far too long, HBCUs have been subjected to both historic underfunding, as well as duplication of programs,” he said. “I would like to applaud Scott for continuing to support our institutions with this most recent gift and her donations a few years back for BSU. It helps to educate the future generation of engineers, doctors, lawyers that our community, our state and our country needs.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Maryland health officials launched a new data dashboard on seasonal respiratory illnesses as the winter holidays approach — with data on the once-novel COVID-19 virus now reported alongside that of influenza and others.
The Maryland Department of Health announced Monday that the Maryland Combined Respiratory Illness Dashboard aims to help families monitor seasonal illnesses that spike in the cooler months.
But public health researchers say the dashboard is also a sign of a new stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, where it operates as a “relatively equal threat” to the other viruses that circulate in the colder months. Deputy Secretary of Public Health Services Meg Sullivan agrees.
“We’re in a different place with COVID, and we know that COVID is endemic and happening,” Sullivan said Monday. “We want to really urge the public to know what is happening in the community, for all the respiratory viruses, to be able to make those informed decisions about how to best protect themselves and their families.”
Sullivan described the Maryland Combined Respiratory Illness Dashboard as a “one-stop shop” for respiratory illnesses that Marylanders and health care providers should monitor in the coming months. The dashboard focuses on COVID-19, seasonal influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), among others.
The new Maryland Combined Respiratory Illness Dashboard offers a wide variety of data for various viruses such as COVID-19 and the flu, such as vaccination uptake. (Chart courtesy of the Maryland Department of Health)
“The goal of the dashboard is to put the data all in one place,” Sullivan said. “To be able to have easy access to a snapshot of what is happening where they live, whether it’s the entire state or more specifically in their counties and how much disease is out there.”
The dashboard will be updated weekly to provide information on the respiratory illnesses. That includes information on the number of hospitalizations, along with deaths caused by those illnesses and the number of people getting vaccinated each week.
“Respiratory viruses continue to cause significant illness and death in the community each season,” the  health department said in a statement. “During the 2024-2025 respiratory virus season, nearly 5,000 Maryland residents were hospitalized with lab-confirmed COVID-19, more than 8,000 with lab-confirmed flu, and more than 2,600 with lab-confirmed RSV.”
The Maryland Department of Health has hosted a public-facing dashboard on COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic back in 2020, at the time releasing daily updates on new cases, hospitalizations and deaths from the then-novel virus.
But as the pandemic evolved – and infection numbers were affected by the availability of new vaccines, growing herd immunity and other factors – the severity in the pandemic lessened, and state officials moved to weekly updates to the COVID-19 dashboard in May 2023. In addition, the development of at-home tests along with weakened disease tracking infrastructure in the later years of the pandemic reduced the accuracy of overall daily COVID-19 case data.
Officials say that the isolated COVID-19 dashboard will remain on the agency’s website, but Sullivan adds that the combined data dashboard will help families understand the full scope of respiratory viruses that could impact their communities.
“We would encourage people to use this dashboard to really see what is happening in the community with regards to respiratory viruses,” she said, noting that the dashboard also serves as a “reminder … that vaccines remain the most important way to protect yourselves and your community.”
Maryland health department moves away from daily COVID reports; what does that signal for the pandemic?

Andrew Pekosz, a Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health professor who researches COVID-19 and other respiratory illnesses, says that with new protections from COVID-19, the virus is now endemic and is a “relatively equal threat” to other seasonal illnesses.
“We’re now focusing on COVID as one of the respiratory viruses that we’re concerned with, side-by-side with influenza and RSV,” he said. “Now that we have population immunity, now that we have vaccines, now that we have treatments, it’s [COVID-19] fallen to that area of ‘here are the respiratory viruses that we need to follow.’”
He agreed that the state’s dashboard grouping COVID-19 data with other seasonal respiratory viruses marks progress against the pandemic.
“I think there is, from a general public’s perspective, an advantage to us talking about them as all being relatively equal threats to the population, because that shows you that we’ve gotten someplace with the COVID pandemic,” Pekosz said.
“We’re now treating it like we do these other viruses,” he said. “COVID-19 has now gotten to that area where it’s still a concern, but it’s an equal concern to other respiratory viruses that are circulating.”

“In Massachusetts, we have school districts who have yet to fully adopt a proven literacy curriculum, even though such approaches are the most effective ways to improve reading outcomes,” House Speaker Ron Mariano said Monday afternoon.
The bill (H 4642) seeks to tackle what officials describe as a literacy crisis, as more young students struggle with the foundational reading and writing skills needed for learning.
A little more than a third of districts in Massachusetts still use outdated reading instruction methods, said Education Committee Co-chair Rep. Ken Gordon. 
“MCAS scores among our youngest readers are falling,” he said. “Between 2011 and 2024, the average fourth grade reading scores fell by 11 percentage points. Among our most economically challenged districts, the decline has been greater.”
The Joint Committee on Education advanced the bill with bipartisan support this month, with 10 members voting in favor and none opposed.
The legislation would require districts to adopt literacy curricula backed by scientific research, focusing on kindergarten through third grade. It sets new standards for teacher training and educator preparation programs, and mandates regular evaluations of those programs by the commissioner of education, who would also publish annual performance data. 
K–3 students would be screened at least twice a year using approved literacy tools, with targeted intervention for students who fall below benchmarks tied to “age-typical development in specific literary skills.” The bill also launches a two-year paid teacher apprenticeship pilot in high-need districts and directs a statewide study on recruiting and retaining diverse, effective educators.
Curricula would need to include instruction in five research-based reading areas — phonemic awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. 
“These approaches are grounded in research and results, strategies that help all students learn to read and write wherever they live, regardless of their circumstances,” Mariano said.
Programs relying on “implicit or incidental instruction,” such as the three-cueing method — which involves visual memorization of whole words and guessing clues from context — would be prohibited.
If passed, Massachusetts would join a growing number of states reshaping early reading instruction around the “science of reading.” Supporters say it would align classroom practice with decades of cognitive science research on how children learn to read, emphasizing systematic phonics and structured literacy.
Critics — including the state’s largest teacher’s union, the Massachusetts Teachers Association — warn that statewide mandates could erode local control, add costly implementation burdens, and limit teachers’ flexibility to tailor lessons to students’ needs.
“This bill is not about telling the teachers how to do their job,” Mariano said. “As a former classroom teacher, I, too, would have resented that implication. Indeed, it’s about ensuring that teaching colleges equip future teachers with the tools they need to succeed — and that current teachers have access to high-quality, evidence-based materials to support their work in the classroom.”
Asked whether any funding would be offered to districts to help them transfer curriculums, Gordon pointed to the state’s existing program dubbed Literacy Launch. 
The $35 million grant program has already funded 58 districts to transition their curriculum to evidence-based literacy materials, he said. One of the conditions of accepting the grant funding is accepting evidence-based literacy teaching as defined by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. 
Gordon said no district that has applied for Literacy Launch so far has been denied because of funding, he believes funding will be sufficient for now, and they will reassess if necessary. 
Asked what they’ve heard on the bill from their counterparts in the Senate, Gordon replied, “We’re hopeful that they’re as interested in this issue as we are.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Mariano-on-budget-scaled-e1712772238792.jpg?fit=1024%2C577&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-10-27 22:17:04.145812

Sears/Maryland Matters)Local social services agencies have been directed by the secretary of the Maryland Department of Human Services to end the practice of housing foster care children in unlicensed facilities, including hotels.
The directive, issued in an Oct. 22 memo, orders all local departments of social services to immediately stop facilitating stays in unlicensed settings “for youth experiencing out-of-home” care. The announcement comes a month after the death of a 16-year-old girl who died of an apparent overdose while under state supervision in a Baltimore City hotel.
“We will not rest until every child in our state is safe, thriving in a permanent home, and surrounded by a loving family,” the department said in a statement. “We are committed to ending the use of inappropriate stays for all children in our care, and that goal is becoming a reality.”
As of Monday, there were 3,762 youth in out-of-home care in the state. Of those, six are in hotels, the department said in its statement.
The number is down from 41 reported on Jan. 31, 2023, according to the department.
The department ordered all six children to be relocated from those hotels by Nov. 24 and placed in kinship care, a licensed foster care facility or other regulated placements.
Department officials are scheduled to appear before the Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee on Wednesday to answer questions about a scathing audit released last month.
State may have put children in homes where registered sex offenders lived

“Putting children in need, who require special attention or care and need love, support, and guidance in hotel rooms with minimal, if any, consistent adult supervision is an absurd policy,” House Minority Leader Jason C. Buckel (R-Allegany) said in a statement. “It is blatantly wrong, and thankfully, DHS has finally reached this conclusion.
“It is unfortunately too late for children and families that have already suffered because of prior failures in our foster care system,” Buckel’s statement said. “Such a policy must never be allowed to be implemented again. Maryland’s foster children deserve better.”
That 70-page audit included findings that the department may have approved guardianship homes for children who are in state care where registered sex offenders lived and failed to identify a convicted sex offender who worked in a group foster home and later faced criminal charges involving children under his care.
Five days after the audit was released, the body of Kanaiyah Ward, 16, was found Sept. 22 in a room at a Residence Inn by Marriott. The teen had been living in the hotel on  N. Wolfe Street Baltimore.
An autopsy concluded that she died as the result of an overdose of diphenhydramine, an over-the-counter allergy medication.
“I am glad that DHS is ending this practice, but it still leaves many questions,” said Del. Mike Griffith (R-Harford and Cecil), who spent years in Maryland’s foster system as a child. “Where will these children be housed? As many of them are children like Kanaiyah who need mental health or medical services, will they be placed with treatment foster care providers? Or, as we already know happens, will they be placed in more dire environments like homeless shelters?
“Given this agency’s track record, it is important that we continue to push for the passage of Kanaiyah’s Law so we can be assured that these placements and practices are forever banned,” he said. Earlier this month, Griffith announced he would sponsor a bill — Kanaiyah’s Law — that would prohibit putting children who are in foster care into a hotel for more than a week without the review and approval of the secretary of Maryland’s Department of Social Services.
The bill — as described by Griffith — would also require training, licensing, and criminal background checks for one-on-one providers and give the state “legal authority to conduct ongoing monitoring, including background checks of adults residing with children placed in guardianship homes.”

(Photo by Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)The cost of purchasing health insurance on Colorado’s individual marketplace is set to double next year in the absence of enhanced federal subsidies, state insurance officials announced Monday.
When the open-enrollment period for Connect for Health Colorado, the state’s individual marketplace under the Affordable Care Act, begins on Nov. 1, the average consumer can expect a net premium increase of 101%, according to the figures released by the state’s Division of Insurance.
The vast majority of that “staggering” increase, the division said, is caused by the expiration of the enhanced premium tax credits, which congressional Republicans have declined to extend. The deadlock over whether to extend the subsidies, which help millions of people afford insurance, is the primary cause of the federal government shutdown that entered its 27th day on Monday.

“These premium increases are going to create impossible decisions for families across the state,” Colorado Insurance Commissioner Michael Conway said in a statement. “We have sounded the alarm bells at every turn, but Congress’ refusal to act means that Coloradans will be left with unacceptably high health insurance bills during a tightening time in the economy.”
Roughly 225,000 Coloradans purchase their health coverage from one of six insurers that offer plans on the individual marketplace, established under the Affordable Care Act to serve consumers who are self-employed or otherwise don’t receive insurance from their employers. State insurance officials estimate that 75,000 of those enrollees are now set be priced out of coverage and become uninsured as of Jan. 1.
Subsidies for the purchase of marketplace health plans were included in the ACA, but legislation passed under President Joe Biden in 2021 expanded the number of households that were eligible for the subsidies. The enhanced eligibility allowed more than 3.2 million people to enroll in coverage who otherwise would not have, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.
“For months, Democrats have been sounding the alarm about the Republican-forced health care crisis,” U.S. Rep. Diana DeGette, a Denver Democrat and the ranking member on the House Health Subcommittee, said in a statement on Monday’s figures. “Costs are already too high under (President) Donald Trump, and many families will now be forced to choose between staying on their health care or buying groceries.”
In a poll conducted last month, the nonpartisan health organization KFF found that more than 78% of people, including 59% of Republicans, want lawmakers to keep the enhanced credits.
Consumer advocates have warned for months of large spikes in insurance premiums and other health costs in 2026, because of the combined impact of the tax credit expiration and broader cuts to Medicaid and other health programs included in Republicans’ tax and spending law.
“It’s clear why premiums are skyrocketing and why Coloradans will be shocked when they go shopping for insurance this open enrollment,” said Mannat Singh, executive director of the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative, a nonprofit health advocacy organization. “Trump and Congressional Republicans have gutted healthcare coverage for families and small businesses that need it, so that they can fund tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations. This is what they set out to do, and all of Colorado’s GOP congresspeople voted for it.”
Congressional Republicans have said they are willing to negotiate with Democrats about the tax credits, but only after the government reopens.
Colorado lawmakers passed a bill during an August special legislative session that will partially offset the loss of the enhanced tax credits, including $100 million for the state’s health insurance affordability fund. Without that money, ACA marketplace premiums would have nearly tripled in 2026, the DOI estimated.
“I thank the Colorado legislature for what they have done so far to protect their constituents, and I urge Congress to step up and extend the enhanced premium tax credits,” Conway said. “Coloradans shouldn’t have to gamble their health simply because they cannot afford these rate increases caused by the federal government.”

Goldstein stands outside the Goldstein Treasury Building in Annapolis. (Photo from grandbrothers/Shutterstock.com)Federal workers who are on a state taxe payment plan can ask to have their payments deferred during the ongoing federal government shutdown, the comptroller’s office announced Monday.
Comptroller Brooke Lierman announced the program as the shutdown entered its 27th day Monday, with no end in sight. The program would allow affected federal government workers to defer payments on their state tax plans for the duration of the shutdown.
“We recognize the financial strain this shutdown is placing on hardworking Marylanders, many of whom are working without a paycheck,” Lierman said in a statement announcing the deferral plan. “Our office is committed to doing everything we can to ease that burden and ensure families can stay afloat while the federal government remains at a standstill.”
Affected federal workers who have state tax payment plans can apply for a deferral by sending an email to GovShutdownRelief@marylandtaxes.gov. The email should include the taxpayer’s full name, address, the last four digits of their Social Security number and their case number or payment plan identification number.
Federal workers approved for the program will have their payment plans deferred for the duration of the shutdown, and for as many as 60 days after the government reopens before they needed to start paying again. The deferred tax payments plan is just the latest in a series of programs state agencies have offered in an effort to assist federal workers who are going without pay.
The government shut down Oct. 1 when the Senate could not agree on a proposal to keep government operations funded through the first months of fiscal 2026, sending most government workers home without pay and requiring essential employees to keep working without pay.
The shutdown is already the second-longest on record, and will tie the record of 35 days — set in President Donald Trump’s first term — in just over a week. At this point, a resolution appears unlikely any time soon: Democrats and Republicans in the Senate have refused to budge off their positions, President Trump is overseas and House Speaker Mike Johnson has refused to bring the House back from a recess that started five weeks ago until there is a budget in place.

Gov. Mike Dunleavy announced the appointment of his deputy, John Crowther, as acting head of the agency that regulates Alaska’s agriculture, mining, oil and gas.
The governor’s office declined Monday to answer questions about the resignation, which had not been previously announced.
Dunleavy is term-limited and will leave office in December 2026. Boyle’s departure follows those of Revenue Commissioner Adam Crum and Attorney General Treg Taylor.
The resignations of both of those men — who are now Republican candidates for governor in next year’s elections — were announced in advance, unlike Boyle’s departure.
Boyle could not be reached for comment on Monday.
The departing commissioner has extensive experience in the oil industry. Before joining Dunleavy’s cabinet in 2023, he was a lobbyist for BP and Oil Search.
Crowther, who will replace Boyle on an interim basis, has been with the Department of Natural Resources since 2012, the governor’s office said.
He previously worked as director of the governor’s Washington, D.C. office and served on the staff of the U.S. Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He holds a law degree from Georgetown University.
“The Department of Natural Resources is at the forefront of protecting and developing Alaska’s precious land and waters.

Fourth District Judge Tony Graf called media and public attention to the case “extraordinary.” He did not rule on a request from Tyler Robinson’s attorneys to restrict news coverage of the case, saying it required “further briefing.”
The case has drawn intense national attention after Kirk, a conservative activist and close ally of President Donald Trump, was shot and killed at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10. A family friend persuaded Robinson to turn himself in, ending a 33-hour manhunt, authorities said.

Robinson’s defense attorneys argue the publicity could harm his right to a fair trial. 
“The court should limit media coverage, or video and photographic coverage, at the least, so the defendant’s appearance is no longer the subject of interest and he has some chance of securing a fair and impartial jury,” his legal team wrote in court papers filed last week. 
They said the media’s right of access to criminal cases “is not absolute” and can be restricted altogether to ensure a fair trial. 
Robinson has been charged with multiple crimes, including one count of aggravated murder, which is a capital offense in Utah. Prosecutors have announced they intend to seek the death penalty if Robinson is convicted.
First Amendment attorney Jeff Hunt told Utah News Dispatch that banning cameras from courtrooms altogether isn’t necessary. He noted that in Utah statute, there’s a presumption they’re allowed. 
“The law sets a high bar to kick cameras and the public out of the courtroom, and for good reason,” Hunt said. “Electronic media coverage allows the public to actually see and hear what transpires in the courtroom, and have a fuller and more meaningful understanding of the proceedings.”  
Charges filed against Utah man accused of killing Charlie Kirk; prosecutors will seek death penalty

Courts have a range of tools they can use to protect the right to a fair trial, he said, including carefully vetting prospective jurors about the news they’ve read or watched on a case and widening a jury pool. 
On Monday, the judge said the restrictions he ordered on photography strike “the proper balance between Mr. Robinson’s right to a fair proceeding and the public’s right to access and transparency.” 
The judge also prohibited news cameras from showing him standing, coming in or leaving the courtroom. Graf said Robinson must wear physical restraints in court — the least restrictive ones necessary for safety — but can wear civilian clothes in court instead of a jail uniform.
Robinson’s attorneys had argued that prospective jurors seeing him in shackles and jail clothes would perceive him as “guilty and deserving of death.” 
Monday’s virtual court proceedings followed a Friday hearing that was closed to the press and public.  
Robinson appeared from the Utah County Jail with the camera off and spoke only when the judge asked if he could hear. 
“Yes I can,” Robinson replied. 
He returns to court for an in-person hearing on Jan. 16.

Georgia SNAP seeks at least $60 million after federal budget cuts

The latest clash stemming from the federal shutdown centers on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. The SNAP program is set to run out of funds on Nov. 1, meaning that as many as 1.4 million Georgians who rely on the aid could face the abrupt loss of benefits starting this weekend. Though the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers the program, currently has about $6 billion in a contingency fund, the department has said it will not use the money to help fund the program during the shutdown.
State Sen. Nikki Merritt, a Grayson Democrat who chairs the Georgia Legislative Black Caucus, urged Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to help fund the program during a Monday press conference at the state Capitol in Atlanta.

“This shutdown threatens to push vulnerable families even closer to the edge,” Merritt said. “As state leaders, we cannot stand idly by while Georgians endure the ripple effects of political inaction in Washington.”
State Sen. Nabilah Islam Parkes, a Duluth Democrat, led a separate effort and sent a letter to Kemp requesting he declare a state of emergency in response to what she called the “ongoing Trump shutdown.” Parkes urged Kemp to use the state’s $14.6 billion surplus to provide temporary relief. She said that her constituents have already reached out with concerns about how they will feed their families if they lose SNAP benefits next month.
“Food is not optional and we have a moral obligation to see to it that Georgia families do not go hungry,” Parkes said in a statement.
Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff and Sen. Raphael Warnock joined a coalition of Democratic senators in Washington to press the Trump administration to “sustain” the food assistance program. In a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, Democratic senators said they were alarmed that the USDA had instructed states to stop processing November benefits, claiming the agency has “several tools available” to avert a lapse in grocery assistance for American families.
The senators called on the agency to utilize the USDA’s “existing authority,” including its contingency funding and interchange authority, which Democratic senators said allows the transfer of funds from other USDA nutrition programs to SNAP, to ensure benefits continue through November.
But Kemp blamed the impasse on the Democratic leadership in Congress just moments after the Department of Human Services announced Friday it would not administer SNAP benefits in November. He called on Senate Democrats to pass the continuing resolution Republicans passed out of the House, arguing it was “past time … to get back to working for the people of our state.”
“As the impacts of the Schumer shutdown are becoming clearer for Georgians, Democrats like Senators Ossoff and Warnock still refuse to do their jobs and open the government,” Kemp said in a statement Friday. The political stalemate leaves over one million Georgians, including 640,000 children, at risk of hunger. Kemp’s office has not returned a request for comment or publicly indicated whether the governor intends to declare a state of emergency or allocate state funds for the federal program.
Federal food aid for over one million Georgians to stop Nov. 1 because of shutdown

However, coming up with funding for the program is only part of the problem, since the infrastructure used to issue SNAP funding to residents is controlled by the federal government. Some states, including North Dakota, have been unable to load state funding onto participants’ electronic payment cards, according to state officials.
The Georgia Department of Human Services, which helps disperse federal SNAP funds to Georgia residents, did not respond to an email inquiry about Georgia’s SNAP infrastructure.
Nov. 1 also marks the first day of open enrollment for the Affordable Care Act, a program whose rising costs are at the center of the shutdown as federal enhanced premium tax credits are set to expire at the end of this year. If Congress does not extend the credits, Americans could see their monthly insurance premiums more than double on average, according to the nonpartisan health organization KFF. Congressional Democrats have said they will not support a GOP path to reopen the government unless Republicans agree to negotiate on rising health care costs.

(Photo by Skylar Laird/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — State Superintendent Ellen Weaver will ask the Legislature for another $5 million to expand eligibility for performance-based bonuses after 400 teachers received a pay boost for the program’s inaugural year, she said Monday.
The state Department of Education doled out just half of what legislators approved last year for the pilot program: At least one teacher at each of the 37 participating schools received some amount, totaling $2.5 million in bonuses, according to agency.
The state-paid bonuses averaged $6,300. The highest award was $33,500.
The other $2.5 million will roll over into this school year, said department spokesman Jason Raven.
That will give the agency $7.5 million total to award for year two of the pilot. More schools will be participating this school year, though it’s unclear how many. The agency has not yet released specifics.
It’s also unclear why half of last year’s allotment went unspent. Weaver did not address that at a news conference Monday celebrating the awards.
The bonus program is meant to reward teachers for a job well done in an effort to keep the state’s best teachers in their classrooms and encourage student growth, Weaver said.
“The goal of this is to thank our teachers, to support them for the great work that they do, and then to keep them in the classroom,” she said. “We want our very best teachers in the areas where we need them most.”
500 SC teachers got bonuses of up to $57K. Program leaders want to expand them statewide.

Different models
The program expands on a public-private model started at Meeting Street Schools in Charleston County in 2021 and run by Beemok Education, a nonprofit funded by philanthropist Ben Navarro.
Its model compares students’ performance on tests at the beginning and end of the school year to judge their progress.
Schools in the state pilot had the option of having their bonus program overseen by Beemok (but funded by the state). Eleven of the 37 participating schools went with Beemok. Of the 400 teachers receiving a state-funded bonus, 94 were part of Beemok’s announcement earlier this month. Their bonuses averaged $9,135, according to the Department of Education.
Roughly half of the 37 schools based bonuses on students’ performance on end-of-year state-standardized math and reading tests taken by students in third through eighth grades. The average bonus for those teachers was $8,728, according to the agency.
Six schools created their own model to measure academic growth, which included using scores on end-of-course tests taken by high schoolers. Bonuses in those schools averaged $3,315.
In all, more than 800 teachers statewide received a combined $6 million in bonuses, according to numbers provided by Beemok Education and the Department of Education.

Funding request
Weaver is seeking an additional $5 million for bonuses at the end of the 2026-27 school year. That would give her agency three years of data to help craft a potential statewide expansion, Weaver said.
She’s long been a proponent of rewarding teachers for proven performance. Her first budget request in 2023 included a $25 million ask for a bonus program, which the Legislature didn’t fund.
Weaver also plans to continue pushing for higher salaries for all teachers, she said.
Since the 2020 pandemic, the state-required minimum salary for a first-year teacher has risen from $35,000 to $48,500.
Repeating a request from last year, Weaver is again asking legislators to raise the floor to $50,000. The bonuses are meant to supplement state minimums in the so-called salary schedule, which pays teachers based on their years in the classroom and level of college degree, Weaver said.
Rewarding teachers for students’ documented progress “is a really important way for us to incentivize our very strongest teachers into our classrooms where we need them the most,” Weaver said.
Patrick Kelly, a lobbyist for the Palmetto State Teachers Association, said he would be open to seeing some sort of boost for excellent teachers, but he worried about whether a statewide model could be fair to all teachers, including those whose classes didn’t include testing. He suggested teacher evaluations as a more equitable way of distributing bonuses, though even those would need a standardized process first, he told the SC Daily Gazette previously.
Highest performer
At Seven Oaks Elementary Global Magnet in Columbia, 20 teachers — 86% of those eligible — earned awards. That’s the highest proportion of any school participating in the state-funded pilot, according to the Department of Education.
Those teachers earned a total of $141,500, which Weaver presented to the school’s principal in the form of a giant check Monday.

Seven Oaks, part of Lexington-Richland School District Five, exemplifies the program’s goals, Weaver said. A school where more than 85% of its students live in poverty showed more growth than any other, she said.
That shows the dedication of students and staff alike, said Principal Angie Slatton.
“I often say that these children and staff are easy to work hard for,” she said. “They inspire us every single day and truly deserve to be celebrated.”
While Seven Oaks is a magnet school — a public form of school choice — there are no academic requirements for attending. Students outside the normal attendance zone are selected by lottery. The students and staff represent more than 25 nationalities, according to the school’s website.
Jennifer Clyburn, an award winner who teaches first grade, works to tailor her lessons to the specific students in her classes each year instead of sticking to a set lesson plan year after year, she said. She focuses on how her students’ mistakes can help them learn and encourages them to remember there are no bad questions, she said.
Clyburn didn’t say how big of a bonus she received.
“Every lesson, every activity and every experience is designed as a team to close that learning gap that we see, and we help each child move forward step by step, however big or small that is,” Clyburn said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_5323-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 20:16:40.769153

Charlie Copeland detailed a plan from government expansion to private-sector growth
 
WILMINGTON, Del. — Oct. 27, 2025 — Charlie Copeland, the Senior Director on economic, tax and fiscal policy at the Caesar Rodney Institute and one of Delaware’s leading voices on the economy, outlined a pro-growth plan Monday aimed at jump-starting private-sector investment and widening the state’s tax base.
He appeared on the popular live podcast “A Better Discussion,” hosted by Jane Brady, chair of  “A Better Delaware”, at 8 a.m. Monday, Oct. 27, where he detailed a pivot from government expansion to private-sector growth. His plan centers on cutting red tape, rethinking taxes that he says punish small firms, lowering energy costs by rebuilding in-state generation, and strengthening the workforce pipeline through better K–12 results.
“We need leaders with a growth mindset,” Copeland said. “Set my people free… every week, I want a list of 200 regulations we’re going to get rid of.”
Taxes that “hit before profits”
Copeland said Delaware’s corporate income tax is the highest in the nation for operators and that the Gross Receipts Tax (GRT) functions as a hidden sales tax that businesses owe “whether your business is making money or not.”
“It’s wrong to say that Delaware has no sales tax. Delaware has a sales tax,” he said, describing how the levy “pyramids” through the supply chain—farmer, processor, retailer—before goods reach consumers. That structure, he added, drains cash during downturns and slows hiring and investment.
Brady noted residents also feel an everyday bite from tolls and utility and telecom fees, and flagged new annual road-use fees—$120 for electric vehicles and $60 for hybrids—meant to offset declining gas-tax revenue.
Cut regulation, speed permitting
Beyond taxes, Copeland said dense codes and slow permitting chill construction and business expansion. He called for an executive-led rollback modeled on “two-for-one” deregulation—eliminate multiple rules for every new one—and weekly progress checks on permits for housing and job-creating projects.
“Instead of a pro-growth mindset… we have a pro-bureaucracy, pro-regulatory environment,” he said. “Leadership matters.”
Compete on energy again
Pointing to rising electricity prices, Copeland said Delaware went from producing most of its power in-state to importing more, with line losses and higher costs. He criticized past subsidies for Bloom Energy—“$750 million… for nothing”—and urged serious consideration of nuclear and emerging hydrogen technologies to anchor reliable, lower-cost energy for employers.
Keep young founders in Delaware
Copeland tied weak new-business formation to out-migration of young adults, arguing that “we do not have a growth mindset” that gives entrepreneurs speed, cost certainty and talent. He and Brady linked long-term prosperity to improving K–12 results so employers can find the workforce they need in-state.
“There is nothing that is free,” Copeland said of expansive programs. “It is only subsidized”—which, he argued, ultimately falls on families and businesses when growth stalls.
Copeland’s pro-growth pillars (as presented)


Tax modernization: Reduce or restructure the GRT to end pyramiding and stop taxing firms before profit; signal a competitive corporate-tax posture for operators, not just incorporations.


Regulatory reset: Executive-branch mandate to cull outdated rules weekly; fast-track permits for housing and job-creating projects; agency accountability for delays.


Energy competitiveness: Rebuild in-state generation; evaluate nuclear and hydrogen; avoid subsidy deals that raise ratepayer costs without delivering jobs.


Talent & entrepreneurship: Accelerate K–12 reform to improve literacy and math; make Delaware “speed-to-yes” for startups; reduce everyday government friction and fees.


User-fee transparency: Where fees are necessary, prefer clear user-fee models over opaque add-ons; avoid nickel-and-diming that suppresses growth.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/copeland-2.png,,,2025-10-27 20:16:40.769153

SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, helps feed about 1.4 million North Carolinians each month. The federal government shutdown means benefits for November are suspended. 
On Monday, the state Department of Health and Human Services warned people who use SNAP that their next round of monthly benefits won’t arrive on schedule. 
More than 580,000 children rely on SNAP, NCDHHS said in a news release, and more than 80% of people who receive food benefits are working. 
Food banks are doing what they can, though their directors know there’s no way they can fill the gap. 
For every nine meals provided through SNAP, food banks provide one, said Liz Reasoner, CEO of Food Bank of the Albemarle. 
“We’re trying to approach this from a disaster mitigation strategy,” she said. 
The state’s food banks, which supply food pantries and other distributors, were already feeling a financial pinch. A federal program that helped food banks nationwide purchase locally grown food was cancelled this year. The state legislature had routinely appropriated money to food banks, but did not include them in this year’s stopgap budgets. 
The Food Bank of the Albemarle decided to pay for seeds and labor for a local farm to grow vegetables, Reasoner said. “One way we can mitigate some of the loss is by investing in intentional planting programs.” 
The government shutdown was putting pressure on nonprofits before the SNAP suspension. A food pantry in Elizabeth City saw a 50% increase in traffic last Saturday, which Reasoner attributed to paychecks lost through the government shutdown. 
“We knew it was going to happen,” she said, as households adjusted their budgets to account for limited cash. 
Federal benefits that help pay for baby formula set to run out
N.C. Rep. Monika Johnson-Hostler spent part of Monday calling people about providing formula to babies who will lose access to it when funding for the federal nutrition program focused on infants, young children and their mothers runs out. 
With the attention on SNAP, Johnson-Hostler (D-Wake) worried that people won’t know that federal support for parents buying baby formula is also at risk. 
“That’s what’s scary to me,” she said. “I don’t think people knew it was happening.” 
Money for the federal nutrition program Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, won’t end as soon as SNAP does, but won’t last too much longer than the larger program. 
NCDHHS said in an email that benefits will last until early November, but did not give an exact end date. 
Wake County said in an email that WIC will issue benefits through Nov. 15. 
More than 262,000 babies, pregnant women, new mothers, and young children in North Carolina use WIC, according to NCDHHS.
Wake County is advising mothers who are supplementing breast milk with formula to increase breastfeeding to help boost milk supply. 
Pediatricians may be a short-term source of formula, Wake’s email said. In special cases, WIC will coordinate with hospitals or manufacturers to arrange for direct deliveries, the email said. 
Political finger-pointing
In a statement Monday, Democratic Gov. Josh Stein urged the USDA to use federal contingency funds to keep SNAP benefits available after Nov. 1. The USDA said last week it would not use contingency fund to help cover the cost, the New York Times reported. 
“The administration’s refusal to use these available funds as temperatures cool and the Thanksgiving holiday approaches is a cruel abdication of the responsibility to support families and communities,” Stein’s statement said.
Meanwhile, Congressional Republicans and the Trump administration continue to blame Democrats for the shutdown that threatens to suspend food benefits in days. 
Most Democrats have voted against a short-term budget in an effort to pressure Republicans to extend Affordable Care Act marketplace tax credits for health care coverage.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)With just one week before Election Day, Virginia lawmakers returned to the state Capitol Monday for a surprise special session that swiftly turned into a partisan clash over the future of the state’s congressional map — and, potentially, its balance of political power for years to come.
House Democrats, using procedural maneuvers that caught Republicans off guard, pushed through a procedural resolution crafted by House Majority Leader Charniele Herring, D-Alexandria, which, if successful, would allow the General Assembly to consider a proposed constitutional amendment granting lawmakers authority to redraw Virginia’s congressional districts mid-decade. 
Under the resolution, adopted on a party-line vote in both chambers, lawmakers may now consider budget and revenue bills, judicial appointments and constitutional amendments related to redistricting and reapportionment. The measure effectively removes the usual constraints that limit special sessions to subjects designated by the governor or legislative leaders.
“This was an important vote for us to take this week in order for us to have that option,” said Del. Cia Price, D-Newport News, chair of the House Privileges and Elections Committee. “If we were not to take this action right now, then we would be pulling an option from the voters.”
Republicans decried the legislative action as an ambush carried out largely behind closed doors. Democrats argued the procedural expansion is needed to respond to what they view as a growing national campaign by Republicans — encouraged by President Donald Trump — to reengineer congressional maps mid-decade. 
As first reported by The New York Times last week, Democratic strategists, including former Attorney General Eric Holder, have urged Virginia to act preemptively in case federal courts uphold new Republican-drawn maps in states such as Texas, North Carolina and Missouri that could tilt the balance of the U.S. House.
“The actions that Texas and Missouri and North Carolina have taken have triggered this,” Price said. “The trigger has already been pulled when it comes to attacks on our democracy. So that’s why Virginia is here. We are going to do our job to protect democracy in Virginia.”
 Republicans cry foul

Republicans blasted the maneuver as a constitutional overreach designed to change election rules days before voters decide three statewide races. 
House Minority Leader Terry Kilgore, R-Scott, said Democrats had sidelined the minority and the public in an opaque process that left many guessing what was actually being planned.
“There’s a lot of issues that we need to talk about to the voters of Virginia, but obviously the ruling party had other plans,” Kilgore told reporters on the House floor. “Just let it be known that we do think that this was a plan to take us out of having any motions of personal privilege. … I just want to know from our side, because we’re not privy to all this, are we going to have a redistricting constitutional amendment coming to the floor?”

Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington, accused Democrats of hiding the ball: “You know a bill is a bad idea when a member mumbles through their description of it and refuses to take questions and sits back down,” O’Quinn said. “They don’t want morning hour speeches, so you’re getting to see a really bad idea play out in real time.”
Republicans also questioned whether Democrats had already missed the legal window to advance a constitutional amendment this year. 
Del. Bobby Orrock, R-Spotsylvania, cited Virginia Code § 30-13, which requires proposed constitutional amendments to be posted publicly at least three months before the next House of Delegates election.
“That deadline has already passed,” Orrock said on the House floor, arguing that any amendment passed this week could not legally appear before voters in November.
Del. Lee Ware, R-Powhatan, warned that Democrats were defying centuries of precedent. 
“Here we are, eight days before Election Day, near the conclusion of our 46-day election season, in Richmond,” Ware said. “The purpose of this unprecedented special session during an election is to hitch Virginia, belatedly, to the pell-mell bandwagon, to redistrict, or to speak more honestly, to gerrymander, the commonwealth’s electoral districts.”
 Democrats: Amendment only creates an “option”

Price and other Democrats maintained that the move does not dismantle Virginia’s independent redistricting commission, approved by voters in 2020, but merely creates an additional safeguard should courts or federal actions reshape national political boundaries.
Del. Rodney Willett, D-Henrico, who will carry the proposed constitutional amendment, said the plan “is going to give us options.”
“Maybe the most important point to make here is what the resolution is not going to do, which is to abolish the commission that was created through the earlier constitutional amendment,” Willett said. 
“This is to create, again, not a mandate, but an option, in the interim, in between those decennial redistrictings to do something when there’s an extraordinary circumstance.”
He added that the move was necessary because “our hand’s been forced here. This is not our choice to be here, but with this kind of attack, we’ve got to respond.”
Democratic House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, who last week called lawmakers back to Richmond, declined to outline his full plan publicly. But some Democratic leaders told Virginia Scope last week that the goal is to prevent Virginia’s representation in Congress from being weakened if neighboring states redraw their maps to favor Republicans.
 Earle-Sears, GOP candidates seize on the optics

Before the session opened, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears — who presided over the state Senate Monday and is also the Republican nominee for governor — staged a campaign-style news conference on the Capitol steps, accusing Democrats of abusing their majority for partisan gain.
“Today, Democrats in our General Assembly are calling this special session, not to serve the people, but to serve ourselves,” Earle-Sears said. “They want to dismantle the very independent redistricting commission that Virginia was voting for in a bipartisan majority.”
Earle-Sears called the commission “born out of a prayer, a rare moment of unity, when Democrats and Republicans alike agreed that voters … should choose their own representatives, and not the other way around.”

 She linked the move directly to her Democratic opponent, Abigail Spanberger, saying, “This pressure is coming from Washington insiders and Abigail Spanberger. What we are seeing today is the worst kind of political backtracking, an attempt to grab power by erasing the voter’s voice.”
Her remarks came as national attention turned to a $150,000 donation each from Holder’s National Democratic Redistricting Committee to Spanberger’s campaign and to Virginia House Democrats. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin seized on that timing Monday, accusing Spanberger of hypocrisy.
“This was Abigail Spanberger’s position just a few short years ago,” Youngkin wrote on X, citing her 2019 praise of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling striking down racially gerrymandered districts. “All it took was $150,000 from the ‘Democrat Redistricting Committee’ to change her position completely,” Youngkin wrote.
Spanberger has not commented publicly on the current effort. In an August interview with WJLA, she said she opposed mid-decade redistricting and warned against “politicians trying to tilt the playing field in their favor,” aligning herself with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore’s call for fair-maps legislation.
Republican lieutenant governor nominee John Reid on Monday echoed Earle-Sears’ criticism, saying Democrats were “not respecting the will of the people.”
“They made it very clear, just five years ago, they don’t want petty partisanship,” Reid said. “They don’t want politicians drawing their own lines … this is not respectful to the people in Virginia.”
 GOP congressional delegation joins chorus

Earlier in the day, Virginia’s five Republican members of Congress — U.S. Reps. Morgan Griffith, Jen Kiggans, Rob Wittman, Ben Cline and John McGuire — held a joint news conference at the Capitol condemning the Democratic move.
Griffith, a former House majority leader in the state legislature, said he had firsthand experience with partisan line-drawing. 
“I was a part of partisan redistricting, but the voters of Virginia spoke in 2020 that they didn’t like that happening,” he said. Griffith argued that a special session after early voting had already begun “deprives those who have voted early” of the chance to weigh the issue.

Kiggans, who represents a competitive swing district in Hampton Roads, called the proposal a cynical replay of Washington dysfunction. “It’s a competitive district, and always will be,” she said, likening the Democratic plan to “partisan games in Washington” that have “now trickled down here to Richmond.” 
 Legal doubts and political fallout

Republican Party of Virginia Chair Mark Peake, a state senator from Lynchburg, told The Mercury in an interview Monday that the Democratic proposal was “unconstitutional.”
“There is no intervening election,” Peake said. “Nine-hundred thousand people have already voted. They’re supposed to post it in courthouses for three months before the election. They don’t have a bill, they don’t have a constitutional amendment. It’s not going through. As I said, it’s a ruse.”
Peake predicted “this will 100 percent end up in court.” 
He dismissed comparisons to Trump’s mid-decade redistricting push in Texas. 
“Where we are different is, we have a constitutional amendment in place that says how we do redistricting. Not mid-decade, it’s every decade. And it’s bipartisan.”
 Broader stakes: A national redistricting arms race

The New York Times reported last week that Virginia Democrats’ rush to act stems from a fear that Republican-controlled states could redraw congressional boundaries before 2026, potentially costing Democrats several seats. 
Trump’s public calls for GOP legislatures to redistrict mid-decade have prompted a flurry of legal and legislative action in Texas, Missouri and North Carolina. The U.S. Supreme Court is also currently weighing a major redistricting case from Louisiana.
In that context, Democrats in Virginia — one of only a few southern states with divided political control in recent years — see a constitutional amendment as both a defensive measure and a statement of principle.
But even some Democrats privately concede that the optics of returning to Richmond just days before an election could prove risky, particularly as Republicans work to cast the move as proof of overreach.
 Next steps and uncertain path ahead

Price, whose committee oversees election law, said the Privileges and Elections Committee would meet Wednesday morning to review the amendment text, followed by a potential vote in the full House later this week. 
She emphasized that the amendment would require approval again in the next legislative session and voter ratification in a statewide referendum before taking effect.
“I’ve been here for 10 years,” Price said. “We’ve had several proposed constitutional amendments, and when the Republicans were in charge, they weren’t worried about what they were bringing up. We are fully within our right to be here.”
Still, the legal and political obstacles are formidable. 
Virginia law requires constitutional amendments to be approved by two separately elected General Assemblies, meaning even if Democrats pass it this week, it would need to survive another vote after the new legislature convenes in January — and then win approval at the ballot box in 2026.
Republicans appear determined to challenge the process in court before it gets that far. “They’re wasting our time,” Peake, the RPV chair, said flatly. “It’s going to be overturned as soon as it gets to court.”
As night fell on the Capitol, lawmakers filtered out of the chamber with few clear answers and even fewer signs of bipartisan consensus. 
Price, standing outside the chamber doors, said Democrats would proceed carefully but deliberately.
“It’s important that we have all of our options on the table,” she said again. “This is about protecting democracy in Virginia.”

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator).Louisiana’s largest provider of aid for sexual assault survivors cut back on services this month as a result of not receiving funding before the federal government shutdown. 
Sexual Trauma Awareness and Response, or STAR, had to halt its hospital accompaniment program, where staff members support victims going through an evidence-gathering medical exam after a sexual assault. 

STAR serves sexual assault survivors in 15 parishes in central and southeast Louisiana. The organization’s hospital accompaniment services will stop for the foreseeable future in St. Tammany Parish and the New Orleans area, where other nonprofits also provide that service. 

In Baton Rouge and Alexandria, STAR hopes to be able to resume hospital accompaniment in November after not offering it in October. But the organization will have to cut back on other services to do so, said Morgan Lamandre, its CEO. In those regions, STAR is the only entity to send staff into hospitals. 
To pay for hospital accompaniment in Baton Rouge and Alexandria, Lamandre will have to shut down STAR’s case management program. It gives sexual assault survivors help accessing crime victims’ funding, health care and other assistance in the weeks and months after their assault. Those processes can be bureaucratic and confusing for those not used to navigating them, which is why STAR offers that support to their clients.
But Lamandre said the organization has to prioritize its hospital accompaniment program in Baton Rouge and Alexandria because the nonprofit needs to offer the service in order to keep its accreditation and some other funding. 

STAR and other Louisiana organizations that help sexual assault survivors have found themselves in a difficult financial position because much of their funding has been cut off while the federal government is shuttered.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

During previous D.C. shutdowns, federal assistance for crime victims continued to flow. But the Trump administration has  shuttered the federal crime victim offices this time, Louisiana Foundation Against Sexual Assault executive director Rafael de Castro said in an interview earlier this month.

In the case of STAR, the organization was awarded a $700,000 federal grant it can’t access because the federal staff who administer it are not working. The nonprofit had also expected to hear at the beginning of October about whether it had won a $1.2 million grant it typically receives every year. But with the government closed, a notice about the award hasn’t been sent yet.

“We could have the grant, but we don’t know if we have the grant. We need to assume we are not getting the grant,” Lamandre said. 

The shutdown resulted from an impasse in Congress over the extent to which the federal government should subsidize health care coverage for people who purchase their insurance through a government exchange. Democrats want a vote assuring tax credits to make those health plans more affordable will continue. Republicans believe the debate over the cost of the health care plans should be dealt with separately. 
In the meantime, more than a million federal employees are not getting paid, and scores of federally funded services are not being provided. 
Louisiana lawmakers announced last week they plan to use $150 million monthly to help pay for residents’ groceries while a federal food assistance program isn’t operating. 
Lamandre and de Castro said they intend to ask for $2 million in permanent state funding for sexual assault survivor centers to be added to the Louisiana budget next year. Over half of STAR’s budget currently comes from federal grants, but Lamandre fears Washington, D.C., will no longer provide financial stability for her organization and others. 

Louisiana also provides very little of its own funding for sexual assault survivor support and programs. This year, the state’s domestic violence shelters and child advocacy centers, which serve children who are victims of abuse, received $7 million and $1.2 million in general state revenue, respectively. Sexual assault survivor centers received no comparable allocation. 
“There are no state dollars provided to stand-alone sexual assault centers like STAR,” Lamandre said. 

Louisiana uses unclaimed gambling winnings each year to pay hospitals, nurses and other medical providers for performing forensic medical exams, during which physical evidence of a sexual crime can be collected. That fund has about $6.2 million currently, but it doesn’t pay for counseling, legal assistance or the other support sexual assault survivor centers provide, according to the Louisiana Commission on Law Enforcement.
A new law, sponsored by state Rep. Kellee Dickerson, R-Denham Springs, was crafted with the intention of creating a new source of funding for sexual assault, child abuse and domestic violence victim service providers. But Lamandre has doubts that it will become a reliable source of money. 

The law assesses a new $2,000 fine on people convicted of crimes related to sexual assault, human trafficking and domestic violence. In theory, it could produce over $1 million per year based on the approximately 500 convictions these offenses produce annually, according to a fiscal analysis of the bill.  
But people imprisoned for such crimes often don’t have the means to pay criminal fines after they become incarcerated. Prison jobs pay as little as less than a dollar per hour, and incarcerated people have other financial obligations – such as child support and victim reparations – they are also required to cover, according to previous reports on Louisiana’s criminal justice system. 

A financial analysis of the new law also notes that the $1 million might be difficult to collect on time, explaining that “current law provides that indigent offenders may be placed on a payment plan and therefore the $2,000 may be dispersed across multiple fiscal years.”
“The likeliness we will see any meaningful funding from that bill is not so high,” Lamandre said at a legislative hearing last month on child sexual abuse.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/IMG_2604-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 19:57:02.208477

The renovation of the Latino Center of the Midlands along a historic commercial corridor was kickstarted by a $2.8 million award from the State of Nebraska’s North and South Omaha Recovery Grant Program.

Anticipated completion in early 2027 will take the center from about 17,000 square feet to nearly 29,000 square feet, officials said. Walls will fall between the longtime headquarters and an adjacent bank building the nonprofit bought last year. Additional space will be created, including outward extension of the top floor and a new deck area.
All services, including workforce development programming that had been offered in a leased spot a block away, will be under one roof  — with space carved out for such features as a training kitchen envisioned as a hub for pop-up restaurants and community events.
“We will be able to serve more people more completely because we have more space,” said CEO and president Albert Varas. 
A groundbreaking reception is scheduled Tuesday. 
Rooted in Chicano movement
Philanthropic and private donor funds complement the state grant in covering the $10 million for the capital project at 4821 S. 24th St. Fundraising efforts for future operating funds are ongoing, Varas said.
The Latino center expansion was part of a bundle of South Omaha projects submitted in an application led by nonprofit Canopy South, which is acting as a sort of “community quarterback.” The resulting $64 million award from the Nebraska Department of Economic Development is divided among seven entities, including the Latino center. 	

Construction activity picks up
The funding source for the $235 million North and South Omaha Recovery Grant Program started with deadline-strapped COVID-19 federal dollars, but a swap with state dollars later occurred to allow more time for a complex slate of projects to develop. Sharing the funds are about 130 groups and businesses, whose selection by state officials were based on potential for helping to reverse disinvestment. The dollars are to be spent by the end of 2027 — a deadline that has prompted a flurry of recent groundbreakings.



César García, executive director of Canopy South, called the Latino center’s extensive renovation “a transformative investment” in South Omaha — opening more pathways to health, education and opportunity.”
Described as the largest Latino-serving agency in Nebraska’s most populous city, the center was born as the Chicano Awareness Center. Its roots go back to the 1960s when the local Mexican-American community and youths were tuned in to the Chicano civil rights movement in larger places such as California, and feeling effects of discrimination in their own city. 
Local leaders began meeting with the goal of creating a self-esteem-building and advocacy hub where young people could affirm their heritage and gain leadership skills.
The Chicano Awareness Center launched formally in 1971 and in 1974 moved into the space on the 24th Street corridor. The range of services and bilingual advocacy efforts grew — to art and culture, anti-gang and anti-drug programming, educational and student support, English language learner classes, civic engagement, family well-being, summer internships and workforce development. 
In 2007, the nonprofit changed its name to Latino Center of the Midlands to better reflect the growing and broader population from various Spanish-speaking countries. The center’s staff has grown to 36 people.
Coffees, community conversations
The renovated headquarters will feature youth-centric areas and modern classrooms to enhance GED, citizenship and literacy programs. A new teaching kitchen will promote nutrition education and is expected to be a “social enterprise” space to host coffee conversations and guest speakers.
The expansion also will allow the center to lease office space in the facility to area nonprofits with similar missions, said Varas.

“We recognize we can’t fix everything,” he said, adding that providing a common ground where clients can easily access services of other organizations is key to solving a community’s needs.
Existing services of the center will continue without disruption at a temporary site a block away at 4937 S. 24th St. until the renovation is complete.
“The Latino center has long been a cornerstone in our community and this expansion ensures its impact will only grow stronger for generations to come,” Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. said in a statement.
Yesenia Peck, president of the Nebraska Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said the center is a standing testament to the drive and vision of the local Latino community. 
“We look forward to the ways it will keep building opportunity and prosperity for Omaha,” she said.
‘More complex needs’
Varas said the needs of immigrants, Latinos and other communities the center serves have evolved and in this era are more complex. He foresees the more modern and larger facility allowing opportunity for a “deeper” response. 
“For over five decades, we’ve walked alongside families in South Omaha. This expansion allows us to grow with them, breaking down barriers, expanding programs and serving more youth and families.”

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Nearly 75,000 South Dakotans — roughly one in 12 residents — will lose food assistance benefits if the federal government shutdown persists into next week, state officials acknowledged Monday. 
The state has no plan to cover benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program if Congress doesn’t act before the program’s funding runs out. The program provides qualifying low-income people — who must meet work requirements, unless they qualify for an exemption — with a preloaded card they can use to help cover grocery purchases.
“If the federal government’s shutdown continues and SNAP benefits are not funded in November, recipients will not receive SNAP benefits for that month,” said the state Department of Social Services. “The federal government has communicated that states would not be reimbursed if they choose to fund benefits to SNAP recipients.”
The federal program provided $14.76 million worth of assistance to 74,459 South Dakotans in September — including 33,198 children. 
Another safety net program supplying food and formula to women, infants and children, known as WIC, is also set to run out of federal funding next week if the shutdown continues. WIC serves about 13,800 South Dakotans monthly.
The South Dakota Department of Health did not answer a question from South Dakota Searchlight asking if the department plans to use state funding to keep the program running.
“At this time, WIC benefits remain available, and the program operations are continuing as normal,” a department spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Impossible for nonprofits to fill federal funding gap
Food insecurity professionals told members of the Downtown Sioux Falls Rotary Club during a panel discussion on Monday that food shouldn’t be used as a political bargaining chip.
One in five South Dakota children are food insecure, Feeding South Dakota Executive Director Lori Dykstra said. More than 70% of participants in South Dakota’s SNAP program have children in their families.

Dykstra said she understands South Dakota’s decision not to fund November SNAP benefits “from a budgeting standpoint,” but she added that “a lot of states are making those decisions; some states are choosing to fund it.”
New York, for example, will supply $30 million in state emergency food assistance. On Friday, 23 state attorneys general sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and questioned the legal basis for the agency to pause benefits for SNAP.
The state Department of Social Services said it is “closely monitoring federal developments” with the program and working to connect people with local resources, including through the Helpline Center. The department’s website says remaining balances from October and earlier will stay available for use.
Panelists encouraged South Dakotans to volunteer their time or donate to food pantries across the state.
Dykstra added that Feeding South Dakota is working to create an emergency response plan to address a spike in food insecurity if the shutdown continues. The hunger relief nonprofit already lost 1.5 million pounds of food to federal cuts in March. 
“We need to be prepared,” Dykstra said. “But we also can’t meet the entire gap.”
For every one meal Feeding South Dakota provides, SNAP provides nine. “We cannot make that up in a matter of a couple of weeks,” Dykstra added.
Disruption could stress hospital systems, child safety
Stasia Elsinger, a dietitian with Avera Health, told South Dakota Searchlight after the panel discussion that she expects hospitalizations to rise across South Dakota if SNAP benefits end — especially in areas of the state with high rates of diabetes and other chronic illnesses. Native Americans are 1.8 times more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes than other South Dakotans, according to the state Department of Health.

“We are all one medical diagnosis, one car accident, one family emergency away from also being food insecure,” Elsinger told Rotary members. “We have patients who went from doing great to needing to utilize programs like these just to survive. We see it every day, and we’re seeing it more and more now.”
The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe declared a state of emergency due to the government shutdown over the weekend, citing the temporary impact to SNAP and WIC programs.
Department of Social Services Secretary Matt Althoff said in a Board of Social Services meeting earlier this month that the department is “crossing our fingers that reason prevails in Washington” to continue the SNAP program.
Board member Stacey Tieszen said at the meeting that the fallout from the disrupted program will happen right away and could cost the state more in the long run. Tieszen serves as CEO of the Sioux Falls Area Court Appointed Special Advocate nonprofit.
“Families that are stressed are not good parents. Those parents might end up making poor choices,” Tieszen said at the time. “That might lead to substance abuse issues; they might hurt their children. Then that all impacts DSS because then there are removals and foster care.”
SNAP loss could hurt grocery stores
Dykstra told South Dakota Searchlight after the panel that the loss of SNAP benefits would impact the state economically, and is especially important for rural grocery stores.
“I don’t want to see more closures,” Dykstra said.
Upcoming federal food assistance pause intensifies shutdown fight

RF Buche, president and CEO of GF Buche Co. in South Dakota, told South Dakota Searchlight that his stores stay open past midnight on days that benefits are loaded on SNAP cards — the 10th of each month.
All 25 stores owned by Buche, which include Buche Foods and Gus Stops, are on or near tribal land. A majority of Buche’s customers use SNAP, he added.
Parents carry or push their sleeping children in carts as they stock up for the month, Buche said, adding that some customers likely “haven’t eaten in days.” He added that if the SNAP funding is disrupted, it’ll be “devastating” for communities he serves.
“I don’t know how anybody in good conscience could sit there and not worry about those struggles,” Buche said.
Team Buche Cares had been planning to donate 50,000 Thanksgiving meals this year, but Buche said he now plans to give $100 worth of groceries per SNAP household if the shutdown continues past Nov. 10. If the shutdown ends before then, he plans to use that money for Thanksgiving.
“Unfortunately, we may not have the choice to get to Thanksgiving,” Buche said. “I don’t think starvation will wait around until Team Buche Cares provides Thanksgiving meals. It’s going to begin November 10th.”

(Aerial photography by Ed Saunders)Customers shouldn’t be on the hook for nearly $50 million in cost overruns NorthWestern Energy incurred to build the Yellowstone County Generating Station, according to the Montana Consumer Counsel.
Those “substantial” overruns stem from “unnecessary development risks” NorthWestern Energy took to build the plant, according to briefing from the state’s consumer watchdog in an open rate case before the Montana Public Service Commission.
The plant, built without preapproval from the PSC, was estimated to have cost $320 million in August 2024.
In briefing, the Montana Consumer Counsel argues the PSC should not relieve NorthWestern of “any responsibility” for additional costs related to the plant and associated returns it “seeks to fully recover from ratepayers.”
But the Montana Consumer Counsel isn’t the only party that’s arguing NorthWestern took “unnecessary” risks in developing the plant and the Public Service Commission should turn down its request to recover costs from customers.
In fact, one group of parties, the Joint Parties, argues NorthWestern isn’t entitled to recover costs from the “imprudent investment” at all given “less-costly and less-risky alternatives” were available.
The Joint Parties are comprised of the Montana Environmental Information Center, Human Resource Council District XI, Natural Resources Defense Council, and NW Energy Coalition.
The costs of the Yellowstone County Generating Station, a methane-fired electrical generation plant in Laurel, are one major contested issue in a significant case pending before the Public Service Commission.
The case was heard before the PSC in June, and a recommendation from agency staff is expected to be released in November.
NorthWestern Energy argues the plant is needed and is already saving customers money — $11.08 a month on average, or 9%, for residential customers as of Oct. 1.
In an email, NorthWestern spokesperson Jo Dee Black said the plant, operating since October 2024, has been helping serve customers “more affordably and reliably.”
“It supports the grid during high demand and balances the ups and downs of wind and solar power,” Black said in an email. “By using YCGS, NorthWestern avoids buying more expensive energy from the market and can sell extra power when it’s not needed locally — benefiting customers.”
(Black did not respond to a question about whether the entire plant is online yet; two of the 18 units were not working when the plant started running.)
Typically, NorthWestern and other parties negotiate settlements in large cases before the Public Service Commission, and then they request approval from regulators.
In this case, four agreements are pending approval from the PSC, but the costs of the Yellowstone plant are a sticking point for most of the parties in the case besides NorthWestern Energy itself.
 Cost overruns

The Montana Consumer Counsel argues NorthWestern’s request for $305.5 million in total Yellowstone plant construction costs represents “a significant increase” to estimates it presented the PSC.
As recently as a 2022 case, NorthWestern estimated total construction costs at $256 million, the Consumer Counsel said.
The company included contingency costs, but it still underestimated construction by at least $49.5 million, and it wants customers to pay for the consequences of its own risks, writes the Montana Consumer Counsel.
It said NorthWestern wants the PSC to approve an annual rate increase of $47.9 million associated with the plant, which presumes recovery of $287.5 million in construction costs, an amount that includes a reduction for a couple of units not yet online.
But the Consumer Counsel argues cost overruns were poorly documented, and the Public Service Commission can hold NorthWestern accountable by disallowing $48 million in cost overruns.
NorthWestern, however, argues the cost overruns, or “construction change orders,” weren’t the fault of the utility.
It said some of the delays were due to lawsuits “caused by environmental groups,” and others from “force majeure events,” such as supply chain disruptions, a fire at a copper factory, a shutdown in China, and the Yellowstone River flood.
But the Large Customer Group (which represents a coalition of large businesses such as refineries) and Federal Executive Agencies agreed with the Montana Consumer Counsel.
It said the PSC should ensure “NorthWestern’s customers are not bearing the burden of compensating the company for its lack of cost discipline.” It said cutting out cost overruns should translate into $12.2 million in reduced revenue requirement too, citing the MCC.
The Public Service Commission regulates monopoly utilities, and as such, acts as “a substitute for competitive markets,” the groups argue. And competitive markets are “ruthless,” the groups state, citing a NorthWestern witness.
“For regulators to act in place of the market, which provides no safeguards for poor decision-making, they must disallow imprudent costs and preventable cost overruns,” the groups said. “Otherwise, utilities lack important incentives to prevent such negative cost incurrences in the future.”
 No preapproval from PSC

NorthWestern built the plant without preapproval, so it should own the results of its decision, argued multiple parties.
The record shows NorthWestern was aware of the “greater risks” of building a large fossil fuel facility “in a time of significant economic uncertainty,” but it still withdrew its request for preapproval by the Public Service Commission, argue the Joint Parties.
The utility withdrew its request for preapproval before a ruling by the PSC or even a hearing, and as such, it assumed all the risks of the action, the parties said.
But preapproval isn’t required, and in its own plea to the Public Service Commission, NorthWestern said just because an action is risky doesn’t make it imprudent. The utility also pointed out that when a different project cost less than estimated, the Montana Consumer Counsel wanted the PSC to approve the actual costs.
“This arbitrary reasoning is unhelpful to the commission, which must be principled in exercising its rate-setting authority,” NorthWestern said in its brief.
 Gaming the system, parties say

In fact, another participant in the case, Renewable Northwest, and other parties argue NorthWestern never even proved the plant was needed; it intentionally manipulated a procurement process to engineer the outcome it wanted by using a method no other utility uses.
And constructing its own plant would be a favorable outcome for NorthWestern because utilities profit from such expenses, argue the Joint Parties.
“Natural gas generation is expensive and along with associated infrastructure would significantly add to the company’s rate base,” on which they earn a rate of return, the Joint Parties said in documents.
NorthWestern said it followed “a deliberate, cautious process,” and it used the Public Service Commission’s own planning and procurement guidelines. It said other parties were included, and the PSC never told NorthWestern to stop or even pause in the selection process.
But the Public Service Commission had informed NorthWestern about flaws in its process, argued the Large Customer Group. It said NorthWestern moved ahead anyway, knowing in advance the investment was “more likely to experience cost disallowance.”
The Montana Consumer Counsel said evidence showed other bids NorthWestern considered “represented more competitive and less risky options” compared to the Yellowstone plant, citing testimony from a professor emeritus of energy studies and consulting economist, David Dismukes.
“In particular, he (Dismukes) noted that an existing natural gas combined-cycle generation turbine (“CCGT”) option consistently had the lowest cost across all of NorthWestern’s planning sensitivity scenarios,” wrote the Montana Consumer Counsel.
NorthWestern passed on “such turn-key options” and chose to build its own generation, an option “it knew or should have known would be vulnerable to legal challenges, contested permitting, environmental and other public opposition, significant cost overruns, and multiple claims of force majeure as construction proceeded,” said the Montana Consumer Counsel.
In fact, the Joint Parties said NorthWestern itself reported such risks in one of its reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The parties argued the Public Service Commission should cap the additional costs it allows NorthWestern to include in its base rates to the amount it would have incurred through “reasonable” planning — if it adds any capital costs at all.
Details about the more affordable CCGT option are redacted in the briefs and in filed testimony.
Renewable Northwest said evidence in the record shows NorthWestern used “non-industry standard planning practices” to model its resource needs, and in doing so, “exposed Montana to the risk of unjust and unreasonable rates.”
It has since obfuscated answers to questions in the case, making it impossible to find the utility prudently incurred costs, according to the brief.
“NorthWestern’s planning practices have effectively placed a thumb on the scale when it comes to resource selection and rendered it impossible for the utility to meet its burden to demonstrate that the portfolio for which it now seeks to recover costs from Montana consumers was prudently conceived,” Renewable Northwest said.
It argued the Public Service Commission should conduct a full review and require NorthWestern to demonstrate its request is “based on just and reasonable rates and is in the public interest.”
NorthWestern, though, argues the other parties misunderstand one “fundamental issue” in the case, and that’s reliability.
“If the commission accepts their arguments and discourages investment in NorthWestern’s system by disallowing costs recovery for investments like the Yellowstone County Generating Station, then it inhibits NorthWestern’s ability to provide reliable service,” NorthWestern said in briefing.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Methane-Plant2.int_-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-10-27 19:57:02.208477

A pair of lawsuits remain pending in state courts as of this week alleging wrongdoing by Gillett prior to her resignation. Utility officials, including those at Eversource and United Illuminating, accuse the former chair of wielding unilateral control over the authority throughout her six-year tenure.
If successful, the lawsuits could force PURA to relitigate at least one case in which it denied the rate increases sought by two gas companies owned by UI’s parent company, Avangrid.
In addition, attorneys for the utilities are continuing their fight to uncover records they say will showcase Gillett’s alleged anti-utility bias — with the potential to further undermine past and pending decisions by PURA. 
On Monday, the utilities scored an initial victory when PURA offered to resolve one of the lawsuits by conceding that Gillett had violated the law by appointing herself as the “presiding officer” over cases without the approval of her fellow commissioners.
Gillett did not respond to a request for comment Monday.
Another recent controversy arising from PURA has to do with the authority’s general counsel, Scott Muska. On Friday, a blog run by former state lawmaker Kevin Rennie published an email in which PURA Executive Secretary Jeff Gaudiosi accused Muska of flouting public records laws and giving “intentionally misleading and false” information under oath.
Muska could not be reached for comment on Monday. A spokeswoman for PURA declined to comment on the allegation, citing an “active personnel investigation.”
Gov. Ned Lamont’s office also declined to comment specifically on the allegation against Muska. A spokesman for the governor, Rob Blanchard, said lawsuits were counterproductive to Lamont’s efforts to reset the relationship between PURA and the utilities — which began with his appointment of four new members to the authority’s board, including new chairman Thomas Wiehl.
“He certainly wants to see things move forward, and continuing litigation is not going to help things in that case,” Blanchard said. 
A spokeswoman for Eversource, Tricia Modifica, said in a statement Monday that the company was looking forward to working with Wiehl and the new slate of commissioners. Still, she argued that further scrutiny of Gillett’s actions as chair is warranted.
“Lawful, transparent, and consistent regulatory processes are all essential in order for regulated utilities to provide value to customers for their electric, heat, and water service,” Modifica said. “When that process is opaque and purposely undermined for inappropriate purposes, there is harm. Customers in Connecticut have the right to know what regulatory decisions were made in this manner; how those decisions were made; and what led to various changes to their bills in recent years and, importantly, in future years.”
A spokesperson for Avangrid declined to comment Monday on the company’s active lawsuits.
The allegation against Muska appeared to stem from a lawsuit filed by Avangrid’s two gas utilities, Connecticut Natural Gas Co. and Southern Connecticut Gas. While the case is nominally about PURA’s 2024 decision to slash the companies’ combined revenues by $35 million, attorneys for Avangrid have focused much of their attention on Gillett and whether or not she played a role in drafting an op-ed last year accusing the utilities of spreading “propaganda” regarding their finances.
If Gillett helped write the piece — an allegation both she and authors have repeatedly denied, including under oath — then she should have recused herself from weighing in on the companies’ rate cases, the attorneys argue.
During a hearing in the case in June, Gillett revealed through her attorneys that her personal cell phone had been set to automatically delete text messages after a period of 30 days. The revelation came months after attorneys for Avangrid had first sought access to the chair’s communications — and too late for text messages she exchanged with one of the op-ed’s authors to be recovered.
Since then, the judge overseeing the case, Matthew Budzik, has been probing PURA and about why the disclosure regarding Gillett’s text messages was not made sooner.
At another hearing last week, Budzik reportedly said he was holding Muska and Assistant Attorney General Seth Hollander responsible for misleading the court, according to the Hartford Courant. The paper also reported that Hollander told the judge that “someone at PURA” was aware of the deletion function on Gillett’s phone, but chose not notify the court earlier.
PURA, meanwhile, has offered to resolve the case by agreeing to reconsider the gas companies’ request for a rate increase. Avangrid’s attorneys have rejected that offer for the time being, arguing that the authority is merely seeking to cover up “inconvenient facts” surrounding Gillett’s tenure. (PURA re-upped its offer on Monday, adding the stipulation that Gillett’s actions while overseeing the case were illegal. Avangrid has yet to respond to that filing.)
In a notice to the court on Monday, Avangrid’s attorneys referred to Gaudiosi as a “whistleblower” and used his allegations against Muska, PURA’s general counsel, to bolster their request to depose the authors of the op-ed. A spokesperson for the Attorney General’s office declined to comment on the allegations.
“Mr. Guadiosi’s [sic] disclosures further demonstrate a deeply rooted culture of noncompliance with document retention and production obligations at the highest levels of PURA,” the company’s filing states. “They also provide additional evidence of PURA’s subversion of its discovery obligations in these very proceedings.”
Budzik has yet to issue a ruling on either the company’s request or PURA’s offer to reconsider the underlying rate case. 
Gaudiosi was also set to appear on Monday before the Connecticut Freedom of Information Commission to testify on a complaint lodged last year by Eversource alleging that PURA had failed to adequately respond to the company’s public records requests. 
That hearing was postponed, however, after the state attorney general’s office filed a notice with the commission stating that “previously unknown information and allegations” were likely to be presented at the hearing. Assistant Attorney General James Zimmer, who is representing PURA in that matter, said he needed more time to prepare a response to the allegations.
The other pending lawsuit alleging wrongdoing dates back to January when a coalition of the state’s largest utilities sued PURA, alleging Gillett had sidelined her fellow commissioners by appointing herself the presiding officer over hundreds of cases and issuing rulings under the guise of the authority. Earlier this month the judge overseeing that case, Elizabeth J. Stewart, dismissed both the state and PURA from the lawsuit on immunity grounds.
However, she allowed the suit to continue against Gillett and two of her fellow commissioners, David Arconti and Michael Caron. 
During a hearing in that case last week in Hartford, Thomas Murphy, an attorney for the utilities, sought permission to depose six members of PURA’s staff, including Gaudiosi, Caron and former commissioner Jack Betkoski. Murphy said the depositions were necessary to shed light on the practices that were put in place under Gillett while the agency transitions toward new leadership.
“The best thing for the new commissioners is that they know what happened in the past,” Murphy said. 
Stewart, the judge, blocked such depositions from taking place for the time being, but scheduled another hearing in the case for Nov. 3.
PURA’s filing on Monday — conceding that Gillett’s practice of appointing herself presiding officer had violated state law — was submitted by Hollander, the assistant attorney general. He also noted that PURA had agreed to modify its procedures to comply with the law.
The ongoing lawsuits are also taking place as PURA is due to issue a series of major rulings over the next month. Those cases include requests to raise rates for customers of both United Illuminating and the Yankee Gas Company, as well as a proposed sale of Eversource’s Aquarion Water Company to the South Central Connecticut Regional Water Authority.
The first of those decisions, UI’s request for a rate increase on its electric customers, is due to be released on Tuesday.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2025_1027_SR_Pura_042-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-10-27 19:57:02.208477

On the north side of the TRAX Power Station, a Salt Lake City affordable housing development has opened its doors, and the Star of India, a neighborhood staple, has a new facade. However, what may constitute the biggest change in the area broke ground on the south side of the station on Monday.
Rocky Mountain Power started construction on its new 10-story, 300,000-square-foot, all-electric headquarters, which alongside a potential Major League Baseball stadium, is set to become the landmark of the so-called Power District on Salt Lake City’s west side.

MLB leaders haven’t released any team expansion plans, and won’t do so until MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred steps down from his role in 2029. But, with baseball insiders putting Salt Lake City on a shortlist of potential expansion markets, the Larry H. Miller Company, which is developing the district, hopes to have a foundation ready to host professional baseball. 
“It’s a physical symbol that there’s progress being made at a site that would be the perfect location for Major League Baseball,” Steve Starks, CEO at the Larry H. Miller Company said on Monday, “and so when baseball gets ready to expand, and the owners decide, the commissioner is ready, they’ll look at this site and they’ll see there’s already momentum.”
SLC may not have an MLB team yet, but has a deadline if it wants a say in stadium plans

When finished, the campus will join a 100-acre sports and entertainment district that aspires to become an extension of downtown and is governed by a state-appointed authority born out of a law the Utah Legislature approved in 2024. That legislation also created a tax structure to raise up to $900 million to help fund the stadium.   
Since the law passed, the Larry H. Miller Company has done remediation work, advanced development agreements, and updated its vision for the site, Starks said. If everything goes according to plan, a new stadium will be shovel-ready within 12 months, only awaiting word from the MLB. 
But, regardless of whether Salt Lake City gets a baseball team or not, the Power District will become a new multiuse hub, Starks said, with access to a clean Jordan River, thousands of people living on the site, other offices, restaurants and entertainment options.
The Power District master plan includes 4,700 housing units, with a mixture of housing types and price points, according to a news release, as well as 320,000 square feet dedicated to retail, 300 hotel rooms, one mile of riverfront clean-up and access, trails and green spaces.

Tremonton Republican Sen. Scott Sandall, who chairs the Utah Fairpark Area Investment and Restoration District Board, also known as UFAIR, said he expects it all to come together in the next three to five years. But, now that the district’s governing body is in place, he doesn’t think more legislation will be needed for the district during the next general session. 



Let us know what you think...


 


“That legislation is already in place, and UFAIR is responsible for the state’s part of a ballpark when the Major League announcement happens,” Sandall said. “I’m just going to be positive about that.”  
While city input is more limited for this project than it was with the Downtown Revitalization District — created to accommodate Utah’s NHL team — Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said on Monday she is excited about the possibilities for the west side of the city, an area that’s home to the state’s most diverse communities. 
“Today marks the beginning of a catalytic investment in this neighborhood that this neighborhood has not only wanted but deserved for a very long time,” Mendenhall said. “It’s part of a growing momentum that we’re seeing all across the west side, where community vision is converging with long planned public improvements and private investment.”
Mendenhall also called for this new chapter of the west side to go hand in hand with sustainability. She highlighted Salt Lake City’s commitment, alongside other Utah communities, to match its electricity consumption with renewable energy generation through Rocky Mountain Power’s system.
“Our entire state needs those improvements, but few places more than the west side of Salt Lake City, which has disproportionately suffered from poor air quality in the past,” Mendenhall said.

Brian Gootkin has served as the head of Montana’s Department of Corrections since 2021.
Gootkin will have to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate, which is moving quickly to install Trump’s nominees. The Republican-majority U.S. Senate changed its rules this fall to move Trump’s nominees through faster.
The Governor’s Office did not immediately respond to a Monday question seeking comment on when they expect to have a new agency head. The Department of Corrections did not answer questions sent on Friday regarding Gootkin’s move.

“Under his direction, we’ve made historic investments to protect and promote a public safety system that supports inmates, corrections officers, and all Montana families,” Gov. Greg Gianforte said in a statement. “From securing overdue improvements to aging infrastructure, expanding capacity at our jails, and increasing collaboration with local partners, Gootkin has been at the helm of our work.”
Members of Montana’s all-Republican federal delegation applauded the move.
U.S. Senator Steve Daines called Gootkin an “excellent choice” for the position, and U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy agreed.
“Senate Republicans have overcome historic obstruction to get President Trump’s picks in place, and we are eager to add Brian to the list of fantastic nominees that have been confirmed,” Sheehy said in a press release.
Prior to Gootkin’s position in the DOC, he spent 27 years in the Gallatin County Sheriff’s Office. Before that, he spent four years in the Air Force. If confirmed, Gootkin will be Montana’s 41st Marshal for the District of Montana.
Craig Anderson is the U.S. Marshal for Montana, and the Department of Justice webpage still lists him in that position. Marshals currently are under the U.S. Attorney’s authority, though there was legislation introduced this year seeking to take it out of the President and Justice Department’s hands.
There are 94 Marshals in Districts across the world, which are appointed by the President or Attorney General. U.S. Marshals are in part responsible for courthouse security, prisoner transport and apprehension of suspects.

An attorney and mentor to many, 83-year-old public servant is remembered for being an insatiable reader and a ""wonderful friend.""
The post Kathy Karpan, former Wyoming secretary of state, dies appeared first on WyoFile .","Kathy Karpan, longtime public servant, attorney and former Wyoming secretary of state, died Friday in Cheyenne at the age of 83. 
Karpan’s tenure from 1987 to 1995 in the second-highest statewide office was part of a 40-year span in which Wyoming voters elected women to the position that oversees elections and business registrations, among other things. 
While part of an Equality State tradition, Karpan also blazed a trail all her own as the first woman elected to a statewide office “other than superintendent, who wasn’t a widow, who in effect had the benefit of her husband having held office before her,” Karpan told the Wyoming Historical Society in an interview last year. 
“My message to women in Wyoming would be: Don’t be afraid to run. Take the chance, you might win,” Karpan said in the interview. 
A lifelong Democrat, Karpan was not always on the winning side of Wyoming politics. She ran for governor and U.S. senator in 1994 and 1996, respectively, but lost to Republicans both times. Meanwhile, Karpan was a mentor to many, her longtime friend Rodger McDaniel told WyoFile on Monday.

“I’ve heard from young people who were candidates for, typically, the Legislature, for whom she was a mentor. They all described her as a mentor, somebody they could talk to, and she would reach out and offer them advice and direction,” McDaniel said. “And she did that her whole life.”
Karpan’s penchant for mentorship, McDaniel said, grew in part from her time working for Teno Roncalio, the last Democrat to have represented Wyoming in Congress. 
“Teno was somebody who believed in mentoring and bringing people along who had potential for involvement in politics and public service. And Kathy did the same thing as secretary of state,” McDaniel said. 
From Roncalio, Karpan said she learned that public service and political life could be a way to “help individual human beings.”
“Because when I worked for him, we helped constituents,” Karpan told the Wyoming Historical Society. 
It was while serving as the director of the Wyoming Department of Health in 1986 that Karpan kicked off a campaign for secretary of state. She won and did so again in 1990. During her tenure, she oversaw the first statewide special election in Wyoming history. Karpan also helped spearhead the state’s revamping of its limited liability statutes — an endeavor that inspired the rest of the country’s business regulations. 
“Former Secretary of State Kathy Karpan was a strong leader who left a lasting legacy on Wyoming. Through much-needed reforms in the Secretary of State’s office to providing a shining example of what serving in a public office is all about,” Wyoming Democratic Party Chair Lucas Fralick wrote in a statement to WyoFile. “Secretary Karpan will be dearly missed by those who knew her, and we will continue to strive to serve by her example.”
Early life and career 
Karpan was born in Rock Springs in 1942, when the city was a Democratic stronghold thanks to the community’s unionized coal miners, according to wyohistory.org. 
“In first grade, I knew that I was a Catholic and a Democrat,” she said.

The family moved to Rawlins after her father’s job with the Union Pacific Railroad was transferred. After Karpan’s mother died when she was 12 years old, Karpan helped raise her two younger siblings, Judy and Frank. 
Given such responsibilities, a higher education was thought to be out of reach for Karpan, but a scholarship to the University of Wyoming College of Commerce and Industry changed that. She earned a degree in journalism and served as editor of The Branding Iron. Years later, she graduated with a master’s degree in American Studies at UW and from the University of Oregon’s School of Law in 1978. 
In Washington, she got a job in the Department of Commerce. Closer to home, she worked in the Wyoming attorney general’s office. In 1997, the U.S. Senate confirmed Karpan as director of the Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation and Enforcement at the Department of the Interior — a full circle moment for the coal miner’s daughter. 
In private practice, where she worked in her later years, she was “an excellent lawyer,” McDaniel told WyoFile.

Her longtime legal partner, Margy White, spoke of Karpan’s “enviable sense of humor” in a 2016 interview with wyohistory.org. 
“My personal favorite story of Kathy practicing law arose from a deposition she took of a person who had only a fleeting acquaintance with the concept of truth. After the deposition, Kathy said if and when we called this person to testify at trial, she would say, ‘the plaintiff would like to call Pinocchio to the stand,’” White said. 
Karpan was also an insatiable reader. When she and McDaniel, who both worked for U.S. Rep. Roncalio at the time, would travel around Wyoming, Karpan “would read aloud books like Lyndon Johnson’s biography,” McDaniel said. 
“She was really a wonderful friend,” he said. 
Last year, Karpan lamented the Wyoming Legislature’s shrunken number of women members and the “brutality” and “mean-spiritedness” of the current state of politics. Yet, Karpan expressed hope for “the best and the brightest and the most caring and generous and tolerant and loving of our young people” running for office. 
“I’d like to think that my legacy would be: Jump in, get involved, run,” Karpan said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-10-27 22:59:29+00:00,CT Mirror,"Facing loss of SNAP, CT increases funding for Foodshare",Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/10/27/facing-loss-of-snap-ct-increases-funding-for-foodshare/,"Officials acknowledged that the $3 million grant will not match the reach of SNAP, which normally pays $72 million in monthly benefits in CT.","Connecticut’s first steps to mitigate the fast-approaching suspension of a federally funded food assistance program will be a $3 million emergency grant to nonprofit Connecticut Foodshare and an outreach campaign informing recipients of their nearest food pantry, Gov. Ned Lamont said Monday.
The partial federal government shutdown forced by the inability of Congress to pass even a temporary spending measure will enter its second month on Saturday, the same day funding runs out for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP.
But the governor and others acknowledged that the emergency step will not match the reach or efficiency of SNAP, which normally pays $72 million in monthly benefits through Electronic Benefit Transfer cards that can be used to purchase food at chain supermarkets and many corner stores and farmers’ markets.
SNAP serves about 360,000 people in Connecticut, about 10% of the state’s population. It largely serves the working poor and struggling retirees whose monthly incomes are no more than $2,609 for a single person and $5,359 for a household of four.
Connecticut is one of the earliest states to address the near-certain suspension of SNAP. Last week, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, declared a state of emergency allowing unspecified actions to provide greater food aid in the absence of SNAP.
The steps announced Monday afternoon at Connecticut Foodshare’s office and warehouse complex in Wallingford came after hurried meetings with officials from the Lamont administration and the statewide nonprofit, which acts as a wholesale and retail distributor of free food to pantries and individuals.
Lamont praised his commissioner of social services, Andrea Barton Reeves, and the Foodshare chief executive, Jason Jakubowski, for quickly assembling a plan in the face of uncertainty from Washington as to whether the Trump administration would use available contingency funds to keep SNAP going.
“They were going to replenish the SNAP benefits, and they weren’t going to replenish it. Turn the card on, turn it off. It is, let’s say erratic, to put it mildly,” Lamont said. “We wanted to pull the trigger and make sure we can take care of people in time for the cards going off.”
Lamont said the state will monitor whether further spending is necessary.
“We’re going to try this out for a couple of weeks,” Lamont said. “We’re going to see what the need is going forward. You know, hopefully they can solve this impasse down in Washington. I think it’s a long overdue, but if not, I think we’ll be here to help out people as best we can.”
The state is unable to simply put more money on the electronic benefits cards already in the hands of SNAP recipients. The state screens for eligibility, but a federal vendor actually uses the state data to reload the cards, Barton Reeves said.
“As a state, we don’t have any access to those particular funds and the ways in which those cards are loaded. We simply determine whether a person is eligible for the SNAP benefit or not,” she said.
Jakubowski said the $3 million would be used to purchase food that would increase the supplies already distributed through a network of food pantries and the 110 mobile distribution sites that are visited once every two weeks. But, he acknowledged, it would not come close to offsetting the loss of SNAP.
“SNAP is the first line of defense against hunger in the state of Connecticut and in the United States,” he said. “For every meal that we provide here at this food bank, SNAP provides nine. There is not enough food at this food bank — or every food bank in the country put together — to make up for the loss that we’re going to see in SNAP.”
Jakubowski also said the suspension of SNAP also would be a blow to supermarkets that operate on thin margins.
“There’s 2,500 retail outlets in the state of Connecticut that accept SNAP dollars. It’s anywhere from 5 to 15% of their business. This is going to hurt the economy just as much as it’s going to hurt working families across the state,” he said.
Jakubowski said the SNAP issue exacerbates what already was a difficult time for Foodshare and the pantries it supplies. The Trump administration previously canceled agricultural programs that had supplied fresh produce.
From October of last year, the nonprofit has received 850,000 fewer pounds of food from the federal government while servicing 23% more households across the state, he said. 
Lamont, Barton Reeves and Jakubowski downplayed the politics of the impasse in Washington. Others at the press conference did not.
“We ask our Congress and our federal government to step up and fix this problem,” Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz said. “We are leading in a bipartisan way here in Connecticut, and I find it incredible that our congressmen are being paid while our federal workers who are doing public safety and health related critical infrastructure work in our country are not being paid and are also at risk of going hungry.”
Standing behind her was U.S. Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, D-3rd District, who is the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee.
“Some of us have have deferred our salary during the shutdown,” DeLauro said, as she stepped to the microphone. “Not everyone, but some of us have.”
DeLauro said responsibility for the SNAP suspension is with Trump. Even in the absence of a federal budget or continuing resolution, there is a $5 billion contingency fund set aside for SNAP, which the Trump administration refuses to use.
“I promise you, there is money to fund this program,” DeLauro said.
Youngkin, the Virginia governor, blamed Democrats in Congress in his emergency declaration announcement.
Democrats have declined to agree to a continuing resolution keeping the government open without an extension of tax credits whose expiration at year’s end will cause dramatic increases in the cost of buying health coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
Rep. Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, who is the House Republican leader, issued a statement earlier criticizing Democratic leaders in the General Assembly who were trying to create a new contingency fund to deal with federal cutbacks, rather than simply using the state’s ample budget reserves.
But Candelora attended the press conference and praised the governor’s first steps to offset the SNAP loss.
“No question we are broken at the federal level,” Candelora said. “There is an impasse that neither side of the aisle wants to break. People are being leveraged now, and people are being hurt. And I stand in support of the governor’s first initiative, and I think it’s just the beginning of a conversation.

Wyoming beef producers watch prices plunge with the president’s plan to quadruple imports from Argentina.
The post Trump’s Argentine beef move causes ‘great concern, some panic’ appeared first on WyoFile .","President Donald Trump’s announcements that the U.S. will allow Argentina to greatly expand its low-tariff beef exports to the U.S. to reduce prices for American consumers have riled Wyoming stock growers.
Trump floated the idea of boosting imports to the U.S. market a week ago, following up with statements that Argentina would be allowed to quadruple the amount of beef it sends north under a low-tariff quota. The move brought a sharp reaction from domestic beef producers as well as markets, which saw cattle prices plunge.
“The president’s statement obviously caused us great concern and some panic in our industry,” said Jim Magagna, executive vice president of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association. “It has had an impact on current live cattle prices and our futures market.”
“The timing is so unfortunate for Wyoming. We’re at that time of the year where people are selling their calves or their yearlings.” Jim Magagna
Magagna cautioned that details of the deal are yet to be made public — whether the plan involves live cattle or only butchered products. Regardless, “it can have a significant impact,” Magagna said of the new policy.
“The timing is so unfortunate for Wyoming,” Magagna said. “We’re at that time of the year where people are selling their calves or their yearlings.”
Gov. Mark Gordon called for domestic solutions to higher grocery prices, solutions that would increase U.S.-raised beef. “Increasing our reliance on cattle imports is not the best answer for our ranchers, farmers, or U.S. consumers,” he said in a statement Thursday.
Trump’s move is a “misguided effort,” the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said in a statement Wednesday, calling on him to abandon the plan. The association and its members “cannot stand behind the president while he undercuts the future of family farmers and ranchers,” the group’s CEO Colin Woodall said in a release.
‘$300 millones extra’
In Argentina, headlines heralded a windfall for a troubled economy. “Inminente anuncio: la mayor cuota para exportar carne a Estados Unidos generará US $300 millones extra,” La Nación trumpeted. Translation: “Imminent announcement: Increased meat export quota to the United States will generate an additional $300 million.”
In Chicago, headlines were different. “Cattle Collapsing as Spec Longs Head for the Exits,” Barchart for Businesses wrote Monday.
“The cattle complex on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange is deepening its steep losses in early Monday trading,” Foodmarket news wrote Monday, “extending Friday’s sharp sell-off that saw all but the nearby live cattle contract end at limit-down.”
In addition to benefiting U.S. meat consumers, Trump’s beef plan augments his support for the Argentinian government, support that includes a $20 billion currency swap. The issue finds the White House trapped between consumer dread in the face of escalating costs and stock producers who are part of a rural cohort of Trump voters.
There’s been much criticism of Trump’s move from rural producers, Rona Johnson wrote Monday on The Fence Post, an ag-focused news outlet. “Most of these ranchers probably voted for Trump,” she wrote, “and were voicing their concerns in hopes that he would come to a different conclusion on how to deal with high beef prices.”
Meantime, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins on Wednesday released a 13-page outline “to strengthen the American beef industry, reinforcing and prioritizing the American rancher’s critical role in the national security of the United States.” The initiative lists 18 actions, implementation plans and expected results addressing everything from grazing on federal land to compensation for stock losses to predators.
Gubernatorial candidate and State Sen. Eric Barlow, a Gillette Republican, “stands with Wyoming ranchers,” he said in a statement issued Friday. “Our producers compete honestly and deserve fair markets that reflect the true value of locally raised beef.”
Conservationists fret the issue will lead to environmental degradation as the administration relaxes oversight and control of public-land grazing and other landscape and wildlife protections.
“This administration is doubling down and making sure that America’s precious western public lands operate as a below-cost feedlot for special interest groups,” Josh Osher, public policy director for Western Watersheds Project said in a statement. The administration’s moves come “despite the growing recognition that beef is bad for the planet.”
Rollins’ proposals to expand grazing on public land come even as land-managing agencies’ data “suggest that they are unable to manage the active allotments already in use,” Western Watersheds and five other environmental groups said.
Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, WildEarth Guardians, Wilderness Watch, the Center for Biological Diversity and Kettle Range Conservation Group joined in the criticism.
Bad timing
Wyoming ranchers are in a tough spot, Magagna said. Some may have sold their cattle already.
“But if you hadn’t sold them and you’re sending them to market next week, it’s definitely going to be an impact,” he said, “a short-term impact.”
Again, details of the deal will be paramount.
“The challenge that I’ve had with this is, to my knowledge, we don’t yet know what the president has in mind,” he said. “I’ve heard rumors he’s talking about importing live animals from Argentina.
“I don’t think that could be done,” he said. “It would be a major concern because of animal disease issues.”
Other programs, like importing butchered lean beef to be blended with U.S. products, could benefit the industry, Magagna said.
He’s reached out to association members, Magagna said, providing a link to comment to the administration and Wyoming’s delegation. “The last I knew — not specific to Wyoming — somewhere in the neighborhood of 10,000 comments had been submitted by cattle producers.”
Regarding U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, “I know they have reached out to the White House and to the Secretary of Ag to express their concerns,” he said.

(Photo by Carol Yepes/Getty Images)President Donald Trump’s lawsuit against the Des Moines Register, its parent company Gannett and pollster J. Ann Selzer will head from federal court to state court in Iowa, a positive development for the president in the proceedings.
The lawsuit was filed in December 2024 after Trump’s victory in the general election. It challenges the Des Moines Register and Selzer, who conducted the Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll, for publishing a poll in the days before the Nov. 5, 2024, election that found Vice President Kamala Harris leading among likely Iowa voters.
The lawsuit claimed the poll amounted to “fraud and election interference,” saying it had intentionally overrepresented support for Harris in violation of the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act. But attorneys representing the defendants denied these claims and the case was transferred to federal court at their request.
However, Trump’s legal team objected to the case going through the federal court system, as the lawsuit had been expanded to include U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and former Republican state Sen. Brad Zaun  — both based in Iowa – as plaintiffs.
In May 2025, U.S. District Judge Rebecca Goodgame Ebinger denied the president’s motion to remand the case from federal court back to state court, allowing Trump to file an appeal on the issue but ordering him to fine an amended complaint without Miller-Meeks and Zaun involved in the case.
But on Friday, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit overruled this decision, granting Trump’s petition for a writ of mandamus, used to correct legal errors, and calling for the district court to “vacate its order striking the notice of voluntary dismissal and treat the case as dismissed without prejudice.”
This decision may allow Trump’s case, refiled June 30 in Iowa, to proceed, as it had not advanced due to challenges about the pending federal case.
In a statement, Lark-Marie Anton, Gannett spokesperson, said the company is  “assessing the court’s decision.”
“Given the nature of the case and that it involves the president of the United States as a plaintiff, we continue to believe the federal courts are the most appropriate forum for this lawsuit,” Anton said. “In the event the suit is heard by the state courts of Iowa, we have confidence the matter will be adjudicated fairly.”
The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, or FIRE, representing Selzer in the lawsuit, has labeled the legal challenge as a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation, or SLAPP lawsuit attempting to suppress free speech or press by engaging a defendant in a lengthy, expensive legal battle, even while knowing they may not win in court. While Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a measure into law this year allowing courts to to grant expedited relief in cases involving First Amendment rights to address SLAPP lawsuits, the law includes a caveat that these legal protections cannot be filed retroactively — meaning Trump’s refiled case in Iowa would not be subject to the law.

(Photo | Isiah Holmes)Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin is restarting abortion services after a nearly month-long pause due to a federal budget and tax law that threatens to withhold Medicaid funding from organizations that provide abortion services.
The organization paused services on Oct. 1, due to a provision in the federal megabill signed by President Donald Trump that bars Medicaid payments for one year to organizations that received more than $800,000 in Medicaid reimbursements in fiscal year 2023 and primarily engage in family planning services and reproductive health and provide abortions. Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin had said the pause was temporary as they explored options for being able to resume. 
The federal Hyde Amendment has prohibited federal funds from being used to pay for most abortion care for nearly five decades, but the new provision, which expires in July 2026, expands that prohibition to cover all Medicaid-covered services at clinics that also provide non-covered abortions. 
“Providing compassionate, high-quality care to our patients has always been our mission — and it always will be,” President and CEO Tanya Atkinson said in a statement. “At a time when politicians are working to take away health care from women and families, we are fighting back with everything we have. We’ve been here before. We’ve stood up to relentless attacks on reproductive health for decades — and we are not backing down now. Our patients deserve nothing less.”
Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin said that it decided to relinquish its “Essential Community Provider” designation, so it won’t meet the definition of a “prohibited entity” under federal law and won’t be barred from receiving Medicaid funds even while it provides abortion services. 
According to KFF, Essential Community Providers are “safety net clinics and hospitals” that serve predominantly low-income, medically underserved patients. The federal Affordable Care Act requires that Qualified Health Plans available through the federal or state insurance Marketplaces include a “sufficient number and geographic distribution of ECPs, where available, to ensure reasonable and timely access to a broad range of such providers for low-income, medically underserved individuals in the plan’s service area.”
A Sept. 29 court filing from attorneys on behalf of Health and Human Services stated that organizations could continue billing Medicaid by ceasing abortion, or by relinquishing their tax-exempt status, or relinquishing their Essential Community Provider status.
Atkinson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that it was unclear what the implications of giving up the ECP status might be, including whether it will affect its financial situation. 
“What we do know is that the vast majority of our patients really rely on BadgerCare as their form of insurance, and our focus is on providing as much care as we possibly can to as many people as we can across the entire state,” Atkinson said.
Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin  — the largest provider for abortion services in the state — offers abortion services at its clinics in Madison, Milwaukee and Sheboygan.

Auditor Mike Foley said the transactions, amounting to nearly $1,000, came despite the department having its own tow trucks.
“It’s a troubling situation where a person is in a position where he can directly order towing services to a company that he owns when in fact the department itself has sufficient towing resources,” he said. “You can not use your position to enhance your own personal financial gain.”
 Insufficient records

Foley’s team, in an 11-page report issued Friday, offered four invoices between April 2024 and July 2025 showing that state purchase cards were used to pay a Wahoo-based business owned by Loren Cuda, the department’s highway fleet shop supervisor.
In three of those instances, the auditor team said, a card was used by a subordinate of Cuda. Foley alleges that Cuda was directing others to steer business to his company. Cuda could not immediately be reached Monday for comment.
Foley said that while transportation employees generally receive verbal approval by a supervisor before making a purchase, such discussion and approval typically is not documented. As a result, the report said, the auditor team was unable to verify whether the towing purchases in question were properly pre-authorized.
The audit team’s report, addressed to Transportation Director Vicki Kramer, said invoices for the four tows lacked sufficient information to verify whether mileage, towing services and additional fee charges were “reasonable.”

Foley said the situation poses concern of a possible violation of the Nebraska Political Accountability and Disclosure Act, which intends to ensure “that public office or employment not be used for private gain other than the compensation provided by law.” 
Foley forwarded the team’s findings and information to the Nebraska Accountability and Disclosure Commission for further review. Violators can be subject to misdemeanor charges.
 Transportation response

 The report included a response from leadership of the Transportation Department. The reply noted that Nebraska law does allow, in certain situations, for state agencies to buy goods or services from a vendor associated with a state employee. The department response acknowledged, however, that department procedures “may not be sufficient to prevent the appearance of a conflict of interest.”
As a remedy, the department said it has suspended future purchases from the vendor in question. It said the department is reviewing its processes to determine whether there are additional controls that could “enable purchasing from vendors associated with state employees” while avoiding any actual or apparent conflicts of interest.
The department, through a spokesperson, declined further comment.
Foley said that while transactions with a state employee’s personal business may be legal in certain circumstances, “it wasn’t necessary in this case.” He said he wants to convey a message to state employees and agencies: “We’re watching.”

Two New Mexico state Democratic lawmakers said Monday they will work during next year’s legislative session to establish a “truth commission” to investigate the activities of the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein at his Zorro ranch near Stanley in Santa Fe County.
It’s been six years since the financier’s death in a Manhattan jail, but his activities in New Mexico require further exploration, according to state Reps. Andrea Romero (Santa Fe) and Marianna Anaya (Albuquerque), who previewed the process of establishing the commission on a Zoom call with local journalists.
Romero said the commission would “put the story together for the public,” while working around issues of statutes of limitations for certain crimes and the privacy of victims.
“We envision very much like a 9/11 or J-6 commission,” Romero said. “As we start releasing information to the public, it has been vetted. There’s essentially a check and balance on the information that we’re providing: information that needs to be redacted or victims or witnesses that need to be protected.”
Previous House commissions established by the New Mexico Legislature over the decades produced investigative reports on corruption, abuses at schools and prisons.
Establishing this type of commission does not require the approval of both legislative chambers, but instead would be a House parliamentary process, which could be launched during the upcoming session, Romero said.
“We’re unsure if we need sponsors, there’s still a lot of parliamentary history we’re going through,” she told Source NM in a call.
The tentative makeup of the commission would be two Democratic and two Republican House members, with subpoena power. It’s unclear exactly how fast the commission would be able to meet after the session wraps in March, but Romero said it needed to move quickly, and work to “prevent this from ever happening again.”
Romero noted that “we’ve heard from many, many different sources that New Mexico… is a great place to do [trafficking]. That’s just horrifying to me; that there was a choice here to make this a sort of a no man’s land for these activities,” she said.
Epstein purchased the 7,500-acre Zorro Ranch from former New Mexico Gov. Bruce King in 1993. According to court documents, the ranch, which has its own airstrip and helipad, was the site of sex trafficking, including by Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted in 2021 as Epstein’s co-conspirator.
Two New Mexican attorneys general have opened previous investigations into Epstein’s activities in the state: Hector Balderas’ criminal investigation in 2019 closed within the year without filing any charges. In 2023, current Attorney General Raúl Torrez investigated the role financial services companies played in failing to identify the abuses at the ranch.
Anaya said that while the state pursued a criminal investigation under Balderas, the overlapping jurisdiction with federal investigators hampered it.
“I think the investigation that actually could have happened here, the full-fledged investigation, was maybe unnecessarily put on hold,” Anaya said. “We do have some documents from that, but it’s definitely not comprehensive.”
At the federal level, New Mexico Democratic U.S. Rep. Melanie Stansbury serves on the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, which has been releasing documents from the 2019 federal sex trafficking case against Epstein. Recent documents included an alleged lewd image and inscription from President Donald Trump to Epstein for his 50th birthday.
Romero said the commission will likely be discussed during an upcoming interim Courts, Corrections and Justice Committee meeting in November.

,DC,2025-10-27 22:25:59+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Thousands of preschoolers could lose access to Head Start due to shutdown,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/thousands-preschoolers-could-lose-access-head-start-due-shutdown,,"WASHINGTON — Funding for scores of Head Start programs hung in the balance as the government shutdown continued Monday without an end in sight. Unless a deal is reached to end the ongoing funding lapse that began Oct. 1, more than 65,000 children in 140 local Head Start programs across 41 states and Puerto Rico will not get their federal grant funding come Nov. 1, according to the National Head Start Association. The federal government spent about $12.3 billion on the program in fiscal 2025.Community programs that receive Head Start funding have different start dates for when their grants are available. Head Start helps fund roughly 1,600 community programs that served more than 790,000 children during the 2023-2024 program year. The program is managed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and the employees in that agency who would disburse those awards are currently furloughed because of the shutdown.Six programs serving 6,525 children did not receive a grant award Oct. 1 and are already tapping into outside resources and local funds to stay afloat. If the shutdown continues past Friday, another 134 programs that serve 58,627 children will lose federal grant funding. Head Start provides early childhood education, nutritious meals, health screenings and other support services to low-income families. It is a discretionary program and subject to congressional approval each year, making it particularly vulnerable to the government shutdown. “There’s just so much instability … that this is causing,” Tommy Sheridan, deputy director of the advocacy group the National Head Start Association, told States Newsroom. “And while we’re hopeful and we’re going to be doing everything we possibly can to try to minimize the impact directly on children and families, there is going to be a long-term impact, no matter what, that is felt.” Shutdown standoffThe shutdown began Oct. 1, the start of the fiscal year, when Congress failed to appropriate money for federal programs. Democrats have voted against bills that would temporarily reopen the government as they ask Republicans to negotiate a fix to expiring tax credits for health insurance premiums purchased on the Affordable Care Act marketplace. Republicans have refused to negotiate while the government is shut down, leading to an ongoing stalemate.In a statement Monday, Emily Hilliard, a spokesperson for HHS, blamed the impending lack of funds on Democrats. “More than 58,000 children are on course to lose access to Head Start funding and programs on November 1 due solely to the Democrat-led government shutdown,” she wrote.Hilliard added that “the Trump Administration is committed to reopening the government for the American people.”‘Collateral damage’ Sheridan criticized the political landscape that will likely lead to a lack of funding.“I can’t stress enough — this is purely due to politics,” Sheridan said. “This has nothing to do with Head Start not being an effective program or people in Congress and the administration not supporting Head Start.” He pointed to the “strong bipartisan support” the program has received since its launch in 1965. “This is just us being collateral damage in a bigger fight that is going to be hurting working families and children,” Sheridan added. Sheridan noted that “when programs don’t have access to federal resources, generally speaking, they can try, depending on the size of the program, to stay open for a certain period of time, but they’re going to be basically using other funds, and then would be reimbursing those costs down the road, kind of like an accounting maneuver, to be able to keep their programs running.” He added: “That’s why we’re seeing so many programs either close or have to consider closures or things of that kind and why ... we are just urging Congress and the administration to stop having children and families be the collateral damage of a political fight.”Consequences for local Head Start programsFor programs that have to shut down because of the loss of federal funding, Sheridan pointed to several impacts.Children would lose access to healthy meals and other resources. Families would be without affordable child care options, forcing some to quit their jobs or reduce their work hours. Community members could see economic ripple effects if staff who work in Head Start programs lose their paychecks or their jobs. “We also have community partners that we rely on for services, and they rely on us for business — small businesses, contractors, vendors, other small businesses, things like that — but they rely on their Head Start contracts, and if we can’t pay the bills, they’re not going to be able to count on us for what they need as well,” he said. Program already reelingUnder President Donald Trump’s administration, the program was already experiencing chaos prior to the government shutdown, including reports of delays in accessing approved grant funding, regional office closures and firings at HHS’ Office of Head Start.That office also told grant recipients in March that it “will not approve the use of federal funding for any training and technical assistance (TTA) or other program expenditures that promote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.” A federal judge in September temporarily blocked the administration’s directive that aimed to prevent immigrants living in the United States illegally from accessing Head Start programs. Meanwhile, Trump’s fiscal 2026 budget request calls for maintaining Head Start funding at its prior fiscal year level of roughly $12.3 billion.The Senate Appropriations Committee passed its annual bill to fund HHS, including Head Start, back in July and provided $12.4 billion for the program, a roughly $85 million increase.The corresponding panel in the House also approved its bill to fund HHS in September, aligning with the administration’s request of maintaining funding for Head Start at $12.3 billion in fiscal 2026.  Sheridan pointed out that the program has operated through challenges before, whether natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, or previous government shutdowns. “Our programs are absolutely dedicated, hopeful and are working tirelessly to minimize that impact on children and families, but we cannot operate a program on hope and goodwill alone,” he said. “We need Congress and we need the president to come together to keep our classrooms open and also to ensure that Head Start funding can stay in line with the rising costs that we’ve seen over this last year.”",,,,2025-10-27 19:01:22.764019

(Photo by Lindsey Wasson/Getty Images)Washington’s lands commissioner, Dave Upthegrove, is on a mission to secure $60 million of additional wildfire funding in next year’s legislative session, despite a tightening budget outlook.
On Monday, he and a leading Democratic House lawmaker indicated that they want to tap revenue from the state’s cap-and-trade program for at least some of that money. The maneuver would mean turning to a steady-flowing stream of cash outside the state’s squeezed operating budget.
“Climate Commitment Act dollars are going to be on the table,” said state Rep. Larry Springer, D-Kirkland, who is deputy House majority leader.
At issue is funding provided under a 2021 law known as House Bill 1168, which passed with broad bipartisan support. With that legislation, lawmakers committed to direct $500 million over eight years to wildfire programs. Springer was a lead sponsor.
The HB 1168 funding supports three general areas: initial attacks on wildfires to keep them from growing into huge blazes; forest health measures, like prescribed burns and thinning; and community resilience initiatives focused on making buildings and property less fire-prone.
Legislators largely kept up the funding, with $115 million in the 2023-25 budget and $130 million in the 2021-23 cycle. This year, confronted with a budget deficit, they delivered just $60 million.
The $60 million Upthegrove is now angling for would bring funding in the current two-year budget up to $120 million, on par with the 2021 framework.
But the budget pressures have not subsided, with revenue trailing expectations and lawmakers and the governor preparing for another session rife with difficult budget talks.
It’s against this backdrop that Upthegrove and Springer say that they’ll press for the Climate Commitment Act dollars.
“Although the general fund has a large shortfall, the Climate Commitment Act funding has some capacity,” Upthegrove said.
And spending on proactive wildfire programs, he said, can save money in the long run.
“If we can prevent or reduce the size of one or two large fires, this will more than pay for itself,” Upthegrove added.

Under the Climate Commitment Act, businesses that produce large amounts of air pollution must buy allowances at state-run auctions to compensate for their emissions. The auctions have raised more than $3 billion since they began in early 2023.
Money the law generates is restricted to certain kinds of spending, related to reducing air pollution and environmental projects. There’s a special emphasis under the law on improving air quality and public health in disadvantaged parts of the state.
Reducing wildfire risk and improving forest health are among the eligible uses for the funding.
Before this year, no funding for the HB 1168 fire programs came from the Climate Commitment Act. In the current budget, $20 million of the $60 million in wildfire spending did.
Springer said it’s too early to say how much of the $60 million he and Upthegrove are now pushing for could come from the climate program. 
“That’s going to be through negotiations,” he said.

There’s always been a need for people to find enough food to eat in Mississippi, one of the nation’s poorest and most food insecure states. But lately, things are different. Federal money that funded the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) has dried up due to the government shutdown – so far the second longest in history – and big changes to the program coming down the pipeline are leaving people desperate and scrambling. 
“You can hear it in their voice, you can see it in their face – they are scared,” Hudnall said. “And there’s no magic solution in the foreseeable future. When you get large groups of people who are worried about their livelihoods, you cannot have a thriving community.”
President Donald Trump opted not to tap into emergency funds to continue running the nation’s largest anti-hunger program, according to a memo from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, obtained by Politico. While officials in at least three states have pledged to keep the program going in the absence of federal funds, the Mississippi Department of Human Services announced Friday that its SNAP program had been paused. 
“No new SNAP benefits will be issued for November unless federal guidance changes, however, previous benefits will remain accessible,” the department said in a press release Friday. 
That decision promises to leave nearly 400,000 Mississippians without food security, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. But it also undermines people’s confidence in elected officials, explained Gina Plata-Nino, interim director of SNAP at the Food Research and Action Center, a national nonprofit working to end poverty-related hunger. 
“Allowing hunger to deepen during a shutdown is a choice,” Plata-Nino said. “The Secretary of Agriculture has the authority and the responsibility to act now to ensure no one goes hungry because of political gridlock. Further delay in using available funds only weakens public faith in government.”
Nonprofits are having to pick up the slack, which is not sustainable long term, said Jason Martin, executive director of the Northeast Mississippi Hunger Coalition, a network of 24 food pantries across eight counties. 
“I just got off the phone a little bit ago with a woman whose SNAP benefits are not coming through and can’t survive and is requesting emergency boxes,” Martin said. “From the pantries’ perspective, we’re expecting to be overwhelmed with the request for services. And our system is already taxed to the max.”
Food banks have been under enormous pressure since the U.S. Department of Agriculture cut $500 million to their funding in March. The loss of federal funding to food banks coupled with the increasing need is forcing nonprofits to constantly pivot in an effort to fill impossible gaps, Martin said. 
“On a personal note, I just wish that our politicians and legislators would stop politicizing human issues with people who are in a poverty-stricken situation already,” said Martin, who made it clear those were his personal beliefs and not those of his organization. 
While the government shutdown will eventually end and SNAP benefits will resume, they won’t look like they used to. 
How Trump’s megabill will affect Mississippians who rely on food aid
As a result of a historic tax and spending package President Donald Trump signed into law over the summer, the SNAP program will be transformed in two ways. First, enrollees will face immediate new paperwork and eligibility requirements. Cost shifts will also force states to make tough choices about cutting eligibility or benefits further. Altogether, the so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act includes the largest cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid and SNAP. 
Mississippians who don’t meet new work requirements could get kicked off SNAP as early as next month, while the state will have to come up with an additional $140 million to keep the program going, according to analysis from the Center on Poverty and Inequality at Georgetown Law School
For the first time ever, states will be forced to cover a portion of the costs for food aid benefits, shifting billions in costs to state budgets. Mississippi, like many other states, will likely have to cut enrollees or benefits or withdraw from the state-federal program altogether. Poverty will increase, local economies will struggle, and food banks will face mounting strain, experts say. As the poorest state in the nation, Mississippi could stand to lose the most. 
“This is one of the most significant impacts on Mississippi’s budget,” said Theresa Lau, senior policy counsel at the Southern Poverty Law Center, to a group of lawmakers during a hearing on the federal budget law in September. 
For a number of reasons, states are not equipped to handle this shift, explained Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow in the Tax and Income Supports Division at the Urban Institute. The poorest states, that need social safety net programs the most, will be at the biggest disadvantage, she said. 
“Unlike the federal government, states typically cannot deficit spend,” Waxman said. “They have to balance their budgets. And they also have a lot fewer revenue sources – they don’t have access to the federal income tax, for example. Especially a state like Mississippi, which has a historically high poverty rate, there’s just less resources to draw out of the population.”
The most likely scenario is that states that can’t afford their new share of the program’s cost will have to make eligibility changes to cover fewer enrollees. Another option would be to reduce the monetary benefits enrollees get – though Waxman said states would likely need to get waivers, specific authorization from the federal government that allows states flexibility in administering the state-federal program, to do so. 
Both of those options would put an undue burden on food banks and coalitions like the one Martin runs in northeast Mississippi. His small non-profit network must now find new donors and more grants to meet needs that the government once supported.
“As a nonprofit organization we’ll have to figure out how to sustain that level of funding so we can sustain that level of service,” Martin said. “We don’t have a bunch of staff – I’m the staff person.”
The last option would make food aid a thing of the past. 
“The most drastic scenario would be that a state would be unable to support the program and would withdraw,” Waxman said. “And that’s a catastrophic option, but I’ve definitely heard states say that they can’t rule it out because this is a pretty significant escalation in their budget responsibilities and they don’t have a clear path as to how they’re going to meet it.”
“It’s never a simple ‘just do this’ resolution”
Costs to states are expected to increase dramatically in the months ahead. Each state’s share of administrative costs for implementing the program will rise from 50% to 75%. Then, states will be responsible for paying up to 15% of the cost of the actual food benefits – something the federal government used to cover completely. 
How much a state has to pay in benefit costs will depend on its error rates. That rate measures how accurately each state determines if a person is eligible to receive benefits, including SNAP. The Trump administration and Congress enacted this provision to crack down on alleged fraud and abuse. But that has been proven to be rare in the SNAP program, which has one of the most rigorous systems to determine eligibility and payment accuracy among safety net programs, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. 
Errors more often come down to overburdened systems and the fluctuation in poor people’s income, Waxman said.
“It’s often literally just administrative errors, or someone forgot to submit something, or someone’s income was fluctuating frequently and that made it difficult to calculate the correct benefits. It’s not driven by fraud – that’s a very small issue relatively in SNAP.”
Mississippi, a state with an error rate over 10%, would be required to pay the maximum 15% share of benefit costs, explained Lau, from the Southern Poverty Law Center.
Shifting costs to states isn’t the only change to SNAP that the federal budget bill imposes. New work requirements will mean that enrollees have to prove they are working, going to school or training at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for one of the exemptions. 
The law increases the upper age limit on the work requirements from 54 to 65-years-old and extends the requirement to those previously exempt: veterans, those facing homelessness, and youth aging out of foster care. Caregivers remain exempt, but parents must have children under the age of 14 – down from 18. 
The coverage losses will have a profound impact on local economies, including grocers and retailers in rural areas who stay afloat from the business SNAP recipients bring, explained Plata-Nino, from the Food Research and Action Center. 
“What happens when the SNAP retailer can no longer receive the funds for whatever reason?” asked Plata-Nino. “He still has to pay the rent, there’s no money for rent. He still has to pay salaries, there’s no money for salaries. So, there go the wages, there go the income and federal taxes they would pay, and there go the local taxes. It really is such an ecosystem.”
Research shows that hunger has serious consequences on health and education outcomes. Since children who are enrolled in SNAP or Medicaid are automatically enrolled in free school lunch, the downstream effects of changes to these programs will result in fewer children automatically enrolled in free school-based meal programs. For many children, these meals are the only ones they are guaranteed each school day. 
With constant uncertainty and an increasingly frayed safety net, advocates worry people’s desperation will force them toward options that perpetuate poverty. Charity Bruce Sweet, who leads the Economic Justice Campaign at the Mississippi Center for Justice, said she has seen people get buried under debt after taking out small loans to cover bills or groceries – and worries that will become more common. 
Payday loans, which often accept bad credit and offer same-day funds, typically have exorbitant interest rates that perpetuate poverty. Mississippi has no protections against payday loans and one of the highest average interest rates for them, Bruce Sweet said. Mississippi’s average payday loan interest rate in 2023 was 572%, according to the Center for Responsible Lending. 
“People eventually default on those loans, and they end up in the court system and these attorneys are coming in asking for the loans, plus the interest, plus the late fees, plus the court fees,” said Bruce Sweet. “And it literally will put you in another level of poverty you haven’t even thought of before.”
While it might be easy to judge people or assume solutions, Hudnall, of Saints’ Brew Soup Kitchen, said that working on the ground has opened her eyes to just how many layers are at play when it comes to poverty. 
“It’s never a simple ‘just do this’ resolution,” Hudnall said. “Getting to know people at an individual level will change your perspective about life. You do not know the real story until you ask open-ended questions and get to know people – their background, where they came from, what life was like for them growing up, what scares them and what motivates them.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/06154723/3X0A2087-scaled.jpg,,,2025-10-27 19:01:22.764019

(Photo by Lora Wobbema/For the North Dakota Monitor)The Bank of North Dakota is developing a disaster relief program to help agricultural producers in the state survive the current crisis in the industry. 
The program will work with local banks and credit unions across the state to help ag producers refinance their debt, state officials said during a North Dakota Industrial Commission meeting Monday. 
“We’re looking at a very sizable ag disaster program given what’s going on with interest rates still high, soybean market, low commodity prices, high input costs from the compound of inflation,” said Don Morgan, CEO of the Bank of North Dakota. “We’re hearing from our banks that agriculture producers are under a lot of stress.”

The goal is to create a program that will help farmers and ranchers in the state regardless of whether a federal relief program materializes later this year. 
Morgan said they’ve had conversations with local banks and have come to the conclusion ag producers are going to be in a tough situation even if federal relief is approved by Congress. 
“No matter the amount of money the federal government throws their way, they’re still going to have a very difficult year in 2026,” Morgan said. 
It’s not clear if Congress will approve relief funding, or when, especially as the federal government shutdown continues. That makes planning a relief program at the state level more difficult. 
North Dakota ranchers say Trump’s market meddling is bad for beef

“We’re trying not to duplicate anything the federal government does,” Gov. Kelly Armstrong said. 
Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring said a little less than 20% of the state’s ag producers “are really going to be hurting” this winter. 
“We’re going to have banks that are going to have to make some really hard decisions,” Goehring said. 
Morgan is having preliminary conversations with legislative leaders to discuss whether lawmakers will want to craft a more extensive relief program for the state’s agriculture industry during a special session planned in the first quarter of next year. 
“We are having those conversations as we build this program,” Morgan said. 
The one silver lining is agriculture land values are being propped up by a diversified set of factors, Morgan said, including agricultural consolidation and out-of-state buyers purchasing ag land in North Dakota. 
“I know that’s contentious, but it’s a reality that is holding land values up,” Morgan said. 
The Industrial Commission, which oversees the state-owned bank, consists of the governor, agriculture commissioner and attorney general.

(Photo courtesy of Larry LaRocco)Former Idaho Democratic Congressman Richard Stallings died at his home in Pocatello on Sunday. He was 85. 
Stallings served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1985 to 1993. He left the House to run for a U.S. Senate position, and lost the 1992 race to then-Boise Mayor Dirk Kempthorne. 
He was then selected by then-President Bill Clinton to serve in the short-lived federal position, U.S. nuclear waste negotiator — a position only held by Stallings and a fellow Idahoan, former Republican state attorney general and lieutenant governor, David Leroy. 
 Stallings represented Idaho for seven years in U.S. House. 

In 1984, Stallings defeated seven-term Republican U.S. Rep. George Hansen by just 133 votes, the Washington Post reported at the time; Hansen had been convicted that year of violating House ethics rules. 
Larry LaRocco met Stallings on the campaign trail just prior to that, in 1982 as both Idaho Democrats were making their first bids for Congress. 
“He was a true public servant, with a deep sense of historical perspective because of his teaching,” LaRocco told the Idaho Capital Sun in an interview. 
Larry LaRocco
Stallings taught history at Ricks College — now called Brigham Young University–Idaho — from 1969 until he was elected in 1984.
LaRocco joined Stallings in Congress in 1990 and said the Pocatello representative distinguished himself as an expert in agricultural policy. 
“Whether it was dry-land farming on the Palouse, or irrigated farming in southern Idaho, and all the subsidy programs, he actually represented the whole state very well on ag issues,” LaRocco said. “And the people in his district just loved him because of his knowledge of that.” 
Stallings was a moderate Democrat, who was fiscally conservative, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and opposed abortion, LaRocco said. Both men supported labor rights and environmental conservation.
Stallings was also very knowledgeable about water rights issues, which were a particular concern to his eastern Idaho district, LaRocco said. 
LaRocco said the East Idaho congressman had a way of speaking both plainly and eloquently, and catching people off guard with an unexpected sense of humor. 
“He was sort of mild-mannered, and then he’d pop with something that was self-deprecating and really humorous,” LaRocco said.

 Bill Clinton selects Stallings selected as nuclear waste negotiator in 1993 

Following Stallings’ unsuccessful bid for the U.S. Senate, he was selected by Clinton to head an independent federal agency tasked with finding long-term storage of radioactive waste in the U.S. 
The position was created in 1990, when then-President George H. W. Bush nominated Leroy to lead it.
The less-populated Western states were likely placements for the radioactive waste, Leroy said, which is why Idaho officials made sense for the post. As its first nominee, Leroy negotiated with Bush to have the office headquartered in Boise, he said. 
When the Clinton administration took over, Leroy left the post and Stallings was recommended by then-former secretary of the interior and Idaho Gov. Cecil D. Andrus. 
“Mr. Stallings and I worked on a very important project that still needs conclusion,” Leroy said. “We were both faithful to our obligation to work with Congress and with local governments, tribal leaders, with state politicians, and both made some substantial progress until the office was canceled.” 
The office was eliminated in 1995. 
Leroy described Stallings as a “warm, friendly man” who was “very serious, committed to his family, and gave a very full day of hard work to his constituents” during his time in Congress. 
“Their problems were his problems, and he was faithful on a daily basis to doing anything and everything he could to address the needs for the Second District of Idaho,” he said. 
 Stallings led Idaho Democratic Party, served on Pocatello City Council, conducted statewide town halls 

Stallings served on Pocatello City Council in the early 2000s, according to the Idaho State Journal, and chaired the Idaho Democratic Party from 2005 to 2007.

“Richard reminded us that politics at its best is about people, not power,” current Idaho Democratic Party Chair Lauren Necochea said in an emailed statement. “It is about understanding our neighbors’ struggles and standing up for them. His legacy endures in the leaders he inspired, the communities he strengthened, and the countless Idahoans who saw in him what public service should look like: humble, principled, and tireless in pursuit of the common good. Our hearts are with his family and all who loved him.”
Stallings remained involved in politics, and last winter, called LaRocco to ask if he wanted to tour the state hosting in-person town halls to ask questions to Idaho’s current Congressional delegation. The former congressmen were frustrated that Idaho’s U.S. representatives were not hosting their own in-person town halls.   
The events ran late February to May, with 11 in total.  
“It was really great just to be on the trail with him again,” LaRocco said. 
Stallings was in his 80s, and LaRocco said he’d noticed Stallings’ age catching up with him up until the moment he took up the microphone at each event. 
“His political muscle memory just returned, and he just was forceful, he was humorous, he was on top of policy,” LaRocco said. 
The men wrote an open letter to the Congressional delegation, published in the Sun, about the concerns they heard during the events. 
“He was busy to the very end,” LaRocco said, “being a public servant and being out there and sharing his thoughts and policies.”

Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said the state typically has less than 10% of soybeans left to harvest and less than 25% of corn acres still in the fields by the last week of October. 
“The dry conditions have allowed farmers to push that pace, with farmers in some parts of the state wrapping up harvest and transitioning to other field work,” Naig said in a news release. 
State Climatologist Justin Glisan reported Iowa had “unseasonably dry” conditions with a statewide average of just 0.01 inch, while the normal is 0.63 inch. Osage reported the most precipitation, at 0.44 inch, during the reporting period. 
According to the latest map from the U.S. Drought Monitor, dry conditions have continued to spread across portions of the state, with 64% of the state in abnormally dry or moderate drought conditions. 
Glisan said that while Iowa has had unseasonably warm temperatures the past six reporting periods, conditions were “near normal” across most of the state. The average statewide temperature was 50 degrees Fahrenheit for the period, which is on par with the climatological normal. 
Agronomists with Iowa Soybean Association reported that many farmers are finished with harvest, or nearing the end. According to the latest “walking rows” report from the association, yields have been variable this year due to disease pressure in corn crops and dry harvest conditions that had some impact on soybean weight. 
Farmers urged to plant fall cover crops
As harvest winds down and farmers look to other field work, Naig and Gov. Kim Reynolds urged farmers to plant fall cover crops and participate in the state’s Crop Insurance Discount Program. 
Through the program, farmers can apply for a $5 per acre discount on their crop insurance premiums for the acres they seeded with fall cover crops. 
A news release from IDALS said the program is part of the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy, which aims to reduce the number of nutrients that end up in Iowa waterways and eventually down to the Gulf of Mexico. 
Cover crops have been a focus of the nutrient reduction strategy and in 2023, farmers planted nearly 4 million acres of cover crops.
“We’ve seen strong interest in our cover crop cost-share programs this summer and fall, and we anticipate just as much enthusiasm for our Crop Insurance Discount Program when the online sign-up opens in December,” Naig said in the release. “This innovative program has been effective in advancing the Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy by boosting cover crop adoption while helping farmers reduce their crop insurance costs.” 
Sign up for the program runs from Dec. 1 through Jan. 23. IDALS said farmers can sign up to receive notifications and reminders about the program online. Applications can be submitted at CleanWaterIowa.org or with crop insurance agents. 
This is the ninth year IDALS has offered the cover crop insurance incentive and to date, nearly 2,000 Iowa farmers have enrolled more than 1.4 million acres of cover crops, according to IDALS. 
“This voluntary and innovative program not only encourages cover crop adoption but also offers farmers a discount on their crop insurance premiums,” Reynolds said in the release. “Our farmers understand the connection between soil health and crop production, and know what’s best for the fields they plant.”

He is set to die for the 2002 stabbing death of Ronnie Wipf, 19, during a robbery at an Oklahoma City motel. 
A knife penetrated his heart and lung, according to the medical examiner’s report. Wipf was a migrant farm worker from rural Montana.
The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board on Nov. 5 will consider clemency.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond opposes clemency.
“Wood’s actions on death row in recent years, including distributing drugs and having another inmate viciously beaten, prove that death is the only way to ensure the safety of Oklahomans,” Drummond said.
According to the state’s clemency packet, which included copies of prison disciplinary records, Wood has trafficked in drugs and contraband and solicited violence against other inmates while incarcerated. 
In his clemency packet, Wood says it was his older brother, Zjaiton ‘Jake’ Wood, who killed Wipf. 
Zjaiton Wood received life without the possibility of parole for his role. 
He died in prison in 2019, according to the Oklahoma Department of Corrections.
Tremane Wood also alleges in the packet that his court-appointed attorney was ineffective because he was impaired by an addiction to alcohol, cocaine and prescription drugs and did no work other than showing up for court. The attorney died in 2018, according to news reports.
Tremane Wood, a victim of child sexual abuse, is regretful and remorseful for his role, according to the clemency packet.

DemasA split Michigan Court of Appeals on Monday said the Republican-led House of Representatives had a clear duty to present nine Michigan House bills passed during last year’s lame duck session for Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s signature – even though the House failed to present those bills under different leadership before the term expired.
The 2-1 published opinion was written by Court of Appeals Judge Thomas Cameron and was joined by Judge Daniel Korobkin. Judge Christopher Murray dissented. A published opinion is binding on the lower courts and instructive to the Michigan Supreme Court, should the case be appealed.
It is unclear if the House plans to do so.
Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids), who led the chamber as the plaintiff in Michigan Senate v. Michigan House, said she was pleased with the decision and was happy to see the bills they worked hard to pass last year move closer to the finish line.
“At a time when Republican leaders across the country are breaking the law and getting away with it, this is a particularly meaningful win. No matter how deep our political differences, the Constitution must be followed,” Brinks said in a statement. “Skirting the law is bad enough, but it’s so much worse that they did it in the name of stopping bills that would have helped thousands of their constituents make ends meet.”
A message seeking comment from House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) was not returned at the time of publication.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The bills in question – House Bills 4177, 4665, 4666, 4667 [which passed in the lower chamber in 2023] and House Bills 4900, 4901, 5817, 5818 and 6058 [which were passed by the House in 2024] –  were passed by the Senate during a marathon lame duck session of the upper chamber at the tail end of 2024.
The House, then under Democratic control, was in a state of disarray when state Rep. Karen Whitsett (D-Detroit) joined a mutiny of sorts staged by Hall, who led a GOP walk out and locked up the lower chamber from passing any of the Senate’s bills in the final days of lame duck.
Undeterred, the Democratic-controlled Senate under Brinks pushed on and passed as many of House bills as it could before the clock ran out on the 2024 term. That included the nine bills at the center of the current presentment battle.
When the Senate voted on the bills, it sent them back to the House to enroll them for presentation to the governor. The House under former Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit) and the House clerk did not complete that task before the end of the term and have never offered an explanation as to why.
Michigan House adjourns after again failing to get a quorum, stranding legislative priorities

That caused a legal controversy over whether the new House, under Hall’s leadership, had an inherent duty to present the bills – which passed both chambers – to Whitmer. Hall’s legal team said it did not have that duty, to which the Senate bristled.
Brinks eventually filed a lawsuit with the Court of Claims, but Judge Sima Patel ultimately ruled for both parties in a confusing decision. Patel’s ruling also landed on the separation of powers doctrine, noting the lower court did not have the authority to tell the legislative branch how to function.
Both sides claimed victory even though the ruling did not grant mandamus relief – or a specific order from the court compelling an elected official to fulfill their duties – and the bills were no closer to Whitmer’s desk and pen.
The House appealed to the Court of Appeals for greater clarity, to which the Senate filed a cross-appeal asking if the lower court had erred when it failed to grant mandamus relief.
In the opinion issued by the Court of Appeals on Monday, Cameron wrote that the House failed to show that the Senate lacked standing to bring the case. He also disagreed with the House in its assertion that the Senate’s legal challenge was unclear enough and unable to seek relief from the court.
Cameron further ruled that the Court of Claims did not commit a legal error when it ruled that the Article IV, Section 33 of the Michigan Constitution enshrines a duty for the Legislature to present all passed bills to the governor.
“The phrasing of this hypothetical indicates an understanding that, after a bill is adopted by both chambers, it becomes the ‘duty’ of the relevant member of the chamber in which the bill originated to present it to the governor,” Cameron wrote. “This understanding supports the interpretation advanced by plaintiffs and adopted by the Court of Claims.”
Cameron added that the mandatory duty was not-session dependent.
“The Legislature, as a whole, bears the duty of presentment. Additionally, the fact that the Constitution does not provide a deadline for presentment is not dispositive,” Cameron wrote. “The discourse at the 1961 Constitutional Convention suggests that presentment is the next, immediate step after a bill is passed by both chambers.”
Michigan Supreme Court orders lower court to decide stalled-bill deadlock

To that end, Cameron ruled that the Court of Claims did commit a legal error when it failed to compel the House to present the bills, deferring to the separation of powers instead.
“While not phrased explicitly, we recognize that defendants raise separation-of-powers concerns with respect to the judiciary compelling legislative action in this case,” Cameron wrote. “As discussed earlier, [the Constitution] contains no language limiting the judiciary’s authority to interpret and enforce its mandates. Absent any such limitations, interpretation and enforcement of this constitutional provision, even in the context of governmental action, falls squarely within the scope of judicial authority.”
Murray said he concurred with the lead opinion in so far as the Legislature’s clear duty to present the bills to the governor. That said, Murray dissented by writing that although the Constitution provides a time period during which the Legislature must present enrolled bills to the governor, that time frame has passed, so there was no constitutional requirement for the bills to be presented now – nor was there any legal remedy that could be granted to the Senate.
The bills in dispute included crucial protections for workers and laborers, including health care affordability measures, pension security and debt collection reforms.
“Today’s ruling from the Court of Appeals is a declaration that the rule of law and state Constitution still matter in Michigan,” Ron Bieber, president of Michigan AFL-CIO, said in a statement. “Three judges, including two Republican appointees, took Speaker Hall to task, ruling that the stalled, pro-worker bills must be presented to the governor. Each day of delay causes real harm to working Michiganders. It’s time for Speaker Hall to stop wasting taxpayer dollars, end his war on workers and present these bills to Governor Whitmer for her signature.”

This story, by Report for America corps member Carly Berlin, was produced through a partnership between VTDigger and Vermont Public.
BURLINGTON — As the number of people living outdoors in the Queen City swells and temperatures begin to drop, a new shelter will soon open its doors.
The Committee on Temporary Shelter, better known as COTS, is slated to open an expanded shelter downtown in early November. The organization ran a smaller seasonal shelter at the same location last winter, but has since renovated the space to add more beds and more privacy for guests. 
Yet the couple dozen additional beds are still a drop in the bucket compared to the overwhelming need.
“There are still as many as 300 folks living rough on our streets today, and with winter fast approaching, we feel the urgency of expanding our city’s shelter capacity more than ever,” said Burlington Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak at a ribbon cutting event on Monday.
COTS has dramatically transformed the interior of the old Social Security Administration building at 58 Pearl St. Days after acquiring the deed in January, the nonprofit lined up beds inside the former office space to accommodate guests; after the shelter closed in April, construction began in earnest. Now, the shelter features dorm-style sleeping areas, individual bathrooms, a fully-equipped kitchen with cafeteria-style seating, consultation rooms for meetings with caseworkers, laundry and secure storage.

It will also be able to accommodate nearly twice as many guests, with space for up to 56 people 18 years old and up. The shelter will also have six additional spots available for walk-ins on nights when winter weather is particularly harsh, according to Jonathan Farrell, COTS’ executive director.
It will be open only during evening hours; COTS has a daytime center for people experiencing homelessness a few blocks away on North Avenue. People seeking access to the shelter will need to register ahead of time; drop-ins will not typically be welcome. 
The shelter will not be considered “low-barrier,” Farrell said. Guests will be expected to work toward a housing plan with caseworkers, and substances will not be allowed onsite, though “we also work with folks if they happen to slip,” he said.
Meanwhile, the Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity is preparing to expand its low-barrier shelter on Shelburne Rroad for the winter season, accommodating 30 additional beds.
Yet even as more capacity comes online, Vermont’s largest city still faces a gap between the number of people living outdoors and available shelter space heading into the colder months – especially as stricter rules for accessing the state’s motel voucher program remain in place this winter.
To help bridge the need, the city plans to open additional shelter space during periods of extreme cold, according to Jen Monroe Zakaras, deputy chief of staff for Mayor Mulvaney-Stanak.
COTS’ renovation of the Pearl Street building cost about $1.8 million, according to Farrell. Funding came in part from the state’s Department for Children and Families and a crowdfunding campaign.
The organization plans to move the 36 guests at its current adult shelter on Church Street, where demand has outstripped capacity, to the new location in the coming weeks. It will ramp up to full capacity in early December, Farrell said. COTS then plans to convert the Church Street building into subsidized housing.

Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) toured Aurelius, a nonprofit organization operating a brain health and human performance clinic at Harrisburg University in Harrisburg, PA on Oct. 27, 2025. (John Cole/Capital-Star)As the federal government shutdown reached its 27th day, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) re-upped his calls for the passage of a continuing resolution (CR) and pointed at Democrats for the ongoing stalemate.
“What was proposed was a clean, continuing resolution,” McCormick said Monday to reporters at an event in Harrisburg.
McCormick, along with all of his GOP colleagues in the Senate and a few Democrats, including Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), have voted 12 times for the GOP-backed spending proposal to keep the government open. That proposal has received a majority vote, but not the 60 required to advance it. Republicans make up 53 Senate seats, so they would need Democratic support for the measure to pass.
Republicans hold a majority in the Senate and U.S. House.
The shutdown, McCormick said, is “really starting to hurt Pennsylvanians,” and noted the number  of federal workers that live in the state, as well as the 2 million that rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.
Upcoming federal food assistance pause intensifies shutdown fight

“I’m really concerned because SNAP benefits are mostly for folks that are living paycheck to paycheck and really need that support,” McCormick said.
He said he talked with Fetterman late last week about the need to help SNAP recipients. 
On Monday, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the largest union representing federal workers, called on Congress to immediately pass a clean CR and reopen the government.
A few weeks prior, AFGE union leaders joined Democratic elected officials in Philadelphia calling on Republicans to negotiate a deal to end the government shutdown.
Most Democrats have remained adamant that an extension of subsidies under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which are set to expire at the end of the year, is needed in a spending plan to reopen the government.
McCormick said the proposal that has passed the Senate a dozen times keeps the government funded and adds time to negotiate “whatever extensions should or shouldn’t be” for the ACA, also known as Obamacare.
He noted that he, President Donald Trump, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) are  open to having a conversation about extending those subsidies, but added that it couldn’t happen until the government re-opens.
However, McCormick didn’t say whether he supported extending the premium tax credits from the ACA or not.
“What we’re talking about are the additional subsidies that were put in place during COVID,” McCormick said. “But I am worried about the healthcare costs for people that are living paycheck to paycheck. So, I’m gonna have to see what the options are.”

Fetterman and McCormick support CR, but differ on filibuster
While Fetterman and McCormick have been side-by-side in their support of the GOP-backed CR to fund the government, they are not aligned on if the filibuster should be used to reopen the government.
Fetterman, who advocated for elimination of the filibuster during his 2022 bid for U.S. Senate, told reporters last week that he would support Republicans bypassing the 60 votes needed and approve the plan with a simple majority.
McCormick, however, told reporters that he does not back a proposal for Republicans to abandon the filibuster to pass a spending plan to fund the government.
“And the reason I wouldn’t is because I wouldn’t support that in the case of the Democrats being a majority or the Republicans being in the majority,” McCormick said. “I think once you set the precedent, then you don’t have to check on needing to build some level of bipartisan consensus.”
“I think you’re going to say that you have to live with the consistency on both sides of it,” he added. “In other words, you say whatever your view is on the filibuster, it should be your view regardless of whether you’re in the majority or not.”
McCormick also claimed that “if the roles were reversed” and there was a Democrat in the White House with majorities in both chambers, he would still vote to keep the government open.

McCormick sees path to new trade agreement with Canada, while Trump adds new tariffs
On Saturday, Trump announced that he was increasing tariffs on Canada by an additional 10%. The move was announced following an ad by the province of Ontario that used words from former President Ronald Reagan sharply criticizing tariffs.
McCormick told the Capital-Star on Monday that he has not seen the ad, but added that he supports a trade agenda that is “trying to create fairness for the American worker and reciprocity.”
“And that’s what the president is trying to do,” McCormick said.
He referenced Trump’s trip to Asia and the framework of multiple trade deals with Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia as proof that he has faith in the president over the matter.
“I think there’s a path here to a trade agreement with Canada that’s going to be much more fair to the American worker, but it’s probably going to take a couple iterations, and I’m not going to tell the president how to negotiate,” he added. “I think he’s making some pretty good progress across these deals.”
Some have expressed concern that Trump’s tariff policies have created uncertainty in the market.
McCormick added that he believes that the trade deals that have been made under Trump are a “net good” for Pennsylvania, although he said they aren’t perfect for everybody.
“The sooner we can get these deals done, the better,” McCormick said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/0-14-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-10-27 18:01:31.780589

(Photo by Nelson Chenault via Peacock Group)The University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences received a $4 million federal grant to support obstetric care for pregnant people in two rural South Arkansas counties.
Helping Expand Access to Rural maternal health care Transformation for Moms (HEART Moms) will bring “comprehensive, team-based care closer to home” in Ashley and Union counties, Dr. Nirvana Manning, the grant recipient and chair of the UAMS College of Medicine Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, said in a Monday news release.
The goal of the program is to create “a sustainable, regionally coordinated maternal health network with robust governance, a referral infrastructure and Medicaid-aligned payment strategies,” the news release states.
Another goal of the program is to reduce maternal mortality, measured by the rate at which women die during childbirth or within a year of giving birth. Arkansas has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the nation and the third-highest infant mortality rate, according to the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement.
HEART Moms will utilize “a combination of mobile health, digital health and workforce development strategies that we hope can be replicated in other rural areas across Arkansas,” Manning said.
According to the news release, the initiative will start in 2026 and include:

Employing widespread screenings for conditions that increase health risks during pregnancy, such as hypertension and diabetes, and ensuring in-person or virtual follow-up care
Establishing group prenatal care services in the two counties “to enhance prenatal education, peer support and health outcomes”
Training community health workers and mental health specialists on culturally responsive patient outreach, assessments of non-medical determinants of health and assisting patients in choosing and understanding insurance benefits
Improving online access to mental health treatment and local obstetric emergency preparedness

The grant comes from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). The agency awards HEART Moms funding to areas with “urgent gaps in access to obstetric care and perinatal behavioral health” caused by a shortage of health care providers, hospitals closing their labor and delivery units or closing entirely, and long travel distances between providers, among other things, according to the news release.
The Ashley County Medical Center in Crossett is among six Arkansas hospitals that have closed their labor and delivery units since 2020. The hospitals in Bradley and Columbia counties have also ended obstetric services since then. Both counties border Union County, where the South Arkansas Regional Hospital in El Dorado has a labor and delivery unit.
The hospital in Ouachita County, which also borders Union County, is considering scaling back its labor and delivery services in exchange for increased federal funding that will help its doors remain open.
Thirty-one other hospitals in 20 more of Arkansas’ 75 counties have labor and delivery units.
Arkansas postpartum outreach program to expand by end of year

In February, the Arkansas Legislature directed $2.5 million in state funds to the Crossett and El Dorado hospitals so UAMS can train physicians in 22 residency slots, including an obstetrics fellowship. The HEART Moms program will install a second obstetrics fellow in the region.
The program will also employ mobile maternal health clinics that rotate between Ashley and Union counties to reduce patients’ transportation-related barriers to care. A federally-funded mobile maternal health clinic program serves 11 Southwest Arkansas counties, including Columbia and Ouachita, but the program does not stretch all the way across South Arkansas, and its future after 2026 is uncertain.
Earlier this year, UAMS launched the Arkansas Center for Women and Infants’ Health with Manning as director. The center works with providers to increase pregnant and postpartum Arkansans’ access to care, especially in rural and underserved communities.

For the first time, one of the state’s most diverse school districts has eliminated racial disparities in suspension rates.

Burlington School District leaders announced last week that they have reached a major milestone in efforts to reduce racial bias. Data from the last school year indicates that students of color — about 42% of the population — represented only 33% of suspensions across the pre-K-12 school district.
This is a drop from the 2021-2022 school year when students of color – 38% of the population – represented 50% of suspensions in the school district.
The total number of suspensions across the roughly 3,200-student district has also decreased from 248 two years ago to 207 the last school year, according to the release.
The Vermont Agency of Education defines educational equity as the degree of achievement, fairness and opportunity in education as measured by a standard of success. 
While many school districts have adopted equity statements and actions — often not without a fight — many school districts, including Burlington, have struggled to address racial disparities in student outcomes in Vermont, one of the whitest states in the nation. And cases of persistent racism, harassment and resulting settlements continue to be reported at many school districts.
But addressing disparities in student suspensions disproportionately affecting students of color has been a focus in Burlington for decades, according to district leaders. They point to the connection research has shown between suspensions and difficulties succeeding in and outside of school. 
“When students of the global majority succeed, all students succeed,” said Henri Sparks, the school district’s equity director, referring to students who are Black, Asian, brown, indigenous or of multiple races.
The term “people of the global majority” was coined in 2003 by Rosemary Campbell-Stephens, a British-Jamaican academic. Many racial justice advocates and educators consider it to be a more accurate and inclusive descriptor than terms like “BIPOC,” “ethnic minorities” or “marginalized people.”
Of the 207 suspensions recorded in the 2024-2025 school year, 68 involved students of color, compared to 248 suspensions in 2023-2024 of which 121 involved students of color, according to data shared by the district.
Overall, suspensions have decreased by 17% and, as a result, attendance records have improved. Data shows that 305 student school days were lost to suspensions in 2024-2025 compared to 426 days in 2023-2024. The length of suspensions are also decreasing, with the average days lost per suspension down to 1.47 from 1.72.
Burlington’s restorative code of conduct, revised in 2023, made limiting suspensions to extreme circumstances one of its five major goals. This led to the elimination of automatic suspensions for behaviors like fighting, smoking and vaping, and led staff to foster strong bonds with students and better understand cultural divides. “Because historically, the school suspended a lot of students of the global majority for reasons that they probably should not have been suspended for,” Sparks said.
Burlington’s achievement is noteworthy at a time when diversity, equity and inclusion programs are under attack by the federal government and when districts across Vermont are struggling to continue inclusion efforts.
Sparks said he hopes Burlington will stay above the politics in Washington, D.C., that looks to eradicate equity services and programs. “As we look at all the federal cuts, we still have to figure out … how do we do this work better in spite of all the changes?”

A committed community
Superintendent Flanagan said he came to Burlington because it seemed to be a community that was committed to doing the work to improve student outcomes.
“My core responsibility is to create equity in our system. And the inequities in our system are around discipline and achievement, and those show up as disparities in our data every year,” he said.
The majority of Burlington students, families and staff want to do this anti-racism work, Flanagan said, and that’s what has helped the school district accomplish this win.
Burlington district leaders credit the improvements to multiple ongoing efforts. The district started a summer racial justice academy in 2021 that builds youth leadership and empowers them to make suggestions to the board; created yearlong anti-racist professional learning communities for staff; and offered a series of virtual equity workshops with students panelists exploring issues such as dismantling white supremacy and preventing hazing, harassment and bullying in school.
“What we’re really looking at is really helping our teachers to become more informed of the social emotional needs of our students and how students of the global majority learn differently, participate differently,” said Sparks, who serves on the district leadership team. “First and foremost, they want to succeed, and it’s our responsibility to ensure that they are successful. And if there are barriers, those barriers should not be put in place because of us, the adults in our schools.”
Adults fostering relationships with students and implementing restorative practices and peer mediation have greatly helped lessen or prevent conflicts in school, said Sabrina Westdijk, principal of Burlington High School.
For example, she said, when a group text message chain among students caused harm to someone over a weekend, the anger and resentment could fester and lead to significant conflict in school by Monday morning. Alternatively, students could talk to a trusted staff member and discuss what upset them to diffuse the situation. “And we can actually bring students together and handle it proactively to resolve what turns out was actually really a misunderstanding that escalated,” she said.
That’s very different from how fights, smoking or drug incidents were handled previously — with punitive measures that did nothing to curb underlying issues such as addiction or conflict at home, Sparks said.
When he first started work in the Burlington School District as a student support specialist in the early ’90s, the largest group of immigrants were Vietnamese, and they navigated school with immense difficulty — from being teased and called names to being told they smell and to go back where they came from.
“In my opinion, Vietnamese students and their families were not supported in our schools at all,” he said. 
Sparks said he had honest conversations with school leaders when he joined the district.
“I created the job as I went, based on what I was seeing from students. It was an uphill battle all the way, back then. The high school had three Black people, period,” he said.
Since starting that job, he has helped steer the district’s equity efforts from the creation of an equity council to the implementation of restorative practices and has guided professional development in the form of equity conversations for staff.
But, all in all, Sparks said, it’s been a team effort, with buy-in from the superintendent, the school board to teachers and staff.
“The bigger challenge is making sure we stay on top of it,” Sparks said. “We are doing things to really keep that number where it is, and that means, continuing to push, continuing to help students of the global majority thrive, excel and be included.”
Combating disparities elsewhere
At Winooski, Vermont’s most diverse school district, students of color are the majority: 57% identify as Black, indigenous, and people of color, and 36% receive multilingual services. There, students led the effort to present equity solutions to the board through the Antiracism Steering Committee formed in 2020, to serve as an oversight and implementation body, according to Superintendent Wilmer Chavarria. 
Disparities in suspensions have not been an issue there, said recent graduate Mea Ree Jan, a facilitator of the committee that meets every week. The group’s recommendations, which Winooski School District has followed, include increasing staff diversity, creating ethnic studies and restorative justice solutions, she said.
What stands out in the pre-K-12 Winooski school district — a much smaller district than Burlington’s with about 800 students — is that students have really strong relationships with teachers and staff and with one another.
“They feel like they can go to a teacher if something does happen,” Jan said. “There’s this sense of comfortability that you don’t really see happening in larger school districts.”
Winooski’s approach has been more about creating the system, structures, policies and practices to ensure that it is an anti-racist school district, said Lindsey Halman, executive director of Up with Learning, an education consultancy that works with several school districts to help achieve equity and justice.
South Burlington School District — a larger pre-K-12 school district of about 2,700 students, of which about 30% are students of color — has an equity policy adopted by the school board, similar to Burlington’s, that includes anti-racist professional development for teachers and staff with 25 educators facilitating the work, according to Monica Desrochers, director of diversity, equity, inclusion, anti-racism and social emotional learning.
The district aims for all students to pass assessments, have perfect attendance and no suspensions, but one of the challenges they face in South Burlington is around increasing staff diversity and representation, she said.
South Burlington Interim Superintendent Joe Clark commended Burlington for its success in reducing racial disparities in suspensions.
“We track data regarding racial disparities in discipline and have a robust professional development program to work to eliminate the disparities,” he said. “That is great news out of Burlington. We are not there yet but are continuing this important work.”
While racial disparities persist in South Burlington’s suspension data, “our biggest gaps are between the students who are living with disabilities and students who are living below the poverty line,” Desrochers said.
While efforts to achieve equity continue in the South Burlington School District, Desrochers’ benchmark for success would be for every student, including students of color, to feel “comfortable to be their most authentic self in any space in the building.”
“I want 100% of our students to pass all of their assessments, not be suspended, have perfect attendance,” added Clark. “Short of that, it would be that we should not see gaps in any of those subgroups: racial, impoverished folks, students with disabilities. So until that happens, we’re not going to rest.”

The contract, valued at $97,770, calls for Mauldin & Jenkins LLC to examine how the district authorizes spending, tracks purchases, and follows state and federal rules. A report is due by December 31, with a public presentation scheduled for February 15.
State officials ordered the review in September after the district disclosed a roughly $46 million deficit, prompting questions from families and school employees about how the problem went undiscovered for so long. Earlier audits pointed to spending approvals without sufficient budget checks and the use of temporary federal pandemic funds to support permanent staff positions.
Rep. Donny Lambeth (R-Forsyth) said he supported the board’s decision, calling it “a well thought-out and necessary move.” He added that it was disappointing the local board and administration had not acted sooner, saying the directive had to come from a state agency.
The district’s financial turmoil has led to hundreds of job cuts this year, with assistant principals, support staff and employees in the Exceptional Children’s program among those affected.
A state audit report released in August found the district used temporary COVID-19 relief funds to pay permanent salaries, approved spending without money in the budget and delayed basic account reconciliations. Auditors also flagged misuse of “suspense accounts,” where at one point more than $332 million sat without clear tracking.
While auditors found no fraud, state leaders have said the report revealed years of weak oversight.
During a presentation in September on the state’s new strategic plan, North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction Mo Green also linked the district’s budget crisis to the state’s underfunding of public education. Green noted that North Carolina ranks 48th in the nation for per-pupil education spending, spending thousands less per student than neighbors like Virginia and South Carolina.
When adjusted for regional cost differences, North Carolina’s per-student spending is nearly $5,000 below the national average. The state ranks 49th in “funding effort,” a measure of how much a state spends on education relative to its economic capacity.
“While I think there was certainly mismanagement of resources in Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools,” Green said last month, “it also is the case that it’s operated in a situation where we are underfunding our public schools pretty dramatically.”
The district is preparing for a leadership transition, with Dr. Don Phipps set to begin his tenure as superintendent on December 1, succeeding Interim Superintendent Catty Moore.

“Ripple effects of the government shutdown are hitting home,” the Great Plains Food Bank said in the announcement. “Federal employees are living without paychecks and SNAP recipients may be forced to find other ways to feed their families.”
The food bank has set a goal of distributing an additional 1 million pounds of food, on top of the 1 million pounds it already sends out every month.
North Dakota SNAP funding in jeopardy with government shutdown

“We are hoping in the next roughly two months or so that we can raise that amount of food and start moving it out the door right now so that we can get that into the hands of our partner pantries,” spokesperson Darby Njos said.
She said while it’s too early to assess the full scope of the impact, the organization is already noticing an increase in demand.
“We’re just in the beginning stages of federal workers missing their first paycheck, and not knowing what’s happening to SNAP,” Njos said.
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits will be paused Saturday if the federal government is still shut down after Friday.
While the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services has said it has the funds to continue the program, officials last week said the state is unable to load the money onto people’s electronic payment cards.
Some other states, including Louisiana, have announced plans to set aside state money to keep SNAP benefits available to their residents during the shutdown.
More than 57,000 North Dakotans received roughly $9.9 million in SNAP benefits in September. 
Upcoming federal food assistance pause intensifies shutdown fight

Njos said the Great Plains Food Bank encourages monetary contributions, but also accepts food donations.
“We are in a special spot as a food bank, we are able to stretch those dollars farther,” she said. “Every dollar that we are able to take in, we’re able to provide two meals to our neighbors in need.”
The Great Plains Food Bank accepts monetary donations online. Those who wish to give food can also learn more on the nonprofit’s website. The most requested items are fruits, vegetables, protein and dairy, Njos said.
The Great Plains Food Bank also encourages North Dakotans to give food directly to their local food pantries, she added.
